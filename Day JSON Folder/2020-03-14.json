      "body": "<p>A top civil servant and a senior member of the royal household have both been criticised in an official report examining attempts by a victim of child sex abuse to have his abuser stripped of an honour.</p> <p>The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse recently found that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/30/sex-offender-retains-queen-honour-reform\" title=\"\">Hubert Chesshyre </a>\u2013 an acclaimed heraldry expert and a member of the Queen\u2019s household \u2013 had been shown \u201cpreferential or exceptional treatment ... because of their status and contacts, regardless of the known involvement of child victims\u201d. Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith enjoyed similar leniency.</p> <p>Chesshyre was made Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 2014, the year before he was charged and tried on a charge of sexual offences against a child.</p> <p>He was by then suffering from dementia and found unfit to plead, but at a trial of the facts a jury agreed unanimously that he had committed two specimen counts of indecent assault against a child. A third charge was ordered to lie on file.

Documents handed to the inquiry by Sir Jonathan Stephens, a senior civil servant who chairs the honours forfeiture committee, reveal that Reid received help in drafting his response from Thomas Woodcock, who is the Garter Principal King of Arms, the senior officer of the College of Arms, of which Chesshyre was a member for 40 years.</p> <p>Reid asked Woodcock for some \u201csuitable wording\u201d to use in his response to the victim.

      "bodyText": "A top civil servant and a senior member of the royal household have both been criticised in an official report examining attempts by a victim of child sex abuse to have his abuser stripped of an honour. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse recently found that Hubert Chesshyre \u2013 an acclaimed heraldry expert and a member of the Queen\u2019s household \u2013 had been shown \u201cpreferential or exceptional treatment ... because of their status and contacts, regardless of the known involvement of child victims\u201d. Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith enjoyed similar leniency. Chesshyre was made Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 2014, the year before he was charged and tried on a charge of sexual offences against a child. He was by then suffering from dementia and found unfit to plead, but at a trial of the facts a jury agreed unanimously that he had committed two specimen counts of indecent assault against a child. A third charge was ordered to lie on file. Because Chesshyre had been found unfit to plead, no conviction ensued and he was granted an absolute discharge. In October 2015, the victim, who provided a detailed witness statement to the inquiry about how Chesshyre groomed and abused him between the ages of 12 and 16, approached the honours and appointments secretariat at the Cabinet Office to ask how his honour could be rescinded. He was told to contact Sir Alan Reid, keeper of the privy purse, as a CVO is the personal gift of the sovereign. But Reid, who has now retired, said that because Chesshyre was given an absolute discharge, \u201cit would be wrong to submit a recommendation to the Queen\u201d.

Below is a running list of events that have been cancelled: The Formula 1 Melbourne Grand Prix was cancelled on Friday morning. The One Day International series between Australia and New Zealand has been cancelled after one match, after New Zealand announced Australia would be included in a list of countries with a mandatory 14-day self-isolation period.

      "body": "<p>When did it become real for you? Perhaps it was when the first grisly footage started emerging from Wuhan, of deserted and dystopian streets, of a human catastrophe beyond understanding. Perhaps it was when an entire airline went bust, when plans and schemes were thrown into disarray. Perhaps it was when the Italian government decided in effect to put an entire nation of 60 million people under house arrest or when every school in Ireland shut down.</p> <p>Or perhaps it was when they called off Fulham v Brentford on Friday night. If so, there\u2019s no need to feel ashamed or abashed about it: for so many of us, sport isn\u2019t simply a way of passing the time but a way of marking it.

      "bodyText": "A 22-year-old African American woman has filed a civil rights lawsuit in New York, claiming she was shackled to a hospital gurney during labor, after being arrested on a minor assault charge that was later dismissed. The lawsuit filed on behalf of \u201cJane Doe\u201d against the City of New York and several New York police department (NYPD) officers who arrested the woman in December 2018, when she was more than 40 weeks pregnant, claims the woman was also handcuffed and shackled after she gave birth to her son. The woman claims she was asleep in her mother\u2019s home when officers knocked on the door to arrest her on a minor charge. She was then two days past her due date. After the woman was held in cells for almost an entire day and allegedly subjected to an invasive examination, the complaint says, officers finally handcuffed her to an ambulance gurney and took her to Kings county hospital in Brooklyn. The suit claims officers kept the woman in physical restraints for the next 36 hours, \u201coften with one arm and one leg\u201d shackled to a hospital bed. The woman, the suit claims, struggled to feed her newborn son while one arm was cuffed to the bed. After the baby was transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit, the complaint says, officers would not let the woman visit him without first shackling her legs together. \u201cThe NYPD made me feel less than human,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI was sad and depressed for months after giving birth to my son. I just want these officers to be held accountable so something like this never happens to anyone else.\u201d Andrew Jondahl, a lawyer at Emery Celli Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady, said in a statement: \u201cThe NYPD not only acted unconstitutionally, they acted without common sense, since our client posed no risk of harm to herself or anyone else. \u201cIt is shocking that years after the medical and correctional communities have taken a united stand against the inhumane practice of shackling pregnant women, NYPD officers continue to unnecessarily put pregnant people like our client and their newborn children in harm\u2019s way.\u201d According to the lawsuit, medical experts and correctional experts unanimously agree that pregnant women should not be shackled except in the most extraordinary circumstances. Anthony Posada of the Legal Aid Society told the Guardian NYPD patrol guide policies limit the circumstances when restraints should be applied to pregnant women prior to arraignment. \u201cThe NYPD revised patrol guide says this kind of scenario should not play out the way that it did, and [police] have done nothing to stall or minimize this kind of inhuman practice,\u201d Posada said. \u201cThis was not a situation where our client was a threat to herself or others that would warrant this kind of treatment.\u201d At the police precinct, Posada said, the woman was subjected to \u201cnothing less than a sexual assault\u201d by a female officer who directed her to remove her underwear so she could determine if she was indeed going to labour. \u201cWhen you are in custody you don\u2019t feel you have any rights or a level of empowerment to stop something from happening,\u201d Posada said. \u201cNobody should have to endure this kind of treatment in that kind of vulnerable state.\u201d Neither the NYPD nor the City of New York immediately responded to the suit. The claim follows similar complaints. In 2018 the NYPD was sued for an incident in which officers shackled a pregnant women in the Bronx, during labor and after she gave birth. \u201cShackling pregnant people is a dehumanizing and pointless practice that has no place in New York City,\u201d said Corey Stoughton, head of the Legal Aid Society\u2019s Special Litigation Unit. The new complaint will almost certainly renew claims that the NYPD subjects minorities to unduly harsh treatment. Staughton said she was \u201cappalled the NYPD continues to fail people giving birth at one of the most important and vulnerable moments in our lives\u201d. She also said she was \u201coutraged at how this practice consistently singles out black and brown women for treatment no one deserves, especially when black and brown families already face startling high maternal mortality rates\u201d. On Friday, lawyers for the woman delivered a letter of complaint to New York City Health and Hospitals and Kings county hospital, claiming medical staff failed to intervene to protect her health and safety as well as that of her newborn son. The letter said staff \u201cwere improperly trained on how to treat pregnant people who are in law enforcement custody in city hospitals, particularly before, during and after labor\u201d. It also called on the hospital to reform its practices so that \u201cthis practice cannot continue and must not happen to another patient again\u201d.",

However, he predicts that if there is a postponement it will be for a year rather than a couple of months. \u201cIt is unfair to ask athletes to try to peak in July and then tell them to stand down and wait until October,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember that most of them are not stars but amateurs who are carving out time from their other careers. The other thing to bear in mind is that the US network NBC won\u2019t want the Olympics to be held at the same time as the start of the NFL or NBA seasons. So while I still expect the Games to go ahead, I think any delay would be for 12 months.\u201d Another source warns that rescheduling an Olympics will not necessarily be straightforward. \u201cThe Games are effectively block-booked seven years in advance. In London we started to book the hotel rooms very soon after winning the bid. It is quite difficult to postpone the Games. \u201cThe other thing is not to forget about the Paralympics. You have some more vulnerable people competing and it is, in theory, the fourth-biggest world sporting event.\u201d On Saturday, it was left to Japan\u2019s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, to repeat the official line \u2013 that the event, which has cost at least $12bn in preparations and attracted more than $3bn in domestic sponsorships, would not be delayed. Sources in the IOC insist that as long as there is a chance of holding the Games, they should try to stage them for the sake of the athletes. It probably will not be until late May that a decision is made. Some of Tokyo\u2019s residents, though, are increasingly more concerned about the virus\u2019s spread than the Games. \u201cIf you think about the safety of athletes, I don\u2019t think we should have the Olympics,\u201d Yoshio Yoshimoto, a 70-year-old contract worker, said. \u201cWho would take responsibility if you force it and the coronavirus outbreak turns worse?\u201d",

The last recession <a href=\"https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/the-recession-has-officially-ended/\" title=\"\">officially lasted</a> 18 months \u2013 from December 2007 to June 2009, the longest since the second world war. Gus Faucher, chief economist at the US bank PNC, thinks this one is more likely to last \u201ccloser to six months than a year\u201d. If the outbreak proved brief, the US could bounce back fast, he said.</p> <p>However, while this time it may be different, there are worrying factors that could trigger a longer-lasting recession, and the downturn is likely to expose fault lines that the good times kept hidden.</p> <p>Central bankers rode to the rescue after the last crisis, cutting rates close to zero and pumping money into the economy via stimulus packages. The Fed is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/mark-carney-tells-g7-bank-of-england-will-give-necessary-coronavirus-support\" title=\"\">cutting rates</a> again \u2013 even before any recession has been declared \u2013 but now it has little wriggle room. The interest rate is now 1%-1.25% after it made an emergency cut earlier this month, and another reduction is expected.</p> <p>Corporate debt is another concern. Zandi describes it as a \u201cbarbell\u201d: at one end there are highly profitable companies with mountains of cash that have taken advantage of low interest rates to raise even more money. At the other end are a lot of highly risky companies that have been financially engineered to exist on loans that are hovering close to \u201cjunk\u201d status.</p> <p>For now Zandi thinks it doesn\u2019t present the sorts of issues the US experienced in 2008. But the political impasse in Washington and the Trump administration\u2019s \u2013 until recently lackadaisical \u2013 response to the pandemic could worsen the situation. Also, the coming recession \u2013 if it happens \u2013 is likely to expose the fact that many of the jobs added since the last downturn have been low-wage, and that so much of the economic gain has gone to the top 1% that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/09/ray-dalio-billionaire-hedge-fund-capitalism\" title=\"\">even they</a> are worrying about economic inequality.</p> <p>For many Americans, while \u201cthe best of times\u201d may be over, a recession may finally expose something they felt all along. \u201cWe have just had the best stock market we have ever seen,\u201d said Scott Nyerges, a writer and editor in Austin, Texas. \u201cAnd still my friends are worried about whether or not we will ever be able to retire.\u201d</p>",

The last financial crisis also led to mass layoffs in construction, banking and property, and spread through the entire economy. This crisis comes as employers are still fighting to hire workers, the banking sector seems secure and the housing market is far from overinflated. As a result, this recession may not spread as wide or end up being as deep. The last recession officially lasted 18 months \u2013 from December 2007 to June 2009, the longest since the second world war. Gus Faucher, chief economist at the US bank PNC, thinks this one is more likely to last \u201ccloser to six months than a year\u201d. If the outbreak proved brief, the US could bounce back fast, he said. However, while this time it may be different, there are worrying factors that could trigger a longer-lasting recession, and the downturn is likely to expose fault lines that the good times kept hidden. Central bankers rode to the rescue after the last crisis, cutting rates close to zero and pumping money into the economy via stimulus packages. The Fed is cutting rates again \u2013 even before any recession has been declared \u2013 but now it has little wriggle room. The interest rate is now 1%-1.25% after it made an emergency cut earlier this month, and another reduction is expected. Corporate debt is another concern. Zandi describes it as a \u201cbarbell\u201d: at one end there are highly profitable companies with mountains of cash that have taken advantage of low interest rates to raise even more money. At the other end are a lot of highly risky companies that have been financially engineered to exist on loans that are hovering close to \u201cjunk\u201d status. For now Zandi thinks it doesn\u2019t present the sorts of issues the US experienced in 2008. But the political impasse in Washington and the Trump administration\u2019s \u2013 until recently lackadaisical \u2013 response to the pandemic could worsen the situation. Also, the coming recession \u2013 if it happens \u2013 is likely to expose the fact that many of the jobs added since the last downturn have been low-wage, and that so much of the economic gain has gone to the top 1% that even they are worrying about economic inequality. For many Americans, while \u201cthe best of times\u201d may be over, a recession may finally expose something they felt all along. \u201cWe have just had the best stock market we have ever seen,\u201d said Scott Nyerges, a writer and editor in Austin, Texas. \u201cAnd still my friends are worried about whether or not we will ever be able to retire.\u201d",

In an article published today on the Guardian website, the academics and lawyers say Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to \u201cgo it alone\u201d, free of EU regulation, after Brexit means the UK will probably have to join other non-EU countries in a queue to acquire the vaccine after EU member states have had it, and on less-favourable terms. The authors include Martin McKee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and legal academics Anniek de Ruijter of Amsterdam Law School and Mark Flear of Queens University, Belfast. The UK will leave the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the body responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines, at the end of the transition period on 30 December. This means it will no longer be part of the EU\u2019s regulatory regime, which allows for \u201caccelerated assessment\u201d of products developed by drugs companies during a pandemic. The UK has already withdrawn from the EU\u2019s emergency bulk-buying mechanism for vaccines and medicines, under which member states strike collective agreements with pharmaceutical companies, which speeds up their access to the latest products during a crisis. The academics write: \u201cFor all these reasons ... the UK is likely to have to join the queue for access with other countries outside the EU, and to pay more than it would otherwise as an EU member state. \u201cLooking further ahead, this problem will not be limited to emergencies and the UK can expect slower and more limited access to medicines, especially those for rare conditions or those used to treat children, where the market is small.\u201d They argue that the UK could still avoid the worst by agreeing to align fully with the EMA\u2019s regulations from outside the EU. But they say Johnson has so far indicated that his team have no intention of doing so and do not want to operate as \u201crule takers\u201d. While it appears the UK government wants to press ahead with its own regulatory system and rapid market authorisation system for emergencies, the experts say this will be all but impossible to put in place in time for a new Covid-19 vaccine, which is expected in about a year. Even then the view in medical circles is that pharmaceutical companies are likely to look first to the EU for regulatory approval and an agreement on sale, given the scale of the market they would be selling into. Olivier Wouters of the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: \u201cAfter the Brexit transition period, the UK will no longer be part of the EMA and will therefore have to make its own regulatory decisions, unless ongoing EU-UK trade negotiations result in the UK aligning itself with European rules. \u201cThe UK could, in theory, choose to recognise any approval decision made by the EMA to prevent delays, but this seems at odds with the UK government\u2019s pledge to \u2018take back control\u2019. If the UK authorities instead choose to set up a separate review and approval process for medicines and vaccines, then it might delay access to a new coronavirus therapy. \u201cThe country could experience disruptions as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the country\u2019s counterpart to the EMA, works to fill the gap left by the departure of the EMA. \u201cVaccine makers and drug companies may decide to first seek approval from the EMA, which represents some 500 million patients, before seeking approval from the UK MHRA, which covers a smaller patient pool.\u201d Asked about the prospect of the UK having to pay higher prices for a vaccine, he said: \u201cIf a coronavirus vaccine is developed, EU countries may choose to band together to jointly procure the vaccine.

We abused those chocolate sticks back in those days.\u201d</p> <p>Not all of the cakes are that simple, though. \u201cThere are half a dozen or so cakes in that book where I would advise people to stick the pages together so that the child does not see them, because they\u2019re hard work.\u201d</p> <p>A \u201cfluffy frosting\u201d (Italian meringue) covered castle with four pointed turrets ranks among the most challenging; while the train that sits on the book\u2019s cover can be tough when ambitious parents decide to add extra carriages. But a tip truck with <a href=\"https://goat.com.au/abc/the-author-of-the-womens-weekly-birthday-cake-cookbook-has-only-one-piece-of-advice-for-us-dont-even-bother-with-the-dump-truck/\">lollies spilling out of its back pallet</a> is the hardest ask.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had lots of phone calls about the tip truck and mothers who\u2019ve said \u2018I can\u2019t do it but my husband\u2019s an engineer, and you know what, he\u2019s doing an amazing job on the tip truck.\u2019\u201d She says figuring out how the support structures work is the most complicated part. \u201cWe just used skewers, but I don\u2019t know what an engineer would use.\u201d</p> <p>So, will we ever see another book like it? \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do the novelty cakes in the same way that we did back then,\u201d says Clark. \u201cForty years is a long time! I think there are higher expectations than there were back then.\u201d</p> <p>In the kitchen now, recipe writers and food stylists, even those interested in novelty cakes, don\u2019t \u201cwant their cakes to look daggy.

It came about because Clark didn\u2019t want \u201canything with fondant and piping and all that stuff\u201d. She thought to herself, \u201c\u2018what can I do that anyone can do\u2019 ... Not that clever really, but I can\u2019t tell you how many of those cakes I\u2019ve made over the years.\u201d A spiky echidna ice-cream cake was inspired by a children\u2019s colouring book. \u201cI remember thinking \u2018I could do that just by using chocolate sticks\u2019, remembering the pool was also using the chocolate sticks. We abused those chocolate sticks back in those days.\u201d Not all of the cakes are that simple, though. \u201cThere are half a dozen or so cakes in that book where I would advise people to stick the pages together so that the child does not see them, because they\u2019re hard work.\u201d A \u201cfluffy frosting\u201d (Italian meringue) covered castle with four pointed turrets ranks among the most challenging; while the train that sits on the book\u2019s cover can be tough when ambitious parents decide to add extra carriages. But a tip truck with lollies spilling out of its back pallet is the hardest ask. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of phone calls about the tip truck and mothers who\u2019ve said \u2018I can\u2019t do it but my husband\u2019s an engineer, and you know what, he\u2019s doing an amazing job on the tip truck.\u2019\u201d She says figuring out how the support structures work is the most complicated part. \u201cWe just used skewers, but I don\u2019t know what an engineer would use.\u201d So, will we ever see another book like it? \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do the novelty cakes in the same way that we did back then,\u201d says Clark. \u201cForty years is a long time! I think there are higher expectations than there were back then.\u201d In the kitchen now, recipe writers and food stylists, even those interested in novelty cakes, don\u2019t \u201cwant their cakes to look daggy. And I got that. You can\u2019t replicate things all the time. The ideas back then were pretty ordinary \u2026 But nothing touches the Children\u2019s Birthday Cake Book.\u201d \u2022 Take the Cake, along with all other Melbourne Food and Wine festival programming has been postponed due to the COVID 19 pandemic. At this stage, a new date for the event has not been announced by organisers. On 16 March 2020, this article was amended to reflect changes to the Melbourne Food and Wine festival\u2019s program dates.",

Logging operations have continued in the Styx River state forest on the north coast that is now remnant habitat for endangered species including the greater glider and the Hastings River mouse. Both the federal and state governments have identified the mouse, which had 82% of its habitat burnt, as one of the species most at risk of extinction as a result of the bushfire disaster. Trucks have also moved into an area of the Lower Bucca state forest north-west of Coffs Harbour in bushland that is part of the proposed Great Koala national park. Twenty-four per cent of koala habitat in eastern NSW was burnt in the fire crisis and the environment minister, Sussan Ley, has said up to 30% of the koala population on the mid north coast may have been killed. Environment groups and the independent state MLC Justin Field have expressed dismay that NSW Forestry Corporation has been able to continue with harvest plans in unburnt forest that is now important remnant habitat for wildlife. The Nature Conservation Council of NSW asked the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to investigate the logging. But the council\u2019s chief executive said it was told that operations could not be halted when Forestry Corporation was not in breach of its approvals.

If we can\u2019t manage this I very much doubt that liberal democracy will survive what is coming at us down the line. \u2022 Anatol Lieven is the author of Climate Change and the Nation State: The Realist Case",

Paul remembers a particular moment in a bookshop. \u201cThere was a book on the history of opera, a very expensive book. And I said, \u2018I wonder should I buy this book when you already have it?\u2019\u201d And she said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to need to buy another one darling\u2019 [and] I felt that she really loved me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lisa felt the same way about him. \u201cI\u2019m interested in lots of different things and [I remember thinking], \u2018I just don\u2019t want to be in a boring relationship.\u2019 I wanted someone who had the same values, had integrity and loyalty, who when they said they were going to do something, they would. And Paul is very, very much like that.\u201d</p> <p>Their November 1984 wedding was a simple affair in a registry office on the corner of their street. Lisa made her own wedding dress on one of those Elna sewing machines. It was a great selling point. \u201c[Customers] would go, \u2018Oh, what are you making?\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018My wedding dress.\u2019 So it was a good way to flog the product,\u201d she says with a laugh. </p> <p>After about five years in London, they returned home. \u201cIf we were going to have kids, we always wanted to come back to have them in Australia.\u201d Still they wanted to put down their roots first, so they bought their first home and waited until they both had jobs before Lisa could take maternity leave.</p> <p>Despite their plans, when their two children Phoebe and Nicholas were born, they had to change again. \u201cPaul couldn\u2019t wait to have kids. For him, that was quite a stabilising thing as much as kids drive you crazy but it did mean that Paul ended up sacrificing. [He] was an at-home dad, which enabled me to go back to work and keep supporting the family,\u201d says Lisa. \u201cThat was a bit shattering for Paul because it meant he couldn\u2019t sing and work in the opera companies perhaps as much as he wanted to.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/23/how-we-stay-together-we-debate-absolutely-everything-but-we-fight-fair\">How we stay together: we debate absolutely everything \u2013 but we fight fair</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Becoming a stay at home dad and teaching singing part-time wasn\u2019t an easy shift, Paul agrees: \u201cThose seven or eight years, until they were old enough to go to school were very difficult years.

Here she answers some questions about child protection arising from the murders in Brisbane of Hannah Clarke and her three children, Aaliyah, 6, Laianah, 4 and Trey, 3.</p> <h2><strong>How does domestic abuse impact children?</strong></h2> <p> It\u2019s common knowledge that one woman a week is killed by a current or former partner in Australia, but not so common that <a href=\"https://lens.monash.edu/@medicine-health/2019/06/12/1375311/when-parents-kill-the-reality-of-filicide-in-australia\">a child is murdered by a parent every fortnight</a>. While not all of these are a result of domestic abuse situations, most are, and it\u2019s shocking. Why isn\u2019t the child homicide stat commonly known? Because even in these enlightened times, we still can\u2019t see children as individuals. In the public mind, children are subsidiaries of their parents.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/08/patriarchy-and-power-how-gender-inequality-underpins-abusive-behaviour\">Patriarchy and power: how socialisation underpins abusive behaviour | Jess Hill</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite the voluminous research on children\u2019s development, we still can\u2019t seem to conceive that kids experiencing domestic abuse have unique wants and needs that not only differ from their parents but from their siblings, too. One child may be acutely aware of the abuse, and may take on the role of family protector. Their sibling may refuse to acknowledge it at all, even when physical violence occurs right in front of them. Another sibling may identify strongly with the abusive parent and start imitating their behaviours. This is a particularly tragic scenario that we see play out so often: the victim parent leaves the abusive parent, only to have their child replace the perpetrator as the violent oppressor in the family. Truly one of the saddest places I\u2019ve ever visited was a room in the children\u2019s court at Parramatta where parents were applying for intervention orders against their own children.</p> <h2><strong>What about kids that grow up with coercive control?</strong></h2> <p>The critical thing for people (and particularly our justice system) to understand is that children don\u2019t just witness incidents of domestic abuse. Their development is shaped by the abusive dynamic. That\u2019s why exposure to domestic abuse is increasingly being recognised as child abuse. Critically, there doesn\u2019t need to be any physical violence present for kids to be deeply affected. We now understand, thanks to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/car.2422\">recent research</a> from Dr Emma Katz in the UK, that children are harmed by coercive control in similar ways to their victim parent: they may be isolated from extended family, forced to obey trivial demands, degraded and threatened.</p> <p>Just as it is for their victim parent, it can be the little things that are the most frightening: one teenage girl told me that one of the worst things her father did was make this particular creepy smile. These are the kinds of things that haunt children, the signals that remind them that danger is ever-present and the threat is something they must continually manage. Their perspective, like that of their victim parent, is being virtually colonised by the perpetrator parent. They have to develop ways to resist that, to hold on to their own sense of self, and to develop independence and competence. Coercive control is as much a trap for children as it is for their victim parent.</p> <h2><strong>What are some of the long-term psychological impacts for children?</strong></h2> <p>The answer to this question, like all of these, could fill a book! But to tackle just one aspect of this, let\u2019s talk about complex trauma. Children who grow up with prolonged abuse may develop what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.blueknot.org.au/Resources/Information/Understanding-abuse-and-trauma/What-is-complex-trauma\">complex trauma</a>\u201d, or C-PTSD. As Dr Bessel can der Kolk describes it, kids with complex trauma \u201cdevelop a view of the world that incorporates their betrayal and hurt. They anticipate and expect the trauma to recur and respond with hyperactivity, aggression, defeat or freeze responses to minor stresses.\u201d This conditioning can start in infancy. Babies are not oblivious to abuse; they are acutely aware of their surroundings \u2013 particularly the emotional state of their primary caregiver.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think people fully understand how dangerous the family law system can be for children</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Children (and later, adults) with complex trauma can harbour deep distrust for others, or may find that their \u201ctrust\u201d is commonly betrayed, which can lead to major problems with intimacy and friendship. Other common symptoms of complex trauma include suicidal thoughts, feelings of detachment from one\u2019s own body and mind, shame and guilt, the feeling of being like an alien, helplessness and hopelessness, self-harm and substance abuse. The thing is, their view of the world is not disordered \u2013 it is a product of the incredible strategies they developed (like dissociation, for example) to physically and psychologically survive their childhood. These strategies may have worked for them in the abusive environment, but they are maladaptive to life outside of that environment. The problem is, many in the psychiatric world don\u2019t acknowledge complex trauma, and thus misdiagnose children and adults with bipolar disorder, ADD, borderline personality disorder or oppositional defiant disorder.</p> <h2>Why is family law reform such a priority when it comes to protecting children?</h2> <p>I don\u2019t think people fully understand how dangerous the family law system can be for children.</p> <p>In previous centuries, judges could order an abused woman to return to her husband. The idea that a court would make such an order seems unthinkable now \u2013 but that is exactly what the family law system still does to children. Even when kids openly disclose abuse \u2013 and have their testimony corroborated by police, social workers, teachers and doctors \u2013 a family law judge may still order them to see or live part-time with their abusive parent. Worse still, they may even be ordered into the full-time custody of a parent they have openly pleaded to be protected from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6966615924ad0759eef93543d8203fa22e2ce374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6966615924ad0759eef93543d8203fa22e2ce374/0_0_4788_3293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photos of Hannah Clarke and her three children on display at their funeral in Brisbane\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photos of Hannah Clarke and her three children on display at their funeral in Brisbane on 9 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once a family law order is made, it is virtually impossible for children to resist. If they run away, their custodial parent can apply for a recovery order, and the court can then order federal police to track them down and return them to their custodial parent. One teenager I interviewed, \u201cCarly\u201d, was pursued by federal police when she ran away from her father, who was controlling and intimidating towards her and had been violent to her mother and brother. She had to threaten suicide before the police would relent, on the proviso she was taken to hospital. After she was released she stayed for four months in a refuge, where despite asking for schoolwork, she received no schooling. Eventually, she was allowed to return to her mother \u2013 but only because the court decided she was old enough to make her own decision.</p> <p>Another teenager, \u201cAlex\u201d, also became suicidal after years of routine physical abuse from his father, whose sole custody he was ordered into when he was a toddler, after the mother\u2019s allegations against the father were disbelieved by the court. Alex ran away to his mother, with whom he was allowed only limited contact. When the family court requested he see another family report writer (to assess his claims and his mental state for the court), that writer concluded he didn\u2019t really want to die and that his threats were \u201cstress related\u201d. They recommended he be returned to his father, that contact be cut off with the mother, and that if he ran away again to his mother, she should be incarcerated. After he was ordered by the court to return to his father, Alex had to run away to police three times before he was taken seriously. Alex fought hard to be returned to his mother when he was 14. Now as a young adult he\u2019s been diagnosed with PTSD; he can\u2019t work, he can\u2019t study. He\u2019s now on the disability support pension.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They plead with their protective parent not to hand them over. They hide under the bed at handover time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The threat to children is not just anecdotal. The Australian Law Reform Commission review found that <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/safety-must-come-first-in-family-law-legal-groups-reject-merger-plan-20191110-p5395q.html\">one in five parents reported safety concerns</a> for their children and/or themselves as a result of court-ordered contact with the other parent.</p> <p>When family law orders are made, children are ordered to comply \u2013 even when they are openly terrified. So they kick and scream at handovers. They plead with their protective parent not to hand them over. They hide under the bed at handover time. They call police. They self-harm. They may even be prevented by the court from accessing medical care and counselling. This is how weird \u2013 and destructive \u2013 parts of the family law system has become.</p> <p>Protective parents spend several years \u2013 and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2013 trying to protect them. Sometimes it\u2019s to no avail \u2013 they watch helplessly as their children develop medical conditions and regress into traumatised states, with no power to intervene. When an abused parent leaves, they do so to protect themselves and their children. But in the end, because the family law system is so dangerously inconsistent, they can\u2019t guarantee that they will be able to protect their children. That\u2019s why so many abused parents stay long past the time they would like to have left.</p> <h2><strong>Why are children being ordered into the care of abusive parents?</strong></h2> <p>So much of this comes back to the pro-contact ideology of the court. The Family Law Act states that when the court is considering how to allocate parenting, they must apply the presumption that the best interests of the child are served by both parents having equal-shared parental responsibility. That might be the case for regular families, but in the family law system, the vast majority of families are <em>not </em>regular. Up to 85% of families going through the family law system report histories of family violence, including emotional abuse, and half report physical violence. Despite this, only 3% of cases result in no contact with one parent, and around 79% end up with orders to share parental responsibility. But how can you share parental responsibility with an abusive parent?</p> <p>This presumption of equal-shared parental responsibility is, in theory, not supposed to apply where the child\u2019s safety is at risk. But in reality, we see allegations (and even proven histories) of domestic/child abuse being minimised, dismissed and disbelieved. They are seen as inconvenient, a barrier to making orders for shared parenting.</p> <p>I have to add here that within the family law system, there <em>are </em>judges that prioritise child safety, and family report writers who provided nuanced assessments of families. If you\u2019re leaving domestic abuse and entering the family law court, you may be lucky enough to get a judge and a report writer who believe you, and act to protect your children. But for too many families, that is not the case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62aa827e4ac14fd23bc104127346a32dba9271ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62aa827e4ac14fd23bc104127346a32dba9271ba/0_34_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian author Jess Hill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jess Hill, the author of See What You Made Me Do.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yaya Stempler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The standard operating procedure in so many of these cases can beggar belief. It is truly bizarre, for example, to see judges reject evidence from counsellors and doctors that corroborates the disclosure of a child or the testimony of their parents. Parents who apply for a no-contact order \u2013 even when they can prove a history of domestic abuse \u2013 are routinely warned by their own lawyers that unless they allow some contact, they may lose custody altogether. As Zita Adut Deng Ngor, CEO of Women\u2019s Legal Services South Australia, says: \u201cIt is always a delicate balancing act in terms of how far you push the issue of domestic and family violence. It can actually harm your client, if you push too hard with the wrong judicial officer.\u201d<em> </em>What does that say about how the system responds to the parenting risks associated with domestic abuse?</p> <h2><strong>What would be the most effective result of the family law inquiry to ensure the safety of children?</strong></h2> <p>Honestly, I don\u2019t know what it would take to reform the family law system. Policy changes alone won\u2019t fix it \u2013 this is a cultural problem that is throughout the family law system. Even if the government follows the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendation to revoke the presumption of shared parental responsibility, that in itself won\u2019t change the minds of experts and judges who routinely minimise the impact of domestic abuse and disbelieve victims and their children. The Gillard government made significant changes to the Family Law Act in an attempt to reprioritise children\u2019s safety, but we keep seeing the same old stories repeating. Child makes disclosure, child is disbelieved, protective parent fights to limit the abusive parent\u2019s access, and they either end up losing custody altogether or being coerced to agree to shared parenting arrangements that are unsafe for them and their children.</p> <p>Ultimately, it may be that the recommendation from the law reform commission \u2013 to abolish the federal family law courts and replace it with specialist state-based family courts, which would be better connected with state-based child protection agencies \u2013 is the only way to truly change the culture of family law in this country.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit <a href=\"https://www.1800respect.org.au/\">1800RESPECT.org.au</a>.

Madsen, a well-known Danish inventor, was sentenced to life in jail for the murder and sexual assault of journalist Kim Wall, after he invited her onto his homemade submarine under the pretence of an interview in August 2017. Australian director Emma Sullivan had been filming Madsen and his volunteer crew for months for an unrelated documentary, about the inventor\u2019s attempt to build a homemade rocket, when the murder took place. The resulting film Into the Deep contains extensive interviews with Madsen up until the day of the murder, as well as the people who worked with him. According to a Variety review, the movie offers \u201ca rare opportunity to study a murderer before his first kill \u2026 both a portrait of evil and a story of the workers left ashore floundering to understand how they devoted their lives to a fiend\u201d. Into the Deep premiered at the Sundance film festival in January, and had been scheduled for release by the international streaming giant later this year. However, two of the people filmed and the film\u2019s cinematographer have withdrawn support for the film saying it would harm and be \u201ca complete poison\u201d to its subjects. And on Wednesday, a source close to Netflix told the Guardian that they no longer had plans to release Into the Deep \u2013 but would not confirm whether it would eventually be released in an edited form. One woman in the documentary, Anja Olsen, has said she never signed a release form to allow her footage to be used, and told the director and producers repeatedly she was suffering severe mental health effects due to the film\u2019s impending wide release. In portions of the film, as aired at Sundance, Madsen is shown threatening Olsen physically and writing that he would kill other volunteers in his workshop. \u201cI appear against my will as a participant in the documentary\u201d, Olsen said on social media and in Danish media. \u201cI repeatedly and unequivocally told the director Emma Sullivan that I did not want to participate, that it would endanger my health due to trauma I suffer following the murder case\u201d. The second person filmed, who is objecting to the documentary, has chosen to remain anonymous. A cinematographer on the film, Cam Matheson, told Guardian Australia he had also withdrawn his support for the film.

      "bodyText": "After the share market fell 7.4% on Monday, 3.5% on Wednesday, and more than 5% on Thursday you could be excused for thinking everything is buggered. Do we need perspective? The market is around 23% below the peak of the past 12 months, which is much less a fall than in the October 1987 crash, and also the global financial crisis. In both cases the stock market lost about half of its value. So that\u2019s the good news. The bad news is, oh boy, it can fall a lot more yet. Yes, the long-term performance of the stock market is good \u2013 a 6.2% annual return over 35 years. But these hits take time to recover from. It took around eight years to return to the pre-1987 crash peaks, and 11 years after the GFC. That does not mean all our super is gone. This year will be carnage, but over the past 10 years the median annual rate of return for industry super funds has been 8% (for retail funds it is 6.3%). The problem of course is what if those were the good times? Perspective is great only if normality returns. A 2006 Treasury department paper on \u201cThe macroeconomic effect of an influenza pandemic\u201d, coincidentally co-authored by the current Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, concludes that \u201cGDP could contract by over 5% over the first year following an outbreak of a highly contagious pandemic\u201d. But such a study did not consider that the world\u2019s biggest economy is run by a megalomaniac with an aversion to reality. Consider that Trump gave a national TV address in which he stated at least three errors, all of which sent the US markets into their biggest fall for 33 years. The lack of any international co-ordination is damning \u2013 no urgent meeting of the G20, not even a phone hook-up. Trump has made the world more insular, at the very moment it needs to be the opposite. And what about our government\u2019s response? It has been less than stellar. The lack of a public information campaign is damning. Where are the health advice ads playing on TV? They haven\u2019t been able to even get a cheap YouTube ad up to share on social media. Should you get tested? How do you get tested? When should you stay home? We should all know the advice by rote. The economic stimulus, I think, also contains far too little on the health side. During the GFC we needed to get people spending; now we first need to ensure it is safe for people to go out to spend. An absolute priority must be to ensure people who are sick stay home. I would have considered providing casual workers with at least access to a 14-day government-paid sick leave equal to the minimum wage for coronavirus symptoms. In such cases you need to go big to break through the noise. Nothing in the government\u2019s announcement had you thinking \u201ccripes, they aren\u2019t holding back\u201d. Mostly the reaction was instead was that more is needed. The level of resources being put towards urgent and rapid testing should be jaw-dropping. Instead, we had Morrison being grossly casual telling Alan Jones he is going to the footy and that \u201cit\u2019s important for our economy and just our general wellbeing ... that people sort of get on about their lives\u201d. At the same time the head of the AMA in Western Australia tweeted: \u201cYou want to go to the footy? I want my colleagues to stay alive. Cancel crowds at events. Close the schools soon.\u201d Later chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised that Coag recommended gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled (though not actually banned). Oddly that advice only comes into effect from Monday. I guess the virus gets the weekend off ... Morrison\u2019s TV address contained little health advice except \u201cplease visit health.gov.au or talk to your local GP\u201d (because yes, GPs have so much time on their hands). He did not even address panic buying. The $750 cash payment for government benefit cardholders also seems rather weak. In 2008 the Rudd government\u2019s first cash stimulus was $1,000 to $1,400 for pensioners and low-income households. It was followed up with $900 to households earning up to $80,000. In 2008, $1,000 was worth 77% of average male weekly full-time earnings; $750 is just 40% of the current average of $1,840. Crucially, the GFC payments did not have to account for people overspending while stocking up on supplies. You would be smart to bet that the May budget will contain more than has been announced this week.

According to the World Health Organization, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations. How does the WHO decide whether to call it a pandemic? Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in a foreign country and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the \u201cindex case\u201d, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community. Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that. An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community. When is a pandemic declared? Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met.

      "body": "<p>Phyllis Rose is an American author and former academic whose books include <em>Woman of Letters: A Life of Virginia Woolf</em> and <em>The Year of Reading Proust</em>. She is best known for <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/parallel-lives-9781911547525.html\" title=\"\"><em>Parallel Lives</em></a>, her acclaimed study of Victorian marriage as seen through the relationships of five literary couples including Effie Gray and John Ruskin, and Catherine Hogarth and Charles Dickens. The book is being reissued in a new edition with an introduction by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/25/sheila-heti-motherhood-interview\" title=\"\">Sheila Heti</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Parallel Lives</em> first came out in </strong><strong>1983</strong><strong>. What\u2019s your relationship with it now?</strong><br>I\u2019m astonished by it. I\u2019m very proud of the girl who wrote it. It\u2019s miraculous that this girl knew so much, and was able to write so wittily.</p> <p><strong>Does that girl strike you as having been unnervingly wise?</strong><br>\u201cUnnerving\u201d is a good word for it. I can\u2019t tell you where that wisdom came from, except that the magic of biographical writing is that you get out of yourself: you\u2019re up in the clouds, looking down on people. You get a distance that isn\u2019t available to you in terms of looking at your own life.</p> <p><strong>How did the idea for the book come to you?</strong><br>I had two models. The first was Lytton Strachey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/16/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-50-eminent-victorians-lytton-strachey-manning-nightingale-arnold-gordon\" title=\"\"><em>Eminent Victorians</em></a>. The second was Diane Johnson\u2019s book <a href=\"http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/00/04/16/specials/johnson-lesser.html\" title=\"\"><em>Lesser Lives</em></a>, which was a biography of the first Mrs George Meredith, Mary Ellen Peacock. That was very important for me: the idea that there was someone there in the room [with a great writer], whose life was as important to her as his was to him. I\u2019d written my PhD on Dickens, but it was never published. But I knew a lot about Victorian writers. The material sat in my mind, and then the early feminist movement gave me the point, which was to look at the structures which shape women\u2019s lives.</p> <p><strong>Was it immediately apparent which couples you would write about?</strong><br>Everything about the book seemed to fall into place. Jane Carlyle [best known for her letters, she married the historian Thomas Carlyle in 1826; they became a famously unhappy couple] was tremendously appealing to me, so I began with them. I wrote about their courtship and that gave me the book\u2019s structure: for each couple, I would write about a different stage of their relationship. Effie and John Ruskin, for instance, were my newlyweds, and the Dickenses I wrote about in middle age. With each essay, then, I knew where to start, and where to stop.</p> <p><strong>I think George Eliot and George Henry Lewes are the beating heart of the book\u2026</strong><br></p> <p>You might be right. Each couple reminded me of people I knew in real life. George Eliot reminded me of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/06/the-abundance-by-annie-dillard-review\" title=\"\">Annie Dillard</a> [the Pulitzer prize-winning writer], who lived round the corner from me: her moral seriousness, her slight disconnection from the world. George Eliot the writer wouldn\u2019t have existed without Lewes. He was one of those men who are proud of their wives, and are willing to put themselves at their service.<strong> </strong></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Women are used to talking about other people\u2019s behaviour. Men don\u2019t do that, and they\u2019re a little morally dull</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>People like to say: oh, the Victorians were more like us than you think. But they really were very weird, weren\u2019t they?</strong><br>Absolutely, and that was a gift for me. Our culture has made us very different. They were pre-Freudian, so they weren\u2019t self-conscious about expressing themselves. Look at Dickens. When he tired of Catherine, he just said: it\u2019s my wife\u2019s fault. No one could get away with that now. These days, Catherine would be represented by [the high-powered women\u2019s rights lawyer] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/23/gloria-steinem-meets-gloria-allred-prince-andrew\" title=\"\">Gloria Allred</a> or something.</p> <p><strong>Does it worry you that people are currently so unwilling to separate art and life, with the result that writers like Dickens are in danger of being \u201ccancelled\u201d?</strong><br>Yes. I try never to forget that men like Ruskin or Dickens, who were naughty or sick or cruel, produced things that affected people for generations. You don\u2019t want to slap the hand of a genius \u2013 at least, I don\u2019t. The worst reaction to <em>Parallel Lives </em>is when people say: I used to read Dickens with pleasure, but I won\u2019t any more, because of how he treated his wife. It is disappointing, and incredibly small-minded. These people are looking for reasons to dismiss writers. They won\u2019t see the bigger picture. It upsets me that while people still associate Ruskin with this mythology over the pubic hair [the story goes that Ruskin did not consummate his marriage to Effie Gray because he was disgusted by the sight of her pubic hair], no one ever sits down and reads <em>Modern Painters</em> or <em>Praeterita</em> [his autobiography], or even looks at his watercolours, which are astonishing.</p> <p><strong>In the prologue to <em>Parallel Lives</em>, you say that gossip is the beginning of moral inquiry. Do you stand by that?</strong><br>Yes, I think that\u2019s true. It\u2019s the reason that women in general have finer sensibilities than men. They\u2019re used to talking about other people\u2019s behaviour. Men don\u2019t do that, and they\u2019re a little morally dull.</p> <p><strong>Is biography just high-class gossip?</strong><br>I feel that it\u2019s an art form, but also that it\u2019s never definitive. When I was writing about Virginia Woolf in 1979, her nephew Quentin Bell was about to publish his own book about her. I was anxious. It seemed to me that what I had to say about her \u2013 which had to do with the fact that being a woman was central to the way she saw life \u2013 was so obvious that he would say the same thing. But though he wrote a great book, he didn\u2019t see that, and I was so happy and relieved.</p> <p><strong>You also say in your prologue that human beings invoke love at moments when they want to disguise transactions, like marriage, that involve power. Do you still see marriage like that?</strong><br>Women may be less inclined now to be hoodwinked by romantic folderol. But power still resides in marriage, and the stuff about weddings is still incredibly potent, which is why it gets Instagrammed. That\u2019s part of the cover-up.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong><br>A book about the relationship between the Jesuit priest and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin [1881-1955], and an American woman in Paris who was married to a communist.

      "body": "<p>British-Indian artist <a href=\"https://anishkapoor.com/\" title=\"\">Anish Kapoor</a>, 66, is mounting his largest-ever UK exhibition of outdoor sculpture at Houghton Hall in Norfolk from late March, including his famous Sky Mirror, a five-metre stainless steel disc that turns the world around it upside down.</p> <p><strong>What kind of things did you want to show at Houghton Hall?</strong><br>It\u2019s one of the great houses of England, with a great history, and extensive grounds. I decided the stone works that I\u2019ve made over the past 25 years, and I\u2019ve never shown in the UK before, would sit quite well there. Then it felt right to put in some mirror works, and put the Sky Mirror in the grounds. It came together as quite a precise project.</p> <p><strong>What are you investigating with the stone sculptures?</strong><br>Most stone carving, over the last centuries, has been to have a block of stone, and then carve, like Michelangelo did, from outside in. What I\u2019ve been doing, perversely, is to carve the interior. The block stays as it was quarried, and then I\u2019ve been working on the inner form.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a sense of yourself when you mount a retrospective exhibition?</strong><br>Yes, inevitably. I don\u2019t like retrospectives, really. I\u2019m looking to bring to life bodies of work that I hope make sense together. I seem to have a disjointed practice, because on the one hand I\u2019m making these very geometric, very pure objects; and on the other my work is messy and all over the place \u2013 whether it\u2019s a great pile of wax or these ritualistic paintings that I am making for an exhibition at the <a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Modern Art Oxford </a><a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/\" title=\"\">gallery</a> in September. Yet they are one practice \u2013 and they are, in a way, very similar to each other.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your overarching description of what you do?</strong><br>Oh God, I\u2019ve no idea! [Laughs] I really do feel very strongly that I have nothing to say; I have no message to give the world and nor do I want to give the world a message. What I\u2019m looking to do is to make objects that question the nature of objects \u2013 stones that are empty; heavy that\u2019s not heavy, black objects that veil themselves\u2026</p> <p><strong>The black objects</strong><strong> you are making with </strong><strong>Vantablack, the world\u2019s darkest black substance, </strong><strong>will be shown for the first time in the <a href=\"http://www.gallerieaccademia.it/en\" title=\"\">Accademia in Venice</a> next year. They are thrilling</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>I\u2019m very excited by them. The material is, in a way, mythological. Imagine being able to describe a material as the blackest in the universe \u2013 including black holes. That\u2019s kind of daft, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p><strong>How do you think it is now</strong><strong> for young artists</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Incredibly difficult. I think the art world is in severe difficulty. At one level, it\u2019s booming. But what does that mean for artists? We are not makers of luxury goods.</p> <p>I am part of that system too, so I\u2019m not speaking as an outsider. But if everything\u2019s for sale, how is it possible to find anything that\u2019s radical? It\u2019s so hard to maintain one\u2019s distance from the commodification of the object.</p> <p>And for young artists today, it\u2019s impossibly hard to find space in London, it\u2019s so goddamn expensive. When I first had a studio in east London in the early 80s it cost \u00a35 a week...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3142b8766845979a26d0b00848344f54546a379b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3142b8766845979a26d0b00848344f54546a379b/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anish Kapoor\u2019s sculpture The Orbit in the Olympic Park, east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anish Kapoor\u2019s sculpture The Orbit in the Olympic Park, east London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What advice would you give to someone starting out?</strong><br>It\u2019s taking your metier as an artist thoroughly, absolutely, totally seriously. It\u2019s not a part-time activity\u2026 it is what we do all the time. Perseverance and endurance, or something like it, that\u2019s what you need. </p> <p><strong>Do you still work every day?</strong><br>Oh yes, I have a practice. I think Mae West once said: \u201cI\u2019m so tired of being admired.\u201d I\u2019m so tired of being inspired. Inspiration is marvellous, but it\u2019s not really about that. I work a very normal day, 8.30am to 7pm, five days a week \u2013 I don\u2019t work on a weekend. And it\u2019s through the practice of working that things occur. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do. Just do it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris Johnson turned The Orbit into a visitor attraction. Oh, Jesus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You were vocally opposed to Brexit. What\u2019s your feeling now</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It continues to be a disaster. Psychically it\u2019s about where we are and how we see ourselves. This idea that Britain can do special deals and play a big nation\u2026 I think it\u2019s a fantasy. An isolationist, sad fantasy. Yet political discourse has almost ceased on the subject. I hope it will return.</p> <p><strong>Would it make you think about leaving?</strong><br>I\u2019ve had serious thoughts about leaving. And sad thoughts, because I\u2019ve been here 40 years.</p> <p><strong>Why do you feel the need to speak out?</strong><br>We\u2019re all citizens, and as citizens we have a voice. I feel it\u2019s important to engage, but I do believe that\u2019s different from agitprop. My art has its political position but it isn\u2019t speaking in a political voice. But as a citizen I do! And so, stupid or otherwise, I\u2019ll continue.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve recently managed to stop the National Rifle Association of America using an image of your Chicago sculpture </strong><em><strong>Cloud Gate</strong></em><strong> in one of their films\u2026</strong><br>Yes, I did. They put out a vile little film using public objects as images of the so-called liberal invasion of traditional American space. I thought the whole way it was done was revolting, so I decided to fight on the basis of copyright. A group of American lawyers took it on pro bono, and I agreed to pay their expenses. They say it was the first action <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-46469881\" title=\"\">to cause the NRA to retreat from a position</a>, and they\u2019ve been retreating ever since. Yay!</p> <p><strong>On the subject of public sculpture, </strong><em><strong>The Orbit</strong></em><strong>,</strong><strong> which you designed for the Olympic </strong><strong>Park</strong><strong> in </strong><strong>east London, is apparently losing a lot of money\u2026</strong><br>It was made as a public sculpture, then Boris Johnson, in his previous incarnation [as mayor of London], turned it into a \u2013 what do they call it? \u2013 a visitor attraction. Oh, Jesus!</p> <p>I could have had a war with him, but I didn\u2019t want to. But it always was a bad idea, according to me. Either you do something as a public object, or it\u2019s a commercial enterprise. To mix the two up is confusion. It doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p><strong>Generally</strong><strong>, you always seem enthusiastic and curious</strong><strong>. Is that true?</strong><br>I\u2019m an idiot, you know. Just deeply engaged in what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not interested in doing what I know how to do. I\u2019ve just had my 66th birthday and I hope I can work with the same kind of idiotic enthusiasm that I had when I was 20.<br></p> <p>\u2022<em> <a href=\"https://www.houghtonhall.com/\" title=\"\">Anish Kapoor at Houghton Hall</a> runs from 29 March to 27 September</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "British-Indian artist Anish Kapoor, 66, is mounting his largest-ever UK exhibition of outdoor sculpture at Houghton Hall in Norfolk from late March, including his famous Sky Mirror, a five-metre stainless steel disc that turns the world around it upside down. What kind of things did you want to show at Houghton Hall? It\u2019s one of the great houses of England, with a great history, and extensive grounds. I decided the stone works that I\u2019ve made over the past 25 years, and I\u2019ve never shown in the UK before, would sit quite well there. Then it felt right to put in some mirror works, and put the Sky Mirror in the grounds. It came together as quite a precise project. What are you investigating with the stone sculptures? Most stone carving, over the last centuries, has been to have a block of stone, and then carve, like Michelangelo did, from outside in. What I\u2019ve been doing, perversely, is to carve the interior. The block stays as it was quarried, and then I\u2019ve been working on the inner form. Do you have a sense of yourself when you mount a retrospective exhibition? Yes, inevitably. I don\u2019t like retrospectives, really. I\u2019m looking to bring to life bodies of work that I hope make sense together. I seem to have a disjointed practice, because on the one hand I\u2019m making these very geometric, very pure objects; and on the other my work is messy and all over the place \u2013 whether it\u2019s a great pile of wax or these ritualistic paintings that I am making for an exhibition at the Modern Art Oxford gallery in September. Yet they are one practice \u2013 and they are, in a way, very similar to each other. What\u2019s your overarching description of what you do? Oh God, I\u2019ve no idea! [Laughs] I really do feel very strongly that I have nothing to say; I have no message to give the world and nor do I want to give the world a message. What I\u2019m looking to do is to make objects that question the nature of objects \u2013 stones that are empty; heavy that\u2019s not heavy, black objects that veil themselves\u2026 The black objects you are making with Vantablack, the world\u2019s darkest black substance, will be shown for the first time in the Accademia in Venice next year. They are thrilling\u2026 I\u2019m very excited by them. The material is, in a way, mythological. Imagine being able to describe a material as the blackest in the universe \u2013 including black holes. That\u2019s kind of daft, isn\u2019t it? How do you think it is now for young artists? Incredibly difficult. I think the art world is in severe difficulty. At one level, it\u2019s booming. But what does that mean for artists? We are not makers of luxury goods. I am part of that system too, so I\u2019m not speaking as an outsider. But if everything\u2019s for sale, how is it possible to find anything that\u2019s radical? It\u2019s so hard to maintain one\u2019s distance from the commodification of the object. And for young artists today, it\u2019s impossibly hard to find space in London, it\u2019s so goddamn expensive. When I first had a studio in east London in the early 80s it cost \u00a35 a week... What advice would you give to someone starting out? It\u2019s taking your metier as an artist thoroughly, absolutely, totally seriously. It\u2019s not a part-time activity\u2026 it is what we do all the time. Perseverance and endurance, or something like it, that\u2019s what you need. Do you still work every day? Oh yes, I have a practice. I think Mae West once said: \u201cI\u2019m so tired of being admired.\u201d I\u2019m so tired of being inspired. Inspiration is marvellous, but it\u2019s not really about that. I work a very normal day, 8.30am to 7pm, five days a week \u2013 I don\u2019t work on a weekend. And it\u2019s through the practice of working that things occur. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do. Just do it. You were vocally opposed to Brexit. What\u2019s your feeling now? It continues to be a disaster. Psychically it\u2019s about where we are and how we see ourselves. This idea that Britain can do special deals and play a big nation\u2026 I think it\u2019s a fantasy. An isolationist, sad fantasy. Yet political discourse has almost ceased on the subject. I hope it will return. Would it make you think about leaving? I\u2019ve had serious thoughts about leaving. And sad thoughts, because I\u2019ve been here 40 years. Why do you feel the need to speak out? We\u2019re all citizens, and as citizens we have a voice. I feel it\u2019s important to engage, but I do believe that\u2019s different from agitprop. My art has its political position but it isn\u2019t speaking in a political voice. But as a citizen I do! And so, stupid or otherwise, I\u2019ll continue. You\u2019ve recently managed to stop the National Rifle Association of America using an image of your Chicago sculpture Cloud Gate in one of their films\u2026 Yes, I did. They put out a vile little film using public objects as images of the so-called liberal invasion of traditional American space. I thought the whole way it was done was revolting, so I decided to fight on the basis of copyright. A group of American lawyers took it on pro bono, and I agreed to pay their expenses. They say it was the first action to cause the NRA to retreat from a position, and they\u2019ve been retreating ever since. Yay! On the subject of public sculpture, The Orbit, which you designed for the Olympic Park in east London, is apparently losing a lot of money\u2026 It was made as a public sculpture, then Boris Johnson, in his previous incarnation [as mayor of London], turned it into a \u2013 what do they call it? \u2013 a visitor attraction. Oh, Jesus! I could have had a war with him, but I didn\u2019t want to. But it always was a bad idea, according to me. Either you do something as a public object, or it\u2019s a commercial enterprise. To mix the two up is confusion. It doesn\u2019t work. Generally, you always seem enthusiastic and curious. Is that true? I\u2019m an idiot, you know. Just deeply engaged in what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not interested in doing what I know how to do. I\u2019ve just had my 66th birthday and I hope I can work with the same kind of idiotic enthusiasm that I had when I was 20. \u2022 Anish Kapoor at Houghton Hall runs from 29 March to 27 September",

      "bodyText": "For the moment, at least, this is what a world without live entertainment looks like. Sport is basically cancelled, and not because it posted an offensive tweet 11 years ago when it had 39 followers and an egg for an avatar. Tours have been pulled, festivals postponed, and cinematic releases pushed back indefinitely, to a time one can only assume is \u201cpost-doomsday\u201d, when everyone finally fancies having the bejesus scared out of them again by something that is not the live news feed on their recently disinfected phones. For entertainment, I am left scrabbling for what I can get, and for a brief moment of respite from the onslaught of bad news, I have turned to the social media feeds of celebrities dealing with either having coronavirus, or trying not to get it, or trying to understand it. So far, Naomi Campbell has emerged as the Dame Vera Lynn of this present situation, entertaining the virtual troops with her \u201cI have not come to play\u201d approach to hygiene. She has posted pictures of herself in the full hazmat, covered from head to toe, goggles, face mask and all, while travelling through Los Angeles airport. \u201cSafety First NEXT LEVEL,\u201d she wrote, adding a thank you to Linda Evangelista, which makes me wonder if there\u2019s an underground network of supermodels doling out protective clothing to the rich and beautiful. I have to admit, with only mild embarrassment, that this is not the first time I have thought of Campbell during this outbreak. Until very recently, I had an international flight planned, and I had already reminded myself of her infamous approach to inflight hygiene. In a video she posted to her YouTube channel last year, she got out a pair of gloves and a packet of Dettol wipes, and gave her first-class seat an astonishingly thorough wipe down. \u201cI do not care what people think of me,\u201d she said, as she cleaned. \u201cIt\u2019s my health, and it makes me feel better.\u201d People mocked, at the time, but Campbell is having the last laugh, particularly if she is still sitting on a decent supply of antibacterial wipes. Tinie Tempah followed her lead, posting a picture of himself this week adopting the full hazmat on a train journey, though he also posted a clip of himself with his hood down, to which the one and only Naomi Campbell replied: \u201cKeep your head covered.\u201d I\u2019m starting to wonder if Campbell should be fronting a How Clean Is Your House?-style show, in which she swabs and cleanses her way through this weird new world, telling us all not to touch our faces. Release date: postponed until at least 2021. Matt Lucas will make Bake Off fluffy again After pouring out a spot of pancake batter for the departure of Sandi Toksvig, Great British Bake Off has announced that Little Britain\u2019s Matt Lucas will be her replacement as co-host, joining Noel Fielding in the tent. The current run of Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off specials will be Toksvig\u2019s last, and Lucas will step in for the 11th series, due to air in the summer. \u201cI\u2019m chuffed to bits to be joining the most delicious show on television,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd bearing in mind my love of cake, I\u2019ve already ordered some much larger trousers in anticipation.\u201d Bake Off certainly needed something to help its dough rise again. Once, its only issue was that Paul\u2019s handshake had become more of a talking point that the pastries. But the last series was a disappointment, to many fans and viewers. The contestants were all too young, and it was sorely lacking in a couple of seen-it-all-before grannies who could show the Instagram bakers how to do it. The judges were too cutting, the tasks too tough and competitive, the challenges a world away from its \u201cwhip us up a nice Victoria sponge while we make a smutty joke about cream\u201d origins. Bake Off was supposed to be nice, and watching people cry over split custard was never what it was there for. Still, plenty of people who thought the show would not survive its transition from BBC to Channel 4, from Mary Berry to Prue Leith, from Mel and Sue to Toksvig and Fielding. But, as unlikely a pairing as it first sounded, they made it work. And it will work again, particularly if they step back from being quite so hard on the participants. After all, the show is bigger than its parts, bigger, even, than the new trousers Lucas is having made. Craig Mazin, making an adaptation worth the wait Any announcement that a much-loved videogame will be turned into a TV show or a film is usually about as promising as finding out that a successful British sitcom is being remade for a US audience. Yes, The Office, but for every show that worked, there are a thousand Skins and Inbetweeners, ideas that ended up so neutered you were desperate for any character to be allowed to say a single, even minor, rude word. That could be about to change, though, with news that the best game of all time is being adapted for the small screen. The Last Of Us is about a journey across post-apocalyptic America, after the world has been ravaged by an infectious mutant fungus \u2013 timely! \u2013 and it is being made for HBO, which suggests it will have the money it needs to make its post-social-distancing landscapes look spectacular. More impressively, it will be helmed by Craig Mazin, whose surname is also a review of the job he did when he wrote Chernobyl. Mazin will work with the game\u2019s creative director, Neil Druckmann. \u201cGetting a chance to adapt this breathtaking work of art has been a dream of mine for years, and I\u2019m so honoured to do it in partnership with Neil,\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter.

The average European office worker <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/how-long-spend-meetings-year-thirteen-days-uk-workers-average-a8542861.html\" title=\"\">spends 13 days a year</a> in meetings, many of them pointless.</p> <p>Be selective about who you invite. \u201cGet as few people on the call as possible,\u201d says Bruce Daisley, author of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-joy-of-work-9781847942470.html\" title=\"\">The Joy of Work</a></em>. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a collection of 50 postage-stamp-sized faces on the screen, it\u2019s impossible to feel connected. And when you don\u2019t know everyone in the meeting, you speak less frankly.\u201d</p> <h2>Practise good etiquette</h2> <p>You wouldn\u2019t openly browse Twitter during a meeting, so don\u2019t do it in a video call. \u201cMake eye contact with the camera,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cIf you\u2019re typing, mute your keyboard so other people don\u2019t hear clicking.\u201d Sit forward in your seat when others are talking, rather than slumping on your sofa \u2013 it shows your co-workers that you\u2019re engaged.</p> <p>If some people are dialling in from home, and others are at work, be mindful of the people physically absent. Meetings may be weighted in favour of the people in the room: they can exchange looks or read body language in a way those plugged in from home can\u2019t.</p> <p>Petriglieri often teaches mixed seminars, where some participants are dialling in, and others are working from home. He uses the example of meetings between heads of states: there are the world leaders who sit at the conference table, and the aides on the chairs behind them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People\u2019s stress levels are actually higher when they work remotely. They think their boss doesn\u2019t trust them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe best advice I can give is to be mindful of the people in the second row,\u201d says Petriglieri. \u201cYou need to develop a muscle for inclusion.\u201d When he is lecturing, he is careful to draw on students online, as well as those in the room, to avoid what he terms \u201cextreme asymmetry\u201d.</p> <p>If you are in a meeting room with a large screen showing people dialled in from home, Petriglieri recommends asking participants at home to raise their hands if they want to talk. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to ignore people who aren\u2019t in the room if the conversation is getting going,\u201d he says. \u201cAsk people to let you know if someone is raising their hand and you don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p> <h2>Beware the private chat</h2> <p>So much of our interaction in meetings is nonverbal. The eye-roll behind your boss\u2019s back; the strained smile when the office bore drones on. With video calling, these subtleties are lost \u2013 which is why many workers will often have a sneaky chat going on with their co-workers at the same time.</p> <p>But a chat message is much more permanent than an eye-roll. \u201cThese messages can be recorded by your employers,\u201d says Spicer, \u201cand people can be held accountable for them. An informal eye roll can be disavowed, but an instant message on a company server can\u2019t.\u201d So, if you\u2019re tempted to gripe about how tedious the video call is to a trusted colleague \u2013 use your personal mobile phone instead. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/25/slack-butterfield-emoji-chat-nasa-harvard-silicon-valley\">Beyond email: could startup Slack change the way you work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019re sharing a slide-deck or other notes during a video call, other people in the meeting will be able to screenshot those materials without you realising. Which is fine if you trust your colleagues, but good to be aware of nonetheless.</p> <h2>Treat each other like humans</h2> <p>\u201cThe interesting thing about remote working is that people always think it will be better,\u201d says Daisley. \u201cBut people\u2019s stress levels are actually higher when they work remotely. It\u2019s stressful and lonely. We think our boss doesn\u2019t trust us and our team doesn\u2019t like us.\u201d</p> <p>One-to-one video calling can help combat social isolation. \u201cI work for a company where 80% of the employees work remotely,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cOur HR department encourages us to call people via video call instead of sending them an email, so that you can have that face-to-face interaction. It adds time, but it helps you engage more with your co-workers.\u201d US software startup GitHub even runs <a href=\"https://github.com/nathenharvey/conference-call-backgrounds#distributed-happy-hour\" title=\"\">Remote Happy Hours</a> for employees working from home \u2013 although of course, they have to drink whatever\u2019s in their fridge.</p> <p>Like any technology, video calling is neutral. It\u2019s about how you use it. Don\u2019t drone on, waste time, or speak for the sake of it, and you\u2019ll get the most of video calling software. And remember: if you are watching Netflix instead of working, always put your microphone on mute.</p>",

He uses the example of meetings between heads of states: there are the world leaders who sit at the conference table, and the aides on the chairs behind them. \u201cThe best advice I can give is to be mindful of the people in the second row,\u201d says Petriglieri. \u201cYou need to develop a muscle for inclusion.\u201d When he is lecturing, he is careful to draw on students online, as well as those in the room, to avoid what he terms \u201cextreme asymmetry\u201d. If you are in a meeting room with a large screen showing people dialled in from home, Petriglieri recommends asking participants at home to raise their hands if they want to talk. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to ignore people who aren\u2019t in the room if the conversation is getting going,\u201d he says. \u201cAsk people to let you know if someone is raising their hand and you don\u2019t see it.\u201d Beware the private chat So much of our interaction in meetings is nonverbal. The eye-roll behind your boss\u2019s back; the strained smile when the office bore drones on. With video calling, these subtleties are lost \u2013 which is why many workers will often have a sneaky chat going on with their co-workers at the same time. But a chat message is much more permanent than an eye-roll. \u201cThese messages can be recorded by your employers,\u201d says Spicer, \u201cand people can be held accountable for them. An informal eye roll can be disavowed, but an instant message on a company server can\u2019t.\u201d So, if you\u2019re tempted to gripe about how tedious the video call is to a trusted colleague \u2013 use your personal mobile phone instead. If you\u2019re sharing a slide-deck or other notes during a video call, other people in the meeting will be able to screenshot those materials without you realising. Which is fine if you trust your colleagues, but good to be aware of nonetheless. Treat each other like humans \u201cThe interesting thing about remote working is that people always think it will be better,\u201d says Daisley. \u201cBut people\u2019s stress levels are actually higher when they work remotely. It\u2019s stressful and lonely. We think our boss doesn\u2019t trust us and our team doesn\u2019t like us.\u201d One-to-one video calling can help combat social isolation. \u201cI work for a company where 80% of the employees work remotely,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cOur HR department encourages us to call people via video call instead of sending them an email, so that you can have that face-to-face interaction. It adds time, but it helps you engage more with your co-workers.\u201d US software startup GitHub even runs Remote Happy Hours for employees working from home \u2013 although of course, they have to drink whatever\u2019s in their fridge. Like any technology, video calling is neutral. It\u2019s about how you use it. Don\u2019t drone on, waste time, or speak for the sake of it, and you\u2019ll get the most of video calling software. And remember: if you are watching Netflix instead of working, always put your microphone on mute.",

      "body": "<p>For artist and writer Charlotte Amelia Poe, 30, every day feels like a walk across a frozen pond. \u201cIt\u2019s how it\u2019s always been,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to navigate it and stay safe, but you\u2019re aware that at any moment the ice is likely to crack, and at that point you will sink into the water.\u201d</p> <p>The worst of it is that, when she feels that way, she has no idea how she can avoid going under. \u201cYou think you\u2019re doing fine and you\u2019re treading carefully enough not to crack the ice. But suddenly you\u2019ve gone under. You\u2019ve got it completely wrong \u2013 and you\u2019ve no idea why.\u201d</p> <p>Poe is describing how it feels to be autistic. She wants the rest of us to understand, she says, because it really matters, perhaps more than it\u2019s ever mattered (of which more later). Her mission to break open the mystery of how it feels to be autistic has already been impressively successful: last year she won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">Spectrum </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">art </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/07/spectrum-art-prize-awarded-to-how-to-be-autistic-video-charlotte-amelia-poe\" title=\"\">prize</a> for her video piece <em>How </em><em>To </em><em>Be Autistic</em> and recently she wrote a book of the same name. Her hope is that, by opening up about her own journey through childhood, school and adolescence, she can change other people\u2019s perceptions and expectations about what autism is like, from the inside.</p> <p>We are talking in the sitting room of the semi-detached house overlooking a Suffolk field that Poe shares with three generations of her family. She has never left home and doesn\u2019t expect to; her nephews and niece are playing outside in the garden, and one day their mother, her sister, will be her carer in the way that her parents are at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scary feeling, that I\u2019ll be inherited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019d be very lonely if I had to live alone. I need people around me. I like noise and I like being surrounded by people I love.\u201d She\u2019s curled up on the sofa as we speak, her legs tucked underneath her, looking fragile and bird-like, but her voice is surprisingly strong, as well as impressively articulate.</p> <p>Poe was just six or seven years old and at primary school when she realised she was different. Astonishingly, it wasn\u2019t until she was 21 that she received a diagnosis of autism. The reason, she says, is simple \u2013 society looks for autism in boys, not girls, and the way it presents means that boys are more likely to be identified with it. \u201cAutistic children are often quiet and obedient when they\u2019re very young \u2013 and if you\u2019re a girl, that\u2019s not unusual. But for a boy it is. If I\u2019d been a boy I\u2019d have been diagnosed years sooner.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People with autism get what others are feeling to a huge degree</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That rankles, because at school she knew autistic boys and they had an easier time of it because they had a label \u2013 \u201cSometimes labels can be really helpful,\u201d she says \u2013 and she describes how she was increasingly seen as awkward by her teachers, some of whom bullied her as much as some of her fellow pupils did.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019d been diagnosed sooner,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had the level of trauma I\u2019ve had. It makes me angry that I have to deal with extra baggage that could have been avoided.\u201d</p> <p>It was people\u2019s attitude towards her, rather than the condition itself, that made life so unbearable. \u201cUnderstanding is so important \u2013 that\u2019s what makes a real difference,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need trained people to support us, and there aren\u2019t enough of them \u2013 and although there\u2019s been more awareness of autism in the past few years, it\u2019s not filtered through into proper training. My brother is a doctor and I think he spent one day on it in his entire time at medical school.\u201d</p> <p>There are so many misunderstandings, she says. To take just one, autistic people are <em>not</em> unable to empathise. \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing, but people with autism get what others are feeling to a huge degree. It overwhelms us \u2013 that\u2019s why we often don\u2019t know how to respond, how to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>One focus of her difficulties, for several years, was her teeth. From the time they began to wobble she was unable to brush them. She\u2019s not sure why she found the loss of her milk teeth so disturbing, but she speculates that it may have been because \u201cautistic people are extremely sensitive to sensation, to change, to pain\u201d. The net result: \u201cI went through the entirety of first school and half of middle school with a mouth full of disgusting, stinking plaque.\u201d Although her teeth are fine now, she tries not to show them when she\u2019s talking or smiling.</p> <p>Having terrible teeth was one of the many things that made Poe stick out as different. She also had a tendency to vomit in public when her anxiety became too much to cope with (she ended up carrying a sick bowl around with her wherever she went, just in case).

      "bodyText": "For artist and writer Charlotte Amelia Poe, 30, every day feels like a walk across a frozen pond. \u201cIt\u2019s how it\u2019s always been,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to navigate it and stay safe, but you\u2019re aware that at any moment the ice is likely to crack, and at that point you will sink into the water.\u201d The worst of it is that, when she feels that way, she has no idea how she can avoid going under. \u201cYou think you\u2019re doing fine and you\u2019re treading carefully enough not to crack the ice. But suddenly you\u2019ve gone under. You\u2019ve got it completely wrong \u2013 and you\u2019ve no idea why.\u201d Poe is describing how it feels to be autistic. She wants the rest of us to understand, she says, because it really matters, perhaps more than it\u2019s ever mattered (of which more later). Her mission to break open the mystery of how it feels to be autistic has already been impressively successful: last year she won the Spectrum art prize for her video piece How To Be Autistic and recently she wrote a book of the same name. Her hope is that, by opening up about her own journey through childhood, school and adolescence, she can change other people\u2019s perceptions and expectations about what autism is like, from the inside. We are talking in the sitting room of the semi-detached house overlooking a Suffolk field that Poe shares with three generations of her family. She has never left home and doesn\u2019t expect to; her nephews and niece are playing outside in the garden, and one day their mother, her sister, will be her carer in the way that her parents are at the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary feeling, that I\u2019ll be inherited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019d be very lonely if I had to live alone. I need people around me. I like noise and I like being surrounded by people I love.\u201d She\u2019s curled up on the sofa as we speak, her legs tucked underneath her, looking fragile and bird-like, but her voice is surprisingly strong, as well as impressively articulate. Poe was just six or seven years old and at primary school when she realised she was different. Astonishingly, it wasn\u2019t until she was 21 that she received a diagnosis of autism. The reason, she says, is simple \u2013 society looks for autism in boys, not girls, and the way it presents means that boys are more likely to be identified with it. \u201cAutistic children are often quiet and obedient when they\u2019re very young \u2013 and if you\u2019re a girl, that\u2019s not unusual. But for a boy it is. If I\u2019d been a boy I\u2019d have been diagnosed years sooner.\u201d That rankles, because at school she knew autistic boys and they had an easier time of it because they had a label \u2013 \u201cSometimes labels can be really helpful,\u201d she says \u2013 and she describes how she was increasingly seen as awkward by her teachers, some of whom bullied her as much as some of her fellow pupils did. \u201cIf I\u2019d been diagnosed sooner,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had the level of trauma I\u2019ve had. It makes me angry that I have to deal with extra baggage that could have been avoided.\u201d It was people\u2019s attitude towards her, rather than the condition itself, that made life so unbearable. \u201cUnderstanding is so important \u2013 that\u2019s what makes a real difference,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need trained people to support us, and there aren\u2019t enough of them \u2013 and although there\u2019s been more awareness of autism in the past few years, it\u2019s not filtered through into proper training. My brother is a doctor and I think he spent one day on it in his entire time at medical school.\u201d There are so many misunderstandings, she says. To take just one, autistic people are not unable to empathise. \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing, but people with autism get what others are feeling to a huge degree. It overwhelms us \u2013 that\u2019s why we often don\u2019t know how to respond, how to deal with it.\u201d One focus of her difficulties, for several years, was her teeth. From the time they began to wobble she was unable to brush them. She\u2019s not sure why she found the loss of her milk teeth so disturbing, but she speculates that it may have been because \u201cautistic people are extremely sensitive to sensation, to change, to pain\u201d. The net result: \u201cI went through the entirety of first school and half of middle school with a mouth full of disgusting, stinking plaque.\u201d Although her teeth are fine now, she tries not to show them when she\u2019s talking or smiling. Having terrible teeth was one of the many things that made Poe stick out as different. She also had a tendency to vomit in public when her anxiety became too much to cope with (she ended up carrying a sick bowl around with her wherever she went, just in case). She was a picky eater and was unable to eat even a packed lunch at school \u2013 and she spent more and more time on her own in her bedroom. Academically she did well, although once homework got serious she found it increasingly difficult to tackle (\u201cThat\u2019s called executive dysfunction \u2013 you know you should do something, but you can\u2019t bring yourself to do it\u201d) and that led to her being seen as difficult. Eventually, she started playing up to her profile. \u201cYou think, if I\u2019m going to be seen as this, then it might help to just be it.\u201d But as things would turn out, it was embracing her sense of \u201cotherness\u201d that led to a way forward, and gradually, being \u201cdifferent\u201d became something she celebrated, rather than hid. She turned her attention to something she says is deeply ingrained in the autistic psyche \u2013 fandom. From Harry Potter to Captain America, she became a groupie, attending conventions and dressing up as her favourite characters. It felt like a liberation. \u201cFandom conventions are full of people with autism,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re somewhere we can be unashamedly who we are.\u201d That\u2019s because hyperfixation, she says, is both the best and the worst thing about being autistic. \u201cYou become very fixated on something \u2013 it\u2019s very helpful when you\u2019re working on a project, like writing a book for example, because you can write 20,000 words in a day. But it has very negative connotations for others \u2013 people who are over-enthusiastic about stuff are written off as \u201cautistic\u201d \u2013 and that devalues your opinion.\u201d Today Poe looks as different as she feels. Her arms and legs are covered in tattoos and, on the day I meet her, her hair is dyed blonde with hues of light pink and pale blue. Being autistic still limits her life \u2013 agoraphobia means she only manages to leave the house once or twice a month, and she has to take tranquillisers first \u2013 but stumbling on the existence of the Spectrum art prize for people with autism, and then making the winning video, changed her life. She\u2019d like to become a fiction writer, and is currently working on her first novel \u2013 but she\u2019s also committed to telling it like it is about autism. And that matters because, she says, autistic people, once diagnosed and understood, have great potential \u2013 they\u2019re often very effective individuals who can make a noise and a difference. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same filter as neurotypical people and that can make us powerful and strong,\u201d she says. \u201cLook at the environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg, for example.\u201d And there\u2019s more, she says, because we live in a time when people who are \u201cother\u201d are increasingly dismissed, cut out of the action \u2013 and those with autism, who naturally identify as outsiders, can be effective champions for all outsiders. \u201cWe really get what it means to not fit in.

A keen outdoor swimmer whose work is often inspired by water, Rachael was first drawn to this site by its setting. \u201cI walk on the beach and swim in the sea nearly every day,\u201d she says, \u201cand the vision for the house was very much about being able to see the sea.\u201d The result is an arresting contemporary home whose jet-black weatherboarding and corrugated roof echo the tarred fishermen\u2019s huts and net lofts typically found in nearby Whitstable.</p> <p>Rachael came across the plot by accident during a day trip to Whitstable with her sister in 2014. At the time, she was house-hunting without success in south London, after selling her home in Sydenham with a view to moving closer to <a href=\"https://www.fusion-lifestyle.com/centres/brockwell-lido/\" title=\"\">Brockwell </a><a href=\"https://www.fusion-lifestyle.com/centres/brockwell-lido/\" title=\"\">lido</a>. (Rachael has been cold water swimming since 2006 and helped to reform the lido\u2019s original 1930s swimming club: The Brockwell Icicles.) While walking along the east Kent coastline, looping back from Reculver, the sisters stumbled across a small 1930s bungalow for sale right by the shore, but it was in need of modernisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fde763a4adf1352a84de1908593e32ffbf25162\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fde763a4adf1352a84de1908593e32ffbf25162/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old meets new: the kitchen cupboards from the original bungalow were retained and repainted.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old meets new: the kitchen cupboards from the original bungalow were retained and repainted.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Hemming/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a nice house, but it had the most fantastic views and quite a big garden, so I knew I could build a studio at the back,\u201d Rachael recalls. \u201cAnd because I had done some building work before, I could imagine how it could be refurbished.\u201d She quickly made an offer and moved in that October.</p> <p>As her original intention had been to remodel the house, Rachael commissioned a local architect, <a href=\"http://parashoot-architects.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Michael Shoobridge</a>, to draw up plans for a fresh internal layout.

      "bodyText": "You see the most remarkable skies here \u2013 like a miracle of heaven and earth together,\u201d says artist Rachael Dickens of the view from her newly built home, between Herne Bay and Reculver on the Kent coast. A keen outdoor swimmer whose work is often inspired by water, Rachael was first drawn to this site by its setting. \u201cI walk on the beach and swim in the sea nearly every day,\u201d she says, \u201cand the vision for the house was very much about being able to see the sea.\u201d The result is an arresting contemporary home whose jet-black weatherboarding and corrugated roof echo the tarred fishermen\u2019s huts and net lofts typically found in nearby Whitstable. Rachael came across the plot by accident during a day trip to Whitstable with her sister in 2014. At the time, she was house-hunting without success in south London, after selling her home in Sydenham with a view to moving closer to Brockwell lido. (Rachael has been cold water swimming since 2006 and helped to reform the lido\u2019s original 1930s swimming club: The Brockwell Icicles.) While walking along the east Kent coastline, looping back from Reculver, the sisters stumbled across a small 1930s bungalow for sale right by the shore, but it was in need of modernisation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a nice house, but it had the most fantastic views and quite a big garden, so I knew I could build a studio at the back,\u201d Rachael recalls. \u201cAnd because I had done some building work before, I could imagine how it could be refurbished.\u201d She quickly made an offer and moved in that October. As her original intention had been to remodel the house, Rachael commissioned a local architect, Michael Shoobridge, to draw up plans for a fresh internal layout. However, when builders began work in 2015, it became clear that the bungalow\u2019s timber frame was perilously rotten and it would have to be knocked down. \u201cI was a bit terrified \u2013 but excited as well \u2013 when I found out about the demolition,\u201d says Rachael, who has two grown-up children still living in London, and shares her home with a Staffordshire terrier cross named Zoot. \u201cIt did make it a lot more expensive.\u201d A buy-to-let flat she had just purchased in Westgate-on-Sea had to be sold to pay for the project.

      "body": "<p>Europe\u2019s economy was meant to have a decent year in 2020. Factory production in the 19-country eurozone rose strongly in January, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/15/amazing-deal-or-capitulation-why-the-us-china-trade-truce-may-not-last\" title=\"\">a tentative truce in the US-China trade war</a>. Consumer confidence was strong. Housebuilders\u2019 order books were full.</p> <p>The stage was set for a solid, albeit unspectacular year. The European economy would see \u201csteady and moderate growth\u201d, predicted the European commission\u2019s economic forecast on 13 February. It also warned of clouds on the horizon, including a new virus. Noting mounting concern about coronavirus, as well as \u201cdownside\u201d risks, the Brussels forecast concluded the outbreak would peak in the first three months of the year, with \u201crelatively limited global spillovers\u201d.</p> <p>That was then. One month later the global economy is heading for recession, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/markets-rebound-after-worst-day-since-1987-amid-coronavirus-panic-ftse-100-dow-jones-wall-street\" title=\"\">markets have taken a hammering</a>, investors are panicking. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/european-countries-take-radical-steps-to-combat-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Across the continent</a>, shops, restaurants and bars are shuttered, supply chains frozen, football matches cancelled, theatres, cinemas and hairdressers closed. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index had its worst-ever day on Thursday, plunging 11.5%, after a blunt message from the European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\" title=\"\">it was the job of governments \u2013 not the ECB \u2013 to protect indebted countries</a>.</p> <p>The head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described the pandemic as \u201ca major shock\u201d to Europe\u2019s economies, as she promised a \u20ac37bn (\u00a333bn) fund to handle the fallout.</p> <p>Attention is turning to eurozone finance ministers, who will meet on Monday, after the ECB disappointed markets by declining to cut interest rates as part of a stimulus package announced last week.</p> <p>Having fumbled the eurozone debt crisis, can EU leaders now protect their economies from the worst pandemic in more than 100 years?</p> <p>Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, is heading for rocky times. \u201cItaly has gone through many crises, unfortunately,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe problem is that, coming from all these crises in the past, the Italian government is weak right now and the public finances situation is even more fragile, so it\u2019s particularly dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>He is forecasting a 3.1% slump in economic output in 2020, or even 6.5% in a worst-case scenario \u2013 \u201cgiven how the situation is unfolding, [the latter] might become the baseline scenario pretty soon\u201d. The Italian government, which has said it is ready to spend \u20ac25bn to protect its economy from the fallout, has chided other Europeans for \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbour\u201d policies, such as Germany\u2019s export ban on surgical masks.</p> <p>Italy\u2019s banks are in a healthier position than 2011, when they were creaking under bad loans, but things could still turn nasty. To avoid a return to the \u201cdoom loop\u201d \u2013 where potential bank failure risks the bankruptcy of the state \u2013 Codogno is advocating support for Italy in the form of an EU precautionary credit line. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"600056639d10b69e28971f96d0aa4b39dbee14f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/600056639d10b69e28971f96d0aa4b39dbee14f5/0_143_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Disinfection in process outside the Centrale railway station in Milan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disinfection in process outside the Centrale train station in Milan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Furlan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In France, the next-worst-affected European country, the government is warning of \u201csevere\u201d consequences for the economy. The outbreak is another blow, after a wave of strikes in 2019 chipped away at economic growth. France\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecast for the first quarter to 0.1%, down from a previous estimate of 0.3%, warning of a \u201csevere but temporary\u201d slowdown.</p> <p>Germany is not as badly affected by the virus as Italy or France, but its export-led economy was the first to feel the chill of China\u2019s slowdown. A survey for the ifo Institut last week revealed that 56% of German companies had reported \u201cnegative effects\u201d, with a 44% slump in demand and 52% of manufacturers saying they were experiencing difficulties with supply. In response to the pressure on the economy, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, even suggested that she was ready to reverse the rule of maintaining a balanced budget \u2013 the black zero or <em>schwarze Null</em> \u2013 that has proved an unbreakable political orthodoxy for the government in recent years.</p> <p>Speaking before the German government announced \u201cunlimited\u201d credit to keep companies afloat, the influential president of the ifo, Clemens Fuest, said that Berlin was \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d. He supports a temporary relaxation of the <em>schwarze Null</em>, noting that<em> \u201c</em>the black zero was a very good policy in good times, but it shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of taking decisive measures\u201d.</p> <p>The German economist thinks EU measures need to be similarly targeted and \u201cwe have not reached that point\u201d of needing precautionary credit lines for indebted countries.</p> <p>The coronavirus fallout is likely to be uneven. \u201cThe producers of toilet paper don\u2019t have a recession at all, and the restaurants and hotels have a very deep one,\u201d said Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, based in Berlin. Manufacturers, he said, have more hope of a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery \u2013 that is, an economic bounce-back as rapid as the descent \u2013 because they will benefit from pent-up demand.</p> <p>Odendahl observed: \u201cIf you want to buy glasses now but you can\u2019t because of supply chain disruptions, you will do so later, whereas a restaurant or a trip you just have to cancel.\u201d For that reason, he thinks Germany could see a more rapid rebound compared with countries more reliant on tourism, such as Spain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f13d00a12e2c5a1916d591c1ece1355be90fb6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f13d00a12e2c5a1916d591c1ece1355be90fb6f/0_380_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An opera is performed to an empty auditorium in Berlin, where all theatres are closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An opera is performed to an empty auditorium in Berlin, where all theatres are closed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Adamik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that should not stop European policymakers from taking \u201cbold\u201d action, Odendahl said. All companies \u201cneed liquidity help to make sure they survive this long pause of economic activity intact\u201d. He also wants to see a European approach to help indebted countries: \u201cIf there was a time for risk-sharing, then this would be it. This is a situation where there is no moral hazard.\u201d Here he is referring to the debate that raged during the eurozone debt crisis, when creditor countries declined to pool risk for fear of \u201crewarding\u201d debtors.</p> <p>M\u00e1rio Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup \u2013 made up of the finance ministers of the eurozone \u2013 said that his members would come up with \u201ca very large policy response\u201d to address the crisis \u2013 greater than the \u20ac27bn Lagarde suggested was needed. Centeno expects ministers to agree fiscal measures that will ensure liquidity for companies, support unemployment benefits and help reduce hours for workers.</p> <p>But it is not clear whether these measures add up to the \u201cmassive\u201d economic stimulus plan that France is looking for \u2013 a measure EU leaders failed to agree to on a telephone conference summit last week.</p> <p>Pascal Canfin, a French MEP and ally of President Emmanuel Macron, has called for a \u201cEuropean stimulus package\u201d to be announced by the EU leaders\u2019 summit at the end of this month (26-27 March). Canfin, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment and public health committee, argues that this package must be aligned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\" title=\"\">the European Green Deal</a>, a plan to transform the economy to meet the demands of the climate emergency.</p> <p>In addition to using flexibilities in EU budget rules, the MEP said that a European stimulus package agreed on 27 March \u201cwould be a real answer to the problem right on the scale and right on the time\u201d. It would \u201cmake sure the green deal is alive\u201d, with spending to promote electric vehicles and energy-efficient housing.</p> <p>But some EU countries think it\u2019s premature to discuss this kind of stimulus. The European commission\u2019s vice-president in charge of the economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, has sounded a cautious note: \u201cIn current circumstances, I wouldn\u2019t be talking so much about fiscal stimulus, rather about crisis response.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s economy was meant to have a decent year in 2020. Factory production in the 19-country eurozone rose strongly in January, after a tentative truce in the US-China trade war. Consumer confidence was strong. Housebuilders\u2019 order books were full. The stage was set for a solid, albeit unspectacular year. The European economy would see \u201csteady and moderate growth\u201d, predicted the European commission\u2019s economic forecast on 13 February. It also warned of clouds on the horizon, including a new virus. Noting mounting concern about coronavirus, as well as \u201cdownside\u201d risks, the Brussels forecast concluded the outbreak would peak in the first three months of the year, with \u201crelatively limited global spillovers\u201d. That was then. One month later the global economy is heading for recession, markets have taken a hammering, investors are panicking. Across the continent, shops, restaurants and bars are shuttered, supply chains frozen, football matches cancelled, theatres, cinemas and hairdressers closed. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index had its worst-ever day on Thursday, plunging 11.5%, after a blunt message from the European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, that it was the job of governments \u2013 not the ECB \u2013 to protect indebted countries. The head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described the pandemic as \u201ca major shock\u201d to Europe\u2019s economies, as she promised a \u20ac37bn (\u00a333bn) fund to handle the fallout. Attention is turning to eurozone finance ministers, who will meet on Monday, after the ECB disappointed markets by declining to cut interest rates as part of a stimulus package announced last week. Having fumbled the eurozone debt crisis, can EU leaders now protect their economies from the worst pandemic in more than 100 years? Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, is heading for rocky times. \u201cItaly has gone through many crises, unfortunately,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. \u201cThe problem is that, coming from all these crises in the past, the Italian government is weak right now and the public finances situation is even more fragile, so it\u2019s particularly dangerous.\u201d He is forecasting a 3.1% slump in economic output in 2020, or even 6.5% in a worst-case scenario \u2013 \u201cgiven how the situation is unfolding, [the latter] might become the baseline scenario pretty soon\u201d. The Italian government, which has said it is ready to spend \u20ac25bn to protect its economy from the fallout, has chided other Europeans for \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbour\u201d policies, such as Germany\u2019s export ban on surgical masks. Italy\u2019s banks are in a healthier position than 2011, when they were creaking under bad loans, but things could still turn nasty. To avoid a return to the \u201cdoom loop\u201d \u2013 where potential bank failure risks the bankruptcy of the state \u2013 Codogno is advocating support for Italy in the form of an EU precautionary credit line. In France, the next-worst-affected European country, the government is warning of \u201csevere\u201d consequences for the economy. The outbreak is another blow, after a wave of strikes in 2019 chipped away at economic growth. France\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecast for the first quarter to 0.1%, down from a previous estimate of 0.3%, warning of a \u201csevere but temporary\u201d slowdown. Germany is not as badly affected by the virus as Italy or France, but its export-led economy was the first to feel the chill of China\u2019s slowdown. A survey for the ifo Institut last week revealed that 56% of German companies had reported \u201cnegative effects\u201d, with a 44% slump in demand and 52% of manufacturers saying they were experiencing difficulties with supply. In response to the pressure on the economy, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, even suggested that she was ready to reverse the rule of maintaining a balanced budget \u2013 the black zero or schwarze Null \u2013 that has proved an unbreakable political orthodoxy for the government in recent years. Speaking before the German government announced \u201cunlimited\u201d credit to keep companies afloat, the influential president of the ifo, Clemens Fuest, said that Berlin was \u201cmoving in the right direction\u201d. He supports a temporary relaxation of the schwarze Null, noting that \u201cthe black zero was a very good policy in good times, but it shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of taking decisive measures\u201d. The German economist thinks EU measures need to be similarly targeted and \u201cwe have not reached that point\u201d of needing precautionary credit lines for indebted countries. The coronavirus fallout is likely to be uneven. \u201cThe producers of toilet paper don\u2019t have a recession at all, and the restaurants and hotels have a very deep one,\u201d said Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, based in Berlin. Manufacturers, he said, have more hope of a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery \u2013 that is, an economic bounce-back as rapid as the descent \u2013 because they will benefit from pent-up demand. Odendahl observed: \u201cIf you want to buy glasses now but you can\u2019t because of supply chain disruptions, you will do so later, whereas a restaurant or a trip you just have to cancel.\u201d For that reason, he thinks Germany could see a more rapid rebound compared with countries more reliant on tourism, such as Spain. But that should not stop European policymakers from taking \u201cbold\u201d action, Odendahl said. All companies \u201cneed liquidity help to make sure they survive this long pause of economic activity intact\u201d. He also wants to see a European approach to help indebted countries: \u201cIf there was a time for risk-sharing, then this would be it. This is a situation where there is no moral hazard.\u201d Here he is referring to the debate that raged during the eurozone debt crisis, when creditor countries declined to pool risk for fear of \u201crewarding\u201d debtors. M\u00e1rio Centeno, the head of the Eurogroup \u2013 made up of the finance ministers of the eurozone \u2013 said that his members would come up with \u201ca very large policy response\u201d to address the crisis \u2013 greater than the \u20ac27bn Lagarde suggested was needed. Centeno expects ministers to agree fiscal measures that will ensure liquidity for companies, support unemployment benefits and help reduce hours for workers. But it is not clear whether these measures add up to the \u201cmassive\u201d economic stimulus plan that France is looking for \u2013 a measure EU leaders failed to agree to on a telephone conference summit last week. Pascal Canfin, a French MEP and ally of President Emmanuel Macron, has called for a \u201cEuropean stimulus package\u201d to be announced by the EU leaders\u2019 summit at the end of this month (26-27 March). Canfin, who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment and public health committee, argues that this package must be aligned with the European Green Deal, a plan to transform the economy to meet the demands of the climate emergency. In addition to using flexibilities in EU budget rules, the MEP said that a European stimulus package agreed on 27 March \u201cwould be a real answer to the problem right on the scale and right on the time\u201d. It would \u201cmake sure the green deal is alive\u201d, with spending to promote electric vehicles and energy-efficient housing. But some EU countries think it\u2019s premature to discuss this kind of stimulus. The European commission\u2019s vice-president in charge of the economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, has sounded a cautious note: \u201cIn current circumstances, I wouldn\u2019t be talking so much about fiscal stimulus, rather about crisis response.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On 15 February the director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, addressed <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/munich-security-conference\" title=\"\">the Munich Security conference.</a> At that moment, there were 66,000 cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a> in China, and only 505 in the rest of the world. So most of us were probably still assuming that this was predominately a Chinese problem. This view was not shared by the WHO director-general. He was also concerned about: the lack of urgency in the international community; the severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment, which was putting health workers at risk; the levels of rumours and misinformation that were hampering the response; and the havoc the virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems.</p> <p>The part of his speech that made me sit up, though, was this: \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.\u201d And if we don\u2019t tackle this, he went on, \u201cwe are headed down a dark path that leads nowhere but division and disharmony\u201d.</p> <p>As if to underscore that point, up popped two stories this week. The first was <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/coronavirus-riots-social-media-ukraine\" title=\"\">a Buzzfeed report</a> of what mis- and disinformation did to a small Ukrainian village. Two days of chaos and riots illustrated what can happen when people don\u2019t trust their government but instead believe rumours and misinformation spread on social media. On 18 February a plane from Wuhan, China, had arrived in the country, and rumours started circulating that several of the 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals on board were infected with Covid-19. Upon landing, they were to be immediately bused to an undisclosed medical facility. A government announcement said that the evacuees had all been tested and none of them were infected. So there was nothing to worry about.</p> <p>But, Buzzfeed reports, in the small town of Novi Sanzhary, residents went beserk when they discovered that the evacuees were going to be housed in their local sanatorium. Barricades were erected and fires set to try to keep the buses carrying the evacuees out of town. Protesters were met by phalanxes of police in riot gear who arrived with armoured vehicles to push them back. Tensions escalated, violent clashes broke out. And when the buses carrying people from China finally arrived, residents shouted at them to \u201cget out\u201d and hurled stones that shattered the windows.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When tempted to share a snippet of 'information' on Covid-19 that\u2019s popped into your social media feed \u2013 don\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second story concerned polarisation. Some <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3657#.XmaSrM7okEs.twitter\" title=\"\">polling research</a> in the US last week showed that Democrats and Republicans have starkly divergent views on the danger that the virus poses, and on how the Trump administration is handling it: 43% of respondents approve of Trump\u2019s response to Covid-19, while 49% disapprove. But the divide falls largely along party lines \u2013 83% of Democrats disapprove of Trump\u2019s response, while 87% of Republicans approve, and two-thirds of Democrats are \u201cvery or somewhat concerned\u201d about the virus, compared with just 35% of Republicans. Clearly Republicans don\u2019t yet realise that the Covid-19 is no respecter of party affiliations.</p> <p>One of the things that makes this epidemic different from predecessors is the dominance of social media in today\u2019s world. One of the most perceptive analyses of what\u2019s going on has come from Kate Starbird of Washington State University, who\u2019s a leading expert on \u201ccrisis informatics\u201d \u2013 the study of how information flows in crisis situations, especially over social media. Crises always generate levels of high uncertainty, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@katestarbird/reflecting-on-the-covid-19-infodemic-as-a-crisis-informatics-researcher-ce0656fa4d0a\" title=\"\">she argues</a>, which in turn breeds anxiety. This leads people to seek ways of resolving uncertainty and reducing anxiety by seeking information about the threat. They\u2019re doing what humans always do \u2013 trying to make sense of a confusing situation.</p> <p>In the pre-internet era, information was curated by editorial gatekeepers and official government sources. But now anything goes, and sense-making involves trying to find out stuff on the internet, through search engines and social media. Some of the information gathered may be reliable, but a lot of it won\u2019t be. There are bad actors manipulating those platforms for economic gain (need a few face-masks, guv?) or ideological purposes. People retweet links without having looked at the site. And even innocently conceived jokes (a photograph of empty shelves in a local supermarket, for example) can trigger panic-buying.</p> <p>In the absence of a vaccine, the only way of slowing the spread of the virus is by \u201csocial distancing\u201d \u2013 ie stopping people congregating as much as possible. As the political theorist Yascha Mounck <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-cancel-everything/607675/\" title=\"\">pointed out recently</a>, distancing was just about the only thing that worked with the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. And in the online world, maybe we need something analogous. How about a bit of self-discipline? Whenever you\u2019re tempted to share a dramatic snippet of \u201cinformation\u201d about Covid-19 that\u2019s just popped into your social media feed \u2013 don\u2019t. Just say no.

      "bodyText": "On 15 February the director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, addressed the Munich Security conference. At that moment, there were 66,000 cases of Covid-19 in China, and only 505 in the rest of the world. So most of us were probably still assuming that this was predominately a Chinese problem. This view was not shared by the WHO director-general. He was also concerned about: the lack of urgency in the international community; the severe disruption in the market for personal protective equipment, which was putting health workers at risk; the levels of rumours and misinformation that were hampering the response; and the havoc the virus could wreak in countries with weaker health systems. The part of his speech that made me sit up, though, was this: \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting an epidemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.\u201d And if we don\u2019t tackle this, he went on, \u201cwe are headed down a dark path that leads nowhere but division and disharmony\u201d. As if to underscore that point, up popped two stories this week. The first was a Buzzfeed report of what mis- and disinformation did to a small Ukrainian village. Two days of chaos and riots illustrated what can happen when people don\u2019t trust their government but instead believe rumours and misinformation spread on social media. On 18 February a plane from Wuhan, China, had arrived in the country, and rumours started circulating that several of the 45 Ukrainians and 27 foreign nationals on board were infected with Covid-19. Upon landing, they were to be immediately bused to an undisclosed medical facility. A government announcement said that the evacuees had all been tested and none of them were infected. So there was nothing to worry about. But, Buzzfeed reports, in the small town of Novi Sanzhary, residents went beserk when they discovered that the evacuees were going to be housed in their local sanatorium. Barricades were erected and fires set to try to keep the buses carrying the evacuees out of town. Protesters were met by phalanxes of police in riot gear who arrived with armoured vehicles to push them back. Tensions escalated, violent clashes broke out. And when the buses carrying people from China finally arrived, residents shouted at them to \u201cget out\u201d and hurled stones that shattered the windows. The second story concerned polarisation. Some polling research in the US last week showed that Democrats and Republicans have starkly divergent views on the danger that the virus poses, and on how the Trump administration is handling it: 43% of respondents approve of Trump\u2019s response to Covid-19, while 49% disapprove. But the divide falls largely along party lines \u2013 83% of Democrats disapprove of Trump\u2019s response, while 87% of Republicans approve, and two-thirds of Democrats are \u201cvery or somewhat concerned\u201d about the virus, compared with just 35% of Republicans. Clearly Republicans don\u2019t yet realise that the Covid-19 is no respecter of party affiliations. One of the things that makes this epidemic different from predecessors is the dominance of social media in today\u2019s world. One of the most perceptive analyses of what\u2019s going on has come from Kate Starbird of Washington State University, who\u2019s a leading expert on \u201ccrisis informatics\u201d \u2013 the study of how information flows in crisis situations, especially over social media. Crises always generate levels of high uncertainty, she argues, which in turn breeds anxiety. This leads people to seek ways of resolving uncertainty and reducing anxiety by seeking information about the threat. They\u2019re doing what humans always do \u2013 trying to make sense of a confusing situation. In the pre-internet era, information was curated by editorial gatekeepers and official government sources. But now anything goes, and sense-making involves trying to find out stuff on the internet, through search engines and social media. Some of the information gathered may be reliable, but a lot of it won\u2019t be. There are bad actors manipulating those platforms for economic gain (need a few face-masks, guv?) or ideological purposes. People retweet links without having looked at the site. And even innocently conceived jokes (a photograph of empty shelves in a local supermarket, for example) can trigger panic-buying. In the absence of a vaccine, the only way of slowing the spread of the virus is by \u201csocial distancing\u201d \u2013 ie stopping people congregating as much as possible. As the political theorist Yascha Mounck pointed out recently, distancing was just about the only thing that worked with the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. And in the online world, maybe we need something analogous. How about a bit of self-discipline? Whenever you\u2019re tempted to share a dramatic snippet of \u201cinformation\u201d about Covid-19 that\u2019s just popped into your social media feed \u2013 don\u2019t. Just say no. You\u2019ll feel better, and you\u2019ll be slowing the propagation of a pernicious meme \u2013 which, after all, is just another kind of virus.

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.richardalstondance.com/richard\" title=\"\">Richard Alston</a></strong> has ended where he began. The last dance in his farewell <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMfm1FwPg0E\">Final Edition</a></strong> is made to the first music \u2013 by Monteverdi \u2013 that he remembers \u201chopping around to as a small boy\u201d. In <em><a href=\"https://www.richardalstondance.com/voices-and-light-footsteps\" title=\"\">Voices and Light Footsteps</a></em>, created last year, the 71-year-old choreographer reveals the very essence of himself, the glowing seam of light, of musicality and of joy, which has illuminated British dance stages for so long.</p> <p>Faced with a 50% cut in Arts Council funding, he decided to close his <a href=\"https://www.richardalstondance.com/richard-alston-dance-company-touring-contemporary-dance-company\" title=\"\">Richard Alston Dance Company</a>. This was its last programme, the concluding piece, to display his characteristic darting jumps and straight, carefully placed arms; the tilted centre of his fluid movements; his musicality and his sense that dance is a thing of beauty and grace.</p> <p>All the time I was watching what he insisted was a celebration, not a funeral, I kept thinking how mad and sad it is that Britain\u2019s regard for its cultural currency is so low that its principal funding body has to choose between setting aside money to encourage youth and supporting a veteran choreographer who has done as much as anyone to nurture contemporary dance in this country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3a06a91b2f96bb3d821e761b174f828f85f0279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3a06a91b2f96bb3d821e761b174f828f85f0279/0_0_3802_3091/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joshua Harriette and Ellen Yilma in Voices and Light Footsteps by Richard Alston\" width=\"1000\" height=\"813\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joshua Harriette and Ellen Yilma in Voices and Light Footsteps, \u2018the very essence\u2019 of Richard Alston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nature of the choice is even more invidious since Alston\u2019s company is one of the few permanent groups that offer young dancers a stable existence, a chance to hone their art in the service of a particular style. Too many choreographers are project-funded; most contemporary dancers are freelance. It may make them versatile and strong, but the sheer poetry and understanding on display here is rare. They were lovely in everything, including a new work, <em><a href=\"https://www.richardalstondance.com/shine-0\" title=\"\">Shine On</a></em>, set to the music of Britten and the poems of Auden, and the spiky, clever <em><a href=\"https://www.richardalstondance.com/isthmus\" title=\"\">Isthmus</a></em>, to music by Jo Kondo.</p> <p>The programme was also generous, enclosing in its warm embrace the piano playing of company regular<a href=\"https://www.richardalstondance.com/jason-ridgway-pianist-brahms-hungarian\" title=\"\"> Jason Ridgway</a>, performing Chopin mazurkas on stage to accompany <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb0QsSemXJQ&amp;feature=emb_title\" title=\"\">Mazur</a></em>, an emotional, sophisticated duet. Final Edition also featured <em><a href=\"https://www.richardalstondance.com/far-cry\" title=\"\">A Far Cry</a></em>, a fast and furious piece to pre-recorded Elgar from long-time associate Martin Lawrance, and <em>Bari</em>, a lively communal dance for students at London Contemporary Dance School, where Alston trained. The Monteverdi provided the perfect, elegiac close. It was intensely moving; Alston has brought a lot of pleasure to many people. He will shine on.</p> <p>The Royal Ballet is reviving Liam Scarlett\u2019s 2018 production of <strong><a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/swan-lake-by-liam-scarlett-details\" title=\"\">Swan Lake</a>,</strong> for an epic run.

John Macfarlane\u2019s designs are sumptuous, but Scarlett messes around with the story, placing the evil sorcerer Von Rothbart at the heart of the court, determined to bring Siegfried down.

      "bodyText": "Richard Alston has ended where he began. The last dance in his farewell Final Edition is made to the first music \u2013 by Monteverdi \u2013 that he remembers \u201chopping around to as a small boy\u201d. In Voices and Light Footsteps, created last year, the 71-year-old choreographer reveals the very essence of himself, the glowing seam of light, of musicality and of joy, which has illuminated British dance stages for so long. Faced with a 50% cut in Arts Council funding, he decided to close his Richard Alston Dance Company. This was its last programme, the concluding piece, to display his characteristic darting jumps and straight, carefully placed arms; the tilted centre of his fluid movements; his musicality and his sense that dance is a thing of beauty and grace. All the time I was watching what he insisted was a celebration, not a funeral, I kept thinking how mad and sad it is that Britain\u2019s regard for its cultural currency is so low that its principal funding body has to choose between setting aside money to encourage youth and supporting a veteran choreographer who has done as much as anyone to nurture contemporary dance in this country. The nature of the choice is even more invidious since Alston\u2019s company is one of the few permanent groups that offer young dancers a stable existence, a chance to hone their art in the service of a particular style. Too many choreographers are project-funded; most contemporary dancers are freelance. It may make them versatile and strong, but the sheer poetry and understanding on display here is rare. They were lovely in everything, including a new work, Shine On, set to the music of Britten and the poems of Auden, and the spiky, clever Isthmus, to music by Jo Kondo. The programme was also generous, enclosing in its warm embrace the piano playing of company regular Jason Ridgway, performing Chopin mazurkas on stage to accompany Mazur, an emotional, sophisticated duet. Final Edition also featured A Far Cry, a fast and furious piece to pre-recorded Elgar from long-time associate Martin Lawrance, and Bari, a lively communal dance for students at London Contemporary Dance School, where Alston trained. The Monteverdi provided the perfect, elegiac close. It was intensely moving; Alston has brought a lot of pleasure to many people. He will shine on. The Royal Ballet is reviving Liam Scarlett\u2019s 2018 production of Swan Lake, for an epic run. Since the company\u2019s associate artist is currently suspended pending an investigation into allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour, the revival was staged by Royal Ballet artistic director Kevin O\u2019Hare, but \u2013 some new lighting apart \u2013 it feels much the same as before. I don\u2019t love it. John Macfarlane\u2019s designs are sumptuous, but Scarlett messes around with the story, placing the evil sorcerer Von Rothbart at the heart of the court, determined to bring Siegfried down. This seems superficially clever but actually makes nonsense of the plot, which is \u2013 God knows \u2013 one that requires a great suspension of disbelief in the first place. But I managed to suppress my irritation, faced with the dancing of Marianela Nu\u00f1ez and Vadim Muntagirov. As Odette/Odile and Siegfried, they are both nothing less than majestic. Neither the tragic lyricism of Odette nor the bravura evil of Odile hold any technical terrors for Nu\u00f1ez; from that base she weaves an interpretation that is bewitching. In support, Marcelino Samb\u00e9, Mayara Magri, Fumi Kaneko and the entire corps de ballet were magnificent. The orchestra, under Koen Kessels, played like a dream. Star ratings (out of five) Final Edition \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Swan Lake \u2605\u2605\u2605 (production), \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (dancing) \u2022 Swan Lake is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London, until 16 May",

Gillum, a progressive former Tallahassee mayor who narrowly lost a 2018 run to be Florida\u2019s governor, apologized for being too intoxicated to talk to officers at the Mondrian South Beach hotel in Miami early on Friday, after police were called to a \u201cmedical incident\u201d. A police report said Gillum, 40, was discovered throwing up in a bathroom and his companion, Travis Dyson, 30, received CPR from paramedics in the room where the officers also found three bags of presumed crystal methamphetamine. No charges were filed and Gillum, who joined CNN as a political analyst after his election defeat, released a statement in which he said he had too much to drink at a wedding reception and thanked first responders. He asked for privacy, to spend time with his wife and three young children. Trump, however, was keen to not let the story fade away. Between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning the president promoted three tweets by the conservative commentators Candace Owens and Larry Elder, all mocking Gillum. In another tweet on Saturday, Trump, who engaged in a war of words with Gillum during the 2018 elections and branded him \u201ca stone cold thief\u201d for allegedly accepting free theater tickets, praised Owens as \u201cgreat\u201d. Owens was first to reveal the Gillum story in a series of tweets on Friday morning that contained information and assertions about the circumstances of the incident and the individuals involved that were not contained in the police report. According to that report, paramedics were called by a third man, named as Aldo Mejias, who provided the credit card Dyson used to book the room. Mejias told officers that when he arrived he saw Dyson collapsing on to the bed and saw Gillum vomiting in the bathroom. Dyson, 30, whose profile on a male escort website was deleted on Friday afternoon, was taken to Miami\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital in a stable condition, the report said. Officers \u201cattempted to speak to Mr Gillum [but] Mr Gillum was unable to communicate with officers due to his inebriated state\u201d. Later, the report said, \u201cGillum left the hotel room and returned to his residence without incident\u201d after a welfare check.

      "body": "<p><strong>Having a good</strong> mentor is important. I wasn\u2019t particularly driven to be an actor. I\u2019d tried lots of things out in college. I had a lot of interests; acting was just one of them. I\u2019m not sure I ever thought: \u201cI could do this,\u201d rather than: \u201cI like doing this and I\u2019d like to be able to do it.\u201d But I was lucky to have really good people showing me the way. I\u2019ve had a few help me, but meeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidlynch\" title=\"\">David Lynch</a> had a monumental impact on me.</p> <p><strong>Sometimes you</strong> have to accept you\u2019re just not good enough. My dream \u2013 my fantasy \u2013 was to be a professional golfer. I spent so much time playing golf with my dad. Very early I realised that it just wasn\u2019t going to happen. As soon as I started playing in tournaments against other people my age \u2013 and in some cases, younger \u2013 I realised I just couldn\u2019t cut it. When I decided to go all in on acting, I didn\u2019t really feel that.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t understand</strong> all of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/twin-peaks\" title=\"\">Twin Peaks</a></em>. The fans understand it much more than me! When you\u2019re being directed by David [Lynch] it\u2019s sometimes hard to follow everything he\u2019s trying to say. I\u2019m not sure how bothered David is about that. He really does allow his subconscious to move him through stories. I think he likes the actors he works with to do that, too. I think that\u2019s a big reason why his work is so interesting.</p> <p><strong>Dale Cooper</strong> is actually more David than me. There\u2019s a lot of me in him and he\u2019s absolutely my favourite character I\u2019ve played. I\u2019m a pretty positive person, I\u2019m good natured, I take great pleasure in simple things or moments, whether that\u2019s coffee or pie. But I added a lot of David\u2019s traits in playing him, whether that was vocalisations or particular phrases David says. Really, Dale Cooper is David, not me.</p> <p><strong>Actors have a pretty</strong> dark sense of humour.

      "bodyText": "Having a good mentor is important. I wasn\u2019t particularly driven to be an actor. I\u2019d tried lots of things out in college. I had a lot of interests; acting was just one of them. I\u2019m not sure I ever thought: \u201cI could do this,\u201d rather than: \u201cI like doing this and I\u2019d like to be able to do it.\u201d But I was lucky to have really good people showing me the way. I\u2019ve had a few help me, but meeting David Lynch had a monumental impact on me. Sometimes you have to accept you\u2019re just not good enough. My dream \u2013 my fantasy \u2013 was to be a professional golfer. I spent so much time playing golf with my dad. Very early I realised that it just wasn\u2019t going to happen. As soon as I started playing in tournaments against other people my age \u2013 and in some cases, younger \u2013 I realised I just couldn\u2019t cut it. When I decided to go all in on acting, I didn\u2019t really feel that. I don\u2019t understand all of Twin Peaks. The fans understand it much more than me! When you\u2019re being directed by David [Lynch] it\u2019s sometimes hard to follow everything he\u2019s trying to say. I\u2019m not sure how bothered David is about that. He really does allow his subconscious to move him through stories. I think he likes the actors he works with to do that, too. I think that\u2019s a big reason why his work is so interesting. Dale Cooper is actually more David than me. There\u2019s a lot of me in him and he\u2019s absolutely my favourite character I\u2019ve played. I\u2019m a pretty positive person, I\u2019m good natured, I take great pleasure in simple things or moments, whether that\u2019s coffee or pie. But I added a lot of David\u2019s traits in playing him, whether that was vocalisations or particular phrases David says. Really, Dale Cooper is David, not me. Actors have a pretty dark sense of humour. After we\u2019ve finished a job we\u2019ll all say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s it, I\u2019ll never work again,\u201d and everyone laughs. But I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever really worried about that. I\u2019ve found it more exhilarating than anything.

      "bodyText": "The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. Speaking after a seven-hour cabinet meeting on Saturday evening, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said \u201cextraordinary decisions\u201d needed to be taken as Spain grappled with a \u201chealth, social and economic crisis\u201d. Spain is the country most affected by the coronavirus in Europe after Italy, and has so far confirmed 6,251 cases and 193 deaths. Italy has already taken similar measures. S\u00e1nchez said the central government would direct the response and that all the local, national and regional police forces would come under the command of the interior ministry. He also said that the army was standing by and ready to help with the emergency response. The prime minister confirmed that people would be required to stay home and that all non-essential shops would close, along with bars, restaurants, cafes and cinemas. Supermarkets, small food shops, pharmacies, petrols stations and pet supply shops are among those businesses that will remain open. He said: \u201cDuring the state of emergency, people will only be allowed out on to public streets for the following reasons: to buy food, basic or pharmaceutical items; to attend medical centres; to go to and from work; to look after children, older people or those with disabilities or who are especially vulnerable; and to attend financial or insurance offices on force majeure grounds.\u201d S\u00e1nchez acknowledged that the measures needed to tackle the coronavirus would have a \u201cbig economic impact\u201d but said the government was committed to mitigating its effects. The emergency powers, set out in article 116 of the constitution, have not been used since 2010, when the article was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers\u2019 strike. The state of emergency will initially apply for a fortnight, but can be extended with parliamentary approval. Opponents have criticised S\u00e1nchez\u2019s socialist-led coalition government for its delay in rolling out robust measures to fight the virus and for allowing huge rallies across the country last Sunday to mark International Women\u2019s Day. As news of the decree leaked out on Saturday afternoon, the regional governments of Catalonia and the Basque country claimed the central government\u2019s use of the drastic powers could undermine their autonomy, while the Andaluc\u00edan premier accused S\u00e1nchez and his partners in the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance of squabbling when they should have been tackling the crisis. The prime minister addressed the criticisms in Saturday night\u2019s speech, in which he pointedly called on the leaders of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions to work together for the health and safety of all Spaniards. \u201cEach and every one of the regional presidents needs to put aside their differences, get behind the Spanish government and focus on our only mission \u2013 which is working together to beat the virus,\u201d he said. Schools and universities are already shut across Spain, and the measures contained in the emergency decree come after the regional governments of Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias had already ordered the closure of all non-essential shops. Bars, cafes, restaurants and cinemas in and around the capital closed on Saturday morning, while Madrid\u2019s city council announced that all public parks and gardens would close from Saturday afternoon to prevent large concentrations of people. Meanwhile, the Andaluc\u00edan cities of Seville, Granada and C\u00f3rdoba abandoned their famous Holy Week celebrations after consultation with religious authorities. The cancellation of the spectacular but sombre Holy Week parades, which draw huge crowds of foreign visitors, comes as tourist bookings plummet. Jet2, which flies from nine UK airports to destinations including Alicante, M\u00e1laga and Lanzarote, said it was cancelling all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands.",

The NEU\u2019s joint general secretaries, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, wrote: \u201cEvery day we are getting increasing numbers of questions from teachers and support staff asking why the Westminster government isn\u2019t following the pattern of other countries in calling for periods of school closure. \u201cThose questions are increasingly asking why schools aren\u2019t closing if mass gatherings are to be suspended. \u201cWe all want to limit and delay the spread of the coronavirus and we do think medical advice and expert scientific advice is important in this regard. \u201cBut it is clear that such advice can have uncertainties; and that it could be crafted to target a variety of measures.\u201d The letter goes on to propose that parents and schools could work together to find solutions to problems such as NHS staff shortages that would occur as school closures increase childcare needs. \u201cTeachers and other staff would work to help a broader societal response to mitigate the effects of the virus. We know this is especially important in a country where public services and the NHS in particular have been run down for so long,\u201d it says. The letter comes as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) urged the government to cancel Ofsted inspections immediately in light of the coronavirus outbreak. The ASCL\u2019s general secretary, Geoff Barton, asked the government to suspend all inspections with the exception of establishments with safeguarding concerns. The ASCL will meet the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to discuss the issue on Monday. Barton said: \u201cAt this time of national emergency, schools and colleges are devoting all of their time and all of their energies and all of their resources to keeping calm, to carrying on. \u201cThey are preparing contingency plans in the event of closures. This is not a time for business as usual. It\u2019s not a time for business as usual for Ofsted. \u201cWe acknowledge that Ofsted has taken a step in the right direction by accepting that the current situation may be a reason for an inspection to be deferred [but] it simply cannot be right that schools and colleges are judged in a high-stakes manner in these extraordinary circumstances at all.\u201d Barton\u2019s comments follow a tweet by Ofsted which said it was \u201coperating business as usual\u201d, but \u201cwould consider the challenges caused the outbreak. The watchdog then apologised when it was raised that in its updated guidance its deferral policy referred to whether inspectors would visit \u201cin the case of illness or death of the headteacher\u201d. Ofsted said the passage had been in the guidance since 2016, and had since been removed. Its corporate strategy director, Chris Jones, apologised for any distress caused and said that \u201cin situations like this, inspections aren\u2019t important\u201d. \u201cWe are working with the government on how we should react, advising them where necessary. Things are moving fast,\u201d he said. Closing schools for four weeks could cut 3% from the UK\u2019s GDP, according to government advisers.",

Studies of Chinese cases suggest that adults with high blood pressure are more at risk of dying from coronavirus than others. Again scientists find it difficult to find simple explanations. \u201cIt may be such individuals have other conditions that have not been recognised,\u201d says Tom Wingfield, a clinician at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cWe know that people with hypertension are more likely to be diabetic and have impaired kidneys, for example. That could be a factor but the honest answer is that we just do not know at present.\u201d Other puzzles about the impact of Covid-19 have simpler explanations, however. For example, there is its tendency to kill men more often than women. The infection is fatal for 4.7% of men, but just 2.8 % of women, even though the gender balance for those testing positive is roughly 50:50. Most experts say this is explained by the fact that in China smoking is primarily a male prerogative and this has weakened men\u2019s respiratory systems and made them more vulnerable to Covid-19.",

But as I make my way uptown, coronavirus\u2019s impact on small businesses becomes clear.</p> <p>At Thai Street Food, a food truck outside Trinity Church, co-owner Sony Ramirez, 35, from Queens, says business has dropped by 50% because many offices have closed. The truck\u2019s one waiting customer chimes in: \u201cNormally I see a line here. Today I\u2019m the only one.\u201d</p> <p>Ramirez adds: \u201cI\u2019m worried because I have to work. I need to take care of many people.\u201d</p> <p>Further up, there\u2019s a line of food trucks. It\u2019s 12.30pm but none have more than one customer. Sayed Sadat, 52, who works at a bagel and lunch truck, is packing away after a deathly quiet morning. A huge bin of uneaten bagels stands next to the truck.</p> <p>\u201cI came at 4.30am and nobody [came] until 6am. Business is no good. No business at all.\u201d</p> <p>Disaster also looms for the souvenir sellers. On a corner near Fulton Street, where shoals of tourists usually pass on the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, Tiger Diop, wearing a feathered \u201chappy new year\u201d headband, sits, his merchandise unbought.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make a living,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s suffering now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c79781d29a5b356de77dc2f2704ee12f4cfb5d69/0_58_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face masks on display at a souvenir stall in Times Square on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By city hall, a small group of climate protesters stand with a big \u201cFridays for Future\u201d flag. The street is so quiet that birdsong is audible from the gardens.</p> <p>As I reach the Tribeca neighbourhood, the sun comes out. It seems to bring more pedestrians. But John, 55, a souvenir seller dressed in a white surgical mask and a New York police department cap, says the street is considerably quieter than usual. He has started selling latex gloves and alcohol disinfectant but he says it\u2019s hand sanitizer people want \u2013 a commodity impossible to track down. A nearby convenience store has a sign in the window: \u201cMasks sold here.\u201d</p> <p>In Soho, Steff Bradley, 23, a graphic designer, and student Wilson Chiu, 25, are on their way to the bank. Bradley is wearing a mask. She says she felt short of breath this morning and is so anxious about coronavirus that she \u201chad a panic attack over a runny nose\u201d. As we speak, she reprimands Chiu, who says he is not concerned about the virus, for touching his face.</p> <p>I veer off Broadway for Chinatown, where Kong Wah Bakery\u2019s manager, Sam Chung, says business is down by 50% and staff are working half-days.</p> <p>Near New York University, which recently moved all classes online, I speak to a group of computer science students who agree the area has \u201cdefinitely got a different vibe\u201d.</p> <p>In Washington Square it becomes clear that just about everybody is talking about one thing: coronavirus. Disrupted travel arrangements, whether or not to go to a party, cleaning techniques, how much food they\u2019ve got stocked up.</p> <p>In Union Square, everything seems reassuringly normal \u2013 people are playing chess at tables, there\u2019s music, the farmers\u2019 market is on. But things take an apocalyptic turn when I spot a man in a full respirator mask and eye shield inspecting potatoes at a vegetable stand. The man, who doesn\u2019t want to be named, says he is in his 70s and on medication and fears for his health.</p> <p>\u201cThese are not normal times,\u201d he says, in muffled tones.</p> <p>At Madison Square Park it looks like everybody working from home has taken the opportunity to take their pet to the dog area and enjoy the sun. But the atmosphere is distinctly lacking in Friday buzz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6704454675cfd2054c5e431b0c787f707746421e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6704454675cfd2054c5e431b0c787f707746421e/0_247_7402_4441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People walk through Times Square on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk through Times Square on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik Pendzich/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At Times Square I\u2019m greeted by Elmo, Lady Liberty and Spiderman. Unusually, they don\u2019t seem to be able to entice anybody near them. Finally, a man walking into Walgreens agrees, elbow bumping Lady Liberty as Elmo takes a photo, before ambling back in to do his shopping. A solitary man dances to the soundtrack of his AirPods.</p> <p>On the steps, usually packed with tourists, there is plenty of breathing room. British tourists, Dan Hase, 33, and Claire Hase, 30, from Newcastle, are visiting New York for the first time. They are understandably disappointed. After arriving on Wednesday night, they went to see The Lion King only to find all Broadway performances had been cancelled and many of the attractions on the three-day pass they bought are closed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a letdown,\u201d says Dan.</p> <p>It is at West 44th street, where lots of theatres \u2013 including St James\u2019s, currently home to the Frozen musical, and the Shubert, showing To Kill A Mockingbird \u2013 that I find the most haunting scene of the day.</p> <p>The road is usually full of people queuing to get in, gathering during intervals, taxis dropping people off, red ropes for premieres. Now, it is almost completely empty.</p> <p>A few people are in the box offices, optimistically booking tickets for brighter times. But on the street it\u2019s so quiet that all I can hear is a plastic food container \u2013 New York tumbleweed \u2013 blowing down the street.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Running through Manhattan from the Battery to the Bronx, Broadway is New York City\u2019s lifeline. So in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and the raft of restrictive measures being implemented across the city and the state in an attempt to contain it \u2013 it seems like a good place to check the prevailing mood. It doesn\u2019t bode well when, on the 4 train down to Wall Street, a busker with a guitar performs a song featuring the words \u201ccoronavirus everywhere you turn\u201d. Other than that, and the presence of a few face masks and latex gloves, everything appears relatively normal. Above ground, it\u2019s grey and mild. While it\u2019s not heaving, New York is definitely not a ghost town. There are people milling around and tourists lining up as usual to take selfies with the Charging Bull, the bronze sculpture which sums up the spirit of nearby Wall Street. The first person I encounter is Tim Lamch, 38, who with a huge bag on his back and pushing a fully loaded drinks trolley, makes a surreal sight. Is this coronavirus related? \u201cI just happen to be moving during coronavirus,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m only moving two blocks.\u201d The account executive, currently working from home because of the virus, says it\u2019s busier than he had anticipated. \u201cPeople need to be out. People don\u2019t want to be cooped up and people still have to work. Not everyone can work from home.\u201d At the bull, tourist Liliana Oropeza, 44, is lining up with her husband and 10-year-old son. The family, from Monterrey, Mexico, are trying to make the best of the situation but so far, she says, their holiday has been \u201cawful\u201d. \u201cWe bought tickets and can\u2019t use them because the museums are closed. We are trying to move our flight home to maybe Monday.\u201d On the streets, people are more polite than usual \u2013 apologising if they bump into each other, avoiding physical contact. A steady trickle of people are coming out of the New York Stock Exchange, to go get their lunch. But as I make my way uptown, coronavirus\u2019s impact on small businesses becomes clear. At Thai Street Food, a food truck outside Trinity Church, co-owner Sony Ramirez, 35, from Queens, says business has dropped by 50% because many offices have closed. The truck\u2019s one waiting customer chimes in: \u201cNormally I see a line here. Today I\u2019m the only one.\u201d Ramirez adds: \u201cI\u2019m worried because I have to work. I need to take care of many people.\u201d Further up, there\u2019s a line of food trucks. It\u2019s 12.30pm but none have more than one customer. Sayed Sadat, 52, who works at a bagel and lunch truck, is packing away after a deathly quiet morning. A huge bin of uneaten bagels stands next to the truck. \u201cI came at 4.30am and nobody [came] until 6am. Business is no good. No business at all.\u201d Disaster also looms for the souvenir sellers. On a corner near Fulton Street, where shoals of tourists usually pass on the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, Tiger Diop, wearing a feathered \u201chappy new year\u201d headband, sits, his merchandise unbought. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to make a living,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s suffering now.\u201d By city hall, a small group of climate protesters stand with a big \u201cFridays for Future\u201d flag. The street is so quiet that birdsong is audible from the gardens. As I reach the Tribeca neighbourhood, the sun comes out. It seems to bring more pedestrians. But John, 55, a souvenir seller dressed in a white surgical mask and a New York police department cap, says the street is considerably quieter than usual. He has started selling latex gloves and alcohol disinfectant but he says it\u2019s hand sanitizer people want \u2013 a commodity impossible to track down. A nearby convenience store has a sign in the window: \u201cMasks sold here.\u201d In Soho, Steff Bradley, 23, a graphic designer, and student Wilson Chiu, 25, are on their way to the bank. Bradley is wearing a mask. She says she felt short of breath this morning and is so anxious about coronavirus that she \u201chad a panic attack over a runny nose\u201d. As we speak, she reprimands Chiu, who says he is not concerned about the virus, for touching his face. I veer off Broadway for Chinatown, where Kong Wah Bakery\u2019s manager, Sam Chung, says business is down by 50% and staff are working half-days. Near New York University, which recently moved all classes online, I speak to a group of computer science students who agree the area has \u201cdefinitely got a different vibe\u201d. In Washington Square it becomes clear that just about everybody is talking about one thing: coronavirus. Disrupted travel arrangements, whether or not to go to a party, cleaning techniques, how much food they\u2019ve got stocked up. In Union Square, everything seems reassuringly normal \u2013 people are playing chess at tables, there\u2019s music, the farmers\u2019 market is on. But things take an apocalyptic turn when I spot a man in a full respirator mask and eye shield inspecting potatoes at a vegetable stand. The man, who doesn\u2019t want to be named, says he is in his 70s and on medication and fears for his health. \u201cThese are not normal times,\u201d he says, in muffled tones. At Madison Square Park it looks like everybody working from home has taken the opportunity to take their pet to the dog area and enjoy the sun. But the atmosphere is distinctly lacking in Friday buzz. At Times Square I\u2019m greeted by Elmo, Lady Liberty and Spiderman. Unusually, they don\u2019t seem to be able to entice anybody near them. Finally, a man walking into Walgreens agrees, elbow bumping Lady Liberty as Elmo takes a photo, before ambling back in to do his shopping. A solitary man dances to the soundtrack of his AirPods. On the steps, usually packed with tourists, there is plenty of breathing room. British tourists, Dan Hase, 33, and Claire Hase, 30, from Newcastle, are visiting New York for the first time. They are understandably disappointed. After arriving on Wednesday night, they went to see The Lion King only to find all Broadway performances had been cancelled and many of the attractions on the three-day pass they bought are closed. \u201cIt was a bit of a letdown,\u201d says Dan. It is at West 44th street, where lots of theatres \u2013 including St James\u2019s, currently home to the Frozen musical, and the Shubert, showing To Kill A Mockingbird \u2013 that I find the most haunting scene of the day. The road is usually full of people queuing to get in, gathering during intervals, taxis dropping people off, red ropes for premieres. Now, it is almost completely empty. A few people are in the box offices, optimistically booking tickets for brighter times. But on the street it\u2019s so quiet that all I can hear is a plastic food container \u2013 New York tumbleweed \u2013 blowing down the street.",

And for the acclaimed British Wagnerian soprano, Catherine Foster, there is no doubt where her understanding of these central human experiences stems from. The singer, who returns to Britain this spring to perform for the first time after a successful career in Germany, will be drawing heavily on her time as a nurse and midwife in her native Nottingham.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all a collection of our experiences,\u201d she said this weekend, before a performance of Richard Strauss\u2019s expressionist opera <em>Elektra</em> with the Bournemouth Symphony under conductor Kiril Karabits. \u201cAnd so, of course, working on the wards affected me.\u201d</p> <p>A sense of both the tragedy and elation of life were just part of daily work, Foster recalled: \u201cI know there is both evil and beauty in the world. You can be looking after a woman who is facing a loss in one room, while in another you are caring for another who is happily having her first child. That has helped me to separate my emotions. I had to be ready to face both of them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had never sung Wagner, but I found it was like butter on the voice</p> <footer> <cite>Catherine Foster</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Foster will perform the lead role of Elektra in Poole and at Birmingham\u2019s Symphony Hall this week. To play the obsessive character, based on Greek myth, she will draw on the behaviour of patients suffering from mental health issues. She said: \u201cI have based my Elektra on three patients I remember. She is a manipulator really, because she cannot move on. She is stuck at the moment of her father\u2019s death. And in fact we know that the opera\u2019s librettist, Hugo von Hoffmanstahl, visited psychiatric wards to witness patients before he wrote his characters.\u201d</p> <p>As a young child in Nottingham, Foster said that, like the Abba song, she \u201ccould sing long before I could talk\u201d. But she also wanted to be a nurse. After training as a midwife, her path into operatic theatre opened up to her one day as she looked after a mother-to-be in labour.</p> <p>\u201cHer husband was the head of the local amateur dramatic society and he gave me the names of two singing coaches. That eventually led me to Pamela Cook, who changed everything for me.\u201d</p> <p>The Birmingham Conservatoire coach helped shape a career for Foster. \u201cThere was a lot wrong with my voice when I went to her. I had to undo the techniques I had learned.\u201d</p> <p>But when she finished at the conservatoire, British roles proved hard for the newcomer to win: \u201cI applied, but there was only ever one position for a Donna Anna[in Don Giovanni] or for a Mimi[La Boheme]. Then through Pam I heard about the German Fest system.\u201d</p> <p>By cultural convention each major German city has a fully staffed theatre, with an orchestra and ballet dancers as well as singers, Foster explained: \u201cI knew I needed experience and you can\u2019t get better experience than in Germany because they are singing all the time there. I prepared four arias and wrote 100 letters.\u201d</p> <p>She was eventually taken on by an agent, which led to a job in the city of Weimar. \u201cPeople said, \u2018But you don\u2019t speak German!\u2019 and I said \u2018So?\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cAnd luckily, because Weimar had been in East Germany, no one spoke much English, so I had to learn quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Foster moved out to Weimar within months of marrying her composer husband, who was working in England. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford the expensive phone calls. He did come out for our wedding anniversary in August 2001 and then I didnt see him until Christmas.\u201d</p> <p>Trained to sing colaratura soprano, like the late Australian singer Joan Sutherland, the switch to the German repertoire was a pleasant surprise. \u201cI had never sung Wagner, but I found it was like butter on the voice.\u201d</p> <p>Foster\u2019s talent soon took her to the heart of dramatic opera, the <a href=\"https://www.bayreuther-festspiele.de/en/\" title=\"\">Bayreuth festival</a>, where she played Wagner\u2019s heroine Br\u00fcnnhilde for six consecutive years to standing ovations. Since then she has sung around the world.</p> <p>\u201cI have come from a nursing profession that expected 110% giving, to a profession that expects 110% taking. The only way I have been able to bridge that great gap is by telling myself that singing is at least expressing and sharing emotions,\u201d said Foster, who was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire six years ago. In 2018 she was also given the London Wagner Society\u2019s Reginald Goodall award.</p> <p>Foster\u2019s triumphant return to Britain this month inevitably reminds her of the fateful moment she once walked up a hospital corridor with a resignation letter in her hand. \u201cAt first I walked away, thinking I couldn\u2019t give up a regular job. Then I told myself I did not want to be a could-have-been and so I went back and pushed it under the door.\u201d</p>",

To play the obsessive character, based on Greek myth, she will draw on the behaviour of patients suffering from mental health issues. She said: \u201cI have based my Elektra on three patients I remember. She is a manipulator really, because she cannot move on. She is stuck at the moment of her father\u2019s death. And in fact we know that the opera\u2019s librettist, Hugo von Hoffmanstahl, visited psychiatric wards to witness patients before he wrote his characters.\u201d As a young child in Nottingham, Foster said that, like the Abba song, she \u201ccould sing long before I could talk\u201d. But she also wanted to be a nurse. After training as a midwife, her path into operatic theatre opened up to her one day as she looked after a mother-to-be in labour. \u201cHer husband was the head of the local amateur dramatic society and he gave me the names of two singing coaches. That eventually led me to Pamela Cook, who changed everything for me.\u201d The Birmingham Conservatoire coach helped shape a career for Foster. \u201cThere was a lot wrong with my voice when I went to her. I had to undo the techniques I had learned.\u201d But when she finished at the conservatoire, British roles proved hard for the newcomer to win: \u201cI applied, but there was only ever one position for a Donna Anna[in Don Giovanni] or for a Mimi[La Boheme]. Then through Pam I heard about the German Fest system.\u201d By cultural convention each major German city has a fully staffed theatre, with an orchestra and ballet dancers as well as singers, Foster explained: \u201cI knew I needed experience and you can\u2019t get better experience than in Germany because they are singing all the time there. I prepared four arias and wrote 100 letters.\u201d She was eventually taken on by an agent, which led to a job in the city of Weimar. \u201cPeople said, \u2018But you don\u2019t speak German!\u2019 and I said \u2018So?\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cAnd luckily, because Weimar had been in East Germany, no one spoke much English, so I had to learn quickly.\u201d Foster moved out to Weimar within months of marrying her composer husband, who was working in England. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford the expensive phone calls. He did come out for our wedding anniversary in August 2001 and then I didnt see him until Christmas.\u201d Trained to sing colaratura soprano, like the late Australian singer Joan Sutherland, the switch to the German repertoire was a pleasant surprise. \u201cI had never sung Wagner, but I found it was like butter on the voice.\u201d Foster\u2019s talent soon took her to the heart of dramatic opera, the Bayreuth festival, where she played Wagner\u2019s heroine Br\u00fcnnhilde for six consecutive years to standing ovations. Since then she has sung around the world. \u201cI have come from a nursing profession that expected 110% giving, to a profession that expects 110% taking. The only way I have been able to bridge that great gap is by telling myself that singing is at least expressing and sharing emotions,\u201d said Foster, who was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire six years ago. In 2018 she was also given the London Wagner Society\u2019s Reginald Goodall award. Foster\u2019s triumphant return to Britain this month inevitably reminds her of the fateful moment she once walked up a hospital corridor with a resignation letter in her hand. \u201cAt first I walked away, thinking I couldn\u2019t give up a regular job. Then I told myself I did not want to be a could-have-been and so I went back and pushed it under the door.\u201d",

Tour operators are seeing a \u201chuge decline in new bookings over the past couple of weeks\u201d, according to David Hope of GfK, which monitors package holiday sales. By Friday afternoon most attractions in the UK were following government guidance to stay open, with hundreds of Easter egg hunts planned. The National Trust is pressing ahead with Cadbury egg hunts at its heritage landmarks and Historic Royal Palaces still hopes families will come to Hampton Court and Kensington Palace to find Lindt bunnies. A few organisations, such as GoFest, which organises Easter active children\u2019s camps, have warned that if the government decides to ban small gatherings then they may be forced to cancel. Eventbrite was showing nearly 2,000 Easter activities available across the UK on Friday, and so far only a handful of organisers have postponed events in April. The Church of England is still keen to celebrate Easter and will be issuing guidance \u201cin due course\u201d but it has already warned clergy not to wash people\u2019s feet, a ritual often performed on Maundy Thursday, or allow people to kiss the cross as part of Good Friday rituals performed in some churches. Hilary Trahair, events manager at the Association for Project Management, said there were ways for people to plan ahead, in spite of the uncertainty. \u201cPeople should look ahead and think about different scenarios,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat impact could they have and how likely are they to happen.\u201d The next step is to look at the risks \u2013 such as risks to health or finance. \u201cAnd then work out, based on the impacts that would have, what would your decision be? \u201cSo when you get to the crunch point, you\u2019ve already made the decision \u2013 you really don\u2019t have to think about it. And you can focus on putting your action plan in place.\u201d",

But where there\u2019s a crisis, there\u2019s also a marketing opportunity. On Thursday Pornhub <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/13/pornhub-offers-free-premium-service-in-italy-to-ease-coronavirus-pains/\">announced</a> that it is giving everyone in Italy free access to its premium service for the rest of the month. The world\u2019s biggest porn site also said it will donate its March proceeds from Modelhub, one of its adult marketplaces, \u201cto support Italy during this unfortunate time\u201d.</p> <p>Pornhub\u2019s philanthropic division (yes, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/10/pornography-save-the-whales-sex-industry-philanthropist-conservation\">has one</a>) is good at pulling headline-grabbing stunts. It launched a <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/pornhub-bee-movie-aqua-conservation.html\">BeeSexual channel</a> to benefit honeybee conservation efforts; it ran a tree-planting scheme called Pornhub Gives America Wood; it tried to clean up plastic-filled beaches with a campaign called <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/45764/1/pornhub-wants-to-save-the-oceans-with-its-dirtiest-porn-ever-campaign\">Dirtiest Porn Ever</a>.</p> <p>While Pornhub has clearly given a lot of thought to smutty pun-based philanthropy, it doesn\u2019t seem to have put quite as much effort into ensuring its own business practices are ethical. The site is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/worlds-biggest-porn-site-under-fire-over-videos-pornhub\">currently facing serious allegations</a> of profiting from videos of rape and sexual abuse. Almost half a million people have signed <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/shut-down-pornhub-and-hold-its-executives-accountable-for-aiding-trafficking\">an online petition</a>, started by a group called Exodus Cry in the US, demanding that Pornhub be shut down and its executives held accountable for sex trafficking.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a company that is generating millions in advertising and membership revenue and yet they do not have an effective system in place to verify reliably the age or consent of those featured in the pornographic content it hosts,\u201d the Exodus Cry founder said.</p> <p>Pornhub vehemently disagrees. In a recent statement to the Guardian, the company said it \u201chas a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate\u201d.</p> <p>There have been rather a lot of suggestions otherwise. Kate Isaacs, the founder of Not Your Porn campaign, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/09/pornhub-needs-to-change-or-shut-down\">recently wrote a Guardian op-ed</a> detailing how she\u2019d worked with \u201c50 women who were turned into \u2018porn stars\u2019 without their permission\u201d. Isaacs notes that some of these women were under 18 \u201cwhen videos of them were posted on Pornhub without their consent\u201d. It took Pornhub weeks to get a video of one of Isaacs\u2019 friends removed; \u201cWhen one video had been removed, an identical video with her full name attached would pop back up again.\u201d</p> <p>Pornhub claims that it is simple for victims of non-consensual porn to request that videos be removed from its website; flagged videos are then \u201cfingerprinted\u201d to prevent future uploads. A <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9393zp/how-pornhub-moderation-works-girls-do-porn\">recent investigation by Motherboard</a> (part of Vice), however, found that this system can be easily circumvented. The investigation notes that Pornhub\u2019s current method for removing non-consensual porn \u201cnot only puts the onus of finding and flagging videos almost entirely on potentially-traumatized victims \u2013 those victims can\u2019t even rely on the system to work\u201d.</p> <p>While Pornhub may argue it has a \u201csteadfast commitment\u201d to eradicating non-consensual content, there\u2019s clearly a lot of room for it to do better. Instead of trying to take on the coronavirus, it would do well to focus on its own pandemic of revenge porn.</p> <h2>\u2018The web is not working for women and girls\u2019</h2> <p>The inventor of the world wide web has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/12/internet-not-working-women-girls-tim-berners-lee\">urged companies and governments to tackle misogynistic online abuse</a>.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Italy is facing a shortage of pasta \u2013 and a surplus of porn. More than 60 million people are currently under lockdown in Italy, which is dealing with Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of Covid-19. But where there\u2019s a crisis, there\u2019s also a marketing opportunity. On Thursday Pornhub announced that it is giving everyone in Italy free access to its premium service for the rest of the month. The world\u2019s biggest porn site also said it will donate its March proceeds from Modelhub, one of its adult marketplaces, \u201cto support Italy during this unfortunate time\u201d. Pornhub\u2019s philanthropic division (yes, it has one) is good at pulling headline-grabbing stunts. It launched a BeeSexual channel to benefit honeybee conservation efforts; it ran a tree-planting scheme called Pornhub Gives America Wood; it tried to clean up plastic-filled beaches with a campaign called Dirtiest Porn Ever. While Pornhub has clearly given a lot of thought to smutty pun-based philanthropy, it doesn\u2019t seem to have put quite as much effort into ensuring its own business practices are ethical. The site is currently facing serious allegations of profiting from videos of rape and sexual abuse. Almost half a million people have signed an online petition, started by a group called Exodus Cry in the US, demanding that Pornhub be shut down and its executives held accountable for sex trafficking. \u201cThis is a company that is generating millions in advertising and membership revenue and yet they do not have an effective system in place to verify reliably the age or consent of those featured in the pornographic content it hosts,\u201d the Exodus Cry founder said. Pornhub vehemently disagrees. In a recent statement to the Guardian, the company said it \u201chas a steadfast commitment to eradicating and fighting non-consensual content and under-age material. Any suggestion otherwise is categorically and factually inaccurate\u201d. There have been rather a lot of suggestions otherwise. Kate Isaacs, the founder of Not Your Porn campaign, recently wrote a Guardian op-ed detailing how she\u2019d worked with \u201c50 women who were turned into \u2018porn stars\u2019 without their permission\u201d. Isaacs notes that some of these women were under 18 \u201cwhen videos of them were posted on Pornhub without their consent\u201d. It took Pornhub weeks to get a video of one of Isaacs\u2019 friends removed; \u201cWhen one video had been removed, an identical video with her full name attached would pop back up again.\u201d Pornhub claims that it is simple for victims of non-consensual porn to request that videos be removed from its website; flagged videos are then \u201cfingerprinted\u201d to prevent future uploads. A recent investigation by Motherboard (part of Vice), however, found that this system can be easily circumvented. The investigation notes that Pornhub\u2019s current method for removing non-consensual porn \u201cnot only puts the onus of finding and flagging videos almost entirely on potentially-traumatized victims \u2013 those victims can\u2019t even rely on the system to work\u201d. While Pornhub may argue it has a \u201csteadfast commitment\u201d to eradicating non-consensual content, there\u2019s clearly a lot of room for it to do better. Instead of trying to take on the coronavirus, it would do well to focus on its own pandemic of revenge porn. \u2018The web is not working for women and girls\u2019 The inventor of the world wide web has urged companies and governments to tackle misogynistic online abuse. Berners-Lee said the \u201conline harms facing women and girls\u201d, particularly those from marginalized groups, was causing them to skip school, silencing female opinions and damaging relationships. Coronavirus is causing an outbreak of domestic violence in China A combination of people spending more time indoors together and police attention being diverted to coronavirus-related issues has caused a spike in domestic violence in China. The hashtag #AntiDomesticViolenceDuringEpidemic (#\u75ab\u671f\u53cd\u5bb6\u66b4) has been used more than 3,000 times on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media platform and calls to women\u2019s rights organizations have tripled, according to the BBC. Thousands of Mexican women strike A total of 1,006 women were victims of femicide in Mexico last year; 580 more than in 2015. On Monday women across the country joined a historic strike to protest against the government\u2019s failure to combat violence against women. Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years The convicted rapist doesn\u2019t seem to understand he did anything wrong. \u201cI\u2019m totally confused,\u201d Weinstein said at his sentencing. \u201cI think men are confused about these issues.\u201d I guess he has time to think about it now. Converse launching a gender-neutral clothes line It\u2019s called Converse Shapes and the clothes are designed for body types rather than gender. Women are (horse)racing ahead Last year female jockeys outperformed their male counterparts. US Soccer Federation president resigns after misogyny row Women just aren\u2019t as good as men, according to court filings by the US Soccer Federation in an ongoing gender discrimination lawsuit. On Thursday, Carlos Cordeiro, the federation\u2019s president, resigned following a backlash from fans, players and sponsors over the misogynistic filings. Former USWNT midfielder Cindy Parlow Cone will become the first female president in the history of the federation. \u2018Setting my Tinder to Wuhan so I can get the real scoop on what\u2019s going on\u2019 Tinder has become a coronavirus news service. As the virus spreads around the world, dating app users are setting their location to Wuhan to learn more about life in the initial focus of the epidemic. Sarah Palin raps Baby Got Back dressed as a furry bear Quite a few jaws dropped on Thursday when the former Republican governor appeared in a purple and pink bear costume on TV show The Masked Singer.

      "bodyText": "Few figures in Formula One emerged with any great credit as the season opener fell apart in Melbourne. Coronavirus, as had seemed inevitable, simply proved an implacable force against which the sport\u2019s attempt to pretend it was business as usual was left looking impotent and foolhardy. Throughout the process the major players had all been toeing the party line, but one had the backbone to articulate what many were thinking. Step forward Lewis Hamilton, an honourable and honest voice inside the delusion of F1\u2019s bubble. Melbourne is ordinarily a celebratory place to kick off a new season. The atmosphere is superb as the city embraces teams, media and fans. The sheer pleasure felt in returning to racing after the close season is palpable. This time, it was altogether different. At best subdued, at worst there was a sense of foreboding. It was two-fold. There was disquiet that with the paddock such a tightly knit community \u2013 hundreds of people working in close proximity \u2013 should, as seemed plausible, the virus have travelled with them it could spread exponentially. Of greater concern, though, was the fear F1 would have brought the infection from Europe and that, at an event attracting up to 100,000 people a day, the sport would be responsible for giving the virus a real grip in Melbourne and Australia. The idea of an explosion of cases in the city in the weeks following the sport\u2019s departure was frequently discussed but not by the principal protagonists of F1.

The immediate risk may have been minimal since there have been three confirmed cases in Sri Lanka, though that risk may have escalated with the arrival of 3,000 English fans, heading for Galle for the first Test, which was scheduled to start on Thursday.</p> <p>Root was refreshingly candid with PA Media news agency before his flight back to the UK. \u201cThere was an element of relief,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right decision has been made. You could see looking at the players that their minds were elsewhere thinking about people back home. Now that we can go and look after families and be with loved ones that\u2019s put a lot of guys at ease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\">England cricket tour of Sri Lanka called off due to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNaturally there was a lot of talk in the dressing room and it got to a stage where it overshadowed the cricket. Looking at how quickly things have happened at home, you\u2019re thinking about family and friends who might be a bit more vulnerable and that\u2019s hard when you\u2019re a long way away. It was clear it was getting in the way of performance and affecting the mental wellbeing of the guys.\u201d</p> <p>There were also concerns within the squad about the implications of testing positive and the subsequent necessity of being put into quarantine away from the team environment. The idea of being stranded a long way from home is currently unappealing to all travellers and England cricketers were no exception.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a number of different scenarios we could have found ourselves in that were pretty scary to be honest,\u201d Root said. \u201cYou think how things might have gone \u2013 being in isolation here, disconnected from the team, without the security we would usually have around us at the ground or the hotel. If one of the lads was to get it in these conditions, or a member of the public travelling, it could be quite a scary experience.\u201d</p> <p>So the team heads home after a bizarre few months. In South Africa, the squad was hindered by a virulent bug at the start of the tour but in the end they prevailed. But there was no way this virus could be defeated.</p> <p>Root has no better idea than anyone else when the team will reconvene. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll play again. I suppose you can\u2019t have mass gatherings so there won\u2019t be many training camps. I\u2019m sure over the coming weeks we\u2019ll prepare and do everything we can to be as ready as possible but until we know more it\u2019s just a case of common sense. Look after yourself, condition well and be ready to start.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Joe Root has outlined how the decision to abandon England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka was driven more by the unsettling effect of the coronavirus pandemic on his squad than the advice of the experts. As sporting events around the globe were cancelled in swift succession on Friday, cricket fell into line to the relief of the England players. The immediate risk may have been minimal since there have been three confirmed cases in Sri Lanka, though that risk may have escalated with the arrival of 3,000 English fans, heading for Galle for the first Test, which was scheduled to start on Thursday. Root was refreshingly candid with PA Media news agency before his flight back to the UK. \u201cThere was an element of relief,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right decision has been made. You could see looking at the players that their minds were elsewhere thinking about people back home. Now that we can go and look after families and be with loved ones that\u2019s put a lot of guys at ease. \u201cNaturally there was a lot of talk in the dressing room and it got to a stage where it overshadowed the cricket. Looking at how quickly things have happened at home, you\u2019re thinking about family and friends who might be a bit more vulnerable and that\u2019s hard when you\u2019re a long way away. It was clear it was getting in the way of performance and affecting the mental wellbeing of the guys.\u201d There were also concerns within the squad about the implications of testing positive and the subsequent necessity of being put into quarantine away from the team environment. The idea of being stranded a long way from home is currently unappealing to all travellers and England cricketers were no exception. \u201cThere were a number of different scenarios we could have found ourselves in that were pretty scary to be honest,\u201d Root said. \u201cYou think how things might have gone \u2013 being in isolation here, disconnected from the team, without the security we would usually have around us at the ground or the hotel. If one of the lads was to get it in these conditions, or a member of the public travelling, it could be quite a scary experience.\u201d So the team heads home after a bizarre few months. In South Africa, the squad was hindered by a virulent bug at the start of the tour but in the end they prevailed. But there was no way this virus could be defeated. Root has no better idea than anyone else when the team will reconvene. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll play again. I suppose you can\u2019t have mass gatherings so there won\u2019t be many training camps. I\u2019m sure over the coming weeks we\u2019ll prepare and do everything we can to be as ready as possible but until we know more it\u2019s just a case of common sense. Look after yourself, condition well and be ready to start.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Two very different approaches to Handel found their way on to London stages last week; one sure-footed and graceful, the other awkward and graceless, but each offering brilliant vocal showcases for several countertenors to peacock their prodigious talents, and both displaying just how blessed we are for top-class period instrumentalists.</p> <p>The ever-admirable <a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/\" title=\"\">English Touring Opera</a> is off around England again, celebrating its <a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/\" title=\"\">40th</a> anniversary with a spring season encompassing Handel\u2019s <strong><a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/giulio-cesare-2020\" title=\"\">Giulio Cesare</a></strong>, Bach\u2019s <a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/st-john-passion-2020\" title=\"\">St John Passion</a> and Mozart\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/cosi-fan-tutte-2020\" title=\"\">Cos\u00ec fan tutte</a></em>. Director <a href=\"http://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/giulio-cesare-2020\" title=\"\">James Conway</a>\u2019s<em> Cesare</em> is an entirely successful reworking of his 2017 production, which had spread the opera (it\u2019s very long) over two nights. Sensitive editing has brought it down to one evening, heightening the drama and giving it a welcome, though at times almost breathless, drive.</p> <p>Giulio Cesare has defeated Pompey in his campaign to capture Egypt, but the scheming King Tolomeo dishonours his victory by presenting him with Pompey\u2019s severed head. Pompey\u2019s widow, Cordelia, and son, Sesto, vow to avenge his death, while Cleopatra, Tolomeo\u2019s sister, sees her chance to side with Cesare and grasp Tolomeo\u2019s crown.</p> <p>Handel takes this seething, treacherous snake pit and gives each character demanding, rapid-fire arias of anger, anguish and turmoil. Outstanding talent is required, and ETO responds with an exceptional cast, including three classy countertenors. Clint van der Linde makes an implacable Cesare, singing with noble grace, dispatching high-wire arias with ease; Paul-Antoine B\u00e9nos-Djian, as Tolomeo, has more character in his voice, but also more licence to use it \u2013 his Tolomeo is a crazy, double-dealing, vicious tyrant in a silly wig \u2013 while sweet-voiced Alexander Simpson, as Nerino, guides Cordelia and Sesto, magnificently sung by mezzos Ann Taylor and <a href=\"https://www.kittywhately.com/\" title=\"\">Kitty Whately</a>, to take their revenge.</p> <p>Outshining even these big hitters is soprano <a href=\"https://www.intermusica.co.uk/artist/Susanna-Hurrell\" title=\"\">Susanna Hurrell</a>, simultaneously coquettish, petulant and radiant as Cleopatra, who wins the audience\u2019s heart as surely as she wins Cesare\u2019s. And dynamic, cohesive and intelligent conducting from Jonathan Peter Kenny draws some superb, drily acerbic playing from the period instrument Old Street Band. The action \u2013 neatly transferred to Handel\u2019s time, all frock coats and mantuas \u2013 takes place within Oliver Townsend\u2019s admirably sparse set, with Mark Howland\u2019s subtle lighting making it glow with the shimmer of old gold. <em>Giulio Cesar</em>e is on the road all spring. It\u2019s a hit.

This co-production with the Royal Opera showcased current Jette Parker Young Artists, and sought to bring the ancient tale of Susanna and her mistreatment at the hands of so-called Elders into a modern #MeToo focus. It\u2019s a timely idea, but one marred by Grace Smart\u2019s cluttered and awkward design and Isabelle Kettle\u2019s fussy and at times clumsy direction.</p> <p>Susanna, warmly sung by soprano <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha</a>, lives in an impoverished Cornish fishing village caught in an environmental catastrophe, where the daily catch is more likely to be floating plastic than fish. Her tumbledown cottage sits centre-stage, getting in everyone\u2019s way. At one point the entire cast is made to squeeze into her tiny kitchen, as into a telephone box; at another she hops up on the draining board to sing. The chorus has to enter single-file, or clamber over the rocks behind. None of this does much service to one of Handel\u2019s most brilliantly subtle scores.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31c30bdf3b490b0591819f7c432236364d382034\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31c30bdf3b490b0591819f7c432236364d382034/0_307_4341_2606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha (Susanna) and Patrick Terry (Joacim) in Susanna at the Linbury theatre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha (Susanna) and Patrick Terry (Joacim) in Susanna at the Linbury theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Left alone to bathe, Susanna is taunted and sexually abused by lusting old village men who then outrageously accuse her of adultery, a charge too eagerly believed by a chorus of weary fisherfolk, in a parallel with Britten\u2019s <em>Peter Grimes</em>. It\u2019s not until we get to Act 3, and the clutter is swept away, that the production settles down and properly responds to the music, matching the dignity with which Susanna rebuffs her vile tormentors.</p> <p>The fast-rising countertenor <a href=\"https://jamesblackmanagement.com/artists/patrick-terry/\" title=\"\">Patrick Terry</a> sings Susanna\u2019s husband, Joacim, with an easy grace, his mellifluous voice flexible and consistent throughout its range. <a href=\"https://www.michaelmofidian.com/\" title=\"\">Michael Mofidian</a>, as Susanna\u2019s father, Chelsias, and <a href=\"https://musicint.co.uk/opera-performer/blaise-malaba/\" title=\"\">Blaise Malaba,</a> as one of the seedy Elders, both impress in their weighty bass roles. Soprano <a href=\"https://www.hazardchase.co.uk/artists/yaritza-veliz/\" title=\"\">Yaritza V\u00e9liz</a>, as Daniel, sings with aching beauty, yet renders the English text almost unintelligible.

      "bodyText": "Two very different approaches to Handel found their way on to London stages last week; one sure-footed and graceful, the other awkward and graceless, but each offering brilliant vocal showcases for several countertenors to peacock their prodigious talents, and both displaying just how blessed we are for top-class period instrumentalists. The ever-admirable English Touring Opera is off around England again, celebrating its 40th anniversary with a spring season encompassing Handel\u2019s Giulio Cesare, Bach\u2019s St John Passion and Mozart\u2019s Cos\u00ec fan tutte. Director James Conway\u2019s Cesare is an entirely successful reworking of his 2017 production, which had spread the opera (it\u2019s very long) over two nights. Sensitive editing has brought it down to one evening, heightening the drama and giving it a welcome, though at times almost breathless, drive. Giulio Cesare has defeated Pompey in his campaign to capture Egypt, but the scheming King Tolomeo dishonours his victory by presenting him with Pompey\u2019s severed head. Pompey\u2019s widow, Cordelia, and son, Sesto, vow to avenge his death, while Cleopatra, Tolomeo\u2019s sister, sees her chance to side with Cesare and grasp Tolomeo\u2019s crown. Handel takes this seething, treacherous snake pit and gives each character demanding, rapid-fire arias of anger, anguish and turmoil. Outstanding talent is required, and ETO responds with an exceptional cast, including three classy countertenors. Clint van der Linde makes an implacable Cesare, singing with noble grace, dispatching high-wire arias with ease; Paul-Antoine B\u00e9nos-Djian, as Tolomeo, has more character in his voice, but also more licence to use it \u2013 his Tolomeo is a crazy, double-dealing, vicious tyrant in a silly wig \u2013 while sweet-voiced Alexander Simpson, as Nerino, guides Cordelia and Sesto, magnificently sung by mezzos Ann Taylor and Kitty Whately, to take their revenge. Outshining even these big hitters is soprano Susanna Hurrell, simultaneously coquettish, petulant and radiant as Cleopatra, who wins the audience\u2019s heart as surely as she wins Cesare\u2019s. And dynamic, cohesive and intelligent conducting from Jonathan Peter Kenny draws some superb, drily acerbic playing from the period instrument Old Street Band. The action \u2013 neatly transferred to Handel\u2019s time, all frock coats and mantuas \u2013 takes place within Oliver Townsend\u2019s admirably sparse set, with Mark Howland\u2019s subtle lighting making it glow with the shimmer of old gold. Giulio Cesare is on the road all spring. It\u2019s a hit. Don\u2019t miss it. There was more incisive period instrument playing last week from the London Handel Orchestra, in the pit at the Linbury theatre, Covent Garden, for Handel\u2019s oratorio Susanna, staged as an opera to launch this year\u2019s five-week London Handel festival. This co-production with the Royal Opera showcased current Jette Parker Young Artists, and sought to bring the ancient tale of Susanna and her mistreatment at the hands of so-called Elders into a modern #MeToo focus. It\u2019s a timely idea, but one marred by Grace Smart\u2019s cluttered and awkward design and Isabelle Kettle\u2019s fussy and at times clumsy direction. Susanna, warmly sung by soprano Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha, lives in an impoverished Cornish fishing village caught in an environmental catastrophe, where the daily catch is more likely to be floating plastic than fish. Her tumbledown cottage sits centre-stage, getting in everyone\u2019s way. At one point the entire cast is made to squeeze into her tiny kitchen, as into a telephone box; at another she hops up on the draining board to sing. The chorus has to enter single-file, or clamber over the rocks behind. None of this does much service to one of Handel\u2019s most brilliantly subtle scores. Left alone to bathe, Susanna is taunted and sexually abused by lusting old village men who then outrageously accuse her of adultery, a charge too eagerly believed by a chorus of weary fisherfolk, in a parallel with Britten\u2019s Peter Grimes. It\u2019s not until we get to Act 3, and the clutter is swept away, that the production settles down and properly responds to the music, matching the dignity with which Susanna rebuffs her vile tormentors. The fast-rising countertenor Patrick Terry sings Susanna\u2019s husband, Joacim, with an easy grace, his mellifluous voice flexible and consistent throughout its range. Michael Mofidian, as Susanna\u2019s father, Chelsias, and Blaise Malaba, as one of the seedy Elders, both impress in their weighty bass roles. Soprano Yaritza V\u00e9liz, as Daniel, sings with aching beauty, yet renders the English text almost unintelligible. However, no praise can be too high for 28-year-old conductor Patrick Milne and his players, bringing to life a score not heard at Covent Garden since its premiere there in 1749. They alone make it worth the wait. Star ratings (out of five) Giulio Cesare \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Susanna \u2605\u2605\u2605 Giulo Cesare tours until 30 May",

Prep 30 min Cook 15 min Serves 2-4 For the pancakes 2 large eggs 2 pinches salt 3 tbsp plain flour \u00bd tbsp double cream \u00bd tbsp milk A few drops lemon juice 65g caster sugar Melted butter, to grease Fresh blueberries, to serve For the peanut butter cream 200ml double cream 70g smooth peanut butter 25g dark brown sugar 40g caster sugar To make the peanut-butter cream, mix 70ml cream, the peanut butter and both sugars over a low heat until combined. Transfer to a large bowl with the remaining cream, and whisk until fluffy. For the pancakes, start by setting a large, flat-bottomed frying pan over the lowest possible heat on your hob. To make the batter, separate the eggs into two large mixing bowls. Add the salt to the yolks, then stir in the flour, followed by the cream and milk, until you get a smooth paste. Pour the lemon juice over the egg whites, then beat with an electric whisk until foamy and soft peaks form. Still whisking, add the sugar, a spoonful at a time, until the sugar is mixed in and the meringue is glossy. Stir a third of the meringue into the yolk mixture, then carefully fold in the second third until just combined, followed by the final portion. Brush the insides of the pastry cases with melted butter, arrange them in your frying pan and brush a little more butter on the frying pan surface within each case. Divide the pancake mixture between the four cases; it should come about two-thirds of the way up. Cook for about six minutes, by which time they should have risen to the top of each case. Put the pan under a grill on a medium-low heat and cook for a further five minutes, or until the tops have browned. Transfer the cases to a plate and run a palette knife around the edges to release them. Serve with the peanut-butter cream and a scattering of blueberries.",

      "body": "<p>Growing up in the north of England, Dr James Chatterton was enthralled by the books of the pioneering zookeeper and conservationist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/26/gerald-durrell-was-my-hero-i-married-him-for-his-zoo#\">Gerald Durrell</a> and dreamed of saving endangered species. Now, on the other side of the world, Chatterton has done just that, helping to bring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/worlds-fattest-parrot-endangered-kakapo-fungal-infection-new-zealand\">world\u2019s fattest parrot</a> back from the brink.</p> <p>Chatterton and his team spent the best part of a year bringing in quarantine conditions and trialling new treatments on the frontline of a killer disease afflicting New Zealand\u2019s k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d.</p> <p>\u201cI think most people think our job is to go and stroke the red panda, and cuddle the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d,\u201d says Chatterton, manager of veterinary services at Auckland Zoo\u2019s New Zealand Centre for Conservation Medicine. Even in a normal year, the vet team\u2019s work caring for the zoo\u2019s animals and treating some of the country\u2019s wild creatures is more serious than that, but 2019 was \u201cmonumental\u201d, he says.</p> <p>The respiratory disease aspergillosis began to spread through the endangered k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d population last April, threatening to reverse the gains of the bird\u2019s most successful breeding season in living memory.</p> <p>K\u0101k\u0101po are not just rare, they are also deeply weird: flightless, nocturnal, with fragrant feathers and a comical waddling run. Males \u201cboom\u201d to attract females, and they only breed every three to six years when the native rimu trees \u201cmast\u201d, or produce large numbers of seeds. Last year was a \u201cmega-mast\u201d, the ripe fruit carpeting the ground, and the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d responded by laying eggs earlier than ever before.</p> <p>By the end of the southern hemisphere\u2019s summer in February, thanks to intensive intervention by New Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation (DOC) K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d Recovery Programme, the population of 147 k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d had produced more than 80 chicks \u2013 a record number, given the seriously inbred species\u2019 struggles with infertility.</p> <p>Auckland Zoo\u2019s vets took turns working busy stints alongside conservation workers on the remote sanctuary islands where the birds live, in the country\u2019s far south. By April, everyone was exhausted, but finally starting to relax.</p> <p>Then one of the chicks died suddenly. It was found to have aspergillosis, a brutal infection in which lumps of fungus form in the birds\u2019 lungs and slowly choke them to death.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to diagnose, extremely hard to treat, and usually fatal, particularly in wild birds.

      "bodyText": "Growing up in the north of England, Dr James Chatterton was enthralled by the books of the pioneering zookeeper and conservationist Gerald Durrell and dreamed of saving endangered species. Now, on the other side of the world, Chatterton has done just that, helping to bring the world\u2019s fattest parrot back from the brink. Chatterton and his team spent the best part of a year bringing in quarantine conditions and trialling new treatments on the frontline of a killer disease afflicting New Zealand\u2019s k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d. \u201cI think most people think our job is to go and stroke the red panda, and cuddle the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d,\u201d says Chatterton, manager of veterinary services at Auckland Zoo\u2019s New Zealand Centre for Conservation Medicine. Even in a normal year, the vet team\u2019s work caring for the zoo\u2019s animals and treating some of the country\u2019s wild creatures is more serious than that, but 2019 was \u201cmonumental\u201d, he says. The respiratory disease aspergillosis began to spread through the endangered k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d population last April, threatening to reverse the gains of the bird\u2019s most successful breeding season in living memory. K\u0101k\u0101po are not just rare, they are also deeply weird: flightless, nocturnal, with fragrant feathers and a comical waddling run. Males \u201cboom\u201d to attract females, and they only breed every three to six years when the native rimu trees \u201cmast\u201d, or produce large numbers of seeds. Last year was a \u201cmega-mast\u201d, the ripe fruit carpeting the ground, and the k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d responded by laying eggs earlier than ever before. By the end of the southern hemisphere\u2019s summer in February, thanks to intensive intervention by New Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation (DOC) K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d Recovery Programme, the population of 147 k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d had produced more than 80 chicks \u2013 a record number, given the seriously inbred species\u2019 struggles with infertility. Auckland Zoo\u2019s vets took turns working busy stints alongside conservation workers on the remote sanctuary islands where the birds live, in the country\u2019s far south. By April, everyone was exhausted, but finally starting to relax. Then one of the chicks died suddenly. It was found to have aspergillosis, a brutal infection in which lumps of fungus form in the birds\u2019 lungs and slowly choke them to death. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to diagnose, extremely hard to treat, and usually fatal, particularly in wild birds. You usually just find them dead,\u201d says Chatterton. The disease had only ever been seen in one k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d before. \u201cWe thought it was going to be a one-off.\u201d A few weeks later two more chicks died. Then two adult females became ill and had to be put down. \u201cWe thought: \u2018Something very unusual is going on.\u2019 You\u2019re dealing with a lot of unknowns.\u201d With aspergillosis, by the time a wild bird begins to display symptoms \u2013 or anything unusual shows up in blood tests \u2013 it is usually too late to save them. The only way to diagnose the disease in time is using a CT scan or endoscopy to spot fungal growths in the lungs. The vets and DOC scientists began mapping which k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d had shared a nest with the sick birds and which had been on the same food run.

Just as Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced the entire country would be placed under lockdown in an attempt to stop the coronavirus, for the first time in my career I wasn\u2019t simply covering a crisis, I was living it alongside my family.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Readers have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not have been aware of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a reporter, while my hands pecked at the keyboard, I felt the huge responsibility to inform readers in search of balanced news. On one hand I sensed the necessity to express the crude realities of the outbreak, of the thousands infected and hundreds dead; on the other, the need to explain, factually, that it was possible to stop the virus. It was a thin line between the need to inform and the obligation not to cause alarm.</p> <p>But the biggest responsibility, the most challenging task, was the emergency I found myself in as a father. It wasn\u2019t easy to explain the coronavirus outbreak to my six-year-old son, Leoluca, who won\u2019t be able to attend school or leave the house except in extreme cases. Once again I found myself having to explain the seriousness of the situation while remaining level-headed. I reminded my son of his idol, Spider-Man, and what his Uncle Ben said to him: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d \u201cYeah, dad. I know,\u201d he answered. \u201cI don\u2019t have to jump around skyscrapers. All I have to do is stay home and wash my hands well.\u201d God bless him. It was easier than I thought.</p> <h2>Angela Giuffrida, Rome correspondent</h2> <p>It seems as if a lifetime has passed since that Saturday morning in January, when I was listening to an Irish resident in Wuhan speaking to LBC as news of the coronavirus outbreak in China emerged. He was describing life under quarantine, and how you only left your home to buy essentials \u201csuch as toilet roll\u201d. The situation seemed frightening, but very remote.</p> <p>As events unfolded, I followed the coverage of my colleague, Lily Kuo, in Beijing, all the while wondering how challenging it must have been for her to report the story in China while trying to keep healthy. But again, I never anticipated being in her shoes. Within a few short weeks, I have gone from writing about Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, which was initially confined to 11 northern towns, to living it.</p> <p>Reporting on this story has been among the most challenging of my career, not least because there are still so many unknowns about coronavirus. There is a huge sense of responsibility to tell the story correctly, but with not even the experts agreeing with each other, it has been a challenge to explain at times.</p> <p>We are fortunate that Italy has been transparent with data and swift in its actions. The government took coronavirus seriously from the beginning. Every day, the chief of the civil protection authority gives journalists a regional breakdown of new cases, deaths, those recovered and hospitalised. I also have a couple of trusted scientists to call for verifications as well as a team of colleagues at Rome\u2019s foreign press association, who have been invaluable in sharing their knowledge and experiences.</p> <h2><br>Ben Quinn, reporter</h2> <p>This has been one of the fastest-moving stories for as long as I can remember as a live blogger, demanding an unusual blend of international, political and science reporting as well as crowdsourcing and data analysis.</p> <p>In a story that\u2019s truly global, the Guardian\u2019s international network also really feels like it has come into its own, with our Australian office handing over to London and copy constantly coming in from reporters everywhere.</p> <p>But the very nature of the crisis has presented particular challenges too, such as in finding the right balance between covering the global picture and then knowing when and how much to drill down into localised and personal stories, while keeping them relevant to readers in a different part of the world.</p> <p>Given that our blog has really been global-facing by default, we\u2019ve also tried to take care, for example, to frame and explain specific British developments in a way that are coherent to readers elsewhere while also ensuring that readers in the UK get the depth of detail they expect.</p> <p>Readers themselves have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not otherwise have been aware of, or providing eyewitness accounts.</p> <p>Verification is obviously essential, and we\u2019re grateful to those who\u2019ve helped make this as easy as possible. That has involved, for example, something as simple as providing photos of boarding passes to help indicate that someone really is at an airport in Milan and can speak from experience about the impact of the Italian lockdown.</p> <p>Above all, as people find themselves with an unprecedented choice of information sources, we\u2019re still trying to make sure that we remain a calm and trustworthy source for the facts they need.</p> <p><br></p>",

There is a huge sense of responsibility to tell the story correctly, but with not even the experts agreeing with each other, it has been a challenge to explain at times. We are fortunate that Italy has been transparent with data and swift in its actions. The government took coronavirus seriously from the beginning. Every day, the chief of the civil protection authority gives journalists a regional breakdown of new cases, deaths, those recovered and hospitalised. I also have a couple of trusted scientists to call for verifications as well as a team of colleagues at Rome\u2019s foreign press association, who have been invaluable in sharing their knowledge and experiences. Ben Quinn, reporter This has been one of the fastest-moving stories for as long as I can remember as a live blogger, demanding an unusual blend of international, political and science reporting as well as crowdsourcing and data analysis. In a story that\u2019s truly global, the Guardian\u2019s international network also really feels like it has come into its own, with our Australian office handing over to London and copy constantly coming in from reporters everywhere. But the very nature of the crisis has presented particular challenges too, such as in finding the right balance between covering the global picture and then knowing when and how much to drill down into localised and personal stories, while keeping them relevant to readers in a different part of the world. Given that our blog has really been global-facing by default, we\u2019ve also tried to take care, for example, to frame and explain specific British developments in a way that are coherent to readers elsewhere while also ensuring that readers in the UK get the depth of detail they expect. Readers themselves have been particularly great in flagging up stories, trends and data that those anchoring the blog may not otherwise have been aware of, or providing eyewitness accounts. Verification is obviously essential, and we\u2019re grateful to those who\u2019ve helped make this as easy as possible. That has involved, for example, something as simple as providing photos of boarding passes to help indicate that someone really is at an airport in Milan and can speak from experience about the impact of the Italian lockdown. Above all, as people find themselves with an unprecedented choice of information sources, we\u2019re still trying to make sure that we remain a calm and trustworthy source for the facts they need.",

Cross-dressing in secret once or twice a week felt dishonest and stifling,\u201d recalls the 64-year-old artist. \u201cI\u2019d learned to be comfortable with being a transvestite and now I was desperate to live as one.\u201d</p> <p>Eighteen years later,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\">Dragman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review\" title=\"\"> </a>is back as the star of his own book.

By instinctively saving a young girl as she plummets off a rooftop, Dragman has outlawed himself.</p> <p>Appleby created the book at his studio on a busy south London street, where he opens the door to a colourful gathering. His wife, Nicola Sherring \u2013 to whom he remains married though they separated many years ago \u201cas a biblical couple\u201d \u2013 is sharing a sandwich with Charlie, a scarlet cockatoo, who sits on her shoulder, watched jealously by Una, an accident-prone one-eyed pug (named from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/31/edward-gorey-book-jacket-design-contribution-unique-era-publishing\" title=\"\">Edward Gorey</a>\u2019s <em>The Gashlycrumb Tinies</em> \u2013 \u201cU is for Una who slipped down a drain\u201d).

Like August\u2019s long-suffering wife Mary, Sherring was a carpenter when the couple met. \u201cShe came to make bookshelves for my flat and we just got on so well that I kept finding more jobs for her to do, and then we fell in love.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbda27177f71edb4184bafd52651c734e6f248c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbda27177f71edb4184bafd52651c734e6f248c1/817_1075_1168_816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dragman to the rescue \u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"699\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dragman to the rescue \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mmckay/Steven Appleby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While August keeps his secret locked up in boxes in the attic, Appleby was honest with Sherring from the start \u2013 even though he admits that their marriage involved a certain amount of denial. \u201cI assumed my other issues would fade into the background or even go away, because I certainly hadn\u2019t fallen in love ever before.

After a local Church of England primary school, where he won prizes for plasticine modelling, he boarded at a Quaker school from the age of 11. \u201cI loathed it to begin with, but in the end I wouldn\u2019t wish it away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s that mixed thing, because I have huge respect for the Quakers and I still have friends from school.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"590cb3fa8387be9571534b4095e6fb07a53bd629\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590cb3fa8387be9571534b4095e6fb07a53bd629/35_26_2154_3009/716.jpg\" alt=\"Appleby was tutored by Quentin Blake: \u2018He taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality\u2019\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appleby was tutored by Quentin Blake: \u2018He taught me that you didn\u2019t have to be a brilliant drawer if your drawings have personality\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: mmckay/Steven Appleby</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He hung out in the art room and got involved in a band, going on to do art and design at Manchester Polytechnic, \u201cmainly because I found art fun, and because my academic subjects weren\u2019t brilliant\u201d.

Together they ran high-profile campaigns for bands such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/12/how-buzzcocks-invented-indie-with-help-from-the-sex-pistols-a-renault-and-the-quo\" title=\"\">Buzzcocks</a> and Duran Duran. \u201cMalcolm would design the album covers and I\u2019d do the other things like playing cards or bubblegum cards. It was fun, but after a few years I got frustrated, because you\u2019re doing it for other people.\u201d</p> <p>One of the first characters he created was Captain Star, an obsolete astronaut stranded on a distant planet with an outsized ego, who was invented for a strip in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/07/farewell-to-nme-rocknroll-riot-that-petered-into-silence\" title=\"\">New Musical Express</a> and went on to become the star of a TV animation series voiced by Richard E Grant and Adrian Edmondson. Commissions from Punch, the Guardian and the Times followed. He collected his work into a series of books that make him appear to be a self-help guru: <em>Normal Sex</em> was followed by <em>Men: The Truth</em> and <em>The Truth About Love</em>. His Loomus cartoons about a small boy and his dysfunctional parents, which ran for 11 years in the Guardian Family section, were published as <em>Steven Appleby\u2019s Guide to Life</em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s all a question of curation, he says. \u201cSo for <em>Normal Sex</em>, I collected everything I\u2019d ever done about sex and divided it into sections.\u201d Published in black and white in 1993, its opening pages are a characteristic mix of awkward truths and absurdist humour: \u201cSome individuals are attracted only to themselves. Other confused people believe they may belong to a hitherto undiscovered sex. Of course creepie-crawlies have sexual worries too. Worms have trouble deciding which end is which \u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Dragman</em> is his first venture into sustained narrative, and it has already been optioned for a live action TV adaptation. In some ways, he says, it\u2019s a strange choice of subject because \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about superheroes at all, but I loved the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/09/batman-box-set-review-60s-cult-classic\" title=\"\">Batman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/09/batman-box-set-review-60s-cult-classic\" title=\"\"> series</a> that I watched in the 1960s and, looking back, I probably wanted to be Catwoman.\u201d He read the Dandy and the Beano alongside his sister\u2019s comics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/aug/21/postgraduate.highereducation\" title=\"\">Bunty</a> and Diana. \u201cI did move on to superhero comics a bit, but not all that much. Then I got into science fiction. I loved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/27/philip-k-dick-best-novels-blade-runner-minority-report\" title=\"\">Philip K Dick</a>, particularly, because nothing in his books was ever quite what it appeared to be, and that seemed to be reality to me. Maybe it reflected the secret life that I had.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The relationship between fiction and autobiography is seldom as delicately nuanced as it is in Appleby\u2019s protagonists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Which brings us back to the question of gender. Unlike <em>Dragman</em>, Appleby doesn\u2019t have a transvestite alias, though he lives full-time in woman\u2019s clothes. He briefly investigated gender reassignment but decided against it, citing his encounter with \u201cColin the mouse man\u201d \u2013 a pest-controller \u2013 as an example of both the challenges and rewards. \u201cColin arrived at the door and I opened it and said, \u2018Hi. I\u2019m Stephen. I changed my image a few years ago,\u2019 and he laughed, and we had this whole conversation. On his second visit he brought me a couple of leopard print screwdrivers, with little fluffy bits, and said \u2018I was given these for Christmas. I thought you might like them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He now lives partly in his studio and partly back at the family home with Sherring and her partner, a son and his girlfriend, a nephew, and, of course, Charlie and Una. Friendship is important to him, cropping up time and again in his professional life. When he wanted to try out the ideas in <em>Dragman</em>, it was to a member of his old school band that he turned.</p> <p>The book is full of Appleby\u2019s unique brand of punning fun. If it has a message, it\u2019s that it pays to be honest, and capitalism isn\u2019t honest: it steals souls. Its warning is knitted into a plot that is indebted to hard-boiled detective fiction and soap opera, as well as to his own experience of the cross-dressing scene.</p> <p>\u201cI would know people as Deirdre or Susan and have no idea what their male name is, or whether they\u2019re a plumber or a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel so lucky that the world allows me to be myself. \u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dragman</em> is published by Vintage (RRP \u00a318.99).

In some ways, he says, it\u2019s a strange choice of subject because \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about superheroes at all, but I loved the Batman series that I watched in the 1960s and, looking back, I probably wanted to be Catwoman.\u201d He read the Dandy and the Beano alongside his sister\u2019s comics, Bunty and Diana. \u201cI did move on to superhero comics a bit, but not all that much. Then I got into science fiction. I loved Philip K Dick, particularly, because nothing in his books was ever quite what it appeared to be, and that seemed to be reality to me. Maybe it reflected the secret life that I had.\u201d Which brings us back to the question of gender. Unlike Dragman, Appleby doesn\u2019t have a transvestite alias, though he lives full-time in woman\u2019s clothes. He briefly investigated gender reassignment but decided against it, citing his encounter with \u201cColin the mouse man\u201d \u2013 a pest-controller \u2013 as an example of both the challenges and rewards. \u201cColin arrived at the door and I opened it and said, \u2018Hi. I\u2019m Stephen. I changed my image a few years ago,\u2019 and he laughed, and we had this whole conversation. On his second visit he brought me a couple of leopard print screwdrivers, with little fluffy bits, and said \u2018I was given these for Christmas. I thought you might like them.\u2019\u201d He now lives partly in his studio and partly back at the family home with Sherring and her partner, a son and his girlfriend, a nephew, and, of course, Charlie and Una. Friendship is important to him, cropping up time and again in his professional life. When he wanted to try out the ideas in Dragman, it was to a member of his old school band that he turned. The book is full of Appleby\u2019s unique brand of punning fun. If it has a message, it\u2019s that it pays to be honest, and capitalism isn\u2019t honest: it steals souls. Its warning is knitted into a plot that is indebted to hard-boiled detective fiction and soap opera, as well as to his own experience of the cross-dressing scene. \u201cI would know people as Deirdre or Susan and have no idea what their male name is, or whether they\u2019re a plumber or a lawyer,\u201d he says. \u201cI just feel so lucky that the world allows me to be myself. \u201d \u2022 Dragman is published by Vintage (RRP \u00a318.99).

      "bodyText": "Film Boy (2010) Amazon Prime Video Taika Waititi\u2019s semi-autobiographical, wholly magical 2010 comedy has recently become available to stream over here, and it is essential viewing, whichever side of the Jojo Rabbit debate you fall on. Set in 1984, it\u2019s a boy\u2019s-eye-view story of growing up in a New Zealand Maori community, while hero-worshipping Michael Jackson and pining after your absentee father. For Sama (2019) All4 Now is the time to catch up on some Oscar movies \u2013 not to mention news of ongoing world events \u2013 and this 2020 best documentary nominee offers both. Waad al-Kateab addresses her film to her baby daughter Sama, born in the midst of the Syrian conflict. It is a difficult watch, but be witness and you will discover a beautiful testament to hope and humanity. Logan Lucky (2017) Amazon Prime Video Tired: speculating on who will be the next Bond. Wired: speculating on who Bond will be next. Universal\u2019s decision to push back No Time to Die until China\u2019s cinemas re-open provides an opportunity to remember the other Daniel Craig in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 2017 heist. And if OTT accents aren\u2019t your bag, Craig\u2019s five-star performance in 2000\u2019s Some Voices is also available on Prime. Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2020) Curzon Home Cinema, \u00a39.99 rental Are you craving a trip to the local independent cinema, like a 18th century lesbian craves the touch of her lover? Then this is the choice for you. Curzon brings the arthouse into our homes with the great C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s passionate film, a historical romance that asks burning questions about art and representation. A Quiet Place (2018) All4 If being indoors feels like hard work, imagine if you had to stay silent, too. That is the premise of this nerve-jangler, set in a world terrorised by sharp-eared aliens. It also takes credit for turning its married creator-stars, Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, into the Richard &amp; Judy of sci-fi horror. EEJ * * * TV Ballers Now TV, five seasons There is never a bad time for an ass-kicking pep talk from Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. That is the core appeal of Ballers, in which the forklift-sized sweetheart plays a sports agent barking motivational advice at his coddled clients against an absurdly well-heeled backdrop. Even the appearance of Russell Brand can\u2019t disrupt the deluxe sheen. Dead Pixels All4, one season Struggling to stay in the same place for hours on end? Gamers have been managing to do it for years. That\u2019s why E4\u2019s byte-size sitcom about online gaming addicts serves as an invaluable primer on their world, as well as offering a concentrated blast of oddball characters and ribald gags. Time to stock up on Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cakes and energy drinks. Lost in Space Netflix, two seasons Crash-landing on an alluring but hostile alien planet with your mum and dad in tow sounds like the worst Center Parcs holiday ever. But Netflix\u2019s handsome reboot of the creaky 1960s serial is an exhilarating and life-affirming marvel, forcing its dysfunctional space family, the Robinsons (starring Molly Parker and Toby Stephens as the parents), through exotic hazards and old-school cliffhangers that require brains, guts and non-snarky communication to overcome. Race Across the World iPlayer, one season This enjoyably back-to-basics BBC Two reality show offers some vicarious street-level travel thrills via orienteering on a continental scale. Pairs of plucky pathfinders are tasked with navigating vast distances with meagre funds and no smartphones. Season one yomped from London to Singapore; the just-launched second season charts a course from Mexico to the tip of South America. Supernatural Amazon Prime Video, 13 seasons This post-Buffy perennial stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as the hunky Winchester brothers, criss-crossing the US in a battered Chevy duffing up demons as they go. Since 2005, it has been beloved by fans and utterly overlooked by everyone else. But with the 14th season about to launch on E4, now seems like the perfect time to go back to the start, watch all 200-odd hours and learn, once and for all, which one is Sam and which one is Dean.

Grimes: Miss Anthropocene (4AD) It\u2019s easy to spiral when worrying about world events. But why not take a leaf out of Grimes\u2019s book and flip the script? On her very good new album, she re-envisages the climate crisis as a vengeful goddess who has fun wreaking hell on Earth. Find creative potential and get world-building. Pop Smoke: Meet the Woo Vol 2 (Republic) Knock boredom away with this bassy, blown-out mixtape. Now, sadly, it stands as the last testament of the Brooklyn drill star-in-the-making Pop Smoke, who died last month on the cusp of becoming a superstar; his 2019 single Welcome to the Party will for ever rattle car windows in tribute to his curtailed genius. Tame Impala: The Slow Rush (Universal) The best albums can transport you to another world.

Saward\u2019s family have donated \u00a310,000 to a crowd justice campaign to fund a legal challenge brought by the End Violence against Women\u2019s Coalition (Evaw), which accuses the CPS of covertly changing its policy and practice on prosecuting rape, and becoming more risk-averse. Gavin Drake, Saward\u2019s widower, said the family were unanimous in their support for the challenge. \u201cAs soon as I read about the case, I knew that this was something that Jill would be supporting if she was still alive,\u201d he said. The CPS has stated its intention to pursue tens of thousands of pounds in legal costs if a judicial review, where a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision taken by a public body, is not granted on Tuesday at the Royal Courts of Justice, according to legal documents seen by the Guardian. The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, argued that Evaw\u2019s proposed proceedings \u201care not public interest proceedings\u201d \u2013 which, if accepted by the judge, may mean costs would not be capped, according to lawyers from the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, which is representing Evaw. The women\u2019s groups argue that this money would come in large part from victims of rape who feel they have been failed by the CPS, and have given small donations. By mid-afternoon on Friday the fund had raised \u00a348,000 towards the legal challenge, but campaigners fear that costs could amount to at least \u00a370,000 if they are not capped at the permission hearing on Tuesday. The campaign has received an increase in donations in recent days, many of them for \u00a310 or \u00a320 and nearly all with messages of support. One donor wrote: \u201cHaving been through the system myself and being failed on every level I so wish you every success.\u201d Under the anonymous donation of \u00a310, someone simply wrote: \u201cI never got justice.\u201d The Saward family pledge comes from donations following the campaigner\u2019s sudden death in January 2017, aged 51.

I throw my head back and laugh the kind of full-throated cackle an evil genius makes right before he presses the red button that blows up the world. I have barely slept more than five hours a night since my daughter was born eight months ago, and there is something genuinely hilarious about this era of sleep obsession when you have a baby who refuses to let you sleep. It\u2019s like living in a busted shack when everyone around you is banging on about the problems with their new basement extension. (I told you I was into property magazines.) \u201cThe truth about why you keep waking up at 3am\u201d a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/17/shut-eye-and-sleep-hygiene-the-truth-about-why-you-keep-waking-up-at-3am\" title=\"\">doomy headline</a> in this paper read recently. Is it because there\u2019s a screaming baby in the cot next to your bed? </p> <p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so tired,\u201d I used to say when I was young and merrily childfree. Talking about how tired I was back then seemed to be a way of proving how deeply sensitive I was (too fragile to sleep) while simultaneously giving the impression that I led an extremely exciting social life (too fabulous to sleep). But I did genuinely think I was tired, and this is what I want to say to my twentysomething self and any other young person who is about to say how tired they are: you\u2019re not.</p> <p>If you have the energy to ascertain your tiredness and then talk about it, you\u2019re not actually tired. You\u2019re just thinking too much about yourself, which is what the entire wellness industry is based on, and which ultimately becomes detrimental because focusing too much on sleep will only exacerbate your sleeplessness. If anyone is worrying that they only got seven and a half hours\u2019 sleep last night, allow me to reassure you: I have done interviews on three hours\u2019 sleep, written articles on four hours, and I\u2019m typing this after being woken three times in the night (as Amy Poehler says in her memoir, Yes Please, everything written by men and women with children under six should come with a \u201csleep-deprived\u201d sticker on it). And I\u2019m <em>fine</em>. OK, I can feel my brain cells self-cannibalising and have possibly given myself premature dementia: it took me two days last week to think of the word \u201cgondola\u201d. But I am still fine. Well, alive, anyway. I am definitely 100% alive.</p> <p>So no, I don\u2019t want to hear about how tired you are. But if you\u2019re all having such trouble sleeping, how about if you take over the night shift with my baby? I\u2019ll definitely sleep, and you and the baby can rave all night together. David Baddiel has said that the only thing that cured his insomnia was having kids, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/19/david-baddiel-struggles-insomnia\" title=\"\">because they exhausted it out of him</a>. Think of the money you could save on sleep apps, kids!</p> <p>Awake at 4am, I fantasise about a time when my kids are teenagers and sleeping until midday, which means I\u2019ll sleep until midday, too. Or perhaps not: older parents warn me that, while child-induced sleeplessness cures insomnia, it also breaks you, leaving you doomed for ever after to wake at 6am. So maybe we\u2019ve got this parenting thing all wrong: just as twentysomething bodies are supposed to cope best with pregnancy and childbirth, perhaps fifty- and sixtysomething biorhythms work best with a baby\u2019s sleeping patterns. Older friends and relatives could rise at 6am and take the baby out for a nice walk around the park, while we broken thirty- and fortysomethings could be left to get on with other things. Like sleeping. Strangely, none have yet accepted my suggestion, but they\u2019re probably just mulling it over.</p> <p>Last weekend I went away for a friend\u2019s 40th, alone. We had dinner on the first night, and it was lovely, but I was impatient to get back to my hotel room where I knew the fun would really begin. Reader, I slept solidly for 11 hours. When I woke \u2013 naturally, as opposed to being woken \u2013 I nearly wept with happiness. The second night was a party and, giddy with freedom and an unaccustomed feeling of being well rested, I danced until the sky was light. The next day, I went home, and my husband, who had been looking after all three kids all weekend, asked how I was. I looked him right in the eyes and said, \u201cGod, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p>",

Talking about how tired I was back then seemed to be a way of proving how deeply sensitive I was (too fragile to sleep) while simultaneously giving the impression that I led an extremely exciting social life (too fabulous to sleep). But I did genuinely think I was tired, and this is what I want to say to my twentysomething self and any other young person who is about to say how tired they are: you\u2019re not. If you have the energy to ascertain your tiredness and then talk about it, you\u2019re not actually tired. You\u2019re just thinking too much about yourself, which is what the entire wellness industry is based on, and which ultimately becomes detrimental because focusing too much on sleep will only exacerbate your sleeplessness. If anyone is worrying that they only got seven and a half hours\u2019 sleep last night, allow me to reassure you: I have done interviews on three hours\u2019 sleep, written articles on four hours, and I\u2019m typing this after being woken three times in the night (as Amy Poehler says in her memoir, Yes Please, everything written by men and women with children under six should come with a \u201csleep-deprived\u201d sticker on it). And I\u2019m fine. OK, I can feel my brain cells self-cannibalising and have possibly given myself premature dementia: it took me two days last week to think of the word \u201cgondola\u201d. But I am still fine. Well, alive, anyway. I am definitely 100% alive. So no, I don\u2019t want to hear about how tired you are. But if you\u2019re all having such trouble sleeping, how about if you take over the night shift with my baby? I\u2019ll definitely sleep, and you and the baby can rave all night together. David Baddiel has said that the only thing that cured his insomnia was having kids, because they exhausted it out of him. Think of the money you could save on sleep apps, kids! Awake at 4am, I fantasise about a time when my kids are teenagers and sleeping until midday, which means I\u2019ll sleep until midday, too. Or perhaps not: older parents warn me that, while child-induced sleeplessness cures insomnia, it also breaks you, leaving you doomed for ever after to wake at 6am. So maybe we\u2019ve got this parenting thing all wrong: just as twentysomething bodies are supposed to cope best with pregnancy and childbirth, perhaps fifty- and sixtysomething biorhythms work best with a baby\u2019s sleeping patterns. Older friends and relatives could rise at 6am and take the baby out for a nice walk around the park, while we broken thirty- and fortysomethings could be left to get on with other things. Like sleeping. Strangely, none have yet accepted my suggestion, but they\u2019re probably just mulling it over. Last weekend I went away for a friend\u2019s 40th, alone. We had dinner on the first night, and it was lovely, but I was impatient to get back to my hotel room where I knew the fun would really begin. Reader, I slept solidly for 11 hours. When I woke \u2013 naturally, as opposed to being woken \u2013 I nearly wept with happiness. The second night was a party and, giddy with freedom and an unaccustomed feeling of being well rested, I danced until the sky was light. The next day, I went home, and my husband, who had been looking after all three kids all weekend, asked how I was. I looked him right in the eyes and said, \u201cGod, I\u2019m so tired.\u201d",

Robertson developed it 17 years ago. He was 23 and covering the Iraq war, during which he witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/23/iraq.unitednations\" title=\"\">the 2003 bombing </a>of the UN building in Baghdad that killed 22 people. \u201cI was having lunch opposite, then there were bodies everywhere,\u201d he recalls. A few days later, \u201cI was in the shower, when I got out, I shaved, and a 50p-size clump came off my beard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8d838ff013f1f9b15770fef6373b7a292a16c5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d838ff013f1f9b15770fef6373b7a292a16c5e/68_0_634_792/400.jpg\" alt=\"Graeme Robertson\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graeme Robertson: \u2018I wanted to help people who were going through it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was the start of a dramatic physical transformation. Before his hair loss, Robertson had a thick beard and a body covered in dark hair. It took time for him to accept that he had alopecia. An umbrella term for hair loss or balding, it is commonly caused by an autoimmune condition that attacks the hair follicles (those with it often cite stress as a trigger). In around 20% of cases, there is a family history \u2013 and there is no cure. For Robertson, one of the hardest aspects was the growing disconnect between his appearance and his internal sense of masculinity: \u201cOne girl whom I went out with said it was like kissing a doll, because I\u2019ve not got any stubble. She said, \u2018If I close my eyes, it\u2019s like I\u2019m kissing a girl.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He entered a middle phase, where he had half a moustache, half a head of hair, half a beard, which he got around by shaving daily. However, the psychological impact of losing his eyebrows and eyelashes was significant. \u201cWhen you lose eyelashes and start getting sore eyes, you lose everything. You either have to accept that there\u2019s something different about you, or go the opposite way and drive yourself insane about how you look or feel.\u201d</p> <p>Having come to terms with his hair loss, Robertson has started documenting the experiences of others. \u201cWhen it was happening, I didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to help people who were going through it. It started as a side project then turned into something in-depth, and I saw how many people were struggling.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Poppy Aithwaite</strong><br>18, waitress/barmaid, Teesside</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a3c6ec48ead740a89ae3d749ddb0858a1b700c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a3c6ec48ead740a89ae3d749ddb0858a1b700c2/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poppy Aithwaite for Alopecia UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I was eight months old when I developed alopecia and had no hair until I was about three. Then, from the age of three to 13, I had tiny bald patches behind my ears. I used to think it was the worst thing ever. At 13, it all fell out really quickly. I ended up with nothing. I think it was the stress of going to secondary school that triggered it. And being a teenager; your hormones are changing, too.</p> <p>At school I didn\u2019t want to be different, so I tried to hide it. Wearing a wig was horrendous. I was constantly scared: what if someone pulls it? What if someone thinks it\u2019s funny? I\u2019d get comments such as, \u201cShe\u2019s more bald than my dad.\u201d At the time, I couldn\u2019t talk about it. I just sobbed. It got to the point where I wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. I wouldn\u2019t eat, I wouldn\u2019t open my blinds. I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once, the place where I was working was boiling. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I dropped out of school when I was 15. I was a mess and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. My mam\u2019s a hairdresser, so I started working with her, and at first I loved being able to do all these different things with everybody\u2019s hair, but over time it got harder. I switched to working in bars and restaurants instead, and started seeing a reiki healer. It sounds too good to be true, but she got rid of all my pain. Since then my confidence has just grown.</p> <p>One summer, the place where I was working was boiling and rammed. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid. I feel as if I just woke up one day and something had clicked. I\u2019ve heard all the names that anyone\u2019s going to call me by now. If they see me as \u201cthat baldy lass\u201d, so what?</p> <p>Instagram helped, too. There are many different types of hair loss, whether that be patches or total baldness. There\u2019s everything there for people to see. I model for a wig company, and at first I was scared about the pictures being posted. Then I thought, why am I bothered? I want them to see how happy I am. I don\u2019t want to be that depressed person who loses their hair, I want to be that young girl who inspires people to be who they are.</p> <p>Having alopecia and being in relationships has never been a problem. I\u2019m gay and it\u2019s easier being with a girl. Girls are more understanding. I\u2019ve got a drawer full of wigs. One day I\u2019ve got brown hair, the next I\u2019ve got pink. When I first lost my hair, I felt as if my identity had been ripped away. Now I can be who I want to be.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Michael Taylor</strong><br>27, tech worker, Berlin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07d351958d43a4f3b2ad705d5cc62049198ae9c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07d351958d43a4f3b2ad705d5cc62049198ae9c9/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I used to have a very luscious beard and my alopecia began with a fingerprint-sized hole on my chin. I actually found it endearing. I would walk around work and say: \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d Shortly afterwards, I moved to Berlin for a promotion, and within six months I needed to shave completely. Then I got a patch around the crown of my head. I went to the barber and it was a really uncomfortable experience. He showed me the back of my head in the mirror and there were many patches forming. I realised that this was going to change my life permanently.</p> <p>When I came back to London for my Christmas break, I went to the local barbershop with one of my best friends, and got my head shaved. I remember seeing a mole on the back of my head for the first time, which was interesting. Then I walked out, feeling very cold and a little bit shaken.</p> <p>I think I had a genetic predisposition to alopecia, because there are autoimmune diseases in my family. But I also had a really traumatic year while I was losing my hair. I was adjusting to living in a new country; my long-term relationship fell apart; I lost my dog. Suddenly I was single, without any friends. I was withdrawn for a while. I was mourning, essentially. And then I was dealing with this hair loss.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For a while I tried very hard to reverse it naturally. For three months I gave up all of the good stuff in life: cigarettes, alcohol, sugar \u2013 even lots of vegetables that are considered inflammatory. I tried yoga and meditation.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve come out the other side and realised my own peace of mind is more important than sacrificing many things in the hope that I will get some regrowth. I have no way of knowing when or if I will get any, and I am OK with that, at least for now.</p> <p>I had a relatively weak hairline prior to that, so I don\u2019t miss the hair on my head very much. But I miss my beard and my facial hair. I can\u2019t lie about that. When you lose your eyebrows, it tips over into a space where people think that you are sick.</p> <p>But you have to see the funny side. I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps you get through the door. Online dating is a lot more difficult, because it is a purely visual medium. The best chance of meeting somebody is just being out and living life.</p> <p>Paradoxically, I am probably less self-conscious now. I think back to how I was, clinging on to that rubbish hairline. Now, I just find that hilarious. There is something liberating about shedding those concerns about how you look.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Rima Theisen</strong><br>38, flight attendant, Margate</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b2d3a01dd8879a156d562ba94ee95d1c7e2de3c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b2d3a01dd8879a156d562ba94ee95d1c7e2de3c/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rima Theisen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My alopecia started six months after I had my second child. I had an itchy patch at the back that I kept scratching. I thought it was normal postpartum hair loss. I was in denial. I kept thinking: it\u2019s fine, it will grow back. Then one morning when I started to brush my hair, it was coming out in clumps. Four weeks later, I thought, sod it, it\u2019s got to come off. So, I shaved it all off and raised more than \u00a32,000 for <a href=\"https://www.teenagecancertrust.org/\" title=\"\">Teenage Cancer Trust</a>.</p> <p>When I found out that it wasn\u2019t going to grow back, it was a blow. Your hair is a part of your personality. I was always known for my really long, dark hair and I used to wear a huge bun at work. When I went back after maternity leave, I hadn\u2019t told anyone and they said: \u201cOh my God, are you OK? Are you ill?\u201d I just didn\u2019t want to wear a wig. I thought I would embrace this and be me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy. You just have to learn to tell yourself that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My hair was my thing \u2013 I never cut it \u2013 so it took me a long time to get used to looking at myself in the mirror. But I kept telling myself it was just a look. Some women choose to shave their heads. Losing my brows and lashes affected me more, because no one would choose to shave off their eyebrows and have no eyelashes. I would take those back in an instant over my head hair.</p> <p>Alopecia is a strange condition that nobody knows much about. It doesn\u2019t cause physical pain and it\u2019s not life-threatening, but people don\u2019t realise the mental impact. One of my biggest fears was that my husband would not find me attractive any more. It must be hard to be with someone who looks completely different from when you met them. He\u2019s been amazing, but when it came to having sex I felt really unattractive. I just didn\u2019t feel very womanly.</p> <p>I still get that sometimes, but I\u2019ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy. You just have to learn to trick your mind, to tell yourself that. I wear bigger earrings to compensate for the lack of hair. And I can still wear my uniform, put my red lipstick on and be \u201cthe different one\u201d at work. People used to say: \u201cOh, Rima with the hair.\u201d Now I\u2019m known for being the only bald female crew member out of 4,000.</p> <p>When you lose your hair, it\u2019s like losing your identity, really, and you have to get to know a whole new self. It does teach you who you are. Alopecia doesn\u2019t define my life, but it has made me realise what is important: my husband, my children, my confidence.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Laura Buckeridge </strong><br>actor,<strong> </strong>London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f603d674aaa6e77d619fb6a7937feb6e78837685\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f603d674aaa6e77d619fb6a7937feb6e78837685/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Buckeridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I started losing my hair during my GCSEs, with a 2p-piece-sized patch on the back of my head. I just remember crying and crying, and then eventually going to the doctor. I was revising and very depressed. I wanted to be an actor, and my dad had said: \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s the nearest thing to prostitution.\u201d We were a very religious family, and I made the connection that, because my hair was falling out, God must be punishing me.

I shaved my head occasionally, and for my wedding, I was fine in front of hundreds of people in a big white dress, with a bald head and an ornate crown. I asked my husband: \u201cHow was I so strong then?\u201d and he said: \u201cYou just loved being different.\u201d But you can be a confident person and then something happens, and you think, I can\u2019t face it today. In the end, losing my hair took away my career. The whole thing about acting is your image. To walk in the door with nothing\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t do it.</p> <p>When I had children, the wigs came out. I didn\u2019t want to look weird for them. I\u2019d moved into a new area and the last thing I wanted was to stand out. At the playgroups, I was often the only black woman there. My husband is a white, middle-class man who is Oxford-educated, and I didn\u2019t want to have an impact on his career. I was playing the dutiful wife. It feels silly to say that alopecia robs you of your identity, but you just don\u2019t recognise yourself. When I put the wig on, I thought, oh, I remember her.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t tell anyone my hair wasn\u2019t real for years. I was clutching on to my hair on windy days, smiling when people said: \u201cYou\u2019ve changed your hair!\u201d thinking, really? You don\u2019t know? Then I went to see the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/06/black-panther-review-marvel-wakanda-chadwick-boseman\" title=\"\">Black Panther</a>, and there is a lovely scene where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/crush-on-danai-gurira-the-walking-dead\" title=\"\">Danai Gurira</a>\u2019s character takes her wig off and throws it across the room.

This summer when I went \u201ctopless\u201d I was able to spend the whole two weeks in the pool. And whenever there is another bald black woman, they tend to come up and we have a lovely chat.</p> <p>You have to be strong, because people stare. You think: why are they staring? Oh yes, I\u2019m black. And bald. I forgot. I do a lot of work in schools and there\u2019s no better education than seeing a black woman who can speak in public, who is bald, and it is normal. I hope that I empower people. I look good without a wig.

I was working in a job with some very burned-out co-workers, and I was badly bullied. I was young, idealistic and hopeful about where I wanted my life to go, so I wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of experience. I began to notice little patches, and at the time I thought it was nothing. I thought it was stress-related and that it would go away.</p> <p>In the subsequent two years, those patches became bigger, then I got some regrowth and it fell out again. The uncertainty was difficult. I was very paranoid. I was obsessed with this idea that everyone was staring at me. Every day I\u2019d cover my hair over the bald patches, and pencil in eyebrows.</p> <p>By this time I was working in refugee camps in Larissa in northern Greece, and it was very difficult to acknowledge my own struggle. I was waking up with a pillow full of hair, then doing stressful humanitarian work. There was shame that I was even struggling, then the shame of looking so different, and feeling so weird and alone. I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it because the situations we were facing were so much bigger than mine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate.

I went back to my parent\u2019s house for the first time in 10 years and lived there. By then, my hair was falling out in clumps and I decided to shave it off. Since doing that, it hasn\u2019t always been easy, but I feel much more in control. I took charge of it rather and being a victim.</p> <p>I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate. Trying to \u201cown\u201d my baldness is the way I cope with it. I wear more makeup now than I did before and I wear more statement earrings. Seeing other women with buzzed heads or who rock their baldness is empowering. I date men and women, and I think with women it\u2019s much more acceptable to look different. With men, there seems to be a more shallow idea of what women should look like, or so I think.</p> <p>I had eating disorders in my 20s, so I\u2019ve never really felt so comfortable in my body. Alopecia has forced me to confront my own image so, in a way, I\u2019m grateful for it. The only hair I didn\u2019t lose was my armpit hair, which is quite funny.

I tried a couple of medical routes and quickly realised nothing could be done. I felt awful. I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone about it and nobody saw me without hair, even my husband. I hid it away. I thought I looked like an alien.</p> <p>I had a job in a customer-facing role in a bank, so I had to literally put on my wig and put on a face and be the person that people were expecting to see. The first day I went in with my wig, this guy came in and said: \u201cOh Elena, what have you done to your hair?\u201d I burst into floods of tears, ran to the loo and was there for about half an hour, trying to compose myself. Also, when you\u2019ve got a bit of hair, you don\u2019t have control of where your wig is. I was always worrying about whether it was straight or not. It puts you in a state of heightened anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The internet didn\u2019t exist when I had it first time, but when I Googled it this time I was amazed.

I thought, I can\u2019t face going through this again: it\u2019s so unfair. Just go away. Leave me alone.</p> <p>By then I was a mum. So I thought, actually, no.

It\u2019s lovely to be able to help people get out of the place of despair where everybody starts, to a place of acceptance and happiness. Now, putting my hair on is the last thing I\u2019ll do before I walk out of the door, and quite often I don\u2019t notice whether I have it on or not. I keep my wig in the kitchen on a champagne bottle. Why not?</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful I\u2019ve got alopecia. Beauty is not all about the outside.

I was at my baldest in 2017. I couldn\u2019t look in the mirror, because it just wasn\u2019t me. After my eyelashes fell out, my eyes were swollen all the time, and I was getting allergic reactions.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s like a gun going off, and once that\u2019s happened there\u2019s no going back.\u201d This is how Guardian photographer Graeme Robertson describes the onset of alopecia. Robertson developed it 17 years ago. He was 23 and covering the Iraq war, during which he witnessed the 2003 bombing of the UN building in Baghdad that killed 22 people. \u201cI was having lunch opposite, then there were bodies everywhere,\u201d he recalls. A few days later, \u201cI was in the shower, when I got out, I shaved, and a 50p-size clump came off my beard.\u201d This was the start of a dramatic physical transformation. Before his hair loss, Robertson had a thick beard and a body covered in dark hair. It took time for him to accept that he had alopecia. An umbrella term for hair loss or balding, it is commonly caused by an autoimmune condition that attacks the hair follicles (those with it often cite stress as a trigger). In around 20% of cases, there is a family history \u2013 and there is no cure. For Robertson, one of the hardest aspects was the growing disconnect between his appearance and his internal sense of masculinity: \u201cOne girl whom I went out with said it was like kissing a doll, because I\u2019ve not got any stubble. She said, \u2018If I close my eyes, it\u2019s like I\u2019m kissing a girl.\u2019\u201d He entered a middle phase, where he had half a moustache, half a head of hair, half a beard, which he got around by shaving daily. However, the psychological impact of losing his eyebrows and eyelashes was significant. \u201cWhen you lose eyelashes and start getting sore eyes, you lose everything. You either have to accept that there\u2019s something different about you, or go the opposite way and drive yourself insane about how you look or feel.\u201d Having come to terms with his hair loss, Robertson has started documenting the experiences of others. \u201cWhen it was happening, I didn\u2019t understand what was going on,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to help people who were going through it. It started as a side project then turned into something in-depth, and I saw how many people were struggling.\u201d * * * Poppy Aithwaite 18, waitress/barmaid, Teesside I was eight months old when I developed alopecia and had no hair until I was about three. Then, from the age of three to 13, I had tiny bald patches behind my ears. I used to think it was the worst thing ever. At 13, it all fell out really quickly. I ended up with nothing. I think it was the stress of going to secondary school that triggered it. And being a teenager; your hormones are changing, too. At school I didn\u2019t want to be different, so I tried to hide it. Wearing a wig was horrendous. I was constantly scared: what if someone pulls it? What if someone thinks it\u2019s funny? I\u2019d get comments such as, \u201cShe\u2019s more bald than my dad.\u201d At the time, I couldn\u2019t talk about it. I just sobbed. It got to the point where I wouldn\u2019t get out of bed. I wouldn\u2019t eat, I wouldn\u2019t open my blinds. I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone. I dropped out of school when I was 15. I was a mess and I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. My mam\u2019s a hairdresser, so I started working with her, and at first I loved being able to do all these different things with everybody\u2019s hair, but over time it got harder. I switched to working in bars and restaurants instead, and started seeing a reiki healer. It sounds too good to be true, but she got rid of all my pain. Since then my confidence has just grown. One summer, the place where I was working was boiling and rammed. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid. I feel as if I just woke up one day and something had clicked. I\u2019ve heard all the names that anyone\u2019s going to call me by now. If they see me as \u201cthat baldy lass\u201d, so what? Instagram helped, too. There are many different types of hair loss, whether that be patches or total baldness. There\u2019s everything there for people to see. I model for a wig company, and at first I was scared about the pictures being posted. Then I thought, why am I bothered? I want them to see how happy I am. I don\u2019t want to be that depressed person who loses their hair, I want to be that young girl who inspires people to be who they are. Having alopecia and being in relationships has never been a problem. I\u2019m gay and it\u2019s easier being with a girl. Girls are more understanding. I\u2019ve got a drawer full of wigs. One day I\u2019ve got brown hair, the next I\u2019ve got pink. When I first lost my hair, I felt as if my identity had been ripped away. Now I can be who I want to be. * * * Michael Taylor 27, tech worker, Berlin I used to have a very luscious beard and my alopecia began with a fingerprint-sized hole on my chin. I actually found it endearing. I would walk around work and say: \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d Shortly afterwards, I moved to Berlin for a promotion, and within six months I needed to shave completely. Then I got a patch around the crown of my head. I went to the barber and it was a really uncomfortable experience. He showed me the back of my head in the mirror and there were many patches forming. I realised that this was going to change my life permanently. When I came back to London for my Christmas break, I went to the local barbershop with one of my best friends, and got my head shaved. I remember seeing a mole on the back of my head for the first time, which was interesting. Then I walked out, feeling very cold and a little bit shaken. I think I had a genetic predisposition to alopecia, because there are autoimmune diseases in my family. But I also had a really traumatic year while I was losing my hair. I was adjusting to living in a new country; my long-term relationship fell apart; I lost my dog. Suddenly I was single, without any friends. I was withdrawn for a while. I was mourning, essentially. And then I was dealing with this hair loss. For a while I tried very hard to reverse it naturally. For three months I gave up all of the good stuff in life: cigarettes, alcohol, sugar \u2013 even lots of vegetables that are considered inflammatory. I tried yoga and meditation. Now, I\u2019ve come out the other side and realised my own peace of mind is more important than sacrificing many things in the hope that I will get some regrowth. I have no way of knowing when or if I will get any, and I am OK with that, at least for now. I had a relatively weak hairline prior to that, so I don\u2019t miss the hair on my head very much. But I miss my beard and my facial hair. I can\u2019t lie about that. When you lose your eyebrows, it tips over into a space where people think that you are sick. But you have to see the funny side. I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps you get through the door. Online dating is a lot more difficult, because it is a purely visual medium. The best chance of meeting somebody is just being out and living life. Paradoxically, I am probably less self-conscious now. I think back to how I was, clinging on to that rubbish hairline. Now, I just find that hilarious. There is something liberating about shedding those concerns about how you look. * * * Rima Theisen 38, flight attendant, Margate My alopecia started six months after I had my second child. I had an itchy patch at the back that I kept scratching. I thought it was normal postpartum hair loss. I was in denial. I kept thinking: it\u2019s fine, it will grow back. Then one morning when I started to brush my hair, it was coming out in clumps. Four weeks later, I thought, sod it, it\u2019s got to come off. So, I shaved it all off and raised more than \u00a32,000 for Teenage Cancer Trust. When I found out that it wasn\u2019t going to grow back, it was a blow. Your hair is a part of your personality. I was always known for my really long, dark hair and I used to wear a huge bun at work. When I went back after maternity leave, I hadn\u2019t told anyone and they said: \u201cOh my God, are you OK? Are you ill?\u201d I just didn\u2019t want to wear a wig. I thought I would embrace this and be me. My hair was my thing \u2013 I never cut it \u2013 so it took me a long time to get used to looking at myself in the mirror. But I kept telling myself it was just a look. Some women choose to shave their heads. Losing my brows and lashes affected me more, because no one would choose to shave off their eyebrows and have no eyelashes. I would take those back in an instant over my head hair. Alopecia is a strange condition that nobody knows much about. It doesn\u2019t cause physical pain and it\u2019s not life-threatening, but people don\u2019t realise the mental impact. One of my biggest fears was that my husband would not find me attractive any more. It must be hard to be with someone who looks completely different from when you met them. He\u2019s been amazing, but when it came to having sex I felt really unattractive. I just didn\u2019t feel very womanly. I still get that sometimes, but I\u2019ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy. You just have to learn to trick your mind, to tell yourself that. I wear bigger earrings to compensate for the lack of hair. And I can still wear my uniform, put my red lipstick on and be \u201cthe different one\u201d at work. People used to say: \u201cOh, Rima with the hair.\u201d Now I\u2019m known for being the only bald female crew member out of 4,000. When you lose your hair, it\u2019s like losing your identity, really, and you have to get to know a whole new self. It does teach you who you are. Alopecia doesn\u2019t define my life, but it has made me realise what is important: my husband, my children, my confidence. * * * Laura Buckeridge actor, London I started losing my hair during my GCSEs, with a 2p-piece-sized patch on the back of my head. I just remember crying and crying, and then eventually going to the doctor. I was revising and very depressed. I wanted to be an actor, and my dad had said: \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s the nearest thing to prostitution.\u201d We were a very religious family, and I made the connection that, because my hair was falling out, God must be punishing me. My dad had this traditional West Indian mindset that \u201cyour hair is your beauty\u201d. In my teens I always had afros and plaits, so you couldn\u2019t see the alopecia. I shaved my head occasionally, and for my wedding, I was fine in front of hundreds of people in a big white dress, with a bald head and an ornate crown. I asked my husband: \u201cHow was I so strong then?\u201d and he said: \u201cYou just loved being different.\u201d But you can be a confident person and then something happens, and you think, I can\u2019t face it today. In the end, losing my hair took away my career. The whole thing about acting is your image. To walk in the door with nothing\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t do it. When I had children, the wigs came out. I didn\u2019t want to look weird for them. I\u2019d moved into a new area and the last thing I wanted was to stand out. At the playgroups, I was often the only black woman there. My husband is a white, middle-class man who is Oxford-educated, and I didn\u2019t want to have an impact on his career. I was playing the dutiful wife. It feels silly to say that alopecia robs you of your identity, but you just don\u2019t recognise yourself. When I put the wig on, I thought, oh, I remember her. I didn\u2019t tell anyone my hair wasn\u2019t real for years. I was clutching on to my hair on windy days, smiling when people said: \u201cYou\u2019ve changed your hair!\u201d thinking, really? You don\u2019t know? Then I went to see the film Black Panther, and there is a lovely scene where Danai Gurira\u2019s character takes her wig off and throws it across the room. I just thought: yes! Now I have stopped wearing a wig, because I felt I was living a lie. At first I was terrified, but I love being bald. This summer when I went \u201ctopless\u201d I was able to spend the whole two weeks in the pool. And whenever there is another bald black woman, they tend to come up and we have a lovely chat. You have to be strong, because people stare. You think: why are they staring? Oh yes, I\u2019m black. And bald. I forgot. I do a lot of work in schools and there\u2019s no better education than seeing a black woman who can speak in public, who is bald, and it is normal. I hope that I empower people. I look good without a wig. I\u2019m happy. * * * Alice Peck 29, works for the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s Award programme, Bristol My alopecia started more than three years ago. I was working in a job with some very burned-out co-workers, and I was badly bullied. I was young, idealistic and hopeful about where I wanted my life to go, so I wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of experience. I began to notice little patches, and at the time I thought it was nothing. I thought it was stress-related and that it would go away. In the subsequent two years, those patches became bigger, then I got some regrowth and it fell out again. The uncertainty was difficult. I was very paranoid. I was obsessed with this idea that everyone was staring at me. Every day I\u2019d cover my hair over the bald patches, and pencil in eyebrows. By this time I was working in refugee camps in Larissa in northern Greece, and it was very difficult to acknowledge my own struggle. I was waking up with a pillow full of hair, then doing stressful humanitarian work. There was shame that I was even struggling, then the shame of looking so different, and feeling so weird and alone. I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it because the situations we were facing were so much bigger than mine. I left Greece after realising that my health was really being affected by the stress. I went back to my parent\u2019s house for the first time in 10 years and lived there. By then, my hair was falling out in clumps and I decided to shave it off. Since doing that, it hasn\u2019t always been easy, but I feel much more in control. I took charge of it rather and being a victim. I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate. Trying to \u201cown\u201d my baldness is the way I cope with it. I wear more makeup now than I did before and I wear more statement earrings. Seeing other women with buzzed heads or who rock their baldness is empowering. I date men and women, and I think with women it\u2019s much more acceptable to look different. With men, there seems to be a more shallow idea of what women should look like, or so I think. I had eating disorders in my 20s, so I\u2019ve never really felt so comfortable in my body. Alopecia has forced me to confront my own image so, in a way, I\u2019m grateful for it. The only hair I didn\u2019t lose was my armpit hair, which is quite funny. Now I\u2019m very proud of it. * * * Elena McGowan 52, volunteer and stay-at-home mum, Jersey My hair first fell out when I was 30, and it made me really miserable. I tried a couple of medical routes and quickly realised nothing could be done. I felt awful. I didn\u2019t really talk to anyone about it and nobody saw me without hair, even my husband. I hid it away. I thought I looked like an alien. I had a job in a customer-facing role in a bank, so I had to literally put on my wig and put on a face and be the person that people were expecting to see. The first day I went in with my wig, this guy came in and said: \u201cOh Elena, what have you done to your hair?\u201d I burst into floods of tears, ran to the loo and was there for about half an hour, trying to compose myself. Also, when you\u2019ve got a bit of hair, you don\u2019t have control of where your wig is. I was always worrying about whether it was straight or not. It puts you in a state of heightened anxiety. At work I was putting on a brave front, but at home I wasn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror for a long time, because I didn\u2019t recognise myself. Then my hair started to grow back and I was able to ditch the wigs, until about three years ago when it started to thin again. For a couple of weeks I was in utter despair. I thought, I can\u2019t face going through this again: it\u2019s so unfair. Just go away. Leave me alone. By then I was a mum. So I thought, actually, no. Hair is important, but there\u2019s more to life. And I shaved my head. The internet didn\u2019t exist when I had alopecia the first time, but when I Googled it this time I was amazed. There\u2019s so much stuff. I started a support group in Jersey and it\u2019s had an amazingly positive impact on my life. It\u2019s lovely to be able to help people get out of the place of despair where everybody starts, to a place of acceptance and happiness. Now, putting my hair on is the last thing I\u2019ll do before I walk out of the door, and quite often I don\u2019t notice whether I have it on or not. I keep my wig in the kitchen on a champagne bottle. Why not? I\u2019m grateful I\u2019ve got alopecia. Beauty is not all about the outside. And being able to teach that to my daughter, who\u2019s growing up in a complicated world, is a gift. * * * Ranjit Senghera-Marwaha 49, NHS manager, Bromsgrove If you\u2019re an Asian woman growing up, your mum will always make you plait your hair. In the 1970s it was two plaits with a centre parting, and my parting started getting wider. I thought it was linked to eczema, so I modified my hairstyle to accommodate it. Then in my 20s, the doctor said: \u201cIt\u2019s alopecia. There\u2019s no cure for it, it\u2019s to do with your immune system.\u201d Losing my husband at a younger age was probably the biggest trigger, but it didn\u2019t affect me until about two years afterwards. At one point my mum and sister were poorly; I was busy looking after them and my hair came back for two years. Then as soon as they got better, it started to fall out again. I was at my baldest in 2017. I couldn\u2019t look in the mirror, because it just wasn\u2019t me. After my eyelashes fell out, my eyes were swollen all the time, and I was getting allergic reactions. It\u2019s a constant battle. Wearing a wig is like wearing a tight swimming cap. I can\u2019t wait to get it off. Sometimes at work, I have to go to the toilet, take it off, hang it up, calm my head down, then put it all back on. And wigs stop you from doing certain things. It was hard to date. I used to sabotage relationships, purely because I\u2019d be thinking, how the hell do I explain? He\u2019ll go to kiss me and the wig will come off. The first time I was with my current partner and my scarf came off, I couldn\u2019t stop crying because I just didn\u2019t want him to see the real me. I felt embarrassed. I felt ugly. But on the other hand, I wanted somebody to give me a chance to show that this doesn\u2019t define me. I wear my wig because I don\u2019t want people looking at me and making judgments. People see guys with bald heads and think it\u2019s part of the ageing process, or he\u2019s decided to shave his head and, actually, he looks quite sexy. They won\u2019t necessarily see the same in a woman. They think: what\u2019s happened to her? I\u2019d like my hair to grow back, because it\u2019s part of my identity, and I wouldn\u2019t have to wear wigs any more. And nothing beats feeling the breeze through your hair. I miss that. People say: \u201cIt\u2019s only hair!\u201d and I\u2019m like: really? I wish there was someone who said: \u201cThat must be hard. How do you feel about that? Is there anything you need?\u201d * * * Raymond Shek 36, business data analyst, Leicester From the age of 10, I had a small, fist-sized bald patch at the back of my head. I was quite self-conscious about being different, but my school allowed me to wear a baseball cap. I was picked on, but not a lot. I was probably lucky; the friends I had weren\u2019t bullies. They were quite encouraging. I put up with wearing a cap for a few years, but after a while, I just got fed up with it. My friends would say: \u201cOh, you\u2019re not wearing your hat today,\u201d but I didn\u2019t think twice. I was confident in myself, even with a bald patch. When I hit 20, it all fell out within two weeks and stayed the same for eight years. At that age, I thought, what the heck, who cares? I\u2019ll just shave it off. At least then, when I woke up in the morning, I wouldn\u2019t find clumps of hair on my pillow. At first my scalp was quite pale but after a couple of weeks in the sun it evened out, so it just looked normal after that. But it does impact your life. Not having eyelashes, if you walk past a building site, dust gets in your eyes. My scalp is quite sensitive and if anything like a woolly hat touches it, it gets really itchy. So it gets cold in winter. I have tried dating apps and had no luck on that. People judge on appearances and it\u2019s not until they meet me that they see that I am quite a lively sort of person. When I meet new people I say: \u201cMy name\u2019s Ray, or you can call me the bald Chinese guy.\u201d I think I am the only bald Chinese guy in Leicester. Rather than having people say that to me, I\u2019m saying it first. I\u2019m quite a relaxed, chilled person, and if you have questions about my baldness, don\u2019t be afraid: ask. People do sometimes. Once, in the supermarket, the security guard asked, \u201cHow do you always get your head so smooth? What do you use?\u201d which was quite funny. Alopecia has saved me money on haircuts, buying razor blades to shave my face, buying loads of shampoo. On that side, I think it is brilliant. People stare at me sometimes, but I don\u2019t judge them for it. I don\u2019t really care what they think. They don\u2019t know the story. If they want to take the mick out of me, then that\u2019s their problem. I feel comfortable with my own identity. Before this project I thought I was quite alone in this. Now I\u2019ve found out that there is a community out there, I\u2019d like to help other people with alopecia. If young kids can see adults with alopecia being secure about themselves, that will help them feel more comfortable with themselves, too.

So how do healthcare professionals decide who to treat? </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Patients with underlying conditions and elderly patients, who stand less chance of surviving the cornavirus outbreak, are not being treated in favour of younger healthier people who have more chance of recovery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The basic principle being applied in Italy is one we are all familiar with \u2013 a form of utilitarianism \u2013 which aims at maximising the number of lives saved. This approach does not value any one life over another \u2013 all lives are equally valuable \u2013 but it does say that we should focus resources where they are likely to save the most lives. This means prioritising for treatment those people who are most likely to benefit from the treatment and recover quickly enough to vacate the bed and allow the next person in. This way, more lives are saved overall.</p> <p>This may be anathema to those of us, including myself, who intuitively prefer a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d queuing system. That seems familiar, impartial, equitable and fair. That may well be the best strategy in normal times \u2013 but a pandemic is not normal. It is an emergency, and while emergencies do not call for a suspension of ethics, they do call on us to revisit our priorities \u2013 and that will always be horribly uncomfortable.</p> <p>Consider that the person first in the queue suffering from Covid-19 is an older \u2013 but not elderly \u2013 person, with an underlying lung condition that means they need critical care. Treatment would not be futile \u2013 it might save their life \u2013 but to choose to treat them would require an extended period of critical care and the outcome would be uncertain. The next two people in the queue are of similar age and have been hit hard by the virus, but they do not suffer with underlying lung problems. They are more likely to survive.</p> <p>They also need critical care to get them over the worst effects of the virus, but because they have no underlying health conditions they will pass out of the danger zone faster, meaning that both of them are likely to be saved in less time, and for less resource, than it would take to try to save the first patient. In this scenario, assuming that all three cannot be given critical care, it appears to make sense to treat the person who will take up fewer resources with a more certain outcome and free up the bed faster.</p> <p>There is something very intuitively plausible about a system that aims to save as many lives as possible. But the way to do this is to do what Italy has done, and prioritise those who are most likely to survive. The knock-on effect is that elderly people and those with underlying health conditions \u2013 who are less likely to benefit from treatment and would take longer to see benefits \u2013 might not receive treatment. This is a gut-wrenching consequence. It is a conclusion that, ultimately, says some people should be left to die.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/elderly-relatives-coronavirus-advice\">How to give your elderly relatives coronavirus advice: a doctor\u2019s view | Rachel Clarke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But we cannot expect to be comfortable in scenarios like this. This kind of situation places us in a genuinely dilemmatic situation in which we have good reasons to be obliged to try to save all lives, but we are nonetheless forced by circumstance to choose who to try to save. Whatever we choose to do, we will be doing something wrong \u2013 and that is a defining feature of a genuine moral dilemma. No one should be comfortable with this kind of conclusion. If we do end up here, by taking this kind of decision we will not win. We will all lose in some way. </p> <p>It is also worth remembering that the people who would have to make these triage decisions are the clinicians on the frontline. They will have an impossible job, and yet they will do it. These are the people who will bear the brunt of this dilemma \u2013 day in, day out \u2013 and who will be having to make the decisions that may leave them feeling instinctively that they have done something wrong. They will be facing the families of those who have died or are dying, and explaining to them why they made no effort to save them. This will come at a cost \u2013 and that itself requires an ethical response.</p> <p>When we think about ethics in healthcare, a key principle is avoiding harm and suffering. Here, however, there is no avoiding harm. All we can do is try to mitigate it, and if we cannot mitigate it completely then we need to be understanding and accept \u2013 desperately hard though it is \u2013 that not everyone can be saved. This is something we already know \u2013 we just try not to think about it. In a pandemic like this, however, we cannot help but confront it head on.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Jonathan Ives is deputy director of the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at the University of Bristol</p>",

      "bodyText": "Italy is facing serious challenges, with demand for critical care far outstripping supply. Health officials there are having to make very difficult decisions about who to treat \u2013 in the knowledge that deciding not to treat will very likely lead to death. On Thursday the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care, issued guidelines advising doctors how to deploy scarce resources when the need for them is outstripped by the demand of critically ill patients. The guidelines state that priority should be given to those who have, first, \u201cgreater likelihood of survival and, second, who have more potential years of life\u201d. As a result, patients with underlying conditions and elderly patients, who are deemed to stand less chance of surviving the virus, may not be treated in favour of healthier and/or younger people who have more chance of recovery. In the coming months we may face a similar situation in the UK where we do not have the resources necessary to treat all people who will catch Covid-19. So how do healthcare professionals decide who to treat? The basic principle being applied in Italy is one we are all familiar with \u2013 a form of utilitarianism \u2013 which aims at maximising the number of lives saved. This approach does not value any one life over another \u2013 all lives are equally valuable \u2013 but it does say that we should focus resources where they are likely to save the most lives. This means prioritising for treatment those people who are most likely to benefit from the treatment and recover quickly enough to vacate the bed and allow the next person in. This way, more lives are saved overall. This may be anathema to those of us, including myself, who intuitively prefer a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d queuing system. That seems familiar, impartial, equitable and fair. That may well be the best strategy in normal times \u2013 but a pandemic is not normal. It is an emergency, and while emergencies do not call for a suspension of ethics, they do call on us to revisit our priorities \u2013 and that will always be horribly uncomfortable. Consider that the person first in the queue suffering from Covid-19 is an older \u2013 but not elderly \u2013 person, with an underlying lung condition that means they need critical care. Treatment would not be futile \u2013 it might save their life \u2013 but to choose to treat them would require an extended period of critical care and the outcome would be uncertain. The next two people in the queue are of similar age and have been hit hard by the virus, but they do not suffer with underlying lung problems. They are more likely to survive. They also need critical care to get them over the worst effects of the virus, but because they have no underlying health conditions they will pass out of the danger zone faster, meaning that both of them are likely to be saved in less time, and for less resource, than it would take to try to save the first patient. In this scenario, assuming that all three cannot be given critical care, it appears to make sense to treat the person who will take up fewer resources with a more certain outcome and free up the bed faster. There is something very intuitively plausible about a system that aims to save as many lives as possible. But the way to do this is to do what Italy has done, and prioritise those who are most likely to survive. The knock-on effect is that elderly people and those with underlying health conditions \u2013 who are less likely to benefit from treatment and would take longer to see benefits \u2013 might not receive treatment. This is a gut-wrenching consequence. It is a conclusion that, ultimately, says some people should be left to die. But we cannot expect to be comfortable in scenarios like this. This kind of situation places us in a genuinely dilemmatic situation in which we have good reasons to be obliged to try to save all lives, but we are nonetheless forced by circumstance to choose who to try to save. Whatever we choose to do, we will be doing something wrong \u2013 and that is a defining feature of a genuine moral dilemma. No one should be comfortable with this kind of conclusion. If we do end up here, by taking this kind of decision we will not win. We will all lose in some way. It is also worth remembering that the people who would have to make these triage decisions are the clinicians on the frontline. They will have an impossible job, and yet they will do it. These are the people who will bear the brunt of this dilemma \u2013 day in, day out \u2013 and who will be having to make the decisions that may leave them feeling instinctively that they have done something wrong. They will be facing the families of those who have died or are dying, and explaining to them why they made no effort to save them. This will come at a cost \u2013 and that itself requires an ethical response. When we think about ethics in healthcare, a key principle is avoiding harm and suffering. Here, however, there is no avoiding harm. All we can do is try to mitigate it, and if we cannot mitigate it completely then we need to be understanding and accept \u2013 desperately hard though it is \u2013 that not everyone can be saved. This is something we already know \u2013 we just try not to think about it. In a pandemic like this, however, we cannot help but confront it head on. \u2022 Dr Jonathan Ives is deputy director of the Centre for Ethics in Medicine at the University of Bristol",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me for today. Lots happened, quite how much of it will matter in the long run remains to be seen. All eyes now on the response to New Zealand\u2019s travel restrictions and the impact they will have on domestic leagues. For more on that, and the rest of the day\u2019s sporting news Megan Maurice will be on deck tomorrow. An absorbing, incident-packed game ends in favour of Souths - just. NRL: 79 mins: Rabbitohs 22-18 Sharks - Cronulla cross in the left corner, but it\u2019s ruled out - correctly - for a forward pass! Morris was needlessly ahead of the ball in acres of space as play was swung from right to left. Huge let-off for Souths. NRL: 73 mins: Rabbitohs 22-18 Sharks - It has been a chaotic end to this match with both teams coughing up the ball unnecessarily and the Rabbitohs looking a shadow of the side that cruised through the opening hour. NRL: 67 mins: Rabbitohs 22-18 Sharks - Game very much on! What a finish from Katoa! His second in as many minutes, leaping like a salmon upstream from about five metres from the line to avoid crossing into touch. More superb play in the build-up from Johnson. NRL: 65 mins: Rabbitohs 22-14 Sharks - Beautiful try from Cronulla. Shaun Johnson flings a wicked pass out to the right wing where Sione Katoa holds on after a juggle to skip over in the corner. Game back on. It ends goalless in Kogarah, but Steve Corica is wondering how, after a second one-on-one in a matter of minutes goes begging. With the final kick of the match Trent Buhagiar was clean through after superb work from Milos Ninkovic, but he rolled his shot wide of the post. For Sydney, it\u2019s a point closer to an inevitable premiership. Perth remain locked in a scrap for a home final but after four games without a win are starting to look over their shoulder at the chasing pack rather than up towards the Asian Champions League qualification places. The Tigers remain winless and bottom of Conference A, but the Saints celebrate their second win of the season and move up to 5th in Conference B - still some way short of the finals. Caitlin Greiser did the damage with 3.1. NRL: 50 mins: Rabbitohs 22-8 Sharks - They can score tries with 12 men so 13 almost seems unfair. The Bunnies are bouncing in the big NSW derby. A-League: 87 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - Clearest chance of the match so far but Reddy repels Ninkovic one-on-one. The Sydney star was clean through following a massive punt upfield from Redmayne but the Glory stopper was equal to the challenge. NRL: 45 mins: Rabbitohs 16-8 Sharks - The Rabbitohs are back to their full complement of players and they\u2019ll be delighted to have escaped Roberts\u2019 sin-bin with their lead intact. A-League: 80 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - Still goalless with around ten minutes remaining at Kogarah. Chances have been at a premium all afternoon. AFLW: 3QT: St Kilda 4.5 (29) v 0.2 (2) Richmond - It\u2019s turning into a joyous occasion for the Saints, on track for just their second victory in AFLW. The lowly Sunwolves matched it with the mighty Crusaders for about an hour but the champions still ran out convincing winners. Who knows how much it matters in the grand scheme of things? NRL: HT: Rabbitohs 16-8 Sharks - Calamity for Cronulla! Despite the man advantage they concede a try in the shadow of half-time. Souths darted down the short-side left from a play-the-ball 10m from the line and it ends with Campbell Graham touching down in the corner. A-League: 56 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - The visitors almost steal a lead but Bruno Fornaroli can\u2019t redirect his header on target after loitering on the six-yard box, feeding off the scraps, following a corner. NRL: 33 mins: Rabbitohs 10-8 Sharks - Souths have been on top for the opening half-hour but they\u2019ve just seen James Roberts sent to the sin-bin and almost immediately Cronulla take advantage, ripping from right to left before Wade Graham bursts over the line. AFLW: HT: St Kilda 2.1 (13) v 0.2 (2) Richmond - The Tigers narrowed the margin in the second quarter but the Saints remain in pole position for a rare victory. A-League: HT: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - The scoreline is goalless but it\u2019s been an entertaining half of A-League football. Luke Brattan has been instrumental and he thought he\u2019d opened the scoring, only for VAR to find a handball and rule out his effort. He later whipped in a superb free-kick that Rhyan Grant clipped over the bar. At the other end Diego Castro should have done better but he stumbled with a clear sight of goal. NRL: 13 mins: Rabbitohs 6-2 Sharks - After Cronulla opened the scoring with a penalty Souths have hit the front courtesy of a converted Adam Reynolds try. NRL: We\u2019re underway in the big NSW blockbuster between Souths and the Sharks. All eyes on any politicians in the stands... AFLW: QT: St Kilda 2.1 (13) v 0.0 (0) Richmond - It\u2019s a match that\u2019s unlikely to trouble the finals but St Kilda won\u2019t mind as they take a handy lead into quarter-time. Super Rugby: HT: Sunwolves 7-14 Crusaders - The Sunwolves levelled matters at 7-7 but it didn\u2019t remain that way for long with the competition heavyweights restoring their advantage shortly before the siren. A-League: 18 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - Best moment of the match so far sees Caceres draw a good save from Reddy after the Sydney midfielder darted down the right-hand side of the box. Le Fondre thought he was in with the follow-up but he had crept offside. Quite how the A-League, NRL, and Super Rugby authorities are going to cope with New Zealand\u2019s recent restrictions on movement is anyone\u2019s guess. A-League: 10 mins: Sydney FC 0-0 Perth Glory - A neat opening ten minutes in Kogarah with both sides moving the ball nicely around the pitch without creating much in the way of goalmouth action. Kosta Barbarouses fashioned Sydney\u2019s best opening with a turn that left Alex Grant for dead, while Joel Chianese has offered the most at the other end. A-League: We\u2019re underway in the first A-League fixture of the day with premiers-elect Sydney FC hosting the side they beat in last year\u2019s grand final, Perth Glory. Super Rugby: 30 mins: Sunwolves 0-7 Crusaders - In the day\u2019s second Super Rugby contest the Crusaders are into an early lead, not that it\u2019s likely to matter too much in the long run. The Waratahs continued their perfect start to the Super W season by thrashing last-placed RugbyWA at Sydney University. Maya Stewart dominated, running in four successive tries either side of the interval. Huge win for the Pies on the road in Queensland, weathering Brisbane\u2019s storm in the third quarter and streaking away to a finals-boosting victory. A comfortable start to the season for the Knights at a wet and windy Hunter Stadium. An uncomfortable start, and perhaps finish, to the season for the Warriors. AFLW: 3QT: Brisbane 2.1 (14) v 3.10 (28) Collingwood - The Lions are digging deep and outscored the Pies two goals to nil that quarter but they still have plenty of ground to make up in the final term. 20 tackles to six in favour of Brisbane in that third quarter a clear indication of the increased intensity. NRL: 60 mins: Knights 20-0 Warriors - Newcastle are in cruise control. A thumping bonus point victory for the Blues at home to the Lions, but what it actually means in context of the Super Rugby season remains to be seen given the New Zealand government\u2019s announcement earlier today. NRL: 50 mins: Knights 14-0 Warriors - Newcastle\u2019s lead is out to 14-0 courtesy of a couple of second-half penalties. That early Veronica Latsko goal proved enough for Sydney FC to reach their seventh W-League grand final. The defending champions bounced back from a 3-1 defeat in the same fixture last weekend to hold their nerve despite an onslaught on their goal in the second half. AFLW: HT: Brisbane 0.1 (1) v 3.7 (25) Collingwood - The Magpies are having a day out at Hickey Park. Brisbane, second in Conference A, are staring at only their second defeat of the season, against a rampant Collingwood, fourth in Conference B. Brittany Bonnici leads the way for the Pies with 14 disposals while last week\u2019s star Chloe Molloy is in the goals once again. NRL: HT: Knights 10-0 Warriors - It\u2019s wet and windy in Newcastle and the Warriors are enduring the matchday from hell. 40 minutes left in the match, and perhaps for the NRL season, for the Kiwi visitors. W-League: 68 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - The second half has been all Victory but their dominance of territory and possession has yet to convert into an equaliser. The latest chance falls to Ayres but her curling effort from the edge of the box floats agonisingly wide. NRL: 22 mins: Knights 10-0 Warriors - This really is a day to forget for the Warriors. Their season is likely over just as it\u2019s begun, and in the one match they\u2019re going to complete they\u2019re already two tries behind and have a man in the bin. And, with armageddon creeping over the horizon, a quick whip around the grounds: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - It\u2019s all Victory in the early stages of the second-half but the Sky Blues remain ahead in the W-League semi-final. Blues 22-10 Lions - It\u2019s going according to script in Super Rugby at half-time. Knights 6-0 Warriors - Newcastle are on top in horrendous conditions in the NRL, midway through the firs-half. Coronavirus: The knock-on effects of the New Zealand government restrictions on Australian sport are obvious. Super Rugby is going to be hit hard. The Phoenix in the A-League and Warriors in the NRL are also going to suffer major disruption. Cricket: Breaking news - the Australia v NZ ODI series is now off after just one of the three matches. This coincides with New Zealand announcing a 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers to NZ from all countries bar the Pacific as of midnight Sunday. FFA Cup: Craig Foster continues to demonstrate he is an ornament to Australian football. W-League: HT: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - Victory began brightly but after Latsko put Sydney FC ahead this semi-final has been played largely on the Sky Blues\u2019 terms. Super Rugby: 20 mins: Blues 8-7 Lions - A converted Dan Kriel try briefly put the visitors in the lead but the Blues hit back swiftly with an Otere Black penalty. W-League: 35 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - A stoppage in play after Latsko receives a ball to the mush at close range. The doctor and physio are both on the field conducting a thorough concussion protocol before play continues. The TV broadcast has the benefit of Kate Gill on commentary, the deputy CEO of the players\u2019 union, and involved in helping draw up that policy. Super Rugby: 8 mins: Blues 5-0 Lions - The Blues, second-last in the New Zealand Conference despite a 4-2 win-loss record, are on their way to 5-2 with an early try against the Lions. The Johannesburg outfit are rooted to the foot of the South Africa Conference and look unlikely to improve their status in Auckland. W-League: 28 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - Victory again fail to capitalise on a decent opening but Ayres doesn\u2019t commit to attacking a Beard cross and Bledsoe claims. Coronavirus: Naturally, thoughts are turning to the role of sport in times of crisis and how to put the disruption to making sporting events into some kind of context. This is irrelevant. One benefit of force majeure is a sense of perspective, a reminder that football remains essentially a business of propelling a leather sphere into a netted rectangle. There is nothing to stop games resuming once public health advice allows it. On the other hand it may make better sense simply to dead-head the season. The circus will simply have to fit itself into the margins. W-League: 20 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC - Since the goal Huerta has enjoyed a couple of half-chances on the break as Sydney consolidate their advantage. Coronavirus: A reminder that if you are unsure of the state of play of major sporting activity around Australia, you can find out more via the links below. The situation throughout the rest of the world is here: W-League: GOAL! Melbourne Victory 0-1 Sydney FC (Latsko, 14) - Victory have looked the likelier in these early exchanges but they have gone behind after Veronica Latsko stole in at the front post to convert a teasing in-swinging Ally Green cross from the right. W-League: 12 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Sydney FC Victory should be in front but Longo shoots tamely at Bledsoe from just inside the box after terrific hold-up play from Dowie. Victory have the gusty wind at their back this first half so they\u2019ll be keen to make it count. Dowie, incidentally, has just been booked for absolutely nothing. Genuinely mystifying, especially so early in the match. Cricket: In other actual sporting news, Australia rebounded from their ODI humbling in South Africa by defeating New Zealand behind closed doors at the SCG. Adam Zampa once again starred with the ball, dismissing Kane Williamson with a mighty googly. W-League: 5 mins: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Sydney FC Victory have made a tidy start, creating a couple of decent early openings but neither Natasha Dowie nor Haley Hanson forced Aubrey Bledsoe into action. W-League: Victory have timed their season to perfection. They spent the first seven rounds outside the top four and only climbed into the top three in the penultimate week, eventually finishing in a season-high second courtesy of a 3-1 win over - you guessed it - Sydney FC in the last round. That result means Victory, not Sydney host today\u2019s semi at a windswept Epping Stadium. W-League: Here are your line-ups for today\u2019s semi-final. For Victory, Sham Khamis has joined as an injury replacement after Teagan Micah picked up a knock while on international duty. While Ally Green and Natalie Tobin come in for the Sky Blues. Hello everybody and welcome to another action packed edition of Sportwatch. This is comfortably the most surreal session of live-blogging I am ever likely to undertake. As I\u2019m sure you are aware there is plenty happening around the country, and the world, with the Covid-19 situation unfolding by the minute. Improbably, against this backdrop, the show must go on. Despite sporting competitions around the world suspending activity - and sport in Australia facing some restrictions now and further on Monday - we find ourselves in a brief window where leagues that wish to operate can do so relatively unencumbered. So, that means the W-League semi-final between Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC will go ahead at 2pm. There\u2019ll be Super Rugby with the Blues v Lions (2.25pm), Sunwolves v Crusaders (4.35pm), and Reds v Bulls (7.15pm). There\u2019s also Super W action at 3.25pm when the Waratahs take on Rugby WA. The NRL is open for business from 3pm with Knights v Warriors, followed by the blockbuster Souths v Sharks clash at 5.30pm. This evening the Panthers host the Roosters at 7.35pm). The AFLW continues at 3.10pm with Brisbane v Collingwood, followed by St Kilda v Richmond at 5.10pm, then at 7.40pm Melbourne v Carlton. In the A-League there\u2019s a repeat of last year\u2019s grand-final when Sydney take on Perth at 5pm, with the action rounded out by Melbourne City and WSW at 7.30pm. Doubtless there\u2019ll be breaking news throughout the day as well. On with the show!",

The playing-Death-at-chess metaphor of <em>The Seventh Seal</em> is so easily parodied that many forget, or never find out, how nimble, poetic and drily funny Bergman\u2019s existential fantasy is.

August\u2019s effective, affecting film, a Palme d\u2019Or winner in its day, hasn\u2019t aged as strikingly, but the performance (left) still stuns. Von Sydow\u2019s international career, meanwhile, is a fascinating mixed bag, completing an impressive checklist of top-tier auteurs \u2013 from Martin Scorsese to Lars von Trier, David Lynch to Wim Wenders \u2013 though not always in top-tier roles. His best, most fully shaded English-language performances came in The Exorcist (on Chili) and Hannah and Her Sisters (Amazon), in which his funny but lacerating portrayal of bottomless depression proved a perfect spiritual foil to Woody Allen\u2019s more self-aware, Bergman-fixated Eeyore-ism. That\u2019s not to dismiss the deadpan camp of his aged-cheese villainy in Flash Gordon (free on Now TV, if you must) or Never Say Never Again (iTunes). Or even his surprisingly elegant, expressive Hollywood debut as Jesus Christ in the otherwise very stolid, very long mid-1960s biblical epic The Greatest Story Ever Told \u2013 on Amazon if you have a whole rainy afternoon to kill. That\u2019s a role impossible to play credibly without equal parts integrity and plunging reserves of darkness: from his first duel with Death to his final passing, Von Sydow had both. New to streaming &amp; DVD this week 21 Bridges (Sony, 15) A surprisingly tight and tidy police thriller that benefits from Chadwick Boseman\u2019s swaggering charisma, as a detective locking down Manhattan in pursuit of cop killers, to juice up its lean, B-movie plotting. Judy and Punch (Picturehouse, 15) Overlooked in cinemas, Mirrah Foulkes\u2019s flawed but invigorating debut gives the titular puppet panto an elaborate feminist spin, shifting into a mob-justice allegory that escalates in wild and unexpected ways. Them That Follow (Sony, 15) An unexpected post-Oscar role for Olivia Colman: as a snake-handling Pentecostal petrol station attendant in Appalachia, one of a sect oppressing a young woman (Alice Englert) in this slow-burning but luridly compelling indie. Sunday Bloody Sunday (BFI, 15) An excellent reissue of John Schlesinger\u2019s greatest film, a biting yet tender queer love triangle steeped in the contradictory sexual politics of early 1970s Britain, laden with extras including two early Schlesinger shorts. Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night (Eureka, PG) Finally available on Blu-ray, Sidney Lumet\u2019s 1962 film of the Eugene O\u2019Neill classic features Katharine Hepburn at her mightiest. It\u2019s not Lumet\u2019s most inspired film-making, but you won\u2019t see a better-acted version on stage.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve been reading US beauty magazines my entire adult life, but feel the Atlantic divide most acutely when they casually suggest \u201casking your dermatologist\u201d, as though all readers have a skin doctor on speed dial, waiting to advise on every line and pimple. The British system is, of course, entirely different, focused on free-at-the-point-of-delivery healthcare; any GP would rightly need to see a legitimate and unresponsive skin condition to even consider a referral to a consultant.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s still entirely reasonable to have concerns about skin, whether driven by health or vanity, and to want to seek expert help without dropping \u00a3250 for half an hour with a derm. It\u2019s also possible that a prescription-strength product (containing higher levels of active ingredients) will work beyond the reach of a retail equivalent.</p> <p>That\u2019s where <a href=\"https://www.dermatica.co.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-dHJpbbv5wIVg7TtCh2aLQPIEAAYASAAEgJ3L_D_BwE\" title=\"\"><strong>Dermatica</strong></a> rather ingeniously comes in. For a \u00a319.99 monthly subscription, UK clients can access dermatologists, doctors and pharmacists specialising in beauty-related skin concerns such as pigmentation, ageing, rosacea and acne, starting with a personalised online consultation based on uploaded photographs. A three-month routine is designed by a dermatologist, a prescription issued and relevant products mailed out with instructions on how to use them. Clever.</p> <p>But while prescription skincare can work wonders, it is for neither the fainthearted nor the half-arsed. Not everyone who thinks they want rid of a wrinkle realises that, actually, they might sooner take it over a prescription of tretinoin that renders skin flaky and dry for up to six weeks before anything improves. (That\u2019s if it can be tolerated at all.

The British system is, of course, entirely different, focused on free-at-the-point-of-delivery healthcare; any GP would rightly need to see a legitimate and unresponsive skin condition to even consider a referral to a consultant. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still entirely reasonable to have concerns about skin, whether driven by health or vanity, and to want to seek expert help without dropping \u00a3250 for half an hour with a derm. It\u2019s also possible that a prescription-strength product (containing higher levels of active ingredients) will work beyond the reach of a retail equivalent. That\u2019s where Dermatica rather ingeniously comes in. For a \u00a319.99 monthly subscription, UK clients can access dermatologists, doctors and pharmacists specialising in beauty-related skin concerns such as pigmentation, ageing, rosacea and acne, starting with a personalised online consultation based on uploaded photographs. A three-month routine is designed by a dermatologist, a prescription issued and relevant products mailed out with instructions on how to use them. Clever. But while prescription skincare can work wonders, it is for neither the fainthearted nor the half-arsed. Not everyone who thinks they want rid of a wrinkle realises that, actually, they might sooner take it over a prescription of tretinoin that renders skin flaky and dry for up to six weeks before anything improves. (That\u2019s if it can be tolerated at all. The internet has wrongly decided that what is, in effect, a strong retinol is the silver bullet for all skin woes, when it can often irritate and inflame.) If Dermatica\u2019s expertise appeals, but a specialist over-the-counter product better suits your lifestyle, comfort levels and timeframe, then the Skin Nerd is a good option. Here, an online Skype appointment with a well-trained, experienced consultant is \u20ac50 (\u00a343; your \u20ac25 follow-up deposit is redeemable on future appointments) and there\u2019s zero obligation to buy recommended products from the 27 high-quality and reputable brands on offer (including Environ, REN, Avene, NeoStrata, Murad and very good in-house brand Skingredients).

Instead they moved to the current system, persuading independent contracted farmers to take on this responsibility instead, and the system has reaped rich profits for those at the top. From 1981 to 2018, farm sales of chickens increased from <a href=\"https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT84800258/PDF\">$4.5bn </a> to <a href=\"https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/plva0519.pdf\">$31.7bn</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/03/is-the-us-chicken-industry-cheating-its-farmers\">Is the US chicken industry cheating its farmers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But contracts typically hand a remarkable amount of control to the parent company.

A mild winter followed by a warm, wet spring had turbocharged a ferocious mass of cow parsley, nettles and dense grass along the hundreds of miles of road his team maintains for Dorset council. Austerity meant there was barely enough money to pay for repeated cuttings to hold back the matted swards. Complaints poured in about messy roadsides.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The machinery] wouldn\u2019t go through it,\u201d says Nicholson, recalling the overspilling verges.</p> \n<p>But the chaos of that summer would prove an unlikely turning point for wildflowers and biodiversity in the English county. Vast stretches of roadside have been transformed. Where there were thick clumps of grass, there are low-growing wildflowers such as black medic, birds-foot trefoil and red clover. The verges are cut two or three times a year, not 12, saving the council tens of thousands of pounds. Butterflies and other invertebrates have returned in their droves.</p> \n<p>The reasons behind this unlikely mini-revolution for biodiversity are simple. When the worst of the 2014 growing season was over, ecologist Philip Sterling was brought in to oversee the council\u2019s service team. He and Nicholson, Dorset council\u2019s countryside and greenspace manager, set about applying the centuries-old principles of hay making to the management of verges, cul-de-sacs and urban grass patches across the county. It is a practice that has now been adopted by other counties in the UK, including in Lincolnshire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2ef1e72beb40802c13a94f5c6b4f78b0274875\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2ef1e72beb40802c13a94f5c6b4f78b0274875/0_0_4961_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eva Worobiec/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>In Sandford, Wareham, wildflowers are part of an initiative to provide an attractive habitat for butterflies and insects, while helping to cut the costs of roadside mowing.

But the medicinal pea-like flowers, whose seeds can cost more than \u00a32,000 a kilo from commercial providers, are not an extravagant token of the region\u2019s Olympic legacy.</p> \n<p>\u201cI harvested the seeds for that myself,\u201d says Sterling, recounting the painstaking task of growing enough kidney vetch at recycling centres and flood bunds since the early 90s. \u201cNow look how much there is.\u201d </p> \n<p>Since the road opened, more than half of the species of butterfly known to inhabit Britain have been recorded on the grasslands lining the road, including the Adonis blue and Chalkhill blue.

It\u2019s not impossible to do. We haven\u2019t gone beyond that tipping point where there is so little left that there\u2019s no point.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf half the species of butterfly in the UK can turn up on a road verge created less than 10 years ago, then we do have the capabilities to do this, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p> \n<p>But such enthusiasm for Britain\u2019s wildflowers are not apparent everywhere. Opposite a burger van in a ditch near Ely lies one of England\u2019s rarest plants, the only known native fenland ragwort plant.</p> \n<p>The critically endangered wildflower, which is supposedly protected by being on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is surrounded by faded McDonald\u2019s packaging and beer tins. The plant was only discovered when a French botanist from a nearby Cambridge research centre identified it while relieving himself in a layby in the 1960s, so the story goes.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was the first sighting of fen ragwort since the mid to late 19th century, so getting on for 100 years, more or less,\u201d says Tim Pankhurst, Plantlife\u2019s conservation manager for the east of England, as lorries storm pass on the road that links Ely and Newmarket.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s it for fen ragwort. This is the sole native site in Britain. A lonely roadside ditch at the back of a verge near Ely.\u201d</p> \n<p>The tall plant is a relic of how the fens, in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk, used to be: a vast expanse of marshland full of native birds and wildlife. Fen ragwort would have been torn up and moved around by flood waters, but since the region was drained in the 18th century, there\u2019s now only one known native site.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0e8e8835-fe99-4034-b030-5cb44867cb91\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Embrace shaggy lawns</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Grass needs to be three to four inches long for flowers such as clovers, daisies, selfheal and creeping buttercup to thrive. Prof Jane Memmott, president of the British Ecological Society, says we should drop our obsession with keeping everything tidy. \u201cI think bohemian untidiness is what we\u2019re aiming for \u2013 you don\u2019t want it to look like neglect.\" If gardeners can't wave goodbye to their manicured lawn, Buglife recommends leaving a strip of long grass and mowing it just once in autumn and spring.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> Don\u2019t mow over dandelions</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dandelions are a crucial source of food for early pollinators such as solitary bees, honey bees and hoverflies. Each dandelion head contains up to 100 individual flowers, known as florets, which contain large amounts of nectar and pollen.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Don\u2019t plant too many \u201cpompom-shaped\u201d flowers</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Old English roses and dahlias might look beautiful but they focus much of their energy on producing petals, leaving little nectar for insects. A good test to find out if a flower is insect-friendly is to see whether you can see the pollen and nectar parts without pulling the petals back. If they are visible, it\u2019s probably ok for pollinators, Memmott says.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Avoid decking and artificial grass</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The trend for artificial lawns threatens valuable habitats for a wide range of butterflies, bees and birds. Research from 2011 found that 7,423 acres of the UK\u2019s garden space had been lost over eight years and nearly all of this loss was down to people putting decking, concrete or artificial grass over their gardens.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Phoebe Weston</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Restoring wildflower meadows in the agricultural heartlands of the UK by creating a network of wildlife corridors has become a particular focus for conservationists.

Derek Scott, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, Henry Dymoke, a local farmer and landowner, and Mark Schofield, a conservation officer at Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, have developed a machine that could spread the cut and collect method around the country.</p> \n<p>Scott\u2019s company manufactures industry-standard machinery for vegetable washing, which is exported to every major agricultural economy. In 2018, Schofield convinced him to apply his engineering prowess to a pioneering tender by Lincolnshire County Council to create machinery that would allow the local authority to use the cut and collect method on hundreds of miles of road in the county.</p> \n<p>Crucially, the machinery had to be able to deliver the cuttings to an anaerobic digestion plant that could convert the grass into biogas, which is found at Dymoke\u2019s farm, Scrivelsby Estate.</p> \n<p>The Vergenair 5.5 verge harvesting system is a JCB tractor, an Italian suction flail and a Larrington trailer. The bespoke machinery trundles along the roadsides, cutting the grass and sucking it into the trailer which can take up to 10,000kg to the anaerobic digestion plant.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re replacing a natural process. We see fossil records of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/aug/01/aurochs-project-tauros-cro-magnon\">auroch</a>, the ancestor of the modern-day cow in cave paintings.

You can\u2019t unleash the auroch on the A158 but you can have an artificial beast that\u2019s a lot more manageable.\u201d</p> \n<p>The contraption allows the council to use the cut and collect, low fertility method across Lincolnshire and could go nationwide. But the project has come to an abrupt halt. The Environment Agency (EA) did not renew the permit for Lincolnshire to continue the trial due to concerns about waste codes and regulations.</p> \n<p>Because roadside verges are not being managed as a crop, they are formally classified as waste. To continue the project, Dymoke would have to purchase expensive new permits from the EA and invest thousands of pounds in upgrades to the anaerobic digestion plants.<br></p> \n<p>For now, Dorset and Lincolnshire lead an increasing number of councils in the quest to turn UK roadsides into the backbone of a nature recovery network where native plants and wildlife are free to re-emerge.</p> \n<p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",

Without that diversity of plants there, you don\u2019t get the diversity of other wildlife,\u201d he adds. One 4.5-mile stretch in Dorset shows what is possible: the Weymouth relief road. Opened in 2011 ahead of sailing events at the Olympics, the seven hectares (17 acres) of verges that line one of the busiest roads in the county have become a crucial site for biodiversity. Yellow clusters of kidney vetch, the only wildflower where the small blue, Britain\u2019s smallest butterfly, will lay its eggs, dominate the roadsides in the spring and summer. But the medicinal pea-like flowers, whose seeds can cost more than \u00a32,000 a kilo from commercial providers, are not an extravagant token of the region\u2019s Olympic legacy. \u201cI harvested the seeds for that myself,\u201d says Sterling, recounting the painstaking task of growing enough kidney vetch at recycling centres and flood bunds since the early 90s. \u201cNow look how much there is.\u201d Since the road opened, more than half of the species of butterfly known to inhabit Britain have been recorded on the grasslands lining the road, including the Adonis blue and Chalkhill blue. Sterling has 10kg of of kidney vetch seed ready in his office for when the Stonehenge tunnel gets approval . A Holly blue butterfly rests on a yellow kidney vetch. Photograph: MusicalJoe/Getty Images/iStockphoto \u201cIf you think about the species of butterfly that Weymouth relief road supports on seven hectares, what would it be like on a hundred hectares?\u201d says Nicholson excitedly. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity here in the UK to change what we\u2019ve currently got,\u201d says Sterling. \u201cWe can put back much of what we\u2019ve lost. It\u2019s not impossible to do. We haven\u2019t gone beyond that tipping point where there is so little left that there\u2019s no point. \u201cIf half the species of butterfly in the UK can turn up on a road verge created less than 10 years ago, then we do have the capabilities to do this, don\u2019t we?\u201d But such enthusiasm for Britain\u2019s wildflowers are not apparent everywhere. Opposite a burger van in a ditch near Ely lies one of England\u2019s rarest plants, the only known native fenland ragwort plant. The critically endangered wildflower, which is supposedly protected by being on a Site of Special Scientific Interest, is surrounded by faded McDonald\u2019s packaging and beer tins. The plant was only discovered when a French botanist from a nearby Cambridge research centre identified it while relieving himself in a layby in the 1960s, so the story goes. \u201cIt was the first sighting of fen ragwort since the mid to late 19th century, so getting on for 100 years, more or less,\u201d says Tim Pankhurst, Plantlife\u2019s conservation manager for the east of England, as lorries storm pass on the road that links Ely and Newmarket. \u201cThat\u2019s it for fen ragwort. This is the sole native site in Britain. A lonely roadside ditch at the back of a verge near Ely.\u201d The tall plant is a relic of how the fens, in Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Norfolk, used to be: a vast expanse of marshland full of native birds and wildlife. Fen ragwort would have been torn up and moved around by flood waters, but since the region was drained in the 18th century, there\u2019s now only one known native site. Restoring wildflower meadows in the agricultural heartlands of the UK by creating a network of wildlife corridors has become a particular focus for conservationists. The widest road verges in the country are in East Anglia, on the former drovers\u2019 roads once used to transport livestock to London and other major cities. Small stretches in Lincolnshire have been managed as roadside nature reserves since the 1960s. Nature recovery Seated around a table in a rural pub near Spalding in Lincolnshire is an unlikely trio of wildflower revolutionaries taking Plantlife\u2019s maintenance guidelines one step further. Derek Scott, an agricultural equipment manufacturer, Henry Dymoke, a local farmer and landowner, and Mark Schofield, a conservation officer at Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, have developed a machine that could spread the cut and collect method around the country. Scott\u2019s company manufactures industry-standard machinery for vegetable washing, which is exported to every major agricultural economy. In 2018, Schofield convinced him to apply his engineering prowess to a pioneering tender by Lincolnshire County Council to create machinery that would allow the local authority to use the cut and collect method on hundreds of miles of road in the county. Crucially, the machinery had to be able to deliver the cuttings to an anaerobic digestion plant that could convert the grass into biogas, which is found at Dymoke\u2019s farm, Scrivelsby Estate. The Vergenair 5.5 verge harvesting system is a JCB tractor, an Italian suction flail and a Larrington trailer. The bespoke machinery trundles along the roadsides, cutting the grass and sucking it into the trailer which can take up to 10,000kg to the anaerobic digestion plant. \u201cWe\u2019re replacing a natural process. We see fossil records of the auroch, the ancestor of the modern-day cow in cave paintings. Predators would drive them on from place to place, they\u2019d have routes to get to water and they\u2019d be moving from one bit of grazing to another bit of grazing,\u201d says Schofield. A suction flail is used to cut grass verges in Lincolnshire. Photograph: Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust \u201cHay cutting is our replacement for the wild auroch, the tarpan, the horse, the red deer. You can\u2019t unleash the auroch on the A158 but you can have an artificial beast that\u2019s a lot more manageable.\u201d The contraption allows the council to use the cut and collect, low fertility method across Lincolnshire and could go nationwide. But the project has come to an abrupt halt. The Environment Agency (EA) did not renew the permit for Lincolnshire to continue the trial due to concerns about waste codes and regulations. Because roadside verges are not being managed as a crop, they are formally classified as waste. To continue the project, Dymoke would have to purchase expensive new permits from the EA and invest thousands of pounds in upgrades to the anaerobic digestion plants. For now, Dorset and Lincolnshire lead an increasing number of councils in the quest to turn UK roadsides into the backbone of a nature recovery network where native plants and wildlife are free to re-emerge.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-pandemic-visualising-the-global-crisis\" title=\"\">coronavirus pandemic </a>surrounds us but Pearson has spent an hour discussing a dizzying range of subjects, including his mental health during a relegation dogfight as well as the remarkable turnaround he has engineered since taking over as Watford\u2019s manager in early December. Watford, having snapped Liverpool\u2019s long unbeaten record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/watford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">with a 3-0 thrashing</a> two weeks ago, are just above the relegation zone. Pearson knows their position remains precarious but he underlines far more serious concerns about coronavirus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/nigel-pearson-condemns-boris-johnson-lack-of-leadership-coronavirus-watford\">Nigel Pearson condemns Boris Johnson over 'lack of leadership' on coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pearson is also dealing with the rawest stages of grief, having lost his mother in January, but he is engaging company whether talking about emotional intelligence, attacking football or his Spotify playlists. Amid some diverse choices, Pearson also listens to classical music. He is interested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jan/14/classicalmusicandopera\" title=\"\">Shostakovich</a> and his liking for solitude rises up again as he says of the Russian composer: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t listen to Shostakovich with other people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson is a very good manager. He has a gift for simplifying the game and inspiring his team with a blend that he says is both brutal and attuned to his players\u2019 shifting emotions. But he is perhaps more complex than any other manager in English football. There is deep introspection at the heart of the 56-year-old \u2013 and even Pearson seems amused by his need for some seclusion from the Premier League rollercoaster.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We have to keep this in perspective, but for Liverpool it would be such a tragedy not to conclude the season</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cSometimes I just need to be out in nature,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much I need time on my own. We\u2019ve got a place in Devon and I joined the golf club there. It\u2019s very friendly and, as a new member, you get people saying: \u2018Come have a round with us.\u2019 I think: \u2018No, actually, I just wanna hit some balls on my own.\u2019 It makes me sound a right miserable sod. But it\u2019s just me finding some quiet time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Three days later, on Friday morning, we talk again. The Premier League has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-football-league-suspended-until-4-april-coronavirus\" title=\"\">just announced a suspension of all matches until 4 April</a>. Our earlier conversation about seclusion seems ironic now Pearson faces the stark possibility one of his players has the virus and that he and many others at the club could be facing a period of self-isolation. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s nicer to choose when and where you are isolated.\u201d Pearson says wryly. \u201cBut for now it\u2019s the right decision and it\u2019s relatively proactive \u2013 even if it was made under duress.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson is still mulling over his disappointment after watching Boris Johnson shuffling around the issue and avoiding any decision in regard to cancelling sporting events. \u201cI was totally underwhelmed by him last night,\u201d Pearson says of the prime minister, \u201cand by the lack of leadership and any clear messages. At times like this we need strong leadership and it\u2019s important people have as much information as possible and that any decisions are made for their well-being. They need to be made for humanitarian rather than financial reasons. Of course, the economy is going to be hit but that can\u2019t be the main priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>I ask Pearson what he and his players will do this weekend now Saturday\u2019s game against Leicester City, his former club, has been suspended. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the report on one player who is being tested for the virus. The players are not expected to report for training until next Thursday at the earliest. But we might have to reassess that. For now we just want them to look after themselves and their families at home \u2013 and also to make sure that if they feel ill they report it straight away. We\u2019ve just got to be vigilant and minimise the risk for everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson had told me earlier in the week that the idea of playing games behind closed doors was \u201can absolute nonsense\u201d and that it also put players, coaches and officials at unnecessary risk. In the likely event the pandemic will have escalated by 4 April, should the season be abandoned? \u201cWell, the longer it goes on the more difficult it will be to conclude the season. We have to keep this in perspective, of course, but for Liverpool it would be such a tragedy not to conclude the season. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. It could be that when we get to April we may be able to resume and go into the summer months. How it looks for football pales \u2013 not into insignificance \u2013 but we need perspective on real-life issues. But, yes, purely on a football basis it\u2019s going to throw up problems we\u2019ve not experienced in this country before.\u201d</p> \n<p>The result of the test on the Watford player suspected of having the virus will be known by Saturday at the latest, so is Pearson steeling himself for self-isolation? \u201cI would follow the recommendations like everyone else. It depends on the outcome of the test and that will have a knock-on effect on how I behave. We\u2019re just sitting tight at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f1f9dac9-f7b9-43be-b136-34ce50ad170d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rvx_kXEwGpA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Stepping away from coronavirus, Pearson reflects on the hidden impact of management on his mental health. \u201cIt can be quite damaging. I know I\u2019m good at this job but certain aspects aren\u2019t very good for me. It can be absolutely draining emotionally and mentally. You then can neglect yourself. Those are the dangerous times.\u201d</p> \n<p>How does Pearson replenish himself when there is always some Premier League drama to face? \u201cI have things I enjoy doing on my own. I\u2019ve also got better in talking to friends. One of my strengths is dealing with people but I like to be alone as well. I\u2019ve noticed being back in football that, after some anonymity, people recognise you again. It\u2019s a pain in the neck. My wife said to me yesterday, on a walk: \u2018When you wore glasses that used to be quite a good disguise. But now people recognise you straight away.\u2019 I\u2019m going to have to wear a false beard and moustache.\u201d</p> \n<p>During his last stint at Leicester, when he saved them from relegation the season before they shocked everyone and won the Premier League in 2016, Pearson could be prickly. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/30/nigel-pearson-leicester-sacked\" title=\"\">losing his job in June 2015</a> broadened his vision. He discovered hiking and painting. He read and worked on his history degree. After a year away Pearson went back into football and soon fell out with Mel Morris, the chairman of Derby County, in October 2017. For the next 11 months he drew breath away from the game before accepting an offer to manage OH Leuven in the Belgian second division. Pearson \u201cloved\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/10/nigel-pearson-interview-leuven-belgium-leicester-ostrich\" title=\"\">his time in Belgium</a>, where he helped design the kit and managed a team in front of average crowds of 4,500 for 17 months.</p> \n<p>His latest break lasted 10 months and three days before, on 6 December 2019, with Watford bottom of the table and having already fired two managers this season, Pearson accepted an unexpected invitation from Vicarage Road. \u201cI was curious and thought: \u2018Let\u2019s give it a real crack.\u2019 People said: \u2018It\u2019s a bit of a risk.\u2019 But where\u2019s the risk? A club that\u2019s got eight points and might score a goal every 400 minutes? You risk a relegation on your CV. The real risk is you regret not having a go.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his first game in charge, away to Liverpool, Watford played well, despite losing 2-0. They then won four and drew one of the next five games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/22/watford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">beating Manchester United </a>and Wolves while looking a different team. Before his arrival they had won one league game out of 13 and their goal difference was -18. How did he rejuvenate a moribund team?</p> \n<p>\u201cBeing positive. Giving direction. Simplifying. Encouraging people to look at what\u2019s possible. I get worn down by people telling you what you can\u2019t do or what the problems are. Go on, give us a solution then. As I say to the players: \u2018I pick you for what you can do, not what you can\u2019t do.\u2019 I make people feel part of a journey to which they can contribute.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"401520e405ebae9bf18268145eda07a81f35a4b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/401520e405ebae9bf18268145eda07a81f35a4b1/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watford manager Nigel Pearson puts his arm around Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu after the Hornets\u2019 3-0 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford in February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watford manager Nigel Pearson puts his arm around Watford\u2019s Gerard Deulofeu after the Hornets\u2019 3-0 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford in February 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pearson was once depicted as a ranting old-school manager \u2013 an English gaffer that gets called \u201ca proper football man\u201d \u2013 but the reality is different. He is a smart tactician who also stresses the importance of emotional intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to our success because footballers are people first and foremost. It\u2019s important that you\u2019ve got different types of people and it\u2019s my job to bring the best out of them. But I don\u2019t want to sound as if it\u2019s all touchy-feely stuff. Sometimes it can be blunt and brutal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet Pearson brings a light touch to his work. Before they outran, outworked and simply outplayed Liverpool, Pearson eased off in training that week. Watford did understated sessions, including a day of yoga and swimming. \u201cIt was spontaneous. As we went through the week we thought: \u2018Let\u2019s do something different.\u2019 But it\u2019s got to have authenticity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pearson gave Watford more solidity when he arrived by changing to 4-2-1-3 \u2013 with the idea that a more structured defence would unleash the team\u2019s attacking potential. Watford are fourth from bottom and, should this campaign recommence, Pearson insists they will keep attacking. This means he often replaces a defensive midfielder with a forward, even if Watford are leading. There have been 3-0 wins over Aston Villa, even after going down to 10 men, and Liverpool but they conceded last-minute winners at Villa Park and at home to Everton.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. I have a love-hate relationship with it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cWe need to win games,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we go gung-ho and take away the importance of solidity. But the way in which you play is dictated by what you have available and the situation you\u2019re in. We have pace and good attacking players but we can\u2019t be negligent. Sometimes we have to recognise that a point is great. But to give belief and hope we have to be positive and aggressive.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a relegation dogfight and we\u2019ve worked exceptionally hard to get back in contact with teams. Now we\u2019ve done that, results like last weekend\u2019s loss against Palace can feel a missed opportunity. But we can\u2019t dwell on disappointments. We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/crystal-palace-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">didn\u2019t take our chances against Palace </a>but we played OK. I have to detach myself from this emotional rollercoaster that everyone else is on.\u201d</p> \n<p>The more human backdrop is shaped by the fact Pearson lost his mum unexpectedly 10 weeks ago. He highlights the support of his wife, Nicky, and their adult son and daughter, James and Hannah, but he admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve found the right way of grieving yet. We\u2019re making sure we all rally around my dad. They were together 64 years. A long, long time. Mum was such an energetic, dynamic 84-year-old. She was the dominant figure in the family and so it\u2019s been difficult. It would\u2019ve been her 85<sup>th</sup> birthday next Wednesday. That\u2019s when we plan to scatter her ashes. So it\u2019s still very, very raw.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt happened on 28 December, the day of the Villa game, and straight after James said: \u2018We need to get ready quickly.\u2019 My mum had had a fall. The next few days were just backwards and forwards on the motorway. She died just a few days later, on the third. It was a huge shock. So now the focal point is my dad. I\u2019ve just lost my mum and I certainly don\u2019t want to lose my dad to [coronavirus]. It\u2019s going to be a further worry because the elderly are more at risk.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pearson visited his father on Monday evening, before the threat that the virus had reached the Watford camp had emerged. Now he knows that a fellow manager, Arsenal\u2019s Mikel Arteta, has coronavirus, is Pearson concerned he may also be affected and have passed it on to his 86-year-old dad? \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to presume that we may all have come into contact with someone who has got it. But it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how many have been exposed to it. That\u2019s not scaremongering. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Is Pearson finding a balance between looking after others both inside and outside the club while taking care of himself? \u201cI hope so. But the reality of it is, like a lot of people, I\u2019m good at giving advice, but not so much when taking it. I\u2019m trying to enjoy the job a bit more. But that\u2019s never easy because I have a love-hate relationship with it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"784248dc-94b4-4d26-9b0b-5f952a88b359\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KfRm-YggRH0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond the travails of a pandemic virus and a relegation battle, Pearson relaxes and shares a couple of his many pleasurable diversions. \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying doing the Guardian crossword since I joined Leicester first time around [in 2008]. I try to do the quick ones under 10 minutes. Today\u2019s I did in nine minutes.\u201d Flicking through his Spotify playlist he reads out an eclectic mix stretching from Miles Davis to The Cure, Nick Drake to Chick Corea, Van Morrison to XTC, The Shins to a selection of Icelandic groups, his enjoyment is obvious.</p> \n<p>We drift back to football. If the season does resume will Watford survive the drop and can he possibly enjoy the challenge? \u201cYeah, I believe we will stay up. As for enjoying it I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. But I think the pain of it is also a stimulus. I\u2019d rather be bored sometimes \u2013 but then there would be other things to worry about. I just know we\u2019re in this situation and I\u2019m going to give everything to get us out of it \u2013 so we have to be ready to engage with it again when the opportunity comes along. But, for now, we\u2019ll put relegation worries to one side. The health of all of us is the priority.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cSometimes I just need solitude, which is really rather nice,\u201d Nigel Pearson says in a deserted lounge at Vicarage Road on a quiet Tuesday afternoon. The coronavirus pandemic surrounds us but Pearson has spent an hour discussing a dizzying range of subjects, including his mental health during a relegation dogfight as well as the remarkable turnaround he has engineered since taking over as Watford\u2019s manager in early December. Watford, having snapped Liverpool\u2019s long unbeaten record with a 3-0 thrashing two weeks ago, are just above the relegation zone. Pearson knows their position remains precarious but he underlines far more serious concerns about coronavirus. Pearson is also dealing with the rawest stages of grief, having lost his mother in January, but he is engaging company whether talking about emotional intelligence, attacking football or his Spotify playlists. Amid some diverse choices, Pearson also listens to classical music. He is interested in Shostakovich and his liking for solitude rises up again as he says of the Russian composer: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t listen to Shostakovich with other people.\u201d Pearson is a very good manager. He has a gift for simplifying the game and inspiring his team with a blend that he says is both brutal and attuned to his players\u2019 shifting emotions. But he is perhaps more complex than any other manager in English football. There is deep introspection at the heart of the 56-year-old \u2013 and even Pearson seems amused by his need for some seclusion from the Premier League rollercoaster. \u201cSometimes I just need to be out in nature,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much I need time on my own. We\u2019ve got a place in Devon and I joined the golf club there. It\u2019s very friendly and, as a new member, you get people saying: \u2018Come have a round with us.\u2019 I think: \u2018No, actually, I just wanna hit some balls on my own.\u2019 It makes me sound a right miserable sod. But it\u2019s just me finding some quiet time.\u201d Three days later, on Friday morning, we talk again. The Premier League has just announced a suspension of all matches until 4 April. Our earlier conversation about seclusion seems ironic now Pearson faces the stark possibility one of his players has the virus and that he and many others at the club could be facing a period of self-isolation. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s nicer to choose when and where you are isolated.\u201d Pearson says wryly. \u201cBut for now it\u2019s the right decision and it\u2019s relatively proactive \u2013 even if it was made under duress.\u201d Pearson is still mulling over his disappointment after watching Boris Johnson shuffling around the issue and avoiding any decision in regard to cancelling sporting events. \u201cI was totally underwhelmed by him last night,\u201d Pearson says of the prime minister, \u201cand by the lack of leadership and any clear messages. At times like this we need strong leadership and it\u2019s important people have as much information as possible and that any decisions are made for their well-being. They need to be made for humanitarian rather than financial reasons. Of course, the economy is going to be hit but that can\u2019t be the main priority.\u201d I ask Pearson what he and his players will do this weekend now Saturday\u2019s game against Leicester City, his former club, has been suspended. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the report on one player who is being tested for the virus. The players are not expected to report for training until next Thursday at the earliest. But we might have to reassess that. For now we just want them to look after themselves and their families at home \u2013 and also to make sure that if they feel ill they report it straight away. We\u2019ve just got to be vigilant and minimise the risk for everyone.\u201d Pearson had told me earlier in the week that the idea of playing games behind closed doors was \u201can absolute nonsense\u201d and that it also put players, coaches and officials at unnecessary risk. In the likely event the pandemic will have escalated by 4 April, should the season be abandoned? \u201cWell, the longer it goes on the more difficult it will be to conclude the season. We have to keep this in perspective, of course, but for Liverpool it would be such a tragedy not to conclude the season. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. It could be that when we get to April we may be able to resume and go into the summer months. How it looks for football pales \u2013 not into insignificance \u2013 but we need perspective on real-life issues. But, yes, purely on a football basis it\u2019s going to throw up problems we\u2019ve not experienced in this country before.\u201d The result of the test on the Watford player suspected of having the virus will be known by Saturday at the latest, so is Pearson steeling himself for self-isolation? \u201cI would follow the recommendations like everyone else. It depends on the outcome of the test and that will have a knock-on effect on how I behave. We\u2019re just sitting tight at the moment.\u201d Stepping away from coronavirus, Pearson reflects on the hidden impact of management on his mental health. \u201cIt can be quite damaging. I know I\u2019m good at this job but certain aspects aren\u2019t very good for me. It can be absolutely draining emotionally and mentally. You then can neglect yourself. Those are the dangerous times.\u201d How does Pearson replenish himself when there is always some Premier League drama to face? \u201cI have things I enjoy doing on my own. I\u2019ve also got better in talking to friends. One of my strengths is dealing with people but I like to be alone as well. I\u2019ve noticed being back in football that, after some anonymity, people recognise you again. It\u2019s a pain in the neck. My wife said to me yesterday, on a walk: \u2018When you wore glasses that used to be quite a good disguise. But now people recognise you straight away.\u2019 I\u2019m going to have to wear a false beard and moustache.\u201d During his last stint at Leicester, when he saved them from relegation the season before they shocked everyone and won the Premier League in 2016, Pearson could be prickly. But losing his job in June 2015 broadened his vision. He discovered hiking and painting. He read and worked on his history degree. After a year away Pearson went back into football and soon fell out with Mel Morris, the chairman of Derby County, in October 2017. For the next 11 months he drew breath away from the game before accepting an offer to manage OH Leuven in the Belgian second division. Pearson \u201cloved\u201d his time in Belgium, where he helped design the kit and managed a team in front of average crowds of 4,500 for 17 months. His latest break lasted 10 months and three days before, on 6 December 2019, with Watford bottom of the table and having already fired two managers this season, Pearson accepted an unexpected invitation from Vicarage Road. \u201cI was curious and thought: \u2018Let\u2019s give it a real crack.\u2019 People said: \u2018It\u2019s a bit of a risk.\u2019 But where\u2019s the risk? A club that\u2019s got eight points and might score a goal every 400 minutes? You risk a relegation on your CV. The real risk is you regret not having a go.\u201d In his first game in charge, away to Liverpool, Watford played well, despite losing 2-0. They then won four and drew one of the next five games, beating Manchester United and Wolves while looking a different team. Before his arrival they had won one league game out of 13 and their goal difference was -18. How did he rejuvenate a moribund team? \u201cBeing positive. Giving direction. Simplifying. Encouraging people to look at what\u2019s possible. I get worn down by people telling you what you can\u2019t do or what the problems are. Go on, give us a solution then. As I say to the players: \u2018I pick you for what you can do, not what you can\u2019t do.\u2019 I make people feel part of a journey to which they can contribute.\u201d Pearson was once depicted as a ranting old-school manager \u2013 an English gaffer that gets called \u201ca proper football man\u201d \u2013 but the reality is different. He is a smart tactician who also stresses the importance of emotional intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to our success because footballers are people first and foremost. It\u2019s important that you\u2019ve got different types of people and it\u2019s my job to bring the best out of them. But I don\u2019t want to sound as if it\u2019s all touchy-feely stuff. Sometimes it can be blunt and brutal.\u201d Yet Pearson brings a light touch to his work. Before they outran, outworked and simply outplayed Liverpool, Pearson eased off in training that week. Watford did understated sessions, including a day of yoga and swimming. \u201cIt was spontaneous. As we went through the week we thought: \u2018Let\u2019s do something different.\u2019 But it\u2019s got to have authenticity.\u201d Pearson gave Watford more solidity when he arrived by changing to 4-2-1-3 \u2013 with the idea that a more structured defence would unleash the team\u2019s attacking potential. Watford are fourth from bottom and, should this campaign recommence, Pearson insists they will keep attacking. This means he often replaces a defensive midfielder with a forward, even if Watford are leading. There have been 3-0 wins over Aston Villa, even after going down to 10 men, and Liverpool but they conceded last-minute winners at Villa Park and at home to Everton. \u201cWe need to win games,\u201d Pearson says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say we go gung-ho and take away the importance of solidity. But the way in which you play is dictated by what you have available and the situation you\u2019re in. We have pace and good attacking players but we can\u2019t be negligent. Sometimes we have to recognise that a point is great. But to give belief and hope we have to be positive and aggressive. \u201cWe\u2019re in a relegation dogfight and we\u2019ve worked exceptionally hard to get back in contact with teams. Now we\u2019ve done that, results like last weekend\u2019s loss against Palace can feel a missed opportunity. But we can\u2019t dwell on disappointments. We didn\u2019t take our chances against Palace but we played OK. I have to detach myself from this emotional rollercoaster that everyone else is on.\u201d The more human backdrop is shaped by the fact Pearson lost his mum unexpectedly 10 weeks ago. He highlights the support of his wife, Nicky, and their adult son and daughter, James and Hannah, but he admits: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve found the right way of grieving yet. We\u2019re making sure we all rally around my dad. They were together 64 years. A long, long time. Mum was such an energetic, dynamic 84-year-old. She was the dominant figure in the family and so it\u2019s been difficult. It would\u2019ve been her 85th birthday next Wednesday. That\u2019s when we plan to scatter her ashes. So it\u2019s still very, very raw. \u201cIt happened on 28 December, the day of the Villa game, and straight after James said: \u2018We need to get ready quickly.\u2019 My mum had had a fall. The next few days were just backwards and forwards on the motorway. She died just a few days later, on the third. It was a huge shock. So now the focal point is my dad. I\u2019ve just lost my mum and I certainly don\u2019t want to lose my dad to [coronavirus]. It\u2019s going to be a further worry because the elderly are more at risk.\u201d Pearson visited his father on Monday evening, before the threat that the virus had reached the Watford camp had emerged. Now he knows that a fellow manager, Arsenal\u2019s Mikel Arteta, has coronavirus, is Pearson concerned he may also be affected and have passed it on to his 86-year-old dad? \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to presume that we may all have come into contact with someone who has got it. But it\u2019s very difficult to quantify how many have been exposed to it. That\u2019s not scaremongering. It\u2019s just how it is.\u201d Is Pearson finding a balance between looking after others both inside and outside the club while taking care of himself? \u201cI hope so. But the reality of it is, like a lot of people, I\u2019m good at giving advice, but not so much when taking it. I\u2019m trying to enjoy the job a bit more. But that\u2019s never easy because I have a love-hate relationship with it.\u201d Beyond the travails of a pandemic virus and a relegation battle, Pearson relaxes and shares a couple of his many pleasurable diversions. \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying doing the Guardian crossword since I joined Leicester first time around [in 2008]. I try to do the quick ones under 10 minutes. Today\u2019s I did in nine minutes.\u201d Flicking through his Spotify playlist he reads out an eclectic mix stretching from Miles Davis to The Cure, Nick Drake to Chick Corea, Van Morrison to XTC, The Shins to a selection of Icelandic groups, his enjoyment is obvious. We drift back to football. If the season does resume will Watford survive the drop and can he possibly enjoy the challenge? \u201cYeah, I believe we will stay up. As for enjoying it I\u2019ve always been a bit of a masochist. I presume you need to be in this job. But I think the pain of it is also a stimulus. I\u2019d rather be bored sometimes \u2013 but then there would be other things to worry about. I just know we\u2019re in this situation and I\u2019m going to give everything to get us out of it \u2013 so we have to be ready to engage with it again when the opportunity comes along. But, for now, we\u2019ll put relegation worries to one side. The health of all of us is the priority.\u201d",

As a result, the charity Age UK has called for the policy to be delayed, amid concerns that some older viewers \u2013 who are most likely to rely on television news for their information \u2013 could choose to turn off their sets and cut themselves off from the world.</p> <p>Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cCovid-19 presents a real worry and risk to the health and wellbeing of older people.

However, letters have started arriving on doormats telling most over-75s that they will have to start paying the \u00a3157.50 fee from the beginning of June, around the time that cases of the illness are expected to peak. As a result, the charity Age UK has called for the policy to be delayed, amid concerns that some older viewers \u2013 who are most likely to rely on television news for their information \u2013 could choose to turn off their sets and cut themselves off from the world. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: \u201cCovid-19 presents a real worry and risk to the health and wellbeing of older people.

      "body": "<p>There is a revealing moment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/isabelhardman\" title=\"\">Isabel Hardman</a>\u2019s book where the author, a political journalist who lives with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder\" title=\"\">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, joins a forest therapy session. The therapist encourages her to \u201cconnect\u201d with herself and \u201cexperience nature better\u201d. Hardman wanders through the wood and finds a small hornbeam, which is twisting up towards the light, struggling to make its way in the shade of a mature oak. She is attracted to its shape, admires its bark, and draws parallels with her own life: how long it takes to heal and grow, how the scars we gather can still be beautiful \u201clike the zig-zagging trunk of this young tree\u201d. She reaches up and snaps one of its twigs: the tree is dead.</p> <p>\u201cServes me right for being so dreadfully whimsical,\u201d Hardman writes. \u201cThere seemed to be no neat life lesson here, nothing you\u2019d want to write on a fridge magnet or share on social media. I\u2019d come here hoping to connect with myself, and instead I\u2019d been drawn to a tree that was secretly dead.\u201d</p> <p>It is a valuable lesson in Hardman\u2019s <em>The Natural Health Service</em>, a practical and self-aware account of the relief from mental illness to be found outside. Hardman, and the many people she meets, identify respite, recovery and resilience in walking, running, cold-water swimming, gardening, \u201cforest bathing\u201d, birdwatching, botanising, horse riding and caring for pets. The common denominator is what Hardman calls \u201cthe great outdoors\u201d, that plangent, hearty Victorian-sounding cliche. But as she shows, other species and their ecosystems can be rebellious medics. At times, the \u201cnatural\u201d world resembles the magic mirror that undercuts Snow White\u2019s stepmother: rather than reflecting back ourselves, it is alive with its own agency, a challenge to our narcissism.</p> <p><em>The Natural Health Service</em> is one of a rapidly growing forest of new books that examine cures found in nature. This winter alone has brought the publication of <em>The Wild Remedy</em> by Emma Mitchell; <em>Losing Eden</em> by Lucy Jones; <em>Rootbound</em> by Alice Vincent; and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/wintering-how-i-learned-to-flourish-when-life-became-frozen-katherine-may-memoir-review\" title=\"\">Wintering</a></em> by Katherine May. One of last year\u2019s unexpectedly prominent books \u2013 unexpected because it was rejected by publishers and crowdfunded via Unbound \u2013 was <em>Bird Therapy</em> by Joe Harkness. Just as trend is followed by takedown, so this spring sees a potential debunking in the form of <em>Natural</em><em>: The Seductive Myth of Nature\u2019s Goodness</em> by American philosopher Alan Levinovitz.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75e55d27b0a1ea3b50c72ea6c4e574e8662ca007/0_779_2304_1382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Author Isabel Hardman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Isabel Hardman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The idea that human health can be salved by \u201cnature\u201d has been around for as long as we have regarded ourselves as a species apart from other living things. It truly arrived in Britain with the Romantics, for whom prosperity enabled a more reflective and worshipful relationship with the landscape that others had to toil in for a living. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnkeats\" title=\"\">Keats</a> and Byron loved swimming; sea-bathing was an upper-class health fad that inspired the first seaside resorts. The popularisation of nature\u2019s healing power peaked after the industrial revolution, when later Victorians were beset by fears of the all-conquering machine. Fresh air, exercise and healthful hobbies, from collecting butterflies to finding fossils, were prescribed in much the same way as GPs today are experimenting with \u201cprescribing nature\u201d to patients. Hardman reminds us of the prescience of Octavia Hill, the social reformer and co-founder of the National Trust in 1895, who campaigned to save urban land for city parks. London commons that could make developers fortunes had greater value as outdoor space, Hill argued: \u201cTo my mind they are even now worth very much; but they will be more and more valuable every year \u2013 valuable in the deepest sense of the word; health-giving, joy-inspiring, peace-bringing.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Losing Eden</em>, Jones shows that, ahead of today\u2019s scientists, even Florence Nightingale was aware of how green space and plants can assist recovery from physical illness. In 1859, Nightingale wrote that when she had been ill, her recovery quickened after she received \u201ca nosegay of wild flowers\u201d. The nurse noticed in her patients that there was \u201cmost acute suffering when [the] patient can\u2019t see out of the window\u201d; Jones and Hardman both cite a more modern scientific study by Roger Ulrich who examined the records of 46 patients recovering from gall bladder surgery between 1972 and 1981. Some patients were randomly assigned a hospital bed with a view of deciduous trees; others a view of a brick wall. Those with a view of trees had shorter post-operative stays, took fewer painkillers and had fewer minor complications. And yet 40 years on, hospitals are run as \u201csterile\u201d environments without plants, as Levinovitz notes in <em>Natural</em>: \u201cAn entirely unsuperstitious take on natural healing would recognise the importance of being around life \u2013 of facilitating hospital garden walks, say \u2013 instead of systematically excluding it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u00b6</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03f24d9ea256a1079b11ec9d430ab7447750f0f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03f24d9ea256a1079b11ec9d430ab7447750f0f7/0_188_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Out of the woods \u2026 green spaces have been proven to speed up recovery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out of the woods \u2026 green spaces have been proven to speed up recovery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Travelpix Ltd/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the climate and extinction crisis quickens, so there is a rush for a literary cure. In Britain it began with Richard Mabey\u2019s <em>Nature Cure</em> in 2005. In many of the most popular recent examples of nature writing, other species and wild places have played a healing role \u2013 for bereavement in Helen Macdonald\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\" title=\"\">H </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/23/h-is-for-hawk-helen-macdonald-review\" title=\"\">Is for Hawk</a></em>, and alcoholism in Amy Liptrot\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/22/the-outrun-amy-liptrot-review-by-will-self\" title=\"\">The Outrun</a>. Nature Cure</em> (briefly) details Mabey\u2019s mental breakdown after completing his magnum opus, <em>Flora Britannica</em>, and the succour he found by forgoing his childhood home in the Chilterns for the bleaker plains of south Norfolk. When I ask Mabey if he regrets being midwife to the nature cure subgenre, an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d spills forth. \u201cI feel slightly guilty about the title, which was my idea and it was very euphonious, but I quite soon began getting letters from people saying they loved the book but that it was not much to do with nature curing me. If a pedantic scholar counted the paragraphs that were to do with the illness, it probably amounts to about six pages,\u201d he says. \u201cReally it\u2019s a book about encountering and adapting to a quite new landscape, which you could say was a post-cure experience.\u201d Mabey had to reach a certain stage of recovery to write <em>Nature Cure</em>. As he, Hardman and other nature cure writers emphasise, they can be too ill to leave the house to imbibe the healing wild, and too ill to write, too.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful when it occurs; people in distress find that encounters with the natural world do restore them,\u201d says Mabey. But two things concern him about the concept of a nature cure. \u201cI\u2019m worried that it\u2019s become mooted as a kind of panacea \u2013 green Prozac. And if there\u2019s anything wrong you just go out and look at the pretty flowers and you\u2019re going to be marvellous. That\u2019s a tall order if the natural world is in a state of crisis with the insect apocalypse and British songbirds collapsing all around us. There is also a danger that therapeutic nature becomes another way in which nature is reduced to service provider. The foregrounding of us being the centre of attention, the central agents of change and growth, all form part of a mindset that I think is obsolete. We need to rethink where we stand in relation to all these other organisms and what the transactions are between us, and stop saying they are all for our benefit, even though most of them probably are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b42a613ba2cf7096152929439691c06710560621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b42a613ba2cf7096152929439691c06710560621/0_1252_3338_2002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Mabey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Author Richard Mabey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Si Barber/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an insightful <a href=\"https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/5542/in-search-of-the-nature-cure\" title=\"\">essay on nature cures</a>, Richard Smyth quotes the poet Polly Atkin, who is diagnosed with chronic illnesses Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, a metabolic disorder that leads to a toxic accumulation of iron in the body. Like Mabey, Atkin has misgivings about this literary blossoming. \u201cThere is very little published work that points out how problematic it is \u2013 largely because the people who understand the problem are mainly those with incurable conditions and they\u2019re often too busy being incurable to write books about nature,\u201d she says. \u201cMore importantly, mainstream UK publishing is so attached to the \u2018nature cure\u2019 narrative that it can\u2019t imagine another story to tell about how we relate to the world around us.\u201d</p> <p>The stage is set for a debunking of the literary nature cure but in <em>Natural</em>, it never quite arrives. At the end of the book, despite Levinovitz taking smart aim at the snake-oil salespeople of late capitalism \u2013 those selling expensive natural remedies, natural \u201ccures\u201d for cancer, or loudly advocating \u201cwholly natural\u201d childbirth, sex or sport \u2013 he concludes that there is something innately glorious about the non-human natural world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m worried it\u2019s become mooted as a kind\u00a0of panacea \u2013\u00a0if there\u2019s anything wrong you just go out and look at the flowers</p> <footer> <cite>Richard Mabey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What Levinovitz critiques is what he sees as a religious attitude towards nature. An appeal to natural goodness \u2013 with \u201cunnatural\u201d as its evil twin \u2013 is among the most influential arguments in all human thought, ancient and modern, east and west. In fact, every human-made object is extracted from our planet; everything is \u201cnatural\u201d. Levinovitz argues our veneration of \u201cnature\u201d is dangerous, citing former South African president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mbeki\" title=\"\">Thabo Mbeki</a>\u2019s desire for Aids patients to take beetroot and other \u201cnatural\u201d treatments. What Levinovitz does is help us to identify the \u201cpropagandists, bigots, demagogues, and marketeers who wrap their rhetoric in the mantle of \u2018what\u2019s natural\u2019\u201d. </p> <p>When it comes to making money from nature, the small, poorly renumerated band of writers proselytising for its health benefits do not enter Levinovitz\u2019s line of fire. While <em>H </em><em>Is </em><em>for Hawk</em> will long stand as a literary classic, nature cure writing has taken a practical turn. Hardman and Harkness\u2019s books are squarely self-help. Their qualities include brutal honesty and generous advice. Both authors, alongside others such as Jones and Mitchell, make clear that while time in the natural world has ameliorated their mental illnesses, so too have antidepressants and talking cures. These writers don\u2019t succumb to the requirement for a happy ending either: no one suggests they are cured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3392a105a7aed1b724427f59f6b07eb0dee9e5d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3392a105a7aed1b724427f59f6b07eb0dee9e5d6/0_0_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild swimming in Snowdonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild swimming in Snowdonia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stockimo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We might wonder if a writing cure is also part of their wider recovery, but it is not always so. John Clare, who died in 1864, has long been the most notable nature writer with mental health problems. The Northamptonshire farm labourer, whose superb poems made him a literary sensation in the early 19th century, could be considered both evidence for and against the theory that nature makes us well. Did he only fall ill once embraced by literary London, psychically uprooted from his rural heartland? Or was he ill despite surrounding himself with nature? A country life is no guarantee of mental wellbeing: depression is a major problem<strong> </strong>in modern farming; plenty of farm workers endure it.</p> <p>There is an echo of Clare\u2019s experience in Harkness\u2019s account of life since the publication of his debut, <em>Bird Therapy</em>. \u201cI will never write about nature again,\u201d says Harkness bluntly. He has been diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">obsessive-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">compulsive </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/living-with-ocd-survival-poison-contaminated-food\" title=\"\">disorder</a> and generalised anxiety disorder \u2013 mild medical terms for the crippling anxiety that Harkness vividly describes. After an attempted suicide and a breakdown, he began walking and discovered the exhilaration of encountering birds. \u201cOf all the therapies I\u2019ve tried,\u201d he writes, \u201cnothing has had the prolonged and positive impact that birdwatching has.\u201d He spotted that the requirements of birdwatching matched the five ways to wellbeing devised by a project endorsed by the charity Mind: to connect, to take notice, to give, to keep learning and to be active.</p> <p>As Harkness\u2019s profile grew on social media, he decided to write a book, receiving high-profile endorsements, including an incisive foreword by the naturalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-packham\" title=\"\">Chris Packham</a>, who declared it an \u201cexceptional\u201d publication because it would save lives. Eight months on, Harkness recognises that his book has brought positive things: his honesty about mental illness has encouraged others to reciprocate. He has been told by readers that it has indeed saved their lives.

      "bodyText": "There is a revealing moment in Isabel Hardman\u2019s book where the author, a political journalist who lives with post-traumatic stress disorder, joins a forest therapy session. The therapist encourages her to \u201cconnect\u201d with herself and \u201cexperience nature better\u201d. Hardman wanders through the wood and finds a small hornbeam, which is twisting up towards the light, struggling to make its way in the shade of a mature oak. She is attracted to its shape, admires its bark, and draws parallels with her own life: how long it takes to heal and grow, how the scars we gather can still be beautiful \u201clike the zig-zagging trunk of this young tree\u201d. She reaches up and snaps one of its twigs: the tree is dead. \u201cServes me right for being so dreadfully whimsical,\u201d Hardman writes. \u201cThere seemed to be no neat life lesson here, nothing you\u2019d want to write on a fridge magnet or share on social media. I\u2019d come here hoping to connect with myself, and instead I\u2019d been drawn to a tree that was secretly dead.\u201d It is a valuable lesson in Hardman\u2019s The Natural Health Service, a practical and self-aware account of the relief from mental illness to be found outside. Hardman, and the many people she meets, identify respite, recovery and resilience in walking, running, cold-water swimming, gardening, \u201cforest bathing\u201d, birdwatching, botanising, horse riding and caring for pets. The common denominator is what Hardman calls \u201cthe great outdoors\u201d, that plangent, hearty Victorian-sounding cliche. But as she shows, other species and their ecosystems can be rebellious medics. At times, the \u201cnatural\u201d world resembles the magic mirror that undercuts Snow White\u2019s stepmother: rather than reflecting back ourselves, it is alive with its own agency, a challenge to our narcissism. The Natural Health Service is one of a rapidly growing forest of new books that examine cures found in nature. This winter alone has brought the publication of The Wild Remedy by Emma Mitchell; Losing Eden by Lucy Jones; Rootbound by Alice Vincent; and Wintering by Katherine May. One of last year\u2019s unexpectedly prominent books \u2013 unexpected because it was rejected by publishers and crowdfunded via Unbound \u2013 was Bird Therapy by Joe Harkness. Just as trend is followed by takedown, so this spring sees a potential debunking in the form of Natural: The Seductive Myth of Nature\u2019s Goodness by American philosopher Alan Levinovitz. The idea that human health can be salved by \u201cnature\u201d has been around for as long as we have regarded ourselves as a species apart from other living things. It truly arrived in Britain with the Romantics, for whom prosperity enabled a more reflective and worshipful relationship with the landscape that others had to toil in for a living. Keats and Byron loved swimming; sea-bathing was an upper-class health fad that inspired the first seaside resorts. The popularisation of nature\u2019s healing power peaked after the industrial revolution, when later Victorians were beset by fears of the all-conquering machine. Fresh air, exercise and healthful hobbies, from collecting butterflies to finding fossils, were prescribed in much the same way as GPs today are experimenting with \u201cprescribing nature\u201d to patients. Hardman reminds us of the prescience of Octavia Hill, the social reformer and co-founder of the National Trust in 1895, who campaigned to save urban land for city parks. London commons that could make developers fortunes had greater value as outdoor space, Hill argued: \u201cTo my mind they are even now worth very much; but they will be more and more valuable every year \u2013 valuable in the deepest sense of the word; health-giving, joy-inspiring, peace-bringing.\u201d In Losing Eden, Jones shows that, ahead of today\u2019s scientists, even Florence Nightingale was aware of how green space and plants can assist recovery from physical illness. In 1859, Nightingale wrote that when she had been ill, her recovery quickened after she received \u201ca nosegay of wild flowers\u201d. The nurse noticed in her patients that there was \u201cmost acute suffering when [the] patient can\u2019t see out of the window\u201d; Jones and Hardman both cite a more modern scientific study by Roger Ulrich who examined the records of 46 patients recovering from gall bladder surgery between 1972 and 1981. Some patients were randomly assigned a hospital bed with a view of deciduous trees; others a view of a brick wall. Those with a view of trees had shorter post-operative stays, took fewer painkillers and had fewer minor complications. And yet 40 years on, hospitals are run as \u201csterile\u201d environments without plants, as Levinovitz notes in Natural: \u201cAn entirely unsuperstitious take on natural healing would recognise the importance of being around life \u2013 of facilitating hospital garden walks, say \u2013 instead of systematically excluding it.\u201d \u00b6 As the climate and extinction crisis quickens, so there is a rush for a literary cure. In Britain it began with Richard Mabey\u2019s Nature Cure in 2005. In many of the most popular recent examples of nature writing, other species and wild places have played a healing role \u2013 for bereavement in Helen Macdonald\u2019s H Is for Hawk, and alcoholism in Amy Liptrot\u2019s The Outrun. Nature Cure (briefly) details Mabey\u2019s mental breakdown after completing his magnum opus, Flora Britannica, and the succour he found by forgoing his childhood home in the Chilterns for the bleaker plains of south Norfolk. When I ask Mabey if he regrets being midwife to the nature cure subgenre, an emphatic \u201cyes\u201d spills forth. \u201cI feel slightly guilty about the title, which was my idea and it was very euphonious, but I quite soon began getting letters from people saying they loved the book but that it was not much to do with nature curing me. If a pedantic scholar counted the paragraphs that were to do with the illness, it probably amounts to about six pages,\u201d he says. \u201cReally it\u2019s a book about encountering and adapting to a quite new landscape, which you could say was a post-cure experience.\u201d Mabey had to reach a certain stage of recovery to write Nature Cure. As he, Hardman and other nature cure writers emphasise, they can be too ill to leave the house to imbibe the healing wild, and too ill to write, too. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful when it occurs; people in distress find that encounters with the natural world do restore them,\u201d says Mabey. But two things concern him about the concept of a nature cure. \u201cI\u2019m worried that it\u2019s become mooted as a kind of panacea \u2013 green Prozac. And if there\u2019s anything wrong you just go out and look at the pretty flowers and you\u2019re going to be marvellous. That\u2019s a tall order if the natural world is in a state of crisis with the insect apocalypse and British songbirds collapsing all around us. There is also a danger that therapeutic nature becomes another way in which nature is reduced to service provider. The foregrounding of us being the centre of attention, the central agents of change and growth, all form part of a mindset that I think is obsolete. We need to rethink where we stand in relation to all these other organisms and what the transactions are between us, and stop saying they are all for our benefit, even though most of them probably are.\u201d In an insightful essay on nature cures, Richard Smyth quotes the poet Polly Atkin, who is diagnosed with chronic illnesses Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and genetic haemochromatosis, a metabolic disorder that leads to a toxic accumulation of iron in the body. Like Mabey, Atkin has misgivings about this literary blossoming. \u201cThere is very little published work that points out how problematic it is \u2013 largely because the people who understand the problem are mainly those with incurable conditions and they\u2019re often too busy being incurable to write books about nature,\u201d she says. \u201cMore importantly, mainstream UK publishing is so attached to the \u2018nature cure\u2019 narrative that it can\u2019t imagine another story to tell about how we relate to the world around us.\u201d The stage is set for a debunking of the literary nature cure but in Natural, it never quite arrives. At the end of the book, despite Levinovitz taking smart aim at the snake-oil salespeople of late capitalism \u2013 those selling expensive natural remedies, natural \u201ccures\u201d for cancer, or loudly advocating \u201cwholly natural\u201d childbirth, sex or sport \u2013 he concludes that there is something innately glorious about the non-human natural world. What Levinovitz critiques is what he sees as a religious attitude towards nature. An appeal to natural goodness \u2013 with \u201cunnatural\u201d as its evil twin \u2013 is among the most influential arguments in all human thought, ancient and modern, east and west. In fact, every human-made object is extracted from our planet; everything is \u201cnatural\u201d. Levinovitz argues our veneration of \u201cnature\u201d is dangerous, citing former South African president Thabo Mbeki\u2019s desire for Aids patients to take beetroot and other \u201cnatural\u201d treatments. What Levinovitz does is help us to identify the \u201cpropagandists, bigots, demagogues, and marketeers who wrap their rhetoric in the mantle of \u2018what\u2019s natural\u2019\u201d. When it comes to making money from nature, the small, poorly renumerated band of writers proselytising for its health benefits do not enter Levinovitz\u2019s line of fire. While H Is for Hawk will long stand as a literary classic, nature cure writing has taken a practical turn. Hardman and Harkness\u2019s books are squarely self-help. Their qualities include brutal honesty and generous advice. Both authors, alongside others such as Jones and Mitchell, make clear that while time in the natural world has ameliorated their mental illnesses, so too have antidepressants and talking cures. These writers don\u2019t succumb to the requirement for a happy ending either: no one suggests they are cured. We might wonder if a writing cure is also part of their wider recovery, but it is not always so. John Clare, who died in 1864, has long been the most notable nature writer with mental health problems. The Northamptonshire farm labourer, whose superb poems made him a literary sensation in the early 19th century, could be considered both evidence for and against the theory that nature makes us well. Did he only fall ill once embraced by literary London, psychically uprooted from his rural heartland? Or was he ill despite surrounding himself with nature? A country life is no guarantee of mental wellbeing: depression is a major problem in modern farming; plenty of farm workers endure it. There is an echo of Clare\u2019s experience in Harkness\u2019s account of life since the publication of his debut, Bird Therapy. \u201cI will never write about nature again,\u201d says Harkness bluntly. He has been diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder \u2013 mild medical terms for the crippling anxiety that Harkness vividly describes. After an attempted suicide and a breakdown, he began walking and discovered the exhilaration of encountering birds. \u201cOf all the therapies I\u2019ve tried,\u201d he writes, \u201cnothing has had the prolonged and positive impact that birdwatching has.\u201d He spotted that the requirements of birdwatching matched the five ways to wellbeing devised by a project endorsed by the charity Mind: to connect, to take notice, to give, to keep learning and to be active. As Harkness\u2019s profile grew on social media, he decided to write a book, receiving high-profile endorsements, including an incisive foreword by the naturalist Chris Packham, who declared it an \u201cexceptional\u201d publication because it would save lives. Eight months on, Harkness recognises that his book has brought positive things: his honesty about mental illness has encouraged others to reciprocate. He has been told by readers that it has indeed saved their lives. Unfortunately, the online platform that enabled him to promote his book also damaged him. \u201cThe more open I was on social media, the less people engaged with me. If you\u2019re already struggling with self-esteem, it is hell to be on it. The only way I could deal with it is not use Twitter any more,\u201d he says. He has also shed his illusions about the \u201cguild\u201d of nature writers. He imagined this literary world would be an inclusive salon for the free exchange of ideas about nature and mental health; instead he found a workplace, \u201ca competitive market with a lot of emphasis on product and what you\u2019re selling\u201d, where \u201cpeople become very focused on themselves\u201d. One nature writer, he says, told him that Bird Therapy only sold well because of Packham\u2019s foreword. Harkness, who is a special educational needs co-ordinator working with vulnerable young people, says he is so glad that writing is not his job. His post-book cure has been to remove himself from social media and literary \u201cbackslapping\u201d and simplify his birdwatching regimen. \u201cI don\u2019t drive to birdwatch any more. I walk from my house. I\u2019m under no pressure to see anything exciting. I\u2019ve stopped commodifying it. I just think of being out where I should be. Whenever I do that I\u2019m really thankful for it. Nature is not there to make me feel better. It\u2019s something we can use to help us but ultimately we have to be there for it as well. And we\u2019ve got to make wholesale changes to how we live.\u201d \u00b6 Most nature cure books, both literary triumphs and practical manuals, are overwhelmingly about us. Perhaps we should catch more glimpses of other species as we look into the mirror? Mitchell\u2019s The Wild Remedy, a diary of a year with severe depression, throws welcome attention on natural medicines \u2013 the thrilling dash of a sparrowhawk, or the cosy sight of ladybirds clustered together during winter in a knapweed seedhead. She recreates her encounters with other species around her home in Cambridgeshire in paintings, sketches, photographs and cabinets of curiosities. But, she says, \u201cI\u2019m not using my garden and the wood beyond my cottage as a sort of green Tesco, burgling myself some green serotonin and dopamine. It\u2019s much more of a two-way relationship.\u201d Mitchell, like Harkness, initially connected via social media with readers and others who lived with mental illness. She is not always well enough to visit a nearby wood every day. When she does, she monitors, observes and records the wildlife, and relays it to her audience. A biologist by training, Mitchell hopes her writing and art enlighten our increasingly urban society. \u201cI\u2019m trying to use the place where I live as a source of education for people who may not know what cherry plum blossom looks like \u2013 \u2018This is coming into flower, go and see if you\u2019ve got it on your patch,\u2019\u201d she says. Awakening readers to other species around us is a gift to those species, and it is bequeathed by almost every nature cure writer. Last summer, an area of flowery meadowland in the wood near Mitchell exploded with life. The hot summer of 2018 must have produced \u201ca metric fucktonne of caterpillars\u201d she laughs: the following year there emerged hundreds of marbled white butterflies. \u201cThe dose of dopamine was just off the scale.\u201d She filmed it for her social media followers. A few days later, in full flower, the meadow was scalped because of fears it contained ragwort, a flower that can in rare cases prove fatal to horses (and which landowners sometimes mistakenly believe they are obliged to control under an arcane \u201cinjurious\u201d weeds law). An exquisite ecosystem was cut down at its peak. Alongside Mitchell\u2019s enjoyment of this meadow emerged a deep connection with it, and a responsibility for it. \u201cMy connection with this land is not as a commodity.

The meadow won\u2019t be cut again this year until the flowers and invertebrates have finished flowering and flying. Mitchell\u2019s experience also reveals that in the Anthropocene, an era in which humans are reshaping all life on Earth, it is hazardous to pin our wellbeing on the fragments of non-human life that remain. Lucy Jones\u2019s Losing Eden is a passionate and thorough exploration of the growing scientific evidence showing why humans require other species to stay well \u2013 from a diversity of microbiota in our guts to a diversity of species in nearby green space. But she is aware that \u201cthe medicalisation of nature\u201d also \u201cdemonstrates that we still see ourselves as takers and overseers, the authority figures, rather than being on an equal footing with the rest of nature\u201d.

It took four days before another physician heard her symptoms, sent her in for coronavirus testing, and she was diagnosed positive. Since January, when Washington reported the first case of coronavirus in the US, the state has been the central focus of the American outbreak, documenting the most cases and deaths associated with the infection in the country. Its position in what has now been declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic can be attributed to everything from individual missed opportunities for diagnosis and state funding gaps to restrictive federal guidelines for testing. But at the same time, those high numbers can also be attributed to the simple fact that the state diagnosed its first case before the rest of America and was forced to jumpstart its testing and surveillance response.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has announced a national publicity blitz aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 as the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the infection rate of the virus may not peak until \u201cwell into the middle of the year\u201d. As Australians brace for the shutdown of major sporting codes, concerts and festivals in a dramatic scaling-back of day-to-day life not seen since the Second World War, the federal government has announced the release of a national advertising campaign to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. Australia now has 200 cases of the virus, as New South Wales reported 20 new cases on Saturday, its biggest daily increase since the pandemic began. The education campaign comes after criticism of the government\u2019s response to the crisis and an acknowledgement by the chief medical officer that the country\u2019s supply of crucial medical equipment including personal protective gear and pathology test kits was \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d. From Sunday, the government will release two separate television advertisements which encourage stringent personal hygiene and warn people who have recently been overseas or in contact with someone who has the virus to \u201cseek medical advice\u201d and self-isolate if they develop symptoms. The campaign, which will also include outdoor advertising on buses, at train stations and in shopping centres, includes the slogan \u201ctogether we can help stop the spread and stay healthy\u201d. It also advises people to only be tested for the virus \u201cif you are experiencing flu or cold-like symptoms and have recently returned overseas or have been indirect contact with someone who is known to have contracted coronavirus\u201d. Earlier on Saturday the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, warned the spread of the virus may not peak until \u201cwell into the middle of the year\u201d. \u201cIf we get a large outbreak [it] could go well into the middle of the year before it peaks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are some countries ... which seems to have peaked quite early and controlled the outbreak. One of the things we know about outbreaks and epidemics as they are very hard to predict. \u201cBut it depends how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day.\u201d If the virus were to continue to spread more rapidly into the winter, it could place significant strain on Australia\u2019s medical resources. As the Guardian has reported, a letter sent by Murphy to GPs on Friday warned the country\u2019s supply of personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing kits was already under \u201cextreme pressure\u201d with supplies \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d. \u201cPathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing,\u201d Murphy wrote. Also on Saturday, the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, spoke publicly for the first time since he was diagnosed with the virus. Speaking to a Sydney radio station from his sickbed at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, Dutton said he was feeling \u201cmuch better\u201d and insisted health officials were not concerned about his contact with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, or Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president. \u201cFever has gone this morning, temperature is down, my throat was very mild to start with so probably still a bit sore but very mild in that sense,\u201d he said. Dutton, who said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning, attended a cabinet meeting with senior government ministers including the prime minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday and before that was in the US where he met with Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president. Both Trump and Barr worked from home on Friday in the US after Dutton\u2019s diagnosis was confirmed, but the home affairs minister said that he\u2019d spoken to Queensland health authorities who were not concerned about his earlier contacts. \u201cTheir advice to me is they\u2019re concerned with people that I\u2019ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cSo beyond that, it\u2019s not further back, there\u2019s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there\u2019s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That\u2019s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.\u201d In New Zealand, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that anyone entering the country, except for people from Pacific Islander countries, would need to self-isolate for two weeks. That announcement, which comes despite the country recording only six cases of the virus so far, has potentially widespread consequences for the Super Rugby and NRL competitions already beleaguered by the Australian government\u2019s decision to advise against all mass gatherings of more than 500 people. \u201cThis decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world,\u201d Ardern said on Saturday. In further developments courts across the state of Victoria in Australia will immediately suspend all future jury trials in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19. The drastic measure will apply to the county and supreme courts. Supreme court chief justice Anne Ferguson said all new jury trials would be suspended but that trials in which a jury had already been empanelled would continue. \u201cThis means that the jury empanelment process, in which hundreds of potential jurors gather at court, will not take place until further notice,\u201d Ferguson said. The Northern Territory local court announced on Saturday evening it too would suspend all circuit court services effective immediately.",

They are all prepared to be dislikable, sometimes in ways that make them dislikable to the reader.

The current building was originally one of a pair of towers that lined up with Whitby Rock to warn passing ships of the hazard. In the former lighthouse keeper\u2019s cottages attached to the south tower (the north tower was demolished long ago), there are now two three-bedroom holiday homes, <strong><a href=\"https://www.ruralretreats.co.uk/england/yorkshire-holiday-cottages/vanguard\">Vanguard</a> </strong>and<strong> <a href=\"https://www.ruralretreats.co.uk/england/yorkshire-holiday-cottages/galatea\">Galatea</a></strong>, each with a garden and deck with sea views. The lighthouse itself is still in use, with the beam visible from the garden.

The trust painstakingly restored its baroque plasterwork, including nine Muses decorating the walls. Other highlights include a four-poster bed, a baby grand piano and a roof terrace with views over the city. The Music Room is on a pedestrian square in central Lancaster, two minutes from the castle. A four-mile cycle route links the city with the sea at Morecambe. <br></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Magic bus, Lake District<br></strong>Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3100 a night</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d14d7ff29ea7de1a88478385a20c802bd254a397\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d14d7ff29ea7de1a88478385a20c802bd254a397/0_72_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hinterlandes bus stops at secret locations in the Lake District\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/cumbria/hinterlandes/hinterlandes#search_type=placeType&amp;search_text=bus&amp;\">Hinterlandes</a></strong>, an American Community bus with a VW van welded to the top \u2013 may well be the most unusual entry on this list.

The van is continually relocated to wild sites around the Lake District \u2013 and guests are given the secret locations via the what3words app. It has a marble-clad shower, kitchenette, woodburner, firepit and wood-fired hot tub. A roving, trailer-mounted cabin is launching in spring.

Since owner Anthony Edmonson bought the land in 1980 he has planted over 50,000 trees and large areas of reed beds in the lake, creating wildlife habitats.

Wood panelling and a woodburner add a cosy vibe, complemented by granny-chic interiors: sweeps of pink brocade curtain dividing the lounge area from two sleeping cabins, tasselled sofas and a floral roll-top bath tub. The site also has two showman\u2019s wagons (each sleeping four, from \u00a3190 for two nights).</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Modern eco-bothy, Lanarkshire</strong><strong><br></strong>Sleeps 4 | From \u00a399 a night</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d60050db72e142d71b5b84fe64000baff6a2b516\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d60050db72e142d71b5b84fe64000baff6a2b516/0_207_2896_1737/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burnhead Bothy Lanarkshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>No crumbling old stone hut, <strong><a href=\"https://www.coolstays.com/property/burnhead-bothies/20845\" title=\"\">Burnhead Bothy</a></strong>, set on a 1,600-acre farm, is a thoroughly modern affair \u2013 a timber-frame building with floor-to-ceiling windows, views across the Kilsyth Hills, and a simple pine interior. The farm is unusual too \u2013 home to Highland cattle and Valais sheep, whose wool insulates the sustainably built, off-grid, solar-powered pad. Water comes from a spring and the open-plan space is warmed by a woodburner.

The site is solar- and wind-powered, has composting loos and grows food year-round. Walking and bike trails, the seaside at Newcastle and Tollymore Forest Park (a Game of Thrones site) are all within easy reach.

It stands on its own in a grassy field, surrounded by green and pleasant countryside and surrounding fields.

The current building was originally one of a pair of towers that lined up with Whitby Rock to warn passing ships of the hazard. In the former lighthouse keeper\u2019s cottages attached to the south tower (the north tower was demolished long ago), there are now two three-bedroom holiday homes, Vanguard and Galatea, each with a garden and deck with sea views. The lighthouse itself is still in use, with the beam visible from the garden. It\u2019s a great base for exploring the coast and its beaches, and within easy reach of Whitby and Robin Hood\u2019s Bay. Welcome hamper included. * * * Baroque splendour, Lancaster Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3254 for four nights The Landmark Trust has more than 200 extraordinary buildings to stay in across Britain \u2013 including The Music Room, a garden pavilion that dates from about 1730. The trust painstakingly restored its baroque plasterwork, including nine Muses decorating the walls. Other highlights include a four-poster bed, a baby grand piano and a roof terrace with views over the city. The Music Room is on a pedestrian square in central Lancaster, two minutes from the castle. A four-mile cycle route links the city with the sea at Morecambe. * * * Magic bus, Lake District Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3100 a night Hinterlandes, an American Community bus with a VW van welded to the top \u2013 may well be the most unusual entry on this list. Other reclaimed materials include oak flooring from a Birmingham school, door handles from the Hempel Hotel in London, 1950\u2019s bulkhead lights from a German cargo ship, cupboard doors from the Natural History Museum, and a vintage anglepoise lamp. The van is continually relocated to wild sites around the Lake District \u2013 and guests are given the secret locations via the what3words app. It has a marble-clad shower, kitchenette, woodburner, firepit and wood-fired hot tub. A roving, trailer-mounted cabin is launching in spring. Bikes are available for hire. * * * Round house, Cornwall Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3495 a week In 1820, the Reverend Trist built four round thatched cottages in the village of Veryan on the Roseland Peninsula, part of the Cornwall AONB. They were circular so that the devil would have nowhere to hide, and had crosses on top to scare him away. One of the two surviving properties is now Round House East, a cute, Grade II-listed holiday home with a circular sitting room, a bedroom with a vaulted ceiling, kitchen extension and cottage garden. Well-behaved dogs are welcome. Veryan has a pub and shop, and is within walking distance of unspoiled Carne and Pendower beaches. * * * First-class cabin, East Sussex Sleeps 2 | From \u00a350 a night The Quirky Sussex Carriage started life as an 1880s rail coach and has lots of original features, as well as additions made by the owner \u2013 with timber from his own woodland \u2013 and a pizza oven. The cabin has its own lake, with a jetty to dive off and a rowing boat, and is on the edge of Ashdown Forest. It is off-grid and there are no neighbours in sight, but the Griffin Inn in Fletching is a 30-minute walk away. Stays include a welcome pack of sourdough bread, butter, eggs and jam. * * * Keep on trucking, Powys Sleeps 2 | From \u00a390 a night Pantechnicon Powys is former removals van in Mid Wales that is now a hillside retreat sitting among lavender beds. The side of the vehicle was cut out to make the entrance and recycled into a table top. The space is compact, with a cabin bed, small kitchen and a seating area, and large double doors opening onto the deck. From here, there are views across the farm, which was Wales\u2019s first producer of lavender oil. Outside, there\u2019s a firebowl, a tree swing and swimming pond for a dip in summer after hiking nearby uplands of Mynydd Epynt or around the Brecon Beacons. * * * Magnificent mill, Norfolk Sleeps 9 | From \u00a31,103 a week At five storeys, Ebridge Mill pretty much qualifies as a skyscraper in this rural corner of Norfolk, its upper-floor balconies commanding views across the millpond, water meadows and beautiful Bacton Wood beyond. Reminders of its former life as a flour mill are all around in Cubitts, a four-bedroom holiday home that occupies the top four floors of the red-brick building. The mill\u2019s iron wheels, pulleys and heavy wooden beams give the huge open-plan living, dining and kitchen space an industrial edge, which is offset by vast sofas, oversize lamps and high-spec fittings. Fish for trout in the pond, kayak the North Walsham and Dilham Canal or drive to sandy beaches at Bacton and Mundesley. * * * Holy retreat, Northumberland Sleeps 8 | From \u00a3118 a night The 19th-century Greystead Old Church, on a riverbank in the North Tyne Valley, west of the village of Bellingham, was converted into a holiday home in 2013. Many of the Grade-II listed building\u2019s original features have been retained and restored, including a Victorian stained-glass window, Georgian panelling, stone lancet windows and the flagstone floor. Covering two-thirds of the former nave is a first-floor mezzanine with open-plan kitchen-dining space. Downstairs, where the altar once stood, there\u2019s a living room with a woodburner and four bedrooms, one with an original fireplace. It\u2019s a short drive to Kielder Water &amp; Forest Park, and Hadrian\u2019s Wall. * * * Feathered nest, Monmouthshire Sleeps 8 | From \u00a3163 a night A once unremarkable poultry coop has been converted into The Chickenshed, a stylish, Scandi-style holiday home. The project was an \u201cenjoyable challenge\u201d according to architects Martin Hall and Kelly Bednarczyk, who retained the wooden building\u2019s footprint and structure. Decor around the open-plan living space and four bedrooms is minimalist \u2013 with pops of lime green from beams to cushions. Large windows, white walls and contemporary furniture have been paired with agricultural influences \u2013 wood cladding, corrugated roofing and concrete floors. Sitting on a hill above the Wye Valley, it offers views of the Black Mountains from the terrace, and Offa\u2019s Dyke Path, the Wye Valley Walk and the Abergavenny three peaks are all close by. * * * Captain\u2019s table, Hampshire Sleeps 3 | From \u00a386 a night Architects Alice and Henning Stummel appeared on Channel 4\u2019s Grand Designs with their London home (the Tin House, shortlisted for RIBA House of the Year). Their repurposed Boat Shed in Royal Lymington Yacht Club dinghy yard is close to the busy harbour, but this little, shingle-clad retreat is on a quiet road and has a private garden. The ground floor has a queen-size sofa bed, a small kitchen and dining table, and another single bed on the mezzanine (suitable for older children). There\u2019s a woodburner (but no wifi or TV) and plenty to explore nearby, including the Sea Water Baths in Lymington, the Sea Wall Coastal Walk and the New Forest \u2013 less than 10 minutes away by train. * * * Brilliant design * * * Inside out cabin, north Cornwall Sleeps 6 | From \u00a3235 a night With folding walls that slide upwards and a large outdoor deck, the Danish Cabin, on the coast near Tintagel, aims to make the most of the surrounding wilderness. The wooden structure sits on stilts above a stream, in a private forest less than two miles from the beach. Sleeping six in two bunks and two fold-out beds, it also has hanging wicker egg chairs, a composting toilet and a firepit. It\u2019s on an off-grid campsite, and there\u2019s a larger shared kitchen, a bar, wood-fired hot tubs, breakfast packages to order and hot showers. Activities include yoga, foraging and DJ parties. * * * Low on impact, big on style, Kent Sleeps 11 | From \u00a3275 a night The Passive House is an ultra energy-efficient building in Whitstable that uses design principles such as airtight build, thick insulation and natural light and heat. It is low-impact yet stylish, and big enough for groups of up to 11 people. Bedrooms and a mezzanine level are in one timber-clad block; another, whitewashed, houses an open-plan living space leading to a large garden. The angular form gives it an industrial feel, but it\u2019s a homely, sociable space, and makes a great base for exploring the north Kent coast. * * * Airship pod, West Sussex Sleeps 3 | From \u00a3130 a night A spaceship has landed near Billingshurst in West Sussex. The Sussex Airship is a retro sci-fi-style structure that looks like a spacecraft parked in private woodland in the village of Haven. It sleeps three in one double and one single sofa bed, and has a small kitchen, bathroom, barbecue area and views across surrounding meadows from the portholes and floor-to-ceiling windshield. The aluminium, stainless steel and glass structure was created by architects to be self-built, and dismantled and relocated by two people if desired. Bushcraft sessions are offered on site, and the hills, heathland, towns and villages of the South Downs national park are a short drive away. * * * Waterworks retro, South Cornwall Sleeps 6 | From \u00a3550 a week Fans of art deco will love the Filter House a 1954 waterworks in Ladock, near Truro. It was built by the South Cornwall Water Board to help supply the nearby Roseland Peninsula \u2013 famed for its wide, often uncrowded beaches and a popular area for walks and watersports. Operational until 1980, it was renovated in 2005 to create an art deco retreat, with vintage furniture throughout, and period details from a sunburst door to green leather chesterfield chairs and walnut bedroom sets. Mod cons include wifi, a sound system and underfloor heating. * * * Sleep in a sphere, Mid-Wales Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3199 for two nights Red Kite Conker is a surprisingly spacious copper ball in the Welsh hills near Builth-Wells in Powys, brainchild of aerospace engineer Jag Vardie. Surprisingly spacious, it comes with a custom-made double sofabed, a shower with views of the Elenydd mountains, and a kitchenette. With copper fittings and furnishings, and lined with turquoise hexagons, it\u2019s fun, cosy and modern, with tech-y extras such as an air recirculation system to regulate temperature and a bluetooth soundbar, plus a composting toilet, terrace and fire pit. It\u2019s a 10-minute walk to find a phone signal, and shops and a pub are a 10-minute drive. * * * Corrugated eco-house, Isle of Skye Sleeps 2 | From \u00a382 a night A compact shipping container-esque modern cabin on the shore of Loch Bracadale, Fiscavaig Studio has a corrugated iron-panelled exterior and a timber and woodchip board interior made cosy by wool throws, splashes of yellow and a woodburner. Made from local, sustainable materials, with a composting toilet, it\u2019s on the Minginish peninsula in the island\u2019s south-west, handy for walks and climbs in the nearby Cuillin mountain range and on the coast around Talisiker and Fiscavaig Bay. * * * Scandi cabin, Norfolk Broads Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3370 for 4 nights This 1930s Water Cabin has tiny portholes, large skylights, and a calming, ultra-modern white interior that contrasts with its jet black cedar exterior. It was renovated by creative agency Nor\u2013Folk, with help from local craftspeople, and sits on the banks of the River Thurne in the Norfolk Broads national park. Guests are encouraged to switch off devices and enjoy the library of design books and a lack of wifi or TV signal (although there is a DVD player), and cook and eat together in the open-plan space. By the water on the outskirts of Repps village, it has a dock, and electric boats are available for rent from nearby Potter Heigham, for exploring rivers and open water. * * * Rennie Mackintosh\u2019s cottage, near Inverness Sleeps 6 | From \u00a3509 a week Staying in a house designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh would be a dream come true for many art lovers. Sadly, it was one not realised by the great artist himself, who died before he had a chance to live in the curvy white cottage he designed \u2013 probably as a future home for him and his wife. The Artist\u2019s Cottage, a few miles from Inverness, with craggy mountain views, was sold last year and the new owners let it out when they\u2019re not there. It\u2019s a delight, with floral stained-glass windows, balconies and a central courtyard. * * * Baroque tower, Manchester Rooms 270 | From \u00a395 room-only The 1895 baroque-style tower of the Kimpton Clocktower Hotel (formerly the Principal) looms over the city centre. The Grade-II listed building was once the headquarters of the Refuge Assurance Company, then various hotels, and after extensive renovation it became the Principal in 2016. Unattractive 1990s additions have been removed, and original mouldings and stained-glass windows have been restored. The winter garden room\u2019s soaring, domed atrium is a showstopper, part of the Refuge bar and dining room, run by DJs-turned-restaurateurs Luke Cowdrey and Justin Crawford. * * * New Town chic, Edinburgh Rooms 72 | From \u00a370 a night In an elegant Georgian terrace, Eden Locke aparthotel is the second property from design-led Locke Living. The interior is bright and airy with a feast of muted tropical tones, brass fixtures, custom-made wicker furniture and large plants in terracotta pots. On the ground floor, a cafe-bar with a thick marble counter serves gluten-free pastries by day and local microbrewery ales at night. Studio bedrooms are in a rear extension, and there are free yoga classes for guests. * * * Best for families * * * A place to hover, Isle of Wight Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3195 for 4 nights in the VW, from \u00a3395 in the helicopter (based on 2 people) Possibly the zaniest glampsite in the country, Windmill Campersite has a choice of wacky shepherds\u2019 huts, VW campervans, a wooden shack and even a helicopter, bang in the middle of the Isle of Wight. It will have the kids\u2019 eyes out on stalks. The steampunk-style facilities include an old farm silo transformed into the spaceship-like Siloflix Cinema and a launderette in a converted Robin Reliant. The site is home to chickens and a horse, a silent disco area and a 20-acre field. If you\u2019re tempted to escape, there are two pubs a 10-minute walk away, and Carisbrooke Castle is nearby. * * * Your very own campsite, North York Moors Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3260 for three nights Festival vibes and home comforts are what you get at Coast and Camplight, a peaceful off-grid nature camp between Whitby and Robin Hood\u2019s Bay. At the moment there is just one big safari tent (five more are planned for next summer), so for now you\u2019ll have the whole 24-acre site to yourself. The owners recommend you turn off your phone and listen out for the resident tawny barn owls, paddle in the sea and hike to the pub. Cars have to be left away from the fields, where the camp is tucked into a hollow on the hillside but with a clear view of Whitby Abbey. Inside are cosy sofas, log-burners and unusual decorations that have all been found, upcycled or picked up from car-boot sales \u2013 the founders were influenced by summers spent at festivals such as Shambala and Secret Garden Party. An outdoor bathroom provides hot showers, plus there\u2019s a firepit and solar lights. * * * Boho garden retreat, London Sleeps 4 | From \u00a389 a night (based on 2 people) Finding a place to stay in London for four people for \u00a3100 a night without staying in a hostel is no easy task. The Urban London Yurt in Highgate, north London, not only fits the bill, it also provides an unusually green city escape and is only 20 minutes from the centre. Yes, essentially it\u2019s a tent in someone\u2019s garden, but this is no ordinary tent: Persian rugs cover a solid wood floor and two double sofa beds create a comfy retreat. The owner believes it is the only yurt accommodation in the capital. * * * Kitsch caravan park, Suffolk Sleeps 6 | From \u00a3550 a week Grab a slice of Americana in rural Suffolk at the Happy Days Retro Vacations site, where eight trailers \u2013 some sleek silver Tradewind Airstreams and Streamlines, others pint-sized, 1970s British models \u2013 are decorated vintage style, with bunting and retro graphic-print fabrics. The site \u2013 where there\u2019s space to pitch boring old tents too \u2013 has a play area with an old army truck and trampoline, as well as the usual swings and slide, a polytunnel housing giant Connect4 and table football, the Red Shed, a kitsch lounge screening classic family movies, plus an escape room game in a wartime Nissen hut. A few miles across farmland are the beaches near Thorpeness and arty Aldeburgh. * * * Busman\u2019s holiday, near Edinburgh Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3210 for two nights, luxury bus from \u00a3350 There\u2019s no need to disembark when it\u2019s your stop when staying at the Bus Stop, a collection of refurbished city buses in a field of a working arable farm just 30 minutes from Edinburgh. Thankfully, the usual bus floor detritus has been replaced by sofas, lanterns, wood burners and beds. Outside, there\u2019s a private hot tub and fire pit. The driver\u2019s seat has been left in place, which will thrill kids. Choose rustic or luxury \u2013 the latter have en suites and fancier fittings. Ironically, it\u2019s a little tricky to reach by bus from Edinburgh (two buses and a 0.6 mile hike), so driving is a better option. * * * Chapels and caravans, Shropshire Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3440 for 4 nights (The Chapel) There\u2019s an amazing collection of quirky cottages and glamping options on a large estate near Ludlow, with formal gardens and a fine arboretum around the private Walcot Hall. The most deliciously folksy-looking is The Chapel, a green tin tabernacle surrounded by the oaks and chestnuts of the Walcot Arboretum, with two double bedrooms on a mezzanine (adding to the sense of adventure is the limited lighting at night on the path \u2013 bring a torch). The Wheelwright\u2019s Shop, an original 1840s craftsman\u2019s shed, is decked out with Welsh blankets, a Rayburn, old tools and wood carvings. * * * Fantasy escape, North Devon Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3610 a week The fact that there are a number of Hobbit-themed hideaways in the UK attests to their appeal. The Hobbit Hole is the latest, so new it hasn\u2019t opened yet (booking available from 24 April). Its curvy walls, round door and grassy roof will delight children, regardless of whether they\u2019ve read Tolkien\u2019s classic. Outside there\u2019s a garden, barbecue and hot tub. Nearby the wide sweeping surf beaches of the north Devon coast await, and the gorgeous fishing village of Appledore, with its timeless seaside attractions, is just a couple of miles away. Exmoor is a 45 minute drive. * * * Finnish cabins, the Cotswolds Sleeps 4 to 11 | From \u00a3620 for four nights Fancy a Scandi-style lakeside escape without the flight? Log House Holidays\u2019 eight Finnish cabins sit in 130 acres of private nature reserve in the Cotswolds. Each has a hot tub and rowing boat. It\u2019s the perfect spot for wholesome fun: swim in the spring-fed lake; row, kayak or paddleboard; play rounders in the meadow; and toast marshmallows on the firepit. Since owner Anthony Edmonson bought the land in 1980 he has planted over 50,000 trees and large areas of reed beds in the lake, creating wildlife habitats. Water source pumps heat water, hot tubs and under-floor heating. * * * Carriage splendour, Suffolk Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3200 for 2 nights Sleeping in a first-class railway carriage from the golden age of steam usually means forking out for a luxury journey, but there\u2019s an affordable option at Coppins Farm in Suffolk, where a steam carriage dating back to 1885 is now a cute escape for four. Wood panelling and a woodburner add a cosy vibe, complemented by granny-chic interiors: sweeps of pink brocade curtain dividing the lounge area from two sleeping cabins, tasselled sofas and a floral roll-top bath tub. The site also has two showman\u2019s wagons (each sleeping four, from \u00a3190 for two nights). * * * Modern eco-bothy, Lanarkshire Sleeps 4 | From \u00a399 a night No crumbling old stone hut, Burnhead Bothy, set on a 1,600-acre farm, is a thoroughly modern affair \u2013 a timber-frame building with floor-to-ceiling windows, views across the Kilsyth Hills, and a simple pine interior. The farm is unusual too \u2013 home to Highland cattle and Valais sheep, whose wool insulates the sustainably built, off-grid, solar-powered pad. Water comes from a spring and the open-plan space is warmed by a woodburner. Edinburgh or Glasgow are easily reached, but with rock climbing, and kayaking from Auchinstarry Marina nearby, why bother? * * * Stunning locations * * * Old railway carriage, Ceredigion Sleeps 5 | From \u00a3307 for 2 nights Sit on the terrace of this converted Edwardian sleeping car and gaze out across an endless expanse of sea. The garden gate opens directly on to the Wales Coast Path, and the superb sandy beaches of Cardigan Bay are nearby, from Aberporth\u2019s two beaches to the sheltered cove of Mwnt and the mile-long Penbryn. Built in 1905 for the Waterloo-Plymouth boat train, Wendy the Coastal Carriage still has its original oak interior and authentic features such as signage and a side corridor past the bedrooms. Kids will love running up and down shouting \u201ctickets please\u201d! * * * Off-grid croft, Scottish Borders Sleeps 4 | From \u00a3360 for 3 nights Secluded Fiddle Hill Cottage is a new eco-lodge on a croft in rolling hills north of the small town of Hawick. Walking and on- and off-road cycling opportunities abound: the long-distance, circular Borders Abbey Way is a quarter of a mile away and two 7stanes mountain bike trails are each about a 40-minute drive. There are two electric bicycles for hire. Effective insulation, underfloor heating and a woodburner mean it\u2019s snug all year round, and double-height windows allow guests to take in the view, watch birds on the 30 feeders in the garden, and spot badgers. Wild flowers surround the cabin in spring. A hamper of scones, bread, homemade jam and wine is provided; farm produce \u2013 including lamb, beef, chicken and pork plus fruit and veg \u2013 can be ordered from the owner. * * * Magic Mournes, County Down Sleeps 2 | From \u00a370 a night Lackan Cottage Farm is an off-grid, organic smallholding offering visitors a taste of low-impact living amid some of Northern Ireland\u2019s most spectacular scenery. With views of the dramatic tor-topped Mourne mountains, carbon-neutral Birch Cottage is one of the few cottages in Northern Ireland to hold a Green Tourism Gold award. Or opt for the Horse Box (pictured), kitted out with reclaimed material and with its own herb garden \u2013 and views of the mountains from the bed. The site is solar- and wind-powered, has composting loos and grows food year-round. Walking and bike trails, the seaside at Newcastle and Tollymore Forest Park (a Game of Thrones site) are all within easy reach. The farm is the first permaculture centre in Northern Ireland; and the owners, who live on site, run courses and open days, and welcome volunteers to learn about sustainable living. * * * Fairytale cabin, north Wales Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3595 a week With a rocking chair on the veranda and a woodland path leading to its door, pitched-roof Ty Twt cabin near Conwy looks like something out of a fairytale. In the grounds of the owners\u2019 house but out of sight, it\u2019s a great base for exploring waterfalls, abbeys, castles and Snowdonia national park. A woodburner and selection of boardgames and musical instruments give it a homely feel, and the hamper including Welsh cakes and sloe gin is a welcome touch. On summer nights you can cook on the barbecue or firepit. * * * Swallows and Amazons, Norfolk Broads Sleeps 4 | From \u00a395 a night On a quiet stretch of the Broads, Hippersons Boatyard has four brightly coloured houseboats and two curvy wooden pods \u2013 one floating, one on land \u2013 that offer a chance to spend days on the water spotting otters, marsh harriers and kingfishers. Each houseboat comes with its own rowing boat and two of them, Coot Club and Swallows, are moored in a small boatyard off the main river, so safer for (older) children who want to have their own little Swallows and Amazons style adventure. There are canoes, kayaks or electric day boats to hire, perhaps for a trip up the River Waveney towards Geldeston \u2013 a low bridge deters larger craft \u2013 with a stop at the waterside Locks pub and brewery. Bikes can also be rented. The boatyard is a 10-minute walk from the market town of Beccles, where the Royal Oak does Neapolitan-style oak-fired pizzas. The pods cost from \u00a3150 a night (sleeping four). Open April-October. * * * Army truck, Jurassic coast, Dorset Sleeps 2 | From \u00a350 a night Set on a campsite with sea views, this vintage Bedford MJ Truck is now a bijou, wood-clad space with a woodburner, kitchen, electric cool box underneath and fire pit. Nearby Charmouth is famed for its fossils \u2013 stop off at the heritage centre for information on the geology of the area and what you can expect to find, or to join a guided fossil walk. The beach is also popular for rockpooling and safe for swimming. Follow the South West Coast Path from Charmouth to Lyme Regis \u2013 which heads inland along this stretch. Foodie Bridport is nearby too. * * * Shepherd\u2019s hut, Romney Marsh, Kent Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3299 for 3 nights Romney Marsh is dotted with the remnants of small brick \u201clookers\u201d \u2013 shelters used by shepherds in the 18th and 19th centuries. Now one of them, The Lookers Legacy, has been transformed into a stylish hideaway for two with a timber extension and views across the neighbouring vineyard. Inside there are the usual trappings of the modern retreat \u2013 woodburner, bare brick, fur throws, hot tub \u2013 but it\u2019s the setting that makes it special. It stands on its own in a grassy field, surrounded by green and pleasant countryside and surrounding fields. Guests could walk the Saxon Shore Way, which runs through the nearby village of Stone-in-Oxney, home to the Ferry Inn. Tenterden, Rye and the beach at Camber Sands are all within easy reach too. * * * Rewild yourself, the Cotswolds Sleeps 2-3 | From \u00a389 a night The number of places offering visitors the chance to \u201crewild\u201d themselves is on the rise. Opening this spring Campwell \u2013 near Marshfield, nine miles north of Bath \u2013 invites guests to live simpler and more adventurous lives in off-grid cabins, yurts and a cob house on its woodland site. Swim in a \u201csecret lake\u201d and warm up in the sauna. Bookable activities include yoga, foraging and woodworking courses (from Easter); there are also plans for retreats (October 2-4, from \u00a3350pp, with more dates in 2021). Showers and kitchen facilities are in two separate shelters. Aiming to be carbon negative, the owners plant a tree for every booking. Available for group bookings too. * * * Loughside cottage, County Fermanagh Sleeps 5 | From \u00a3299 for 3 nights (for two people) Billed as one of the best-preserved cottages in Northern Ireland, Geaglum is a picture-postcard thatched home with a 1950s-style interior \u2013 and a Gypsy caravan in the garden. It\u2019s less than half a mile from a pebble beach with a quay on Upper Lough Erne, an atmospheric maze of waterways and 150 islets bearing the marks of Celtic and Christian settlements. Hire a boat at Knockkinny Marina, a 15-minute drive away, to explore on the water, or scramble over the castle ruins and wonderful old yew trees of the National Trust-owned Crom Estate. Head north to Lower Lough Erne to discover the ancient stone figures of Boa island, or make a Game of Thrones pilgrimage to the Riverlands hideout (AKA Pollnagollum Cave in season 3), part of Marble Arch Caves. * * * Artists\u2019 retreat, Welsh borders Sleeps 2 | From \u00a3565 a week The blue haze that envelops the Hindwell Valley on a summer\u2019s evening reminded Australian artist Sidney Nolan of the wild landscapes of his homeland. Such was his love of this slice of rural Britain that he moved here with his wife Mary in the 1980s. The trust they set up still supports established and emerging artists and runs a programme of creative courses. This year it opened Orchard Cottage (formerly the gardener\u2019s cottage) as a holiday let. Guests can wander the grounds, which include Rodd Court, the Jacobean manor house where the couple lived, walk in the valley and visit Nolan\u2019s studio. Proceeds go towards the trust\u2019s education and creative programme, which works with local schoolchildren and visiting artists from around the world.",

We did zero research and we nearly lost everything. Suddenly we were struggling to pay the rent, brown envelopes containing red demand letters arrived daily and there were times when we literally had no money for food. To this day the awful fear of money vanishing at an accelerated speed stays with me.</p> <p>Eventually we managed to turn things around, with my wife, Susan, and I taking multiple jobs including cleaning, waiting tables, night shifts and newspaper delivery.</p> <p>I first started selling original pieces and today my art is sold around the world, with my prints starting from about \u00a3450 and originals starting from \u00a310,000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/29/i-used-to-earn-150000-but-had-a-disrespect-for-money\">'I used to earn \u00a3150,000 but had a disrespect for money'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to bills, I don\u2019t have a clue: Susan sorts all that out. I don\u2019t use technology; I\u2019ve never turned a computer on. I know we paid off our mortgage years ago.</p> <p>I\u2019m not really a spender. I asked my daughter what she thought I spent my money on, and she replied \u201cnot electricity\u201d. I still go around turning off the lights, I hate waste. I\u2019m not into fancy things: I had mashed potato for dinner.</p> <p>I\u2019ve flown so much, it doesn\u2019t excite me any more. I don\u2019t have big expectations. I prefer simpler things. I\u2019d rather have a tin of beans and watch an old John Wayne film. As long as we\u2019re safe and comfortable, that\u2019s what\u2019s important.</p> <p>I do like to spend my money on good art materials such as handmade pastels with a high density of natural pigment.</p> <p>One indulgence I do enjoy is occasionally splashing out in a nice restaurant. I can feel a bit uncomfortable spending so much on a meal, but I totally respect and appreciate the skill, time and vision that goes into producing a plate of food that looks like a work of art and tastes like heaven.</p> <p>After a lot of deliberating and soul searching, a few years ago my wife took out private health insurance for both of us. Within around two months, I had a perforated bowel; the wonderful NHS saved my life and, in the process, discovered I had bowel cancer. The insurance covered my chemotherapy and while the consultant assured me the treatment I would get privately would be exactly the same as on the NHS, he said it would relieve pressure on the system and if I had insurance, then I should use it, so that is what I did. I remain grateful that we took out the private health care, while also acknowledging that I am extremely lucky. I now provide private health insurance for members of staff who want it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/22/i-didnt-become-a-competitive-swimmer-for-money\">'I didn't become a competitive swimmer for money'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the years I have supported many charities. I feel I have a moral duty to do this and am thrilled when one of my pieces raises money for a deserving charity. </p> <p>I grew up in Middlesbrough and will always fly the flag for the town, which has struggled economically since the industry of the area went. Last year we celebrated 30 years since I took the leap of faith to be a full-time artist; the gallery in North Yorkshire remains open and I exhibit my work internationally. I marked the event by developing a sculpture called Waiting for Me Dad and cast it in bronze; it was placed next to Middlesbrough\u2019s Transporter bridge in honour of the men and women who made my town great.</p> <p>I have made some irresponsible decisions and won\u2019t be making any impulsive moves again.

      "bodyText": "Name: Mackenzie Thorpe Age: 63 Income: \u00a355,000 to \u00a365,000 a year Occupation: Artist, Hove, Sussex My approach to money has been shaped by when I was in my late 20s and I risked everything to try and achieve my dream of becoming a full-time artist and open a gallery in North Yorkshire. We did zero research and we nearly lost everything. Suddenly we were struggling to pay the rent, brown envelopes containing red demand letters arrived daily and there were times when we literally had no money for food. To this day the awful fear of money vanishing at an accelerated speed stays with me. Eventually we managed to turn things around, with my wife, Susan, and I taking multiple jobs including cleaning, waiting tables, night shifts and newspaper delivery. I first started selling original pieces and today my art is sold around the world, with my prints starting from about \u00a3450 and originals starting from \u00a310,000. When it comes to bills, I don\u2019t have a clue: Susan sorts all that out. I don\u2019t use technology; I\u2019ve never turned a computer on. I know we paid off our mortgage years ago. I\u2019m not really a spender. I asked my daughter what she thought I spent my money on, and she replied \u201cnot electricity\u201d. I still go around turning off the lights, I hate waste. I\u2019m not into fancy things: I had mashed potato for dinner. I\u2019ve flown so much, it doesn\u2019t excite me any more. I don\u2019t have big expectations. I prefer simpler things. I\u2019d rather have a tin of beans and watch an old John Wayne film. As long as we\u2019re safe and comfortable, that\u2019s what\u2019s important. I do like to spend my money on good art materials such as handmade pastels with a high density of natural pigment. One indulgence I do enjoy is occasionally splashing out in a nice restaurant. I can feel a bit uncomfortable spending so much on a meal, but I totally respect and appreciate the skill, time and vision that goes into producing a plate of food that looks like a work of art and tastes like heaven. After a lot of deliberating and soul searching, a few years ago my wife took out private health insurance for both of us. Within around two months, I had a perforated bowel; the wonderful NHS saved my life and, in the process, discovered I had bowel cancer. The insurance covered my chemotherapy and while the consultant assured me the treatment I would get privately would be exactly the same as on the NHS, he said it would relieve pressure on the system and if I had insurance, then I should use it, so that is what I did. I remain grateful that we took out the private health care, while also acknowledging that I am extremely lucky. I now provide private health insurance for members of staff who want it. Over the years I have supported many charities. I feel I have a moral duty to do this and am thrilled when one of my pieces raises money for a deserving charity. I grew up in Middlesbrough and will always fly the flag for the town, which has struggled economically since the industry of the area went. Last year we celebrated 30 years since I took the leap of faith to be a full-time artist; the gallery in North Yorkshire remains open and I exhibit my work internationally. I marked the event by developing a sculpture called Waiting for Me Dad and cast it in bronze; it was placed next to Middlesbrough\u2019s Transporter bridge in honour of the men and women who made my town great. I have made some irresponsible decisions and won\u2019t be making any impulsive moves again. I take a relatively modest salary and annual dividend from my company and am focused on making sure we have a solid financial foundation under our feet. We have paid off our mortgage, and we have a property we rent out, and pensions and Isas and premium bonds which will hopefully give us security in old age. With a bit of luck there will be some left for our children and grandchildren. I don\u2019t intend to retire fully: I will always paint, sculpt and create.",

They are big business too: tours and book tie-ins underpin the business model of the likes of Chapo. Crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon, which enable fans to support their favourite pods and unlock extra tiers of content as a reward, have made independent profitability possible. Crooked Media, which hosts multiple shows alongside <a href=\"https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/\">Pod Save America</a>, is arguably becoming a new media empire.</p> <p>The UK has followed suit. Pods ranging from <a href=\"https://trashfuturepodcast.podbean.com/\">Trashfuture</a> (a response to the \u201ccontinuing psychic trauma of capitalism\u201d) to Novara Media\u2019s <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/category/audio/tyskysour/\">Tysky</a><a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/category/audio/tyskysour/\">Sour</a> have extolled the virtues of Corbynism. <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/remainiacs-podcast\">The Remainiacs</a> podcast (centrists who suddenly found themselves on the outside looking in) and their second, less Brexit-focused spin-off The Bunker, have become the voice of despairing liberalism. On the right, there is the podcast arm of online magazine Spiked (which recently interviewed privilege-denying thesp Laurence Fox) and The Delingpod, in which journalist James Delingpole does his tendentious, climate crisis-sceptic thing in surround sound.</p> <p>The much-mocked \u201cmainstream media\u201d has responded with pods of its own, in the process often making it clear why their competitors had to happen in the first place. The BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04z203l/episodes/downloads\">Political Thinking </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04z203l/episodes/downloads\">With Nick Robinson</a> boasts titles suggesting the least appetising Friends episodes ever (The Nicky Morgan One; The What Does Boris Johnson Really Think One) and actually uses its extended duration as an excuse to get even cosier still with prominent politicians. These pods don\u2019t exactly go out of their way to dispel the notion that conventional political journalism is frequently a self-perpetuating Human Centipede of quid pro quo banality.</p> <p>Conversely, the success of independent political podcasting is in large part due to the energy generated by outsiders grabbing a platform without permission. Political podcasts thrive on insurgency, on opposition to jaded official voices. \u201cUnmediated, unscripted, direct and authentic content is hugely appealing,\u201d says Dr Lance Dann, who co-wrote <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/podcasting-9781501328688/\">Podcasting: The Audio Media Revolution</a> with fellow academic Dr Martin Spinelli. \u201cIt\u2019s a raw energy and anger that people can express in the moment.\u201d The traditional media has struggled with balance, so in the face of the absurdity of Trump, Johnson and Brexit, these unguarded and incredulous voices have felt not just refreshing but necessary.</p> <p>In fact, the unashamed lack of balance is part of the fun. In an era of correspondents parroting the briefings of anonymous government sources, they feel honest: vigorously and proudly partial. If you are starting to doubt official versions of the truth, it is thrilling to find you\u2019re not alone. \u201cThe form itself is incredibly free,\u201d says Spinelli. \u201cThere are no gatekeepers, there are no rules, the fear of defamation is virtually nonexistent, and podcasters have been experimenting in developing relationships with their audiences based on these attributes. That\u2019s a key point: podcasting is really about a relationship rather than the spoken word.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff4d437fbe667d0e7469af612b6a8f14fee0094\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff4d437fbe667d0e7469af612b6a8f14fee0094/0_6_1654_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Podcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But relationships can become too cosy, and insurgency can curdle into isolationism. Jessa Crispin, whose <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/forever-dog-podcast-network/public-intellectual\">Public Intellectual podcast</a> in the US explores a variety of outlooks, recently hosted an episode whose title suggested that <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/public-intellectual-2379837/you-can-talk-to-a-conservative-like-a-normal-human-being-with-gerald-russello\">You Can Talk to a Conservative Like a Normal Human Being</a>. It was a reaction to a consensus in which, she says, \u201caudiences are mostly looking for a podcast that agrees with what they already believe\u201d. These podcasts\u2019 hosts, she adds, try \u201cto turn everything into a punchline. Everyone is trying to follow the Chapo model; guys shouting over one another, eager to make the best joke. If I wanted to listen to men from privileged backgrounds who think they know best about everything, I\u2019d turn on the cable news.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, one of the most notable problems with some of the \u201cdirtbag left\u201d pods is how light on policy discussion they have become. Rather than being a meaningful part of a battle of ideas, they can sometimes feel like hipsterism manifesting as political punditry, what Sigmund Freud called \u201cthe narcissism of small differences\u201d rendered streamable. Some of the hard-left podcasts often seem more animated by their loathing of \u201ccentrists\u201d than by adversaries on the right. Similarly, few liberal podcasts manage to hide their scorn for the Corbyn project. As Crispin puts it: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of territorial behaviour. \u2018This is what I believe; if you don\u2019t believe it too, get the hell out.\u2019 There\u2019s very little bridge building. The thing I get from most of them is not just a lack of humility but a lack of curiosity. There\u2019s the assumption that they have the right opinions.\u201d</p> <p>With that in mind, it would be fascinating to see how the likes of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house\">Chapo</a> might react to actually getting what they want. The show\u2019s host, Will Menaker, recently sparked controversy by pledging to refuse to vote for anyone but Sanders in November. But if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination, Chapo would be forced to move on from thinking up insults for Pete Buttigieg (\u201cRatfuck CIA operative,\u201d being a recent highlight) and on to discussing policy detail. They would move from the outer edges to the inside track.</p> <p>For a glimpse of how tricky this mainstreaming process can be, it is worth considering the opposition. Take the pugnacious provocateurs over at The Spiked Podcast. A recent episode titled The Woke Stasi spoke volumes about their determination to continue obscuring dry policy issues with emotive cultural ones. But its shtick is now predictable to the point of tedium; straw men constructed for the sole purpose of presenting themselves as the contrarian opposition to what they term \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e96393cec3c5758c67411eb09fddb7d163294d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e96393cec3c5758c67411eb09fddb7d163294d5/0_0_1400_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Rogan Experience\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Rogan Experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, the problem with evoking the Stasi is that the Stasi were the government. Their power was tangible and frightening. Whereas \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d or whatever other lazy identifier you might employ to avoid discussing systemic inequality, is currently under siege like never before. If Spiked ever offered an outsider perspective, those days are long gone; its viewpoint is now represented at the heart of the establishment. How much more culturally dominant would the performatively populist right have to be before its outriders accepted that they were policing the status quo? </p> <p>And yet the medium retains vast potential. The best political podcasts boast wit and irreverence while allowing space for the informed deep dive too. With its generous tone, Ed Miliband\u2019s <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/reasonstobecheerful\">Reasons to Be Cheerful</a> pod is the sound of a man bringing a plastic picnic knife to a gunfight \u2013 but it has established a niche, and it is set apart by its open-mindedness and emphasis on policy and ideas. Likewise, for his <a href=\"https://www.earwolf.com/show/getting-curious-with-jonathan-van-ness/\">Getting Curious podcast</a>, Queer Eye\u2019s Jonathan Van Ness conducted an impressive, humanising interview with Elizabeth Warren.</p> <p>Fascinating material can emerge in unlikely places. Podcasting behemoth <a href=\"http://podcasts.joerogan.net/\">Joe Rogan</a> (whose audience runs into millions per episode) is best known as a politically unaffiliated libertarian comedian; a weed-smoking, bench-pressing, deer-hunting avatar of red-blooded male America. And yet his conversation with Bernie Sanders was as thorough an interrogation of Sanders\u2019s actual policy as any of the radical left pods have managed, and will have reached parts of the electorate that previous Democratic candidates can only have dreamed about.</p> <p>November\u2019s US presidential election may mark a turning point for political podcasts. Can they use their energy and large audiences to make a difference, and convince those outside of their echo chambers?</p> <p>\u201cPeople listen to podcasts for a sense of community, for companionship and, in terms of politics, to have their views confirmed,\u201d says Dann. \u201cAs such, podcasting has become the perfect embodiment of the dangers of social and web media bubbles. Audiences are listening in. They need to force themselves to listen out.\u201d</p>",

On the right, there is the podcast arm of online magazine Spiked (which recently interviewed privilege-denying thesp Laurence Fox) and The Delingpod, in which journalist James Delingpole does his tendentious, climate crisis-sceptic thing in surround sound. The much-mocked \u201cmainstream media\u201d has responded with pods of its own, in the process often making it clear why their competitors had to happen in the first place. The BBC\u2019s Political Thinking With Nick Robinson boasts titles suggesting the least appetising Friends episodes ever (The Nicky Morgan One; The What Does Boris Johnson Really Think One) and actually uses its extended duration as an excuse to get even cosier still with prominent politicians. These pods don\u2019t exactly go out of their way to dispel the notion that conventional political journalism is frequently a self-perpetuating Human Centipede of quid pro quo banality. Conversely, the success of independent political podcasting is in large part due to the energy generated by outsiders grabbing a platform without permission. Political podcasts thrive on insurgency, on opposition to jaded official voices. \u201cUnmediated, unscripted, direct and authentic content is hugely appealing,\u201d says Dr Lance Dann, who co-wrote Podcasting: The Audio Media Revolution with fellow academic Dr Martin Spinelli. \u201cIt\u2019s a raw energy and anger that people can express in the moment.\u201d The traditional media has struggled with balance, so in the face of the absurdity of Trump, Johnson and Brexit, these unguarded and incredulous voices have felt not just refreshing but necessary. In fact, the unashamed lack of balance is part of the fun. In an era of correspondents parroting the briefings of anonymous government sources, they feel honest: vigorously and proudly partial. If you are starting to doubt official versions of the truth, it is thrilling to find you\u2019re not alone. \u201cThe form itself is incredibly free,\u201d says Spinelli. \u201cThere are no gatekeepers, there are no rules, the fear of defamation is virtually nonexistent, and podcasters have been experimenting in developing relationships with their audiences based on these attributes. That\u2019s a key point: podcasting is really about a relationship rather than the spoken word.\u201d But relationships can become too cosy, and insurgency can curdle into isolationism. Jessa Crispin, whose Public Intellectual podcast in the US explores a variety of outlooks, recently hosted an episode whose title suggested that You Can Talk to a Conservative Like a Normal Human Being. It was a reaction to a consensus in which, she says, \u201caudiences are mostly looking for a podcast that agrees with what they already believe\u201d. These podcasts\u2019 hosts, she adds, try \u201cto turn everything into a punchline. Everyone is trying to follow the Chapo model; guys shouting over one another, eager to make the best joke. If I wanted to listen to men from privileged backgrounds who think they know best about everything, I\u2019d turn on the cable news.\u201d In fact, one of the most notable problems with some of the \u201cdirtbag left\u201d pods is how light on policy discussion they have become. Rather than being a meaningful part of a battle of ideas, they can sometimes feel like hipsterism manifesting as political punditry, what Sigmund Freud called \u201cthe narcissism of small differences\u201d rendered streamable. Some of the hard-left podcasts often seem more animated by their loathing of \u201ccentrists\u201d than by adversaries on the right. Similarly, few liberal podcasts manage to hide their scorn for the Corbyn project. As Crispin puts it: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of territorial behaviour. \u2018This is what I believe; if you don\u2019t believe it too, get the hell out.\u2019 There\u2019s very little bridge building. The thing I get from most of them is not just a lack of humility but a lack of curiosity. There\u2019s the assumption that they have the right opinions.\u201d With that in mind, it would be fascinating to see how the likes of Chapo might react to actually getting what they want. The show\u2019s host, Will Menaker, recently sparked controversy by pledging to refuse to vote for anyone but Sanders in November. But if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination, Chapo would be forced to move on from thinking up insults for Pete Buttigieg (\u201cRatfuck CIA operative,\u201d being a recent highlight) and on to discussing policy detail. They would move from the outer edges to the inside track. For a glimpse of how tricky this mainstreaming process can be, it is worth considering the opposition. Take the pugnacious provocateurs over at The Spiked Podcast. A recent episode titled The Woke Stasi spoke volumes about their determination to continue obscuring dry policy issues with emotive cultural ones. But its shtick is now predictable to the point of tedium; straw men constructed for the sole purpose of presenting themselves as the contrarian opposition to what they term \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d. However, the problem with evoking the Stasi is that the Stasi were the government. Their power was tangible and frightening. Whereas \u201cwokeness\u201d, \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d or whatever other lazy identifier you might employ to avoid discussing systemic inequality, is currently under siege like never before. If Spiked ever offered an outsider perspective, those days are long gone; its viewpoint is now represented at the heart of the establishment. How much more culturally dominant would the performatively populist right have to be before its outriders accepted that they were policing the status quo? And yet the medium retains vast potential. The best political podcasts boast wit and irreverence while allowing space for the informed deep dive too. With its generous tone, Ed Miliband\u2019s Reasons to Be Cheerful pod is the sound of a man bringing a plastic picnic knife to a gunfight \u2013 but it has established a niche, and it is set apart by its open-mindedness and emphasis on policy and ideas. Likewise, for his Getting Curious podcast, Queer Eye\u2019s Jonathan Van Ness conducted an impressive, humanising interview with Elizabeth Warren. Fascinating material can emerge in unlikely places. Podcasting behemoth Joe Rogan (whose audience runs into millions per episode) is best known as a politically unaffiliated libertarian comedian; a weed-smoking, bench-pressing, deer-hunting avatar of red-blooded male America. And yet his conversation with Bernie Sanders was as thorough an interrogation of Sanders\u2019s actual policy as any of the radical left pods have managed, and will have reached parts of the electorate that previous Democratic candidates can only have dreamed about. November\u2019s US presidential election may mark a turning point for political podcasts. Can they use their energy and large audiences to make a difference, and convince those outside of their echo chambers? \u201cPeople listen to podcasts for a sense of community, for companionship and, in terms of politics, to have their views confirmed,\u201d says Dann. \u201cAs such, podcasting has become the perfect embodiment of the dangers of social and web media bubbles. Audiences are listening in. They need to force themselves to listen out.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In opposition to the smug marrieds, we singletons have always liked to position ourselves on the frontline of life, squaring off against creeps and weirdos in our valiant search for love. Already shut out of the property market and two-for-one meal deals, we\u2019re now unfairly burdened by coronavirus, confronted with a new dilemma: risk infection by going on dates, or remain for ever alone. Tinder, considered instrumental to a culture of casual sex and hook-ups, has warned users to \u201cmaintain social distance\u201d \u2013 and carry hand sanitiser. OkCupid, meanwhile, has found that mentions of the virus on UK profiles are skyrocketing. I am not active on any apps at the moment, but I have been picturing those first dates taking place against the backdrop of a global pandemic. It is easy to imagine the chat, at least. Coronavirus has handed single people the most obvious of openers. Screw getting-to-know-you questions about work or family \u2013 right now all conversations come back to the virus. It\u2019s as ubiquitous as Brexit, but it moves faster and is less divisive than identifying as leave or remain. In fact, the pandemic has been oddly unifying: though we might not see eye to eye on the government\u2019s response, we can all agree upon the threat posed by Covid-19. The last non-political event I can remember that captured collective attention in this way was the Thai cave rescue in 2018: a similarly fast-moving saga, breaking from dreary politics with multiple points of entry (the boys dreaming of KFC, the approaching storm, Elon Musk\u2019s offer of a hi-tech rescue to the trapped party before he called one of the rescue divers \u201cpedo guy\u201d in a now infamous tweet). The story offered something for everyone; it was the perfect first-date fodder. In that case, of course, the stakes were much lower (at least for those of us outside the cave). Yet dating, and app dating in particular, is a risk at the best of times. On the one hand, you\u2019re making yourself vulnerable to rejection. And on the other, especially for women, you are meeting a stranger who may intend to do you harm. In \u201cputting yourself out there\u201d, as we\u2019re often told is crucial to dating success, single people weigh up the likelihood of such outcomes.

Then we might lose power again within five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Times have changed.

He and his musicians also feature on the album, which journeys across the cities of the world, from Berlin to Tbilisi, combining the genres of film and classical music, folk and pop, tango, jazz and gypsy in 12 pieces.</p> <p>The final track, Tbilisi, by Giya Kancheli, a feted Georgian composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/07/giya-kancheli-obituary\">who died last year</a>, is, for Batiashvili, the most poignant. \u201cIt recalls the pain and anxiety of this small country, which has been in conflict most of its history, at the crossroads of bigger powers, who always wanted something from us. It\u2019s an endless story, which is still relevant today,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Later, Batiashvili and Melua, on whom Kancheli was also a big influence, will lay flowers at his grave in Tbilisi together.But even as the two musicians meet for the first time, politely shaking hands and greeting each other in Georgian in the wood-panelled, Soviet-era studio, outside, anti-government protests are convulsing Tbilisi.</p> <p>\u201cI was woken up by water cannon fire this morning, as our apartment is just behind the parliament,\u201d says Melua, showing a video on her phone of police trying to break up the protesters, thousands of whom have taken to the streets in recent months, campaigning for electoral reform, even pitching tents at the foot of the parliament building.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7zbyvwKtM8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p7zbyvwKtM8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Batiashvili says: \u201cThe protesters would like the country to move closer to Europe, while others think retaining the closeness to Russia is important. The government plays a sort of game where they pretend to go in both directions. But of course you can\u2019t go both ways.\u201d</p> <p>Melua\u2019s contribution to City Lights is the raspy ballad No Better Magic, a heartfelt tribute to London, her adoptive city. Written by her, it conjures an idyllic picture of London life passing through the seasons, told by an observer at the Serpentine lake in Hyde Park.</p> <p>For the orchestra accompanying her, she translates the lyrics into Georgian and explains the title. The musicians applaud. Melua says the song sums up her feelings towards Britain, where she moved with her parents in the 1990s when she was just eight, escaping from the aftermath of Georgia\u2019s civil war, which left the country in economic ruin.</p> <p>\u201cViewed through the eyes of a Georgian, Britain has this touching delicacy about it, embodied in its well-tended parks, people\u2019s love of nature, and London \u2013 where I now live \u2013 from my Georgian perspective, is the most extraordinary place to chance upon. I wanted to capture that in this song and paint that picture,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course, once you\u2019re inside British culture, you realise it\u2019s full of drama and its own kind of wildness.\u201d </p> <p>Batiashvili\u2019s family left Georgia for similar reasons, choosing to settle in Germany because of their expectation that she would get a good education in classical music.

      "bodyText": "In a recording booth at the Georgian Film Studios in Tbilisi, an engineer helping to record the violinist Lisa Batiashvili\u2019s new album curses under his breath as the electrics on the soundboard repeatedly switch off. Katie Melua, the British-Georgian singer-songwriter, is perched on a piano stool, nodding in time to the music. \u201cYou\u2019re in Georgia \u2013 you have to get used to it,\u201d she says. Such mishaps were a part of her everyday life when she was growing up. \u201cThough what was most stressful was when the lights came back on again after a power cut,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone would rush around \u2013 my uncles to their cassette players to listen to music, I\u2019d put in a VHS to watch a film, my gran would run to heat up the water. Then we might lose power again within five minutes.\u201d Times have changed. Georgia is growing economically, power cuts are rarer, and Melua is back in the capital to record a track on Batiashvili\u2019s album City Lights. \u201cFor a long time Georgia was not somewhere I\u2019d have considered recording music,\u201d Melua says. \u201cBut artistically the country\u2019s always been very rich, and now the technology is coming into its own.\u201d The Georgian conductor and composer Nikoloz Rachveli, who is artistic director of the Georgian Philharmonic Orchestra, was responsible for bringing the compatriots together. He and his musicians also feature on the album, which journeys across the cities of the world, from Berlin to Tbilisi, combining the genres of film and classical music, folk and pop, tango, jazz and gypsy in 12 pieces. The final track, Tbilisi, by Giya Kancheli, a feted Georgian composer who died last year, is, for Batiashvili, the most poignant. \u201cIt recalls the pain and anxiety of this small country, which has been in conflict most of its history, at the crossroads of bigger powers, who always wanted something from us. It\u2019s an endless story, which is still relevant today,\u201d she says. Later, Batiashvili and Melua, on whom Kancheli was also a big influence, will lay flowers at his grave in Tbilisi together.But even as the two musicians meet for the first time, politely shaking hands and greeting each other in Georgian in the wood-panelled, Soviet-era studio, outside, anti-government protests are convulsing Tbilisi. \u201cI was woken up by water cannon fire this morning, as our apartment is just behind the parliament,\u201d says Melua, showing a video on her phone of police trying to break up the protesters, thousands of whom have taken to the streets in recent months, campaigning for electoral reform, even pitching tents at the foot of the parliament building. Batiashvili says: \u201cThe protesters would like the country to move closer to Europe, while others think retaining the closeness to Russia is important. The government plays a sort of game where they pretend to go in both directions. But of course you can\u2019t go both ways.\u201d Melua\u2019s contribution to City Lights is the raspy ballad No Better Magic, a heartfelt tribute to London, her adoptive city. Written by her, it conjures an idyllic picture of London life passing through the seasons, told by an observer at the Serpentine lake in Hyde Park. For the orchestra accompanying her, she translates the lyrics into Georgian and explains the title. The musicians applaud. Melua says the song sums up her feelings towards Britain, where she moved with her parents in the 1990s when she was just eight, escaping from the aftermath of Georgia\u2019s civil war, which left the country in economic ruin. \u201cViewed through the eyes of a Georgian, Britain has this touching delicacy about it, embodied in its well-tended parks, people\u2019s love of nature, and London \u2013 where I now live \u2013 from my Georgian perspective, is the most extraordinary place to chance upon. I wanted to capture that in this song and paint that picture,\u201d she says. \u201cOf course, once you\u2019re inside British culture, you realise it\u2019s full of drama and its own kind of wildness.\u201d Batiashvili\u2019s family left Georgia for similar reasons, choosing to settle in Germany because of their expectation that she would get a good education in classical music. She has gone on to become one of the leading violinists of her generation, performing with some of the world\u2019s major orchestras and frequently appearing at the Proms. \u201cWhat I became was thanks to Germany, where I found my place as a foreigner as soon as I was accepted into the school orchestra. But like all Georgian children, I had been given a strong musical grounding and I remain deeply connected to Georgia through the music,\u201d she says. Melua says being in a choir in Georgia and having singing lessons there gave her the basis for her success in the UK, where she attended a performing arts school and went on to have several hit songs. \u201cWhen we left Georgia, I remember being particularly sad about leaving my singing teacher, Zia, and my heavy metal-loving uncles,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the same time, I had this great hope of moving somewhere where the electricity would work and the water was always available. Though when I look back, I think my musical ear probably developed during the blackouts, when we spent the evenings in candlelight and my Mum played the piano.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The financial world is reeling. After the most dramatic week since the financial crisis, investors are counting their losses while economists fear the world economy risks a painful recession this year. Anxiety that global policymakers are failing to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic wiped trillions of dollars off stocks across the globe. The turmoil was compounded by Saudi Arabia launching an oil price war, which threatens to put some US shale producers out of business, triggering debt defaults. For younger traders in the City, this was their first introduction to true panic on the trading floors. Global markets plunged twice, on Monday and Thursday, with losses exceeding the worst times in the eurozone debt crisis. The FTSE 100 index had already been through two bad weeks, but the last five days inflicted the deepest losses yet on the nation\u2019s pension pots, ISAs, share portfolios and funds. By Friday\u2019s close it had lost 1,096 points, or 17%, shedding \u00a3275bn in a week. Helal Miah, Investment Research Analyst at the Share Centre, said: \u201cIn my 20-plus years in the industry, I find it difficult to remember another week of such momentous moves. Yes, we had some big moves during the financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis and the odd flash crash, yet they never had the extreme one day moves as we have had this week. Following yesterday\u2019s biggest one-day fall since the \u201887 crash, this morning the market opened up by over 6%. Some investors may ask whether this is the bottom. It could be, but seasoned traders and investors will merely see it as a dead-cat bounce. Those of a more nervous disposition may just want to sit tight until the volatility dies down.\u201d Even older City heads hadn\u2019t seen anything like it. Oil suffered its biggest crash since the 1991 Gulf War, after Saudi Arabia dramatically vowed to flood the market with supplies. Saudi ordered its producers to turn the taps up after Russia refused to back an Opec plan to curb output. This shocked the markets, as Covid-19 is already cutting energy demand. Brent crude plunged by a third to $31/barrel, while US crude hit $27. Shares in oil producers across the globe fell too, helping to trigger Monday\u2019s market crash. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic bank SEB, said: \u201cSaudi Arabia is now selling its oil into Europe at about $25 per barrel and inventories are building rapidly. As the coronavirus crisis now accelerates in the US and Europe, there is little that can save Brent from $20/barrel except for a war in the Middle East or a last-minute Opec+ deal. \u201cThe WTI crude oil price has halted just above the $30/barrel line at which virtually all US shale oil wells are rendered unprofitable. \u201cThe global demand side of the equation is now totally insensitive to lower prices in terms of demand right now. It is not so difficult to imagine that global oil demand declines by 10%.\u201d America\u2019s bull market celebrated its 11th birthday this week, and promptly stomped off. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones indices of US stocks plunged over 20% from their record peaks, putting them into a bear market. The end came amid wild swings \u2013 usually downwards \u2013 on Wall Street, as Donald Trump\u2019s shock ban on EU travel to the US spooked investors. But there was a late rally too, as Trump declared a national emergency to help fight the coronavirus threat. The bull market began in March 2009, as the world economy began to recover from the economic shock of the last crisis. The speed of its demise shows the next crisis has arrived. David Kostin, Goldman\u2019s chief US equity strategist, predicted that the earnings of America\u2019s largest companies would fall by 5% this year, as the bull market fizzled out. \u201cBoth the real economy and the financial economy are exhibiting acute signs of stress,\u201d Kostin told clients. But he also believes markets will recover late this year. \u201cA new bull market will likely be born later this year \u2026 By year end, economic and earnings growth will be accelerating, the fed funds rate will be at the zero lower bound, and the impact of any fiscal stimulus will be flowing through to consumers.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s fear index has soared alarmingly, to levels not seen since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The VIX index, which measures volatility, almost doubled during the week, showing serious strains building in the financial world. The VIX surged as shares tumbled, safe-haven government bond yields hit new lows, and riskier corporate debt prices slid. A high VIX is a sign that market will remain volatile for some time, so investors will be buckling up. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said the markets were preparing for the world economy to tumble into recession. He warned CNBC: We are going into a global recession. After what\u2019s been happening the last few days, we are going to see a spread of economic sudden stops.The trouble with economic sudden stops is, it\u2019s not easy to restart an economy.\u201d El-Erian also predicted that the market volatility wouldn\u2019t end soon, telling Fox News: \u201cI wish I could tell you that I see calmer waters in front of us, but I do not. Waters are going to get even choppier.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic is threatening to reignite the eurozone debt crisis. Italy faces a deep recession this year, with shops and offices closing under a nationwide shutdown. Fears that Italy may need a bailout forced Italian borrowing costs up from record lows, which accelerated dramatically after ECB president Christine Lagarde suggested rising bond yield spreads weren\u2019t her responsibility. The European Central Bank rushed out a clarification, but the row distracted from a new stimulus package including ultra-cheap loans for banks. Ana Andrade, Analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: Ms Lagarde\u2019s miscommunication both during the press conference and afterwards has lost her political and leadership capital. \u201cThe fallout from Ms Lagarde\u2019s mishandling of the press conference underlines the importance of communication for central banking. The ECB presented a comprehensive, effective package yesterday, but markets didn\u2019t listen because of how poorly it was communicated. \u201cThe package will thus take longer than usual to feed through and have positive effects. It remains to be seen if Ms Lagarde can recover from this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "My wife gave the youngest one a pedometer for Christmas, but he refused to use it on the grounds that it was a tracking device designed to monitor his movements on the government\u2019s behalf, or something. A few weeks later, she picked the device up off the table, strapped it to her wrist and synced it to her phone. Since that time, any day that she doesn\u2019t do 10,000 steps is a pointless day. For the most part, this has no impact on me \u2013 she generally gets the bulk of her walking done in the park with the dog in the morning. The dog comes back looking exhausted, but the dog\u2019s problems are not my problems. The cat\u2019s problems are my problems. \u201cEleven thousand four hundred,\u201d my wife says, striding into the kitchen one evening. \u201cUh-huh,\u201d I say. \u201cMiaow!\u201d the cat says, standing in front of the cupboard where the cat food is kept. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fed,\u201d I say. \u201cGardening, surprisingly, uses up a lot of steps,\u201d my wife says, pacing in circles round the kitchen table, where the oldest one is staring at his laptop. \u201cMiaow!\u201d says the cat. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been fed,\u201d I say, \u201cbecause it was me that fed you, you idiot.\u201d \u201cI fed him as well,\u201d the oldest one says. \u201cMiaow!\u201d the cat says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fed twice!\u201d I shout. \u201cThe room is full of witnesses!\u201d \u201cHow many steps have you done?\u201d my wife says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d \u201cMy phone counts steps,\u201d I say. \u201cLike everyone\u2019s phone. I just don\u2019t look.\u201d \u201cHow many?\u201d she says, marching in place. I take my phone out of my pocket. \u201cTwo hundred and seven,\u201d I say. \u201cSo far.\u201d On Sunday we have plans to meet friends at an exhibition and then go back to their house for a long lunch, so my wife is obliged to skip her trip to the park. On the train, she fiddles impatiently with the device on her wrist. Some hours later she suddenly stands up from the lunch table to announce that we\u2019re leaving. \u201cNow?\u201d I say. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re walking back, and I want to\u2026\u201d \u201cFrom here?\u201d I say. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s seven miles,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s two miles,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to get my steps in.\u201d \u201cYou walked all round that exhibition,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can take a taxi if you like.\u201d We set off under a dark sky that threatens rain. There is another problem: my wife did not drink at lunch, and I did. My legs are heavy, but my mood is dangerously light. \u201cLook!\u201d I say. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a bus? Oh dear \u2013 there it goes.\u201d \u201cKeep up,\u201d my wife says. \u201cFor 30 years you\u2019ve been telling me I walk too fast,\u201d I say. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re too fast,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes, like now, when you\u2019re being\u2026\u201d \u201cWhen I\u2019m being fun?\u201d I say. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to say fun,\u201d she says. \u201cShall we sing?\u201d I say. \u201cDo you want to sing?\u201d \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she says. It is strange to realise that one\u2019s exuberance is, in context, deeply irritating, and also to be too exuberant to care. \u201cLook!\u201d I say. \u201cIsn\u2019t that another bus?\u201d After a mile or so, we arrive at a bus stop as a steady rain begins to fall. \u201cAs much as I\u2019ve loved this time together so far,\u201d I say. \u201cFine,\u201d my wife says. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the bus.\u201d We board the next bus. A hundred metres on, it gets stuck in traffic at some temporary lights. We get off again. \u201cJust up here, then we cut across the park,\u201d my wife says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a race, though,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy, are you tired?\u201d she says. \u201cNot at all,\u201d I say. \u201cBut my hiccups are coming back.\u201d By the time we are greeted at the front door by the dog and the cat, I am all out of fun. \u201cMiaow!\u201d the cat says. \u201cFine,\u201d I say, walking back to the kitchen. \u201cFollow me, jerk.\u201d The cat follows. As I fill its bowl I slide my phone out of my pocket and glance at the screen. It says I\u2019ve done 9,543 steps. The oldest one walks in. \u201cI fed the cat,\u201d he says.",

      "bodyText": "The British class system is, at its worst, a killer. Men living in the poorest communities in the UK have an average of 9.4 years shorn off their life expectancies compared with those in the richest areas; for women, it\u2019s 7.4 years. If you travel on the Jubilee Line from Westminster to Canning Town, every stop represents a year less in the average lifespan of local citizens. For the poorest women, life expectancy is in reverse. The coronavirus pandemic is about to collide with this engine of inequality. The super-rich are fleeing on private jets to luxury boltholes in foreign climes, while the well-to-do may deploy their private health insurance to circumvent our already struggling and soon to be overrun National Health Service. Meanwhile, Britain\u2019s army of precarious workers have nowhere to hide, including from employment that puts their health at risk. Uber drivers, Deliveroo riders, cleaners: all in low-paid jobs, often with families to feed. Many will feel they have no choice but to keep working. While many middle-class professionals can protect themselves by working from home, supermarket shelves cannot be stacked remotely, and the same applies from factory workers to cleaners. How many could truly afford to live on \u00a394.25 a week, which is our country\u2019s paltry statutory sick pay? Those with underlying health conditions are most at risk from coronavirus, and again, the impact differs depending on which rung you\u2019re condemned to on the British social ladder. Previous research by the British Heart Foundation found that working-class Tameside in the north-west has a heart disease mortality rate more than three times higher than well-to-do Kensington and Chelsea. According to Asthma UK: \u201cAsthma is more prevalent within more deprived communities, and those living in more deprived areas of England are more likely to go to hospital for their asthma.\u201d Diabetes is far more common among those living in poverty, and there is a strong link between lung disease and deprivation. 1.9 million pensioners languish below the poverty line: their health will be, on average, worse than their affluent counterparts\u2019, meaning their lives will be significantly more imperilled. We know that depression and stress weaken our immune systems, and the research is clear: those on low incomes are disproportionately likely to suffer from poor mental health. Poor diet is another factor, and one that is strongly linked to poverty. What, too, of our most impoverished, those who are homeless with poor nutrition, weaker immune systems and a lack of access to good hygiene? And what happens to the 1.5 million children eligible for free school meals if our education sector is temporarily closed? Many could soon find themselves with hungry bellies. As the coronavirus continues to unleash mayhem, we could be on the precipice of an economic shock on the scale of the 2008 financial crash. Despite the rhetoric, the latest budget doesn\u2019t reverse the damage to our social fabric inflicted by a decade of austerity. Indeed, the recent budget entrenches cuts in key services outside of the NHS and police. If a renewed economic crisis is on the cards, we can expect the Tories to ensure it is once again paid for by increasingly impoverished children, benefit claimants and a working-age population that has suffered the longest squeeze in real wages for generations. We know the rich look after their own, but these injustices are not acts of God or mere sad facts of life to be shrugged at with resignation. There will be many terrible lessons to learn from this pandemic: one is a lesson that should have been learned long ago, that inequality kills. A decade of austerity, and a social order that deprives millions of citizens of a comfortable existence, will mean many more deaths in the coming weeks and months that could have been avoided. The government\u2019s determination to discover a vaccine for coronavirus must be accompanied by a renewed commitment to addressing poverty. Like every crisis, this one is likely to affect working-class and poor people worst. That is not inevitable. It\u2019s a choice \u2013 and one within our power to stop, if only we had the will to do so. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>On 1 September 1991, a large private yacht cruised towards the Statue of Liberty. It was a clear, breezy evening, and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York, a golden sunset could be seen glinting off the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, a party was in flow. Scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and miniskirts, some as young as 14, danced under disco lights. It could have been a high school prom, were it not for the crowd of older men surrounding them.</p> <p>As the evening wore on, some of the men \u2013 many old enough to be the girls\u2019 fathers, or even grandfathers \u2013 joined them on the dancefloor, pressing themselves against the girls. One balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models, leering into a film camera that was documenting the evening: \u201cCan you get some beautiful women around me, please?\u201d</p> <p>The party aboard the Spirit of New York was one of several events that Donald Trump, then 45, attended with a group of 58 aspiring young models that September. They had travelled from around the world to compete in Elite\u2019s Look of the Year competition, an annual event that had been running since 1983 and was already credited with launching the careers of Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen and Stephanie Seymour. At stake was a life-changing prize: a $150,000 contract with the world\u2019s then leading modelling agency, Elite Model Management, run by John Casablancas.</p> <p>Trump was closely involved in Casablancas\u2019s competition. In 1991, he was a headline sponsor, throwing open the Plaza, his lavish, chateau-style hotel overlooking Central Park, transforming it into the main venue and accommodating the young models. He was also one of its 10 judges.</p> <p>In 1992, Trump hosted the competition again. On a similarly golden evening in early September that year, another group of contestants boarded the Spirit of New York, chartered for another Elite cruise. One of the girls on the boat was Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old from a small town outside Toronto. She recalls how the contestants were encouraged to parade downstairs, one by one, and dance for Trump, Casablancas and others. Lee, an introverted teenager who loved to draw but hated school, was in New York for the first time. \u201cA woman at the agency was pushing me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI said to her, \u2018I don\u2019t see why me going down the stairs and dancing in front of those two has anything to do with me becoming a model. And she said, \u2018No, you look great, take off your blazer and go and do it.\u2019 So I walked down the stairs. I didn\u2019t dance \u2013 I blew a kiss at them, spun around and walked away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81/0_256_5364_3219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4/0_225_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht, September 1991. Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</p></li> </ul> <p>Another contestant, who was 15 at the time, also remembers being asked to walk for Trump, Casablancas and other men on the boat in September 1992. She says an organiser told her that if she refused, she would be excluded from the competition. \u201cI knew in my gut it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t being judged or part of the competition \u2013 it was for their entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>While Elite\u2019s official brochure stated that contestants were aged between 14 and 24, all of those the Guardian has spoken to, competing in both years, were aged between 14 and 19. Some had come to New York with parents or chaperones in tow; others were alone. Many were away from their families for the first time. For them, the stakes were high, and the pressure to impress the judges great. As Casablancas had warned them at the outset of the competition, in a scene recorded by TV cameras: \u201cYou are going to be judged, constantly judged.\u201d (In 1991 and 1992, the Elite contest was filmed for a 60-minute glossy television special, featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and later screened on Fox \u2013 an early foray into reality TV.) Casablancas was a powerful figure in the industry, and to many of the new crop of would-be supermodels, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss.</p> <p>Three decades on, a very different picture of the competition is beginning to emerge. Over the last six months, the Guardian has spoken to several dozen former Look of the Year contestants, as well as industry insiders, and obtained 12 hours of previously unseen, behind-the-scenes footage. The stories we have heard suggest that Casablancas, and some of the men in his orbit, used the contest to engage in sexual relationships with vulnerable young models. Some of these allegations amount to sexual harassment, abuse or exploitation of teenage girls; others are more accurately described as rape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5/592_0_2010_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell and John Casablancas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettina Cirone/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1/0_3_2994_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f/318_689_8865_5318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top left: John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale.

Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>No such allegations have been levelled against Trump, who at the time was dating Marla Maples, the woman who in 1993 became his second wife. But his close involvement in the contest raises questions for the president. Did he know that Casablancas and others were sleeping with contestants? Why would a man in his 40s, whose main business was real-estate development, want to host a beauty contest for teenage girls?</p> <p>Journalists have scoured almost every corner of the 45th president\u2019s life, but his friendship with Casablancas, and his involvement in Look of the Year in 1991 and 1992, have been largely overlooked. Yet the competition is more than a footnote in the Donald Trump story. In time, it would prove to be the foundation of his pivot into reality TV. He even married a former Look of the Year contestant: the current first lady, Melania Trump, narrowly missed out on a trip to New York in 1992, after coming second in the Slovenian heat.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When John Casablancas arrived in New York in 1977, aged 35, he quickly caused a stir. Branded \u201cthe snatcher\u201d for poaching models from rivals for his Elite Model Management agency, he gained a reputation as a ruthless operator. Handsome and charismatic, the son of a former Balenciaga model and a wealthy Spanish banker, he formed the agency that became Elite in Paris in his late 20s. Within years of setting up shop in New York, Casablancas was generating millions of dollars in revenue each year, and ushering in the era of the supermodel. Glamorous friends flocked to Elite parties in fashionable clubs like Studio 54.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how Casablancas first met Trump but, according to several former models who encountered him during the 1980s, the businessman became a regular at his parties. With the opening of Trump Tower on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue in 1983, and the acquisition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mar-a-lago\" title=\"\">Mar-a-Lago</a> resort in Florida in 1985, Trump had gained the reputation of a high-flying playboy in his own right. In 1987 he published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Art </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Deal</a>, and a flurry of publicity followed. \u201cHe sits atop a $3 billion empire,\u201d proclaimed the Washington Post, \u201cand seems to have a Midas touch.\u201d</p> <p>It was perhaps unsurprising that Trump, a New York celebrity who liked to date beautiful women, should come to know the city\u2019s best-known model agent. \u201cTrump was good with PR and that was something John liked,\u201d says Jeremie Roux, who now runs System, a modelling agency he cofounded with Casablancas in 2009. \u201cGood or negative press was all good to Trump.\u201d </p> <p>Patty Owen, an Elle and Cosmopolitan cover star, recalls seeing Trump at Elite parties as far back as 1982. \u201cHe would always be at the bar. That\u2019s where he would stay and that\u2019s where all the new models would hang out,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I saw him, I was always like: why does John have to invite him?\u201d Barbara Pilling, also then an Elite model, told us Trump asked her out for dinner in the summer of 1989 at an industry soiree. She recalls Trump asking how old she was. \u201cI said 17 and he said, \u2018That\u2019s just great \u2013 you\u2019re not too old, not too young.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7/0_199_3312_4137/801.jpg\" alt=\"Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082/0_50_844_506/500.jpg\" alt=\"Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit of New York in 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve.

One was Shayna Love, an Australian model who was 16 when she came to New York for the first time in the summer of 1991. Recalling a dinner she attended, she says now: \u201cIt was presented as our duty as models at the agency. It wasn\u2019t an invitation. It was like, you have to go and do this.\u201d She says the dinner she attended, at which 10 or 15 models were present, was served at a long table in a private area of an upmarket restaurant. \u201cI was at one end with John, and Trump was up the other end\u2026 surrounded by the other girls.\u201d</p> <p>In the spring of 1991, Trump and Casablancas struck a business deal. Trump would sponsor Look of the Year\u2019s final and host contestants at the Plaza, which would double as the headquarters. At the time, Trump faced significant financial pressures and was close to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn\u2019t seem to deter him. In the newly unearthed, behind-the-scenes footage of Look of the Year 1991, Trump makes a series of appearances alongside Casablancas, whom he describes as \u201cmy friend John\u201d. At one point, Casablancas reveals how he and Trump struck their business partnership. \u201cI had prepared for a long meeting with Donald Trump to explain to him why this was going to be a great success,\u201d Casablancas tells the crowd. \u201cIn fact, I hadn\u2019t finished my third sentence and he said: \u2018I love the idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump now disputes being friends with Casablancas. The president\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he denies it \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d. Trump, they said, \u201chardly knew him, spent very little time with him, and knew very little about him\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Stacy Wilkes had never been anywhere like the New York Plaza when she arrived at Trump\u2019s hotel with another contestant in September 1991. Then 16, she was living in Louisville, Kentucky, with her mother, who was struggling to make ends meet. The teenager would hold yard sales and mow lawns to make extra cash. \u201cI was just so excited to be in a hotel,\u201d she says. \u201cTo go from a poor part of Kentucky to a place like this \u2013 I felt like the little kid in Home Alone.\u201d She recalls feeling out of place in a hotel where \u201ceverything was gold\u201d.</p> <p>The teenager had been selected as part of a sprawling international search, overseen by Casablancas, for \u201cnew faces\u201d. Many contestants had come through feeder competitions after winning regional heats, or being spotted in malls and hotel lobbies or, in one case, on the beach. Casablancas had visited Wilkes\u2019 local mall to host an Elite scouting event<strong> </strong>a year earlier, when she was 15. Her local agent had sent her to meet him, telling her what to wear and how to act. She says: \u201cI was told to put my hair down in front of my face and then, like, whoop it around and look up at him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Get%20in%20touch&amp;description=Did%20you%20attend%20Elite's%20Look%20of%20the%20Year%20in%20the%201990s%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Did you attend Elite's Look of the Year in the 1990s?

The contestants assembled beneath crystal chandeliers at the Plaza to meet Casablancas. He told them they would be judged over several days ahead of a gala evening, when the winner would be crowned. The girls would undergo makeovers and attend photocalls, donning spandex for an exercise routine in front of the Plaza. The behind-the-scenes footage shows Casablancas informing the would-be models that attention would be paid not just to appearance, but to \u201cthe way you are, your attitude, your personality, your sense of cooperation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d/178_29_809_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FameFlynet.uk.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36/0_416_2999_1799/1000.png\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top, from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.

The 1992 Fox documentary reported that the average age was 15, and the film\u2019s interviews make the youth of many contestants plain. Standing before the judges for the key swimwear round, the aspiring models are asked to tell the panel about themselves. \u201cI sing and love animals,\u201d says one girl, nervously. Another tells the judges: \u201cI like big dogs and chocolate.\u201d Later, during a photoshoot, a photographer instructs a 15-year-old to show more of her cleavage by pulling her bra lower. \u201cMore,\u201d he tells her. \u201cMore. More.\u201d</p> <p>In 1991, there were 10 judges in total, eight of them men, including Trump, Casablancas, the celebrity magician David Copperfield, and the president of Elite\u2019s European division, G\u00e9rald Marie. For the swimwear round, judges including Trump and Casablancas sat at a table in one of the Plaza\u2019s palatial rooms, rating the teenage models. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable, standing there in my bathing suit,\u201d recalls Wilkes. She says that at one stage of the contest the judges said she should lose weight: \u201cIt felt like they were ganging up on me.\u201d</p> <p>The contestant who came third in 1991 was Kate Dillon, then 17. Dillon, who went on to become a successful plus-sized model, says that many of her fellow competitors were \u201cfrom places that were very poor. I came from a family that had means, so it was something fun to do for a week to get out of school \u2013 but a lot of these girls were desperate.\u201d She recalls various \u201cafter-hours\u201d events over the course of the five-day competition. \u201cIt was very clear that there were opportunities to go out and party with Donald,\u201d she says. The contestants were led to believe \u201cthat if you were nice to certain people, good things will happen to you, and I think that\u2019s why girls were going out\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every time we changed, Trump would find a reason to come backstage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The behind-the-scenes footage seen by the Guardian shows brief snippets of the future president mingling with the Look of the Year models. At an evening reception, he seems to play the role of host, moving regally around the Plaza\u2019s ornate rooms in a suit and tie, talking to VIP guests and contestants. \u201cHow\u2019s the Canadian contestants?\u201d he asks, before moving over to a handful of Canadian would-be models and introducing himself. At another point, he circulates on the top deck of the Spirit of New York as the boat prepares to depart. Wearing a billowing cream blazer, pink open-neck shirt and oversized baseball cap, Trump grins while posing for photographs and chatting to several girls. One tells him she is just finishing school.</p> <p>Some former contestants recall him being there as they got dressed for events. \u201cEvery time we changed, it was like Trump would find a reason to come backstage,\u201d Wilkes says. A Canadian contestant from 1992 recalls similar incidents. \u201cHe\u2019d come by and say, \u2018Hey girls, are we ready?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking, what have I got myself into?\u201d Trump denies, \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d, behaving inappropriately with any Look of the Year contestants. His representatives say he was not aware of any predatory environment at the time.</p> <p>Others, however, observed a disturbing side to the contest. Ohad Oman, a young reporter for a magazine in Tel Aviv, was sent to cover it in 1991 and 1992. He attended a number of the after-parties, and remembers seeing girls drinking alcohol. He recalls one particularly debauched party, telling the Guardian: \u201cI saw girls sitting on guys\u2019 laps, and I remember one guy putting his hand down a girl\u2019s top. I remember thinking they were younger than me, and I was 17 going on 18.\u201d (The legal drinking age is 21 in the US.)</p> <p>Others who were present recall underage models being served alcohol at the contest. Trump\u2019s representatives say he did not provide alcohol to contestants, or encourage any models, whether below the drinking age or not, to drink alcohol, stressing he \u201cdoes not drink alcohol and does not encourage others to do so\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b/0_0_1366_820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behind the scenes footage from 'Look of the year'</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</p></li> </ul> <p>The finale of the 1991 competition was a glittering black-tie gala in the Plaza\u2019s ballroom. Casablancas and supermodel Naomi Campbell presented, as 10 finalists went through a series of costume changes, walking across a stage decorated with columns of sunflowers. Trump sat on the front row alongside a roster of celebrities, his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka perched on his knee.</p> <p>Ingrid Seynhaeve, an 18-year-old from Belgium, was crowned the winner. As the evening drew to a close, Seynhaeve was surrounded by photographers. Guests filtered out of the ballroom as a party got going in another of the Plaza\u2019s grand rooms. In the newly uncovered footage, a man can be heard off-camera, saying: \u201cCome on, babes. Let\u2019s get some liquor in you.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the months before and after the contests, Elite sent several of its teenage models to Milan, New York or Paris on assignments, usually by themselves. Shawna Lee, the 14-year-old from Canada who felt pressured to perform on the Spirit of New York in 1992, had spent the previous summer in Paris, working for Elite. She recalls days at castings, and nights out partying, including at the legendary Les Bains Douches nightclub.</p> <p>After one drunken night at the club, one of the first times she had drunk alcohol, she says a senior executive at Elite offered her a ride home on his motorbike. G\u00e9rald Marie, then in his early 40s, was head of Elite\u2019s Paris office, a powerful figure in the fashion industry and a 1991 Look of the Year judge. Lee accepted the offer. \u201cI was like, OK, sure, because I was always relying on whoever to get me home,\u201d she says. But she alleges that, rather than taking her home, Marie brought her to his apartment and told her to come to his bedroom. Lee says she initially refused, asking about his wife. She says Marie responded: \u201cOh no, just come and sleep in the bed with me, don\u2019t worry,\u201d and she relented. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know, I just went.\u201d</p> <p>Lee says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a> has emboldened her to talk about what happened next. It was her first sexual experience. \u201cI just froze,\u201d she says. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Looking back 30 years later, she feels she was taken advantage of. \u201cI just felt really pressured,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really young and I was manipulated.\u201d She told a friend what had happened, and this soon got back to Elite\u2019s agents. \u201cThey all knew something went down, but they downplayed it,\u201d says Lee, who is now 42 and works as a makeup artist in Toronto. \u201cIt was just understood that it was in my best interest to walk away from it and brush it under the rug.\u201d</p> <p>Questions about Marie\u2019s alleged mistreatment of teenage models are not new. In 2000, New York magazine reported that two of Elite\u2019s senior women executives had pleaded with both Casablancas and Marie to <a href=\"https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/columns/citypolitic/1866/\" title=\"\">stop sleeping with underage models</a>, but had been ignored. (\u201cWe are men,\u201d Marie reportedly said. \u201cWe have our needs.\u201d) In 2011, the Elite supermodel and actor Carr\u00e9 Otis alleged that Marie had repeatedly raped her when she was a 17-year-old model in Paris in the 1980s. Two years ago, another Elite model, Ebba Karlsson, accused Marie of raping her when she was 21.</p> <p>Marie did not respond to a formal letter from the Guardian, but in a brief phone call insisted he had never sexually assaulted any models, and denied the specific allegations levelled against him by Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, I don\u2019t know this person,\u201d he said. \u201cAllegations like this are becoming too easy to make. Frankly, it hurts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1/0_18_1975_2468/800.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the competition final in 1991\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final. Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>Other men closely involved in Look of the Year during this period have been accused of sexual misconduct by former contestants. Some allegations are contained in legal proceedings filed decades ago; others have been shared for the first time with the Guardian. The newspaper has decided not to publish some of these allegations, at the request of the women involved.</p> <p>One allegation already made public concerns David Copperfield, an associate of both Casablancas and Trump, who judged Look of the Year in 1988 and 1991, and once dated another Elite supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. Two years ago, as the #MeToo movement reverberated through the entertainment industry, he was the subject of allegations by Brittney Lewis, a 17-year-old contestant in the 1988 Look of the Year, held in Japan. According to her account, published on the <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/david-copperfield-accused-drugging-assaulting-17-year-old-model-1988/\" title=\"\">entertainment news website The Wrap</a>, Copperfield invited her to a show in California after she had returned home to Utah. Lewis alleged that she saw Copperfield pour something into her glass and then blanked out, but says she retained hazy recollections of him sexually assaulting her in his hotel room. Copperfield stated on Twitter at the time that he had been \u201cfalsely accused\u201d in the past, and was now having to \u201cweather another storm\u201d. He added: \u201cPlease for everyone\u2019s sake, don\u2019t rush to judgment.\u201d In response to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the alleged assault, his representatives said that the claims were false and seriously defamatory.</p> <p>Several of the 1991 contestants recall Copperfield behaving in a way that now strikes them as inappropriate. Stacy Wilkes says Copperfield called the hotel room she was sharing with another 15-year-old contestant, inviting the other girl to his room. Another remembers translating a phone call from Copperfield into Spanish so he could invite a teenage contestant to his hotel room. Aimee Bendio, who was a 14-year-old Look of the Year contestant in 1991, says Copperfield and his assistant contacted her at her family home several times after she took part in the contest, \u201cchecking in to see how my career was going\u201d. She says the magician invited her to his shows, offering to send a limousine, but she declined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A 14-year-old contestant says Copperfield contacted her family home several times afterwards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f/0_479_9102_5459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca/295_0_1401_1751/800.jpg\" alt=\"Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York in 1991, the year he was a judge</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer.

Copperfield categorically denies behaving inappropriately with any contestants at any time.</p> <p>In the early 90s, Look of the Year contestants who secured modelling contracts with Elite were introduced to a fledgling financial advisory firm, Star Capital Management. It was run by an associate of Casablancas, David Weil. Housed at Elite\u2019s Manhattan offices, and an official sponsor of Look of the Year, Weil\u2019s company advertised its services in the 1991 competition programme with a photograph of a small girl dressed in adult clothing and jewellery, alongside the marketing line: \u201cJust like you, we\u2019re not just another pretty face.\u201d</p> <p>By the following year, Star Capital Management was handling millions of dollars earned by Elite\u2019s models. The business soon caught the attention of federal authorities, who later accused Weil and his business partner of stealing at least $1.2m from their clients. In 1998, Weil pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. He also pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 15-year-old model he had met at Look of the Year in 1992.</p> <p>Weil was sentenced to serve weekends in prison for three months, and required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Mark Lawless, a New York lawyer who brought a civil fraud case against Star Capital Management on behalf of the 1991 Look of the Year winner Ingrid Seynhaeve and others, says that when he inspected its office, he found an adjoining bedroom. One of the desk\u2019s drawers, he recalls, contained \u201cbullets and condoms\u201d. Weil declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.</p> <p>Four years after Weil\u2019s conviction, in 2002, Casablancas faced his own set of accusations in the civil courts. A former Look of the Year contestant, known only as Jane Doe 44, filed a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73174/strokes-singers-dad-named-in-sex-abuse-suit\" title=\"\">accusing him of repeatedly sexually abusing her</a>, beginning when she was 15. The abuse began, according to the lawsuit, at Look of the Year 1988 in Japan, where Casablancas told Doe he was \u201cfalling in love\u201d with her. At the end of the competition, the lawsuit states, \u201ccontestants drank and partied late into the evening\u201d and Casablancas told the teenager to come to his hotel room. There, Casablancas sexually abused the girl \u201cseveral times over the evening\u201d. The abuse allegedly continued the following year; when the girl became pregnant, Casablancas told her \u201cshe would be having an abortion\u201d. The abortion was allegedly \u201carranged and paid for\u201d by Elite. Casablancas was 46 at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848/157_245_1343_1678/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant <br><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant. Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>The lawsuit also alleged that Casablancas \u201cengaged in a pattern of seducing, sexually exploiting and/or abusing minor girls, including girls as young as 14 or 15 years old\u201d. But in 2003, the Los Angeles superior court dismissed the claims against him because he did not live in California, where it had been filed. At the time, a lawyer for Casablancas said the allegations were without merit.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s representatives have told the Guardian he denies in the strongest possible terms having any knowledge at the time that Casablancas allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with Look of the Year contestants, including those who were under the age of consent, or that Casablancas allegedly enabled others to exploit or abuse teenage models.</p> <p>But Casablancas\u2019 sexual interest in teenage girls predated this period. His marriage to his second wife, Danish model Jeanette Christiansen, ended in 1983 when it emerged that he was having an affair with a 15-year-old model, Stephanie Seymour. Casablancas, who was in his early 40s at the time, later described Seymour as a \u201cwoman-child\u201d. He met his third wife, Brazilian model Aline Wermelinger, in 1992, when she was a Look of the Year contestant staying at Trump\u2019s Plaza. They married the following year; Casablancas was 51 and she was 17.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>By his own account, Donald Trump got to know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\" title=\"\">financier Jeffrey Epstein</a> in the late 1980s. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with,\u201d Trump famously told New York magazine in 2002. \u201cIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d After Epstein was charged with the sex trafficking of underage girls last year, the president distanced himself, telling reporters he knew the financier \u201clike everybody in Palm Beach knew him\u201d, but hadn\u2019t spoken to him in 15 years. \u201cI was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he had \u201ckicked Mr Epstein out\u201d of Mar-a-Lago for acting inappropriately towards staff.</p> <p>Photographs of Trump with Epstein, who owned a house near Mar-a-Lago, were widely circulated in the wake of the financier\u2019s arrest last year. Renewed attention was also given to a deposition by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was first approached by Epstein\u2019s friend, the British socialite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/ghislaine-maxwell-woman-accused-jeffrey-epstein-groom-girls\" title=\"\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 1999.</p> <p>It also appears that Epstein had a Casablancas connection during the 1990s. According to a lawsuit filed in the US three months ago, in 1990 Casablancas sent a teenage model for her first \u201ccasting call\u201d at a residential address on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, to meet a \u201cphotographer\u201d who, it turned out, was Epstein. The lawsuit states that Epstein ordered the 15-year-old girl to undress before taking photographs of her, pushing her against a wall and sexually assaulting her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

Houraney says that Trump asked him to organise a party that month with some of his pageant\u2019s finalists, promising to invite heads of modelling agencies and prospective sponsors for his competition. \u201cHe had me fly in all these girls, and gave me a $30,000 budget for airfares and limos to pick them up at the airport,\u201d he says. \u201cThe girls were all decked out, expecting to meet all these VIPs.\u201d But after an hour at the party, Houraney says, there seemed to be only one other guest: Epstein. \u201cI was like, \u2018Donald, where are the guys? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019\u201d Houraney says he realised \u201cthis is a Jeff Epstein party, basically\u201d.</p> <p>While suspicious of Epstein, Houraney was keen to have Trump as a business partner. A month earlier, in December 1992, Trump had met with Houraney and Jill Harth, who ran the pageant together. They were looking for a new sponsor for their contest, which each year saw models aged 16 to 22 compete to appear in wall calendars wearing bikinis and swimsuits while posing with classic cars. At dinner in the Plaza\u2019s Oak Room, Harth, Houraney and Trump discussed moving the American Dream competition from Las Vegas to one of Trump\u2019s casinos. \u201cHe wanted to build this into the biggest, the best thing that he could do. He was talking about television and pulling out all the contacts,\u201d Harth later said. Eventually, the pageant was held at Trump Castle in Atlantic City in November 1993, but for one year only.</p> <p>The partnership soured and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\" title=\"\">ended in two lawsuits</a>, but for Trump it was a prelude to a series of more lucrative ventures in the beauty business. In 1996, he secured what the New York Daily News described as \u201chis most beautiful deal yet\u201d. After months of negotiations, Trump acquired the Miss Universe Organization in a reported $10m deal that handed him control of three large, well-established pageants: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. Three years later, he founded Trump Model Management, poaching many staff from Elite.</p> <p>For Wolfgang Schwarz, a veteran model agent in Austria who worked closely with Casablancas, and met Trump at the Plaza in the early 90s, Trump\u2019s decision to establish his own agency was about him wanting his own private source for models. \u201cIf you have your own agency and you\u2019re the owner, you can tell your bookers to make a party,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier than calling 15 agencies in New York.\u201d Trump\u2019s representatives say he entered the modelling industry because it was a \u201cvery profitable\u201d business opportunity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3/0_16_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346/26_0_2723_3402/800.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Kate Dillon, in behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 contest</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14. Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>The Miss Universe deal allowed Trump to realise his ambition of turning a pageant into an international televised event. In 1997, he <a href=\"https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/cbs-trump-ink-beauty-of-a-partnership-1117433243/\" title=\"\">sold a 50% stake in the business to CBS</a>. Five years later, amid a slump in the Miss Universe ratings, Trump brokered a deal with NBC that led to the launch of The Apprentice in 2004.</p> <p>The move into reality TV positioned Trump as a heavyweight tycoon with a significant media profile. In many ways, it was a natural progression from his involvement in beauty contests and pageants. Where once he had judged young models, whose hopes, rivalries and insecurities became TV storylines in Fox\u2019s Look of the Year documentary, now he was ruthlessly separating aspiring business people into winners and losers. </p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Three decades on from the contests at Trump\u2019s Plaza, it is striking to reflect on the diverging fortunes of those who attended. Many of the powerful men Casablancas brought on board to help judge the girls thrived in the years that followed. G\u00e9rald Marie is now the chairman of a prestigious model agency in Paris, Oui Management. Although Marie told the Guardian he had retired, his LinkedIn page lists his responsibilities at the \u201cthriving newcomer\u201d agency as scouting for and managing talent. Oui Management did not respond to our request for comment.<strong> </strong>David Copperfield remains a prominent entertainer, with a current residency at the MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas.</p> <p>The fortunes of the teenagers who took part have been mixed. Some became successful models, Hollywood actors and TV hosts, while many more lived quieter lives. Ingrid Seynhaeve, the 1991 winner, became a face of Ralph Lauren and Dior, hosted Belgium\u2019s Topmodel TV show, and continues to front high-profile campaigns. Other contestants we spoke to include a beautician, a stay\u2013at\u2013home mother, a makeup artist, a yoga teacher and a bus driver.</p> <p>In 1992, the crown went to one of Look of the Year\u2019s youngest contenders: 14-year-old Mariann Molski. Months after her victory, a profile in the Chicago Tribune reported that the sporty high school student was \u201con the brink of a career of a kind that most young women only dream about\u201d. While she had some success as a model, it is not clear what happened to her in the years that followed; US public records indicate multiple arrests for probation violations, alcohol offences and prostitution, though there is nothing to say she was ever charged. Molski\u2019s current whereabouts are unknown, but she is believed to have been homeless in Arizona.</p> <p>After years of financial mismanagement, Elite was forced into bankruptcy in 2004. The Elite brand continues to be used by two separate agencies, owned by different corporate entities. One is Creative World Management, which bought the New York division in 2004. It strongly distances itself from the Casablancas-owned firm and era, saying it \u201cutterly\u201d condemns the kinds of \u201cdeplorable behaviour\u201d alleged to have taken place in the past.</p> <p>The other inheritor of the brand is Elite World Group, which operates the successor to Look of the Year, a similar global contest for the next top young model, called <a href=\"https://elitemodellook.com/int/en/home/index.htm\" title=\"\">Elite Model Look</a>. It, too, distances itself from the Casablancas era. \u201cWe would have no tolerance for the conduct you\u2019ve described,\u201d the company told the Guardian. \u201cEmpowering our models and protecting their safety is our foremost priority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e/93_299_8923_5358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af/0_534_8907_5344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year</p></li> </ul> <p>John Casablancas retired in Brazil in the early 2000s. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 2013, aged 70, long before the #MeToo movement heralded a new standard of accountability for powerful men accused of exploiting women and girls. He never got to see his old associate Donald Trump ascend to the White House, despite a cascade of allegations about Trump\u2019s own treatment of women. There are now <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T\">at least 25 sexual misconduct allegations</a> against the president, ranging from unwanted advances and harassment to serious sexual assaults. More than half relate to models or pageant contestants. Trump denies that he has ever behaved in a predatory or inappropriate fashion with any women or girls. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian 30 years on, several former Look of the Year contestants feel that a #MeToo moment for the modelling world is long overdue. \u201cThe girls are young and they look at these agents like parental figures, and they\u2019re not,\u201d says Shawna Lee. \u201cAnything they say goes, whether it\u2019s \u2018Go cut your hair\u2019, \u2018Go wear this dress\u2019. It\u2019s too bad that there were not more consequences for these men.\u201d</p> <p>After Look of the Year 1991, Stacy Wilkes returned to Louisville and quit school, despite having told the judges she would finish. \u201cI thought that was the reason I lost,\u201d she says, \u201cso I might as well leave if I want to make it as a model. We were really broke, so I thought I\u2019d try and make money for my mom, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d She is content with the path her life took, living in Louisville with her partner and three cats, but adds that women were raising concerns at the time and were ignored: \u201cI think models from the 90s tried so hard, over and over, and nobody believed what we had to say.\u201d</p> <p>Kate Dillon, now a businesswoman living in Seattle, remembers the contest as one that \u201cexploited women\u2019s assets, women\u2019s bodies. A lot of these girls were desperate. They thought modelling was about attracting men, which it isn\u2019t.\u201d There was a climate of opportunism, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the men were like, \u2018Yes, Look of the Year week, let\u2019s make sure my schedule is clear to have chicks over to my apartment.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great is that we now have a language, and a precedent of young people saying: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to let this continue\u2019,\u201d Dillon adds. \u201cThey would never accept being treated the way I was.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p><em>The Guardian will continue to investigate the issues raised in this story.

      "bodyText": "On 1 September 1991, a large private yacht cruised towards the Statue of Liberty. It was a clear, breezy evening, and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York, a golden sunset could be seen glinting off the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, a party was in flow. Scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and miniskirts, some as young as 14, danced under disco lights. It could have been a high school prom, were it not for the crowd of older men surrounding them. As the evening wore on, some of the men \u2013 many old enough to be the girls\u2019 fathers, or even grandfathers \u2013 joined them on the dancefloor, pressing themselves against the girls. One balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models, leering into a film camera that was documenting the evening: \u201cCan you get some beautiful women around me, please?\u201d The party aboard the Spirit of New York was one of several events that Donald Trump, then 45, attended with a group of 58 aspiring young models that September. They had travelled from around the world to compete in Elite\u2019s Look of the Year competition, an annual event that had been running since 1983 and was already credited with launching the careers of Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen and Stephanie Seymour. At stake was a life-changing prize: a $150,000 contract with the world\u2019s then leading modelling agency, Elite Model Management, run by John Casablancas. Trump was closely involved in Casablancas\u2019s competition. In 1991, he was a headline sponsor, throwing open the Plaza, his lavish, chateau-style hotel overlooking Central Park, transforming it into the main venue and accommodating the young models. He was also one of its 10 judges. In 1992, Trump hosted the competition again. On a similarly golden evening in early September that year, another group of contestants boarded the Spirit of New York, chartered for another Elite cruise. One of the girls on the boat was Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old from a small town outside Toronto. She recalls how the contestants were encouraged to parade downstairs, one by one, and dance for Trump, Casablancas and others. Lee, an introverted teenager who loved to draw but hated school, was in New York for the first time. \u201cA woman at the agency was pushing me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI said to her, \u2018I don\u2019t see why me going down the stairs and dancing in front of those two has anything to do with me becoming a model. And she said, \u2018No, you look great, take off your blazer and go and do it.\u2019 So I walked down the stairs. I didn\u2019t dance \u2013 I blew a kiss at them, spun around and walked away.\u201d Top: Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition Bottom: contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht, September 1991. Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR Another contestant, who was 15 at the time, also remembers being asked to walk for Trump, Casablancas and other men on the boat in September 1992. She says an organiser told her that if she refused, she would be excluded from the competition. \u201cI knew in my gut it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t being judged or part of the competition \u2013 it was for their entertainment.\u201d While Elite\u2019s official brochure stated that contestants were aged between 14 and 24, all of those the Guardian has spoken to, competing in both years, were aged between 14 and 19. Some had come to New York with parents or chaperones in tow; others were alone. Many were away from their families for the first time. For them, the stakes were high, and the pressure to impress the judges great. As Casablancas had warned them at the outset of the competition, in a scene recorded by TV cameras: \u201cYou are going to be judged, constantly judged.\u201d (In 1991 and 1992, the Elite contest was filmed for a 60-minute glossy television special, featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and later screened on Fox \u2013 an early foray into reality TV.) Casablancas was a powerful figure in the industry, and to many of the new crop of would-be supermodels, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss. Three decades on, a very different picture of the competition is beginning to emerge. Over the last six months, the Guardian has spoken to several dozen former Look of the Year contestants, as well as industry insiders, and obtained 12 hours of previously unseen, behind-the-scenes footage. The stories we have heard suggest that Casablancas, and some of the men in his orbit, used the contest to engage in sexual relationships with vulnerable young models. Some of these allegations amount to sexual harassment, abuse or exploitation of teenage girls; others are more accurately described as rape.

Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images No such allegations have been levelled against Trump, who at the time was dating Marla Maples, the woman who in 1993 became his second wife. But his close involvement in the contest raises questions for the president. Did he know that Casablancas and others were sleeping with contestants? Why would a man in his 40s, whose main business was real-estate development, want to host a beauty contest for teenage girls? Journalists have scoured almost every corner of the 45th president\u2019s life, but his friendship with Casablancas, and his involvement in Look of the Year in 1991 and 1992, have been largely overlooked. Yet the competition is more than a footnote in the Donald Trump story. In time, it would prove to be the foundation of his pivot into reality TV. He even married a former Look of the Year contestant: the current first lady, Melania Trump, narrowly missed out on a trip to New York in 1992, after coming second in the Slovenian heat. * * * When John Casablancas arrived in New York in 1977, aged 35, he quickly caused a stir. Branded \u201cthe snatcher\u201d for poaching models from rivals for his Elite Model Management agency, he gained a reputation as a ruthless operator. Handsome and charismatic, the son of a former Balenciaga model and a wealthy Spanish banker, he formed the agency that became Elite in Paris in his late 20s. Within years of setting up shop in New York, Casablancas was generating millions of dollars in revenue each year, and ushering in the era of the supermodel. Glamorous friends flocked to Elite parties in fashionable clubs like Studio 54. It\u2019s not clear how Casablancas first met Trump but, according to several former models who encountered him during the 1980s, the businessman became a regular at his parties. With the opening of Trump Tower on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue in 1983, and the acquisition of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in 1985, Trump had gained the reputation of a high-flying playboy in his own right. In 1987 he published The Art Of The Deal, and a flurry of publicity followed. \u201cHe sits atop a $3 billion empire,\u201d proclaimed the Washington Post, \u201cand seems to have a Midas touch.\u201d It was perhaps unsurprising that Trump, a New York celebrity who liked to date beautiful women, should come to know the city\u2019s best-known model agent. \u201cTrump was good with PR and that was something John liked,\u201d says Jeremie Roux, who now runs System, a modelling agency he cofounded with Casablancas in 2009. \u201cGood or negative press was all good to Trump.\u201d Patty Owen, an Elle and Cosmopolitan cover star, recalls seeing Trump at Elite parties as far back as 1982. \u201cHe would always be at the bar. That\u2019s where he would stay and that\u2019s where all the new models would hang out,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I saw him, I was always like: why does John have to invite him?\u201d Barbara Pilling, also then an Elite model, told us Trump asked her out for dinner in the summer of 1989 at an industry soiree. She recalls Trump asking how old she was. \u201cI said 17 and he said, \u2018That\u2019s just great \u2013 you\u2019re not too old, not too young.\u2019\u201d Top: Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit of New York in 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve. Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR Bottom: Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition Speaking to the Guardian, four former Elite models say that in the late 80s or early 90s, when they were teenagers, the agency required them to attend private dinners with Trump, Casablancas and sometimes other men. One was Shayna Love, an Australian model who was 16 when she came to New York for the first time in the summer of 1991. Recalling a dinner she attended, she says now: \u201cIt was presented as our duty as models at the agency. It wasn\u2019t an invitation. It was like, you have to go and do this.\u201d She says the dinner she attended, at which 10 or 15 models were present, was served at a long table in a private area of an upmarket restaurant. \u201cI was at one end with John, and Trump was up the other end\u2026 surrounded by the other girls.\u201d In the spring of 1991, Trump and Casablancas struck a business deal. Trump would sponsor Look of the Year\u2019s final and host contestants at the Plaza, which would double as the headquarters. At the time, Trump faced significant financial pressures and was close to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn\u2019t seem to deter him. In the newly unearthed, behind-the-scenes footage of Look of the Year 1991, Trump makes a series of appearances alongside Casablancas, whom he describes as \u201cmy friend John\u201d. At one point, Casablancas reveals how he and Trump struck their business partnership. \u201cI had prepared for a long meeting with Donald Trump to explain to him why this was going to be a great success,\u201d Casablancas tells the crowd. \u201cIn fact, I hadn\u2019t finished my third sentence and he said: \u2018I love the idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d Trump now disputes being friends with Casablancas. The president\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he denies it \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d. Trump, they said, \u201chardly knew him, spent very little time with him, and knew very little about him\u201d. * * * Stacy Wilkes had never been anywhere like the New York Plaza when she arrived at Trump\u2019s hotel with another contestant in September 1991. Then 16, she was living in Louisville, Kentucky, with her mother, who was struggling to make ends meet. The teenager would hold yard sales and mow lawns to make extra cash. \u201cI was just so excited to be in a hotel,\u201d she says. \u201cTo go from a poor part of Kentucky to a place like this \u2013 I felt like the little kid in Home Alone.\u201d She recalls feeling out of place in a hotel where \u201ceverything was gold\u201d. The teenager had been selected as part of a sprawling international search, overseen by Casablancas, for \u201cnew faces\u201d. Many contestants had come through feeder competitions after winning regional heats, or being spotted in malls and hotel lobbies or, in one case, on the beach. Casablancas had visited Wilkes\u2019 local mall to host an Elite scouting event a year earlier, when she was 15. Her local agent had sent her to meet him, telling her what to wear and how to act. She says: \u201cI was told to put my hair down in front of my face and then, like, whoop it around and look up at him.\u201d One year later, Wilkes was among those met at the airport by a scrum of photographers, and whisked into limousines \u2013 a supermodel welcome. \u201cThat was kind of neat,\u201d she recalls. The contestants assembled beneath crystal chandeliers at the Plaza to meet Casablancas. He told them they would be judged over several days ahead of a gala evening, when the winner would be crowned. The girls would undergo makeovers and attend photocalls, donning spandex for an exercise routine in front of the Plaza. The behind-the-scenes footage shows Casablancas informing the would-be models that attention would be paid not just to appearance, but to \u201cthe way you are, your attitude, your personality, your sense of cooperation\u201d.

Photograph: FameFlynet.uk.com Bottom: Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge At 16, Wilkes was one of the older contestants in Look of the Year. The 1992 Fox documentary reported that the average age was 15, and the film\u2019s interviews make the youth of many contestants plain. Standing before the judges for the key swimwear round, the aspiring models are asked to tell the panel about themselves. \u201cI sing and love animals,\u201d says one girl, nervously. Another tells the judges: \u201cI like big dogs and chocolate.\u201d Later, during a photoshoot, a photographer instructs a 15-year-old to show more of her cleavage by pulling her bra lower. \u201cMore,\u201d he tells her. \u201cMore. More.\u201d In 1991, there were 10 judges in total, eight of them men, including Trump, Casablancas, the celebrity magician David Copperfield, and the president of Elite\u2019s European division, G\u00e9rald Marie. For the swimwear round, judges including Trump and Casablancas sat at a table in one of the Plaza\u2019s palatial rooms, rating the teenage models. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable, standing there in my bathing suit,\u201d recalls Wilkes. She says that at one stage of the contest the judges said she should lose weight: \u201cIt felt like they were ganging up on me.\u201d The contestant who came third in 1991 was Kate Dillon, then 17. Dillon, who went on to become a successful plus-sized model, says that many of her fellow competitors were \u201cfrom places that were very poor. I came from a family that had means, so it was something fun to do for a week to get out of school \u2013 but a lot of these girls were desperate.\u201d She recalls various \u201cafter-hours\u201d events over the course of the five-day competition. \u201cIt was very clear that there were opportunities to go out and party with Donald,\u201d she says. The contestants were led to believe \u201cthat if you were nice to certain people, good things will happen to you, and I think that\u2019s why girls were going out\u201d. The behind-the-scenes footage seen by the Guardian shows brief snippets of the future president mingling with the Look of the Year models. At an evening reception, he seems to play the role of host, moving regally around the Plaza\u2019s ornate rooms in a suit and tie, talking to VIP guests and contestants. \u201cHow\u2019s the Canadian contestants?\u201d he asks, before moving over to a handful of Canadian would-be models and introducing himself. At another point, he circulates on the top deck of the Spirit of New York as the boat prepares to depart. Wearing a billowing cream blazer, pink open-neck shirt and oversized baseball cap, Trump grins while posing for photographs and chatting to several girls. One tells him she is just finishing school. Some former contestants recall him being there as they got dressed for events. \u201cEvery time we changed, it was like Trump would find a reason to come backstage,\u201d Wilkes says. A Canadian contestant from 1992 recalls similar incidents. \u201cHe\u2019d come by and say, \u2018Hey girls, are we ready?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking, what have I got myself into?\u201d Trump denies, \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d, behaving inappropriately with any Look of the Year contestants. His representatives say he was not aware of any predatory environment at the time. Others, however, observed a disturbing side to the contest. Ohad Oman, a young reporter for a magazine in Tel Aviv, was sent to cover it in 1991 and 1992. He attended a number of the after-parties, and remembers seeing girls drinking alcohol. He recalls one particularly debauched party, telling the Guardian: \u201cI saw girls sitting on guys\u2019 laps, and I remember one guy putting his hand down a girl\u2019s top. I remember thinking they were younger than me, and I was 17 going on 18.\u201d (The legal drinking age is 21 in the US.) Others who were present recall underage models being served alcohol at the contest. Trump\u2019s representatives say he did not provide alcohol to contestants, or encourage any models, whether below the drinking age or not, to drink alcohol, stressing he \u201cdoes not drink alcohol and does not encourage others to do so\u201d. A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale The finale of the 1991 competition was a glittering black-tie gala in the Plaza\u2019s ballroom. Casablancas and supermodel Naomi Campbell presented, as 10 finalists went through a series of costume changes, walking across a stage decorated with columns of sunflowers. Trump sat on the front row alongside a roster of celebrities, his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka perched on his knee. Ingrid Seynhaeve, an 18-year-old from Belgium, was crowned the winner. As the evening drew to a close, Seynhaeve was surrounded by photographers. Guests filtered out of the ballroom as a party got going in another of the Plaza\u2019s grand rooms. In the newly uncovered footage, a man can be heard off-camera, saying: \u201cCome on, babes. Let\u2019s get some liquor in you.\u201d * * * In the months before and after the contests, Elite sent several of its teenage models to Milan, New York or Paris on assignments, usually by themselves. Shawna Lee, the 14-year-old from Canada who felt pressured to perform on the Spirit of New York in 1992, had spent the previous summer in Paris, working for Elite. She recalls days at castings, and nights out partying, including at the legendary Les Bains Douches nightclub. After one drunken night at the club, one of the first times she had drunk alcohol, she says a senior executive at Elite offered her a ride home on his motorbike. G\u00e9rald Marie, then in his early 40s, was head of Elite\u2019s Paris office, a powerful figure in the fashion industry and a 1991 Look of the Year judge. Lee accepted the offer. \u201cI was like, OK, sure, because I was always relying on whoever to get me home,\u201d she says. But she alleges that, rather than taking her home, Marie brought her to his apartment and told her to come to his bedroom. Lee says she initially refused, asking about his wife. She says Marie responded: \u201cOh no, just come and sleep in the bed with me, don\u2019t worry,\u201d and she relented. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know, I just went.\u201d Lee says the #MeToo movement has emboldened her to talk about what happened next. It was her first sexual experience. \u201cI just froze,\u201d she says. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Looking back 30 years later, she feels she was taken advantage of. \u201cI just felt really pressured,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really young and I was manipulated.\u201d She told a friend what had happened, and this soon got back to Elite\u2019s agents. \u201cThey all knew something went down, but they downplayed it,\u201d says Lee, who is now 42 and works as a makeup artist in Toronto. \u201cIt was just understood that it was in my best interest to walk away from it and brush it under the rug.\u201d Questions about Marie\u2019s alleged mistreatment of teenage models are not new. In 2000, New York magazine reported that two of Elite\u2019s senior women executives had pleaded with both Casablancas and Marie to stop sleeping with underage models, but had been ignored. (\u201cWe are men,\u201d Marie reportedly said. \u201cWe have our needs.\u201d) In 2011, the Elite supermodel and actor Carr\u00e9 Otis alleged that Marie had repeatedly raped her when she was a 17-year-old model in Paris in the 1980s. Two years ago, another Elite model, Ebba Karlsson, accused Marie of raping her when she was 21. Marie did not respond to a formal letter from the Guardian, but in a brief phone call insisted he had never sexually assaulted any models, and denied the specific allegations levelled against him by Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, I don\u2019t know this person,\u201d he said. \u201cAllegations like this are becoming too easy to make. Frankly, it hurts.\u201d Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final. Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images Other men closely involved in Look of the Year during this period have been accused of sexual misconduct by former contestants. Some allegations are contained in legal proceedings filed decades ago; others have been shared for the first time with the Guardian. The newspaper has decided not to publish some of these allegations, at the request of the women involved. One allegation already made public concerns David Copperfield, an associate of both Casablancas and Trump, who judged Look of the Year in 1988 and 1991, and once dated another Elite supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. Two years ago, as the #MeToo movement reverberated through the entertainment industry, he was the subject of allegations by Brittney Lewis, a 17-year-old contestant in the 1988 Look of the Year, held in Japan. According to her account, published on the entertainment news website The Wrap, Copperfield invited her to a show in California after she had returned home to Utah. Lewis alleged that she saw Copperfield pour something into her glass and then blanked out, but says she retained hazy recollections of him sexually assaulting her in his hotel room. Copperfield stated on Twitter at the time that he had been \u201cfalsely accused\u201d in the past, and was now having to \u201cweather another storm\u201d. He added: \u201cPlease for everyone\u2019s sake, don\u2019t rush to judgment.\u201d In response to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the alleged assault, his representatives said that the claims were false and seriously defamatory. Several of the 1991 contestants recall Copperfield behaving in a way that now strikes them as inappropriate. Stacy Wilkes says Copperfield called the hotel room she was sharing with another 15-year-old contestant, inviting the other girl to his room. Another remembers translating a phone call from Copperfield into Spanish so he could invite a teenage contestant to his hotel room. Aimee Bendio, who was a 14-year-old Look of the Year contestant in 1991, says Copperfield and his assistant contacted her at her family home several times after she took part in the contest, \u201cchecking in to see how my career was going\u201d. She says the magician invited her to his shows, offering to send a limousine, but she declined.

Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images Maya Rubin, a 16-year-old contestant in 1991, says Copperfield approached her on the Spirit of New York. \u201cI told him I\u2019m from Israel,\u201d she recalls. \u201cHe said to me that his mum always wanted him to marry a Jewish girl.\u201d Months later, she says, the magician sent her a Christmas card. Copperfield categorically denies behaving inappropriately with any contestants at any time. In the early 90s, Look of the Year contestants who secured modelling contracts with Elite were introduced to a fledgling financial advisory firm, Star Capital Management. It was run by an associate of Casablancas, David Weil. Housed at Elite\u2019s Manhattan offices, and an official sponsor of Look of the Year, Weil\u2019s company advertised its services in the 1991 competition programme with a photograph of a small girl dressed in adult clothing and jewellery, alongside the marketing line: \u201cJust like you, we\u2019re not just another pretty face.\u201d By the following year, Star Capital Management was handling millions of dollars earned by Elite\u2019s models. The business soon caught the attention of federal authorities, who later accused Weil and his business partner of stealing at least $1.2m from their clients. In 1998, Weil pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. He also pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 15-year-old model he had met at Look of the Year in 1992. Weil was sentenced to serve weekends in prison for three months, and required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Mark Lawless, a New York lawyer who brought a civil fraud case against Star Capital Management on behalf of the 1991 Look of the Year winner Ingrid Seynhaeve and others, says that when he inspected its office, he found an adjoining bedroom. One of the desk\u2019s drawers, he recalls, contained \u201cbullets and condoms\u201d. Weil declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Four years after Weil\u2019s conviction, in 2002, Casablancas faced his own set of accusations in the civil courts. A former Look of the Year contestant, known only as Jane Doe 44, filed a lawsuit accusing him of repeatedly sexually abusing her, beginning when she was 15. The abuse began, according to the lawsuit, at Look of the Year 1988 in Japan, where Casablancas told Doe he was \u201cfalling in love\u201d with her. At the end of the competition, the lawsuit states, \u201ccontestants drank and partied late into the evening\u201d and Casablancas told the teenager to come to his hotel room. There, Casablancas sexually abused the girl \u201cseveral times over the evening\u201d. The abuse allegedly continued the following year; when the girl became pregnant, Casablancas told her \u201cshe would be having an abortion\u201d. The abortion was allegedly \u201carranged and paid for\u201d by Elite. Casablancas was 46 at the time. John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant. Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images The lawsuit also alleged that Casablancas \u201cengaged in a pattern of seducing, sexually exploiting and/or abusing minor girls, including girls as young as 14 or 15 years old\u201d. But in 2003, the Los Angeles superior court dismissed the claims against him because he did not live in California, where it had been filed. At the time, a lawyer for Casablancas said the allegations were without merit. Trump\u2019s representatives have told the Guardian he denies in the strongest possible terms having any knowledge at the time that Casablancas allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with Look of the Year contestants, including those who were under the age of consent, or that Casablancas allegedly enabled others to exploit or abuse teenage models. But Casablancas\u2019 sexual interest in teenage girls predated this period. His marriage to his second wife, Danish model Jeanette Christiansen, ended in 1983 when it emerged that he was having an affair with a 15-year-old model, Stephanie Seymour. Casablancas, who was in his early 40s at the time, later described Seymour as a \u201cwoman-child\u201d. He met his third wife, Brazilian model Aline Wermelinger, in 1992, when she was a Look of the Year contestant staying at Trump\u2019s Plaza. They married the following year; Casablancas was 51 and she was 17. * * * By his own account, Donald Trump got to know financier Jeffrey Epstein in the late 1980s. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with,\u201d Trump famously told New York magazine in 2002. \u201cIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d After Epstein was charged with the sex trafficking of underage girls last year, the president distanced himself, telling reporters he knew the financier \u201clike everybody in Palm Beach knew him\u201d, but hadn\u2019t spoken to him in 15 years. \u201cI was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he had \u201ckicked Mr Epstein out\u201d of Mar-a-Lago for acting inappropriately towards staff. Photographs of Trump with Epstein, who owned a house near Mar-a-Lago, were widely circulated in the wake of the financier\u2019s arrest last year. Renewed attention was also given to a deposition by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was first approached by Epstein\u2019s friend, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 1999. It also appears that Epstein had a Casablancas connection during the 1990s. According to a lawsuit filed in the US three months ago, in 1990 Casablancas sent a teenage model for her first \u201ccasting call\u201d at a residential address on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, to meet a \u201cphotographer\u201d who, it turned out, was Epstein. The lawsuit states that Epstein ordered the 15-year-old girl to undress before taking photographs of her, pushing her against a wall and sexually assaulting her. George Houraney, a businessman whose American Dream Calendar Girls beauty contest had been running in Las Vegas casinos since 1978, recalls encountering Epstein at Mar-a-Lago in January 1993. Houraney says that Trump asked him to organise a party that month with some of his pageant\u2019s finalists, promising to invite heads of modelling agencies and prospective sponsors for his competition. \u201cHe had me fly in all these girls, and gave me a $30,000 budget for airfares and limos to pick them up at the airport,\u201d he says. \u201cThe girls were all decked out, expecting to meet all these VIPs.\u201d But after an hour at the party, Houraney says, there seemed to be only one other guest: Epstein. \u201cI was like, \u2018Donald, where are the guys? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019\u201d Houraney says he realised \u201cthis is a Jeff Epstein party, basically\u201d. While suspicious of Epstein, Houraney was keen to have Trump as a business partner. A month earlier, in December 1992, Trump had met with Houraney and Jill Harth, who ran the pageant together. They were looking for a new sponsor for their contest, which each year saw models aged 16 to 22 compete to appear in wall calendars wearing bikinis and swimsuits while posing with classic cars. At dinner in the Plaza\u2019s Oak Room, Harth, Houraney and Trump discussed moving the American Dream competition from Las Vegas to one of Trump\u2019s casinos. \u201cHe wanted to build this into the biggest, the best thing that he could do. He was talking about television and pulling out all the contacts,\u201d Harth later said. Eventually, the pageant was held at Trump Castle in Atlantic City in November 1993, but for one year only. The partnership soured and ended in two lawsuits, but for Trump it was a prelude to a series of more lucrative ventures in the beauty business. In 1996, he secured what the New York Daily News described as \u201chis most beautiful deal yet\u201d. After months of negotiations, Trump acquired the Miss Universe Organization in a reported $10m deal that handed him control of three large, well-established pageants: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. Three years later, he founded Trump Model Management, poaching many staff from Elite. For Wolfgang Schwarz, a veteran model agent in Austria who worked closely with Casablancas, and met Trump at the Plaza in the early 90s, Trump\u2019s decision to establish his own agency was about him wanting his own private source for models. \u201cIf you have your own agency and you\u2019re the owner, you can tell your bookers to make a party,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier than calling 15 agencies in New York.\u201d Trump\u2019s representatives say he entered the modelling industry because it was a \u201cvery profitable\u201d business opportunity.

Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy The Miss Universe deal allowed Trump to realise his ambition of turning a pageant into an international televised event. In 1997, he sold a 50% stake in the business to CBS. Five years later, amid a slump in the Miss Universe ratings, Trump brokered a deal with NBC that led to the launch of The Apprentice in 2004. The move into reality TV positioned Trump as a heavyweight tycoon with a significant media profile. In many ways, it was a natural progression from his involvement in beauty contests and pageants. Where once he had judged young models, whose hopes, rivalries and insecurities became TV storylines in Fox\u2019s Look of the Year documentary, now he was ruthlessly separating aspiring business people into winners and losers. * * * Three decades on from the contests at Trump\u2019s Plaza, it is striking to reflect on the diverging fortunes of those who attended. Many of the powerful men Casablancas brought on board to help judge the girls thrived in the years that followed. G\u00e9rald Marie is now the chairman of a prestigious model agency in Paris, Oui Management. Although Marie told the Guardian he had retired, his LinkedIn page lists his responsibilities at the \u201cthriving newcomer\u201d agency as scouting for and managing talent. Oui Management did not respond to our request for comment. David Copperfield remains a prominent entertainer, with a current residency at the MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas. The fortunes of the teenagers who took part have been mixed. Some became successful models, Hollywood actors and TV hosts, while many more lived quieter lives. Ingrid Seynhaeve, the 1991 winner, became a face of Ralph Lauren and Dior, hosted Belgium\u2019s Topmodel TV show, and continues to front high-profile campaigns. Other contestants we spoke to include a beautician, a stay\u2013at\u2013home mother, a makeup artist, a yoga teacher and a bus driver. In 1992, the crown went to one of Look of the Year\u2019s youngest contenders: 14-year-old Mariann Molski. Months after her victory, a profile in the Chicago Tribune reported that the sporty high school student was \u201con the brink of a career of a kind that most young women only dream about\u201d. While she had some success as a model, it is not clear what happened to her in the years that followed; US public records indicate multiple arrests for probation violations, alcohol offences and prostitution, though there is nothing to say she was ever charged. Molski\u2019s current whereabouts are unknown, but she is believed to have been homeless in Arizona. After years of financial mismanagement, Elite was forced into bankruptcy in 2004. The Elite brand continues to be used by two separate agencies, owned by different corporate entities. One is Creative World Management, which bought the New York division in 2004. It strongly distances itself from the Casablancas-owned firm and era, saying it \u201cutterly\u201d condemns the kinds of \u201cdeplorable behaviour\u201d alleged to have taken place in the past. The other inheritor of the brand is Elite World Group, which operates the successor to Look of the Year, a similar global contest for the next top young model, called Elite Model Look. It, too, distances itself from the Casablancas era. \u201cWe would have no tolerance for the conduct you\u2019ve described,\u201d the company told the Guardian. \u201cEmpowering our models and protecting their safety is our foremost priority.\u201d Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year John Casablancas retired in Brazil in the early 2000s. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 2013, aged 70, long before the #MeToo movement heralded a new standard of accountability for powerful men accused of exploiting women and girls. He never got to see his old associate Donald Trump ascend to the White House, despite a cascade of allegations about Trump\u2019s own treatment of women. There are now at least 25 sexual misconduct allegations against the president, ranging from unwanted advances and harassment to serious sexual assaults. More than half relate to models or pageant contestants. Trump denies that he has ever behaved in a predatory or inappropriate fashion with any women or girls. Speaking to the Guardian 30 years on, several former Look of the Year contestants feel that a #MeToo moment for the modelling world is long overdue. \u201cThe girls are young and they look at these agents like parental figures, and they\u2019re not,\u201d says Shawna Lee. \u201cAnything they say goes, whether it\u2019s \u2018Go cut your hair\u2019, \u2018Go wear this dress\u2019. It\u2019s too bad that there were not more consequences for these men.\u201d After Look of the Year 1991, Stacy Wilkes returned to Louisville and quit school, despite having told the judges she would finish. \u201cI thought that was the reason I lost,\u201d she says, \u201cso I might as well leave if I want to make it as a model. We were really broke, so I thought I\u2019d try and make money for my mom, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d She is content with the path her life took, living in Louisville with her partner and three cats, but adds that women were raising concerns at the time and were ignored: \u201cI think models from the 90s tried so hard, over and over, and nobody believed what we had to say.\u201d Kate Dillon, now a businesswoman living in Seattle, remembers the contest as one that \u201cexploited women\u2019s assets, women\u2019s bodies. A lot of these girls were desperate. They thought modelling was about attracting men, which it isn\u2019t.\u201d There was a climate of opportunism, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the men were like, \u2018Yes, Look of the Year week, let\u2019s make sure my schedule is clear to have chicks over to my apartment.\u2019 \u201cWhat\u2019s great is that we now have a language, and a precedent of young people saying: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to let this continue\u2019,\u201d Dillon adds. \u201cThey would never accept being treated the way I was.\u201d \u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).

      "body": "<p>Mark Carney, who ends a seven-year term as Bank of England governor on Sunday, ranks as one of Britain\u2019s more worldly central bank bosses. His immediate predecessors rose through the ranks at the bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street offices.</p> <p>Carney \u2013 who holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenship \u2013 was a polished technocrat with an international pedigree, described by the former chancellor George Osborne, who courted him for a year, as \u201cthe outstanding central banker of his generation\u201d.</p> <p>Carney, now 54, arrived on UK soil following a spectacular rise that included a five-and-a-half year stint as governor of Canada\u2019s central bank and 13 years at the investment bank Goldman Sachs before that.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/andrew-bailey-appointed-head-of-bank-of-england\">hands back the reins to Andrew Bailey</a>, a Bank of England lifer, who must wield the central bank\u2019s considerable resources to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus.</p> <p>Here we look back at five key moments in Carney\u2019s BoE career:</p> <h2><strong>Forward guidance</strong></h2> <p>When he took over from Mervyn King in 2013, Carney was determined to give businesses, consumers and financial markets a clear view of the bank\u2019s interest rate policy. Specifically, he wanted to show how the bank\u2019s base rate would move looking two years ahead. Already a popular concept in the US, forward guidance took over from the bank\u2019s traditional assessment of what to do that month based on the available data.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/07/bank-of-engand-links-interest-rates-jobless-target\">At his first quarterly inflation report meeting</a> in August 2013, he said a fall in unemployment from 7.8% to below 7% would trigger a rise in interest rates from their then all-time low of 0.5%.</p> <p>But unemployment quickly tumbled below 7% without any discernible jump in wages \u2013 which would have pushed up inflation and triggered a rate rise.

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, who ends a seven-year term as Bank of England governor on Sunday, ranks as one of Britain\u2019s more worldly central bank bosses. His immediate predecessors rose through the ranks at the bank\u2019s Threadneedle Street offices. Carney \u2013 who holds Canadian, British and Irish citizenship \u2013 was a polished technocrat with an international pedigree, described by the former chancellor George Osborne, who courted him for a year, as \u201cthe outstanding central banker of his generation\u201d. Carney, now 54, arrived on UK soil following a spectacular rise that included a five-and-a-half year stint as governor of Canada\u2019s central bank and 13 years at the investment bank Goldman Sachs before that. He hands back the reins to Andrew Bailey, a Bank of England lifer, who must wield the central bank\u2019s considerable resources to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus. Here we look back at five key moments in Carney\u2019s BoE career: Forward guidance When he took over from Mervyn King in 2013, Carney was determined to give businesses, consumers and financial markets a clear view of the bank\u2019s interest rate policy. Specifically, he wanted to show how the bank\u2019s base rate would move looking two years ahead. Already a popular concept in the US, forward guidance took over from the bank\u2019s traditional assessment of what to do that month based on the available data. At his first quarterly inflation report meeting in August 2013, he said a fall in unemployment from 7.8% to below 7% would trigger a rise in interest rates from their then all-time low of 0.5%. But unemployment quickly tumbled below 7% without any discernible jump in wages \u2013 which would have pushed up inflation and triggered a rate rise. Carney, the outsider, had misread the flexibility of the UK labour market and how fragile workers felt after the financial crash. A year later, the Labour MP Pat McFadden, a member of the Treasury select committee, accused Carney of behaving like an \u201cunreliable boyfriend\u201d. Carney was a man who promised much and delivered very little, he said. It was a cruel jibe that stuck. Carney has never backed down, however. He defended forward guidance at his last appearance before MPs earlier this month. Project Fear The outgoing governor has been a lightning rod in the Brexit debate. Accused by Brexiters of abandoning the political neutrality expected of him and backing the remain campaign, he was admonished in the spring of 2016 as a \u201cProject Fear\u201d figurehead because of his repeated warnings about the negative economic impact of leaving the EU. The row continued after the referendum. He clashed with the rightwing European Research Group, and in 2017 was branded an \u201cenemy of Brexit\u201d by its leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg. After the Bank warned in November 2018 that a no-deal Brexit could trigger a recession worse than the 2008 financial crisis, Carney was blasted on the front page of the Telegraph for unleashing \u201cProject Hysteria\u201d. In an intervention undermining Carney\u2019s authority, Lord King urged MPs to pursue a no-deal Brexit, saying it would have little impact on the British economy in the long run. Brexit vote Carney\u2019s immediate reaction to the leave vote in June 2016 was feted by nervous investors. Dubbed \u201cthe only adult in the room\u201d at the time, he was the first to react when early economic indicators showed business confidence falling through the floor. He stepped in days after the vote on 30 June to say an interest rate cut was needed to steady the ship. Jittery financial markets rallied and stability was restored. The bank\u2019s monetary policy committee duly delivered a rate cut a few weeks later. While Carney did sound the alarm before the EU referendum about a recession that never ultimately materialised, his other warnings about the negative economic consequences have come to pass: the pound crashed, inflation spiked, economic growth slowed and the average household has been left worse off. Environment Carney\u2019s drive to push the climate emergency up the world\u2019s agenda stakes his claim for a lasting legacy. The governor first sounded the alarm over the risks to financial markets and the global economy in a speech in 2015, when he warned about the \u201ctragedy of the horizon\u201d. In a landmark speech to the insurance market Lloyd\u2019s of London, he said the world was running out of time to deal with global heating as the risks mounted from extreme weather events. Before Carney, central banks had typically kept away from climate issues. However, the Bank\u2019s governor used a letter to the Guardian in 2019 to warn that the financial system faces an existential threat, placing the issue squarely on the agenda for global central banks. Stress tests on banks\u2019 climate risks, proposed and developed on Carney\u2019s watch, will take place next year under Bailey. Although he is leaving the Bank, Carney will advise Boris Johnson on climate-related financial risks for the Cop26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow later this year. Coronavirus The biggest challenge for the world economy since the financial crisis hit just as the governor was preparing to leave. Carney used his final week in charge to launch an emergency interest rate cut \u2013 the first since the 2008 credit crunch \u2013 slashing borrowing costs in a coordinated move alongside Rishi Sunak\u2019s first budget as chancellor. Threadneedle Street cut interest rates from 0.75% to 0.25%, taking the key determinant of borrowing costs for households and businesses to the lowest level in the Bank\u2019s 325-year history. In a double-headed press conference alongside Bailey, he said the economic shock from the coronavirus would be large but ultimately temporary, as nations step up their response to the disease. Stock markets around the world crashed the following day by the most since Black Monday in October 1987, amid widespread investor panic over the dwindling chances of a quick recovery in the global economy.",

They gathered in <a href=\"http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/diplomatic-room.htm\">the diplomatic reception room,</a> once home to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfireside chats\u201d, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington.

What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: \u201cHow do you keep people from panicking?\u201d Trump\u2019s response in part: \u201cCalm. You have to be calm. It\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p> \n<p>It has not gone away.</p> \n<p>A week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths.

The NSC\u2019s global health security chief, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, was fired the day after an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year intelligence agencies warned that the US remained vulnerable to the next flu pandemic but Trump, it seems, hoped that his long streak of political luck would hold.</p> \n<p>Distracted by impeachment in January, the president showed little urgency when the coronavirus exploded in China, apparently unwilling to sour his relationship with authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, whom he praised for having the outbreak \u201ctotally under control\u201d even as it raced across that country and beyond.</p> \n<p>The White House did impose a limited travel ban on China but that alone was not enough. Former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/06/coronavirus-testing-failure-123166\">told the Politico website:</a> \u201cThey needed and still need to be searching for where the cases are, instead of trusting that limited travel bans were keeping out a virus that was probably already on the march.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/us_travel_ban_countries/giv-3902kxaGVtNaHNHJ/\" data-alt=\"travel ban\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/us_travel_ban_countries/giv-3902kxaGVtNaHNHJ/\">travel ban</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps Trump\u2019s greatest blunder was <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/question-cdc-who-no-coronavirus-testing-965279/\">turning down</a> the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization and taken up by many countries. The US government\u2019s own painfully slow progress led to a nationwide shortage of test kits at the most critical moment. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxReports/status/1238121576555577346?s=20\">It was reported</a> that just 11,000 tests have been conducted in America so far, whereas South Korea is carrying out 10,000 tests per day.</p> \n<p>Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-12/u-s-coronavirus-response-was-marked-by-overconfidence-delays?sref=Ptu9QECN\">told the Bloomberg news agency:</a> \u201cThis is an unmitigated disaster that the administration has brought upon the population, and I don\u2019t say this lightly. We have had a much worse response than Iran, than Italy, than China and South Korea.\u201d</p> \n<p>It seems that Trump only began to take the issue seriously two weeks ago when he saw a 1,000-point drop on Wall Street. Even then, he urged aides, including Kellyanne Conway and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to go on television and preach confidence, according to five White House officials and Republicans <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-11/analysis-facing-virus-outbreak-trumps-tactics-fall-short\">interviewed by the Associated Press.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"538cecca-7ee7-4bb8-bf40-77cbda8b4dd3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W8Py8qaAV4M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was \u201cvery much under control\u201d and infections were \u201cgoing very substantially down, not up\u201d. On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be \u201cclose to zero\u201d.</p> \n<p>He also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as \u201ctheir new hoax\u201d, promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">usual playbook of deny and distract</a> proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Robert Shrum,</a> a Democratic strategist and political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cBefore it happened, he dismantled a lot of the preparedness that had been put in place under Obama and Ron Klain [Ebola czar] and Joe Biden, I suppose because they were things Obama had done so he wanted to get rid of them, like the Paris climate accords.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd since then he has over and over again contradicted his own health people and at one point tried to muzzle them. He called the coronavirus \u2018a Democratic hoax\u2019 and then they ran out to explain, \u2018No, no, the hoax was that they were blaming Trump for not handling it well\u2019. Well, I think almost universally people would say Trump has not handled this well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if Trump tried to dismiss the health statistics, he could not ignore the financial markets, an obsession he has made central to his reelection. He put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of a coronavirus task force, demoting Health Secretary Alex Azar, but continued to get in the way of the message.</p> \n<p>Soon after signing the congressional funding bill last Friday, Trump donned a \u201cKeep America great\u201d campaign cap and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/us-coronavirus-death-toll-washington-state\">visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> in Atlanta. In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a \u201csnake\u201d, praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this.</p> \n<p>But on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single worst day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person.</p> \n<p>Trump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government\u2019s top public health experts, testified: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RapD4-7uAbg\">\u201cBottom line, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d</a></p> \n<p>The president tried to provide further reassurance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">only his second Oval Office address</a> on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the \u201cforeign virus\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It was just before 9am and the sky was overcast when a small group of reporters were suddenly ushered through the White House\u2019s south portico. They gathered in the diplomatic reception room, once home to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfireside chats\u201d, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal. Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn \u2013 more than three times what the president himself had requested \u2013 and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras. \u201cWe\u2019re doing very well,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut it\u2019s an unforeseen problem. What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: \u201cHow do you keep people from panicking?\u201d Trump\u2019s response in part: \u201cCalm. You have to be calm. It\u2019ll go away.\u201d It has not gone away. A week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths. The stock market suffered its worst percentage drop since the 1987 Wall Street crash. On Wednesday night alone, Trump announced a travel ban on most of Europe during an Oval Office address, the National Basketball Association suspended its season and it emerged the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson had tested positive. The New York Post\u2019s front page headline declared: A world turned upside down. It is at such moments of peril that a nation looks to its leader for reassurance and direction. Trump, critics say, has failed the test in both words and deeds. Uniquely unqualified, he is the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said: \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019s handled it horribly. When things are rough, you want somebody who can exude confidence and competence and Trump does not do that. \u201cWe\u2019ve been incredibly lucky. For the last three years, there was nothing big going on that had a real bearing on the lives of the ordinary American. This does.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak plays to the weaknesses of Trump, a germaphobe and gut instinct politician who prefers to slug it out with human foes on Twitter. He has spent years undermining experts, institutions, scientists, media outlets, global alliances and trust in government, all of which are now needed more than ever. His first misstep came two years ago when he disbanded the global health security team on the National Security Council (NSC) that was responsible for preparing for a pandemic. The NSC\u2019s global health security chief, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, was fired the day after an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year intelligence agencies warned that the US remained vulnerable to the next flu pandemic but Trump, it seems, hoped that his long streak of political luck would hold. Distracted by impeachment in January, the president showed little urgency when the coronavirus exploded in China, apparently unwilling to sour his relationship with authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, whom he praised for having the outbreak \u201ctotally under control\u201d even as it raced across that country and beyond. The White House did impose a limited travel ban on China but that alone was not enough. Former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler told the Politico website: \u201cThey needed and still need to be searching for where the cases are, instead of trusting that limited travel bans were keeping out a virus that was probably already on the march.\u201d Perhaps Trump\u2019s greatest blunder was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization and taken up by many countries. The US government\u2019s own painfully slow progress led to a nationwide shortage of test kits at the most critical moment. It was reported that just 11,000 tests have been conducted in America so far, whereas South Korea is carrying out 10,000 tests per day. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told the Bloomberg news agency: \u201cThis is an unmitigated disaster that the administration has brought upon the population, and I don\u2019t say this lightly. We have had a much worse response than Iran, than Italy, than China and South Korea.\u201d It seems that Trump only began to take the issue seriously two weeks ago when he saw a 1,000-point drop on Wall Street. Even then, he urged aides, including Kellyanne Conway and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow, to go on television and preach confidence, according to five White House officials and Republicans interviewed by the Associated Press. Trump himself constantly downplayed the threat and contradicted his own health officials, asserting that the virus was \u201cvery much under control\u201d and infections were \u201cgoing very substantially down, not up\u201d. On 26 February, he confidently claimed that total cases will be \u201cclose to zero\u201d. He also accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as \u201ctheir new hoax\u201d, promised a vaccine much sooner than scientifically possible, prophesied that the virus will be killed off by warmer spring weather and kept comparing it to the common flu (though experts say coronavirus is 10 times more deadly). But the usual playbook of deny and distract proved futile against a nimble germ without an ego. Robert Shrum, a Democratic strategist and political science professor at the University of Southern California, said: \u201cBefore it happened, he dismantled a lot of the preparedness that had been put in place under Obama and Ron Klain [Ebola czar] and Joe Biden, I suppose because they were things Obama had done so he wanted to get rid of them, like the Paris climate accords. \u201cAnd since then he has over and over again contradicted his own health people and at one point tried to muzzle them. He called the coronavirus \u2018a Democratic hoax\u2019 and then they ran out to explain, \u2018No, no, the hoax was that they were blaming Trump for not handling it well\u2019. Well, I think almost universally people would say Trump has not handled this well.\u201d Even if Trump tried to dismiss the health statistics, he could not ignore the financial markets, an obsession he has made central to his reelection. He put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of a coronavirus task force, demoting Health Secretary Alex Azar, but continued to get in the way of the message. Soon after signing the congressional funding bill last Friday, Trump donned a \u201cKeep America great\u201d campaign cap and visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a \u201csnake\u201d, praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this. But on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single worst day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person. Trump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government\u2019s top public health experts, testified: \u201cBottom line, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d The president tried to provide further reassurance in only his second Oval Office address on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the \u201cforeign virus\u201d. He also failed to explain how tests will become available and committed factual errors the White House was forced to hastily correct. Susan Rice, former national security adviser, tweeted simply: \u201cOMG.\u201d Eight months from a presidential election, the virus has jeopardised Trump\u2019s central reelection argument \u2013 a strong economy \u2013 just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage by offering stability and a safe pair of hands. Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThe most calming and reassuring presidential voice of the past 24 hours has been Joe Biden. As a Republican, this is hard for me to say but it\u2019s true.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic is being described as a once-in-a-lifetime event. History remembers how presidents handle such crises \u2013 and to Trump, it seems unlikely to be kind. He may be regarded as a Nero, fiddling while Rome burned. Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Biden, said: \u201cHe is unable to express compassion and empathy; I don\u2019t believe he possesses those two values. This was his chance to show that he could lead, to show that he was as tough as he said he was for three years. And then what does he do?

Only people who travelled internationally in the 14 days before illness onset or who had close or casual contact in the 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of Covid-19, and also have a fever or acute respiratory infection need to be tested. People with severe pneumonia with or without recent international travel are also classified as a suspect case requiring testing. The head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone urged Australians to take some personal responsibility and to stop pushing doctors for Covid-19 testing unless they met the criteria or were severely unwell. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there is a significant amount of people who are being tested at the moment for no other reason than just fear, anxiety or personal interest,\u201d Bartone told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe criteria that have been clearly outlined in the letter are in the interest of ensuring adequate supply at this crucial time while we\u2019re facing a significant pressure on reagents and kits. \u201cWe are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases.

      "body": "<p>As Ronald and Eva Weissberger boarded the cruise ship bound for Hawaii, the couple were looking forward to the trip of a lifetime.</p> <p>The Weissbergers, the 74- and 69-year-olds from Florida, had heard stories about the boat\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan and ultimately resulted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">more than 700 </a>confirmed cases of coronavirus. But to them, the Diamond Princess \u201cseemed like a world away\u201d, says the couple\u2019s son-in-law, Jason Chalik.</p> <p>Little did they know, what would start as a 15-night cruise through paradise would turn into a waking nightmare for the 3,500 people on board.</p> <p>As passengers headed up the gangway to the Grand Princess and toward their rooms on 21 February they had no idea that a 75-year-old man from Placer county, California \u2013 who\u2019d stepped off the boat in San Francisco \u2013 was carrying Covid-19, the novel coronavirus that, by Friday afternoon, had infected more than 2,000 Americans and killed more than 40.</p> <p>The cruise ship they boarded has since become the center of a dramatic US crisis that has forced national and state governments to take measures that seemed unimaginable even a week ago. It has also become a potent symbol for everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-testing-us\">America\u2019s woeful lack of test kits</a>, which had to be flown in by helicopter, to the racial politics of who will shoulder the burden of the outbreak.</p> <p>Between the boat\u2019s departure and its return, the nation\u2019s handling of the virus would shift entirely. The World Health Organization declared the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\">outbreak a pandemic</a>. Markets tumbled. Schools and theme parks shuttered and professional sports halted. And Donald Trump would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">suspend most travel</a> from the European Union, setting off chaos at airports as confused travelers looked for a way home.</p> <p>Health officials expect the number of US cases to multiply exponentially as the government, <a href=\"https://popular.info/p/unprepared\">caught flat-footed</a> by the outbreak, makes tests more readily available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fce3165999ea9ee818df7b01394a97664d6565d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fce3165999ea9ee818df7b01394a97664d6565d3/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Schwartz Dever and Harry Dever, of Moorsetown, New Jersey, were on board the Grand Princess cruise ship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Schwartz Dever and Harry Dever, of Moorsetown, New Jersey, were on board the Grand Princess cruise ship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Miller/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The outbreak begins</h2> <p>The Grand Princess was thrust into the national spotlight after California reported its first death from coronavirus \u2013 an elderly man in northern California\u2019s Placer county, who had been on the ship\u2019s previous voyage to Mexico.</p> <p>The exact point at which he contracted the virus is disputed.</p> <p>Princess Cruises, which operates the Grand Princess and the Diamond Princess, claimed he was infected at some point during the Grand Princess\u2019s trip to Mexico and said he complained of symptoms while still on board.</p> <p>Public health officials in California disagree. More likely, they said, he was already infected when he stepped aboard the ship, indicating the new coronavirus had been spreading onshore for longer than anyone knew.</p> <p>Genetic researchers <a href=\"https://santamariatimes.com/news/national/scientist-links-state-outbreaks-with-genetic-fingerprints/article_796b09fb-2241-50e0-84e5-5712d7081d34.html\">this week</a> traced the virus that infected passengers on the Grand Princess to the same family tree of infections that spread through a cluster of patients in Washington state and likely originated from a patient who had traveled to Wuhan, China. The finding suggests an infected person may have traveled from Washington to California and had contact with the someone who boarded the ship.</p> <p>What is certain, however, is that the 75-old-year old Placer county man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on 4 March \u2013 the first death in California attributed to the virus.</p> <p>About 60 passengers who traveled with him to Mexico stayed on the ship\u2019s next journey to Hawaii, mixing with other passengers.</p> <p>Passengers had little reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary until the ship slowly started canceling events: first, the shows that drew large crowds, then the smaller events like music or dancing lessons that keep passengers busy at sea.</p> <p>The morning of 4 March, the same day the Placer county man died at a hospital, Grand Princess officials told the 60 passengers who traveled with him they\u2019d need to stay in their rooms until they could be screened for symptoms.</p> <p>Still, most were allowed to carry on, catching sun on the Lido deck and visiting with their shipmates.</p> <p>The elderly Weissbergers were playing cards with friends when news of the potential outbreak reached their daughter and son-in-law back in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cWe called [the Weissbergers] and asked if they were quarantined,\u201d said son-in-law Chalik, an attorney who has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/grand-princess-cruise-coronavirus-lawsuit\">in a lawsuit filed</a> on the couple\u2019s behalf, accusing the Princess Cruises of gross negligence for its \u201clackadaisical\u201d response to the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThey said, \u2018No, we\u2019re playing bridge\u2019,\u201d Chalik recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. We asked, \u2018You\u2019re playing bridge with other passengers?

I can\u2019t stay in this room the whole time.\u2019 I was just really scared about the uncertainty of it all,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared for myself. I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m young. I figured if I got it I would be able to recover. But I was scared for my grandparents, and I felt a lot of pressure to protect them from it.\u201d</p> <p>The ship was delayed off the coast of San Francisco while officials hatched a plan. In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMUJ4BkiRvw\">dramatic scene</a>, US coast guard helicopters dropped tests onto the Grand Princess. Of the 45 tested,<strong> </strong>19 crew members and 2 passengers<strong> </strong>would test positive for the virus and about 100 passengers showed symptoms.</p> <p>Crew members, many who shared space for accommodations and meals, would deliver meals to rooms individually \u2014 which health experts said was one of the factors why the quarantine of passengers within a cruise ship\u2019s close quarters is ineffective.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6886edd5ac377b9b9fd6747b8f560f5719932657\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6886edd5ac377b9b9fd6747b8f560f5719932657/0_523_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on board the Grand Princess watch while a US military helicopter delivers coronavirus tests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers on board the Grand Princess watch while a US military helicopter delivers coronavirus tests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Berry/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In reference to the Diamond Princess, where passengers also faced prolonged quarantine, Dr Amesh Adalja, with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-coronavirus-quarantines-have-failed-health-law-ethics-experts-2020-2\">told Business Insider</a> that quarantining passengers on a cruise ship allows \u201cthe virus to literally pick them off one-by-one\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole idea of the cruise ship quarantine was ill-conceived, and the resultant slew of infections it spawned was completely predictable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the Grand Princess idled offshore, Donald Trump publicly expressed reluctance to bring the ship home.</p> <p>\u201cI like the numbers where they are,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/07/i-like-the-numbers-being-where-they-are-trump-video\">Trump said</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were in shock,\u201d Chalik said of the Weissbergers\u2019 reaction to comments from the president.</p> <p>\u201cThey actually like a lot of what Donald Trump has to say, and here he\u2019s talking about them like they\u2019re just numbers.

Cars honked, passengers whooped and cheered as the boat passed underneath San Francisco\u2019s iconic Golden Gate bridge.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew we were headed toward shore,\u201d said Rex Lawson, 86, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, 81. \u201cEverybody was very happy when we pulled under the bridge, they were out on their balcony, yelling and clapping\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dcd9e888e271537ab561a6dac1cab514fa0ad39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dcd9e888e271537ab561a6dac1cab514fa0ad39/0_0_2348_1464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers on the Grand Princess wave as the ship approaches Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers on the Grand Princess wave as the ship approaches Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The worst, it seemed, was over. But still to overcome was was the colossal task of moving thousands of passengers, an untold number of whom had been infected, off the boat and onto buses, where they\u2019d be transported to hospitals, hotels or military bases for 14 days of quarantine.</p> <p>On Monday morning, just before the Grand Princess pulled in, trucks rumbled to and from the docks along the shoreline like any other day. Four large private passenger buses waited to transport the possibly-infected passengers.</p> <p>Passengers disembarked by order of priority, those with acute medical needs first. Officials said it could take up to three days to unload everybody. But by Friday, five days after the Grand Princess first docked, 14 international passengers still remained on board. Officials said they\u2019d be there at least through the weekend while their home countries arranged transportation.</p> <p>The boat\u2019s 1,000-plus crew is expected to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-infected-crew-members-kept-on-grand-princess-cruise-ship-2020-3\">remain on board </a>under quarantine while officials determine a place to dock for good.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/682a9751ed3504724d478d51ffc54a8331c661c8/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grand Princess cruise ship sits docked at the Port of Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Munsch/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Quarantine issues emerge</h2> <p>Prince Cruises declined to be interviewed for this story, saying that currently \u201call team members are focused on the situation at hand and the well-being of our guests\u201d.</p> <p>But complaints quickly started mounting from passengers concerned that recommended <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html\">quarantine protocols</a> weren\u2019t being followed.

There were no hand-washing stations available in the food areas and the passengers had to serve themselves coffee using their bare hands on the coffee dispenser, she said.</p> <p>On 10 March, the day the Grand Princess first reached Oakland, passengers received an official document under their cabin doors that read: \u201cOnce you arrive at the military installation, you may choose to be tested for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>But Morse said that when she and her husband asked to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday, they were told no tests were available.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not testing us. On the ship they gave us a paper that said we would be tested. When we got here (three days ago), they took our temperatures instead,\u201d Morse said.</p> <p>Heckert, also quarantined at Travis air force base, said on Thursday that her family hadn\u2019t been tested, either.</p> <p>Congressman John Garamendi on Thursday filed a complaint with the federal department of Health and Human Services on Morse\u2019s behalf. It was only then, Morse said, that staff began delivering food to passenger\u2019s rooms instead of having them line up to grab plastic boxes from tall stacks.</p> <p>\u201cWe were better off on the ship,\u201d Morse said, adding that cruise ship staff left food outside their door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521ea96b23e193ca94db96640c03ffc6ec58a85c/0_0_3836_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crew members wear masks while preparing to dock the Grand Princess in Oakland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eric Olsen, a spokesman for Rep Garamendi, said the congressman sent pictures of the food distribution problems to HHS, which is running the quarantine.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to health guidelines, you\u2019re supposed to be separating people in their rooms,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIf someone is Covid-19 positive, this (mingling) is going to spread the disease. These people are supposed to be getting ready to be released to the public.\u201d</p> <p>As spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: \u201cOur number one priority was to screen passengers for symptoms, address any underlining health conditions, make sure they had access to their prescription medication, and get them settled into their rooms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis unprecedented response has raised many significant logistical challenges. We have assigned case managers to each of the guests to individually address their needs. We recognize this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can to passengers.\u201d </p> <p>For 86-year-old Rex Lawson, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, the experience hasn\u2019t soured his travel plans forever. His children told him he\u2019s never going on another cruise, but he said it\u2019s hard pass up the free trip Princess Cruises has offered him and his wife.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t say never,\u201d Lawson said.</p> <p>But he might be out a partner. He asked his wife if they might use the free ticket in the future. She\u2019d told him that next time, he\u2019d have to go by himself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Erin McCormick and Vivian Ho contributed reporting</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "As Ronald and Eva Weissberger boarded the cruise ship bound for Hawaii, the couple were looking forward to the trip of a lifetime. The Weissbergers, the 74- and 69-year-olds from Florida, had heard stories about the boat\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which had been quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan and ultimately resulted in more than 700 confirmed cases of coronavirus. But to them, the Diamond Princess \u201cseemed like a world away\u201d, says the couple\u2019s son-in-law, Jason Chalik. Little did they know, what would start as a 15-night cruise through paradise would turn into a waking nightmare for the 3,500 people on board. As passengers headed up the gangway to the Grand Princess and toward their rooms on 21 February they had no idea that a 75-year-old man from Placer county, California \u2013 who\u2019d stepped off the boat in San Francisco \u2013 was carrying Covid-19, the novel coronavirus that, by Friday afternoon, had infected more than 2,000 Americans and killed more than 40. The cruise ship they boarded has since become the center of a dramatic US crisis that has forced national and state governments to take measures that seemed unimaginable even a week ago. It has also become a potent symbol for everything from America\u2019s woeful lack of test kits, which had to be flown in by helicopter, to the racial politics of who will shoulder the burden of the outbreak. Between the boat\u2019s departure and its return, the nation\u2019s handling of the virus would shift entirely. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. Markets tumbled. Schools and theme parks shuttered and professional sports halted. And Donald Trump would suspend most travel from the European Union, setting off chaos at airports as confused travelers looked for a way home. Health officials expect the number of US cases to multiply exponentially as the government, caught flat-footed by the outbreak, makes tests more readily available. The outbreak begins The Grand Princess was thrust into the national spotlight after California reported its first death from coronavirus \u2013 an elderly man in northern California\u2019s Placer county, who had been on the ship\u2019s previous voyage to Mexico. The exact point at which he contracted the virus is disputed. Princess Cruises, which operates the Grand Princess and the Diamond Princess, claimed he was infected at some point during the Grand Princess\u2019s trip to Mexico and said he complained of symptoms while still on board. Public health officials in California disagree. More likely, they said, he was already infected when he stepped aboard the ship, indicating the new coronavirus had been spreading onshore for longer than anyone knew. Genetic researchers this week traced the virus that infected passengers on the Grand Princess to the same family tree of infections that spread through a cluster of patients in Washington state and likely originated from a patient who had traveled to Wuhan, China. The finding suggests an infected person may have traveled from Washington to California and had contact with the someone who boarded the ship. What is certain, however, is that the 75-old-year old Placer county man who tested positive for the new coronavirus died on 4 March \u2013 the first death in California attributed to the virus. About 60 passengers who traveled with him to Mexico stayed on the ship\u2019s next journey to Hawaii, mixing with other passengers. Passengers had little reason to believe anything was out of the ordinary until the ship slowly started canceling events: first, the shows that drew large crowds, then the smaller events like music or dancing lessons that keep passengers busy at sea. The morning of 4 March, the same day the Placer county man died at a hospital, Grand Princess officials told the 60 passengers who traveled with him they\u2019d need to stay in their rooms until they could be screened for symptoms. Still, most were allowed to carry on, catching sun on the Lido deck and visiting with their shipmates. The elderly Weissbergers were playing cards with friends when news of the potential outbreak reached their daughter and son-in-law back in Florida. \u201cWe called [the Weissbergers] and asked if they were quarantined,\u201d said son-in-law Chalik, an attorney who has since in a lawsuit filed on the couple\u2019s behalf, accusing the Princess Cruises of gross negligence for its \u201clackadaisical\u201d response to the outbreak. \u201cThey said, \u2018No, we\u2019re playing bridge\u2019,\u201d Chalik recalled. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe it. We asked, \u2018You\u2019re playing bridge with other passengers? And you\u2019re touching the same cards?\u2019 They had no idea.\u201d Things get worse Later that day Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, announced a state of emergency and, citing those on board who had shown symptoms said the Grand Princess, would head back to California early for testing. The toughest moment for Michelle Heckert, a Bay Area woman traveling with her grandparents, came when she learned all passengers would need to stay in their rooms until further notice. \u201cI called my mom in tears, like \u2018I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t stay in this room the whole time.\u2019 I was just really scared about the uncertainty of it all,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared for myself. I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m young. I figured if I got it I would be able to recover. But I was scared for my grandparents, and I felt a lot of pressure to protect them from it.\u201d The ship was delayed off the coast of San Francisco while officials hatched a plan. In a dramatic scene, US coast guard helicopters dropped tests onto the Grand Princess. Of the 45 tested, 19 crew members and 2 passengers would test positive for the virus and about 100 passengers showed symptoms. Crew members, many who shared space for accommodations and meals, would deliver meals to rooms individually \u2014 which health experts said was one of the factors why the quarantine of passengers within a cruise ship\u2019s close quarters is ineffective. In reference to the Diamond Princess, where passengers also faced prolonged quarantine, Dr Amesh Adalja, with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Business Insider that quarantining passengers on a cruise ship allows \u201cthe virus to literally pick them off one-by-one\u201d. \u201cThe whole idea of the cruise ship quarantine was ill-conceived, and the resultant slew of infections it spawned was completely predictable,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, as the Grand Princess idled offshore, Donald Trump publicly expressed reluctance to bring the ship home. \u201cI like the numbers where they are,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d \u201cThey were in shock,\u201d Chalik said of the Weissbergers\u2019 reaction to comments from the president. \u201cThey actually like a lot of what Donald Trump has to say, and here he\u2019s talking about them like they\u2019re just numbers. They\u2019re not numbers, they\u2019re my kids\u2019 grandparents.\u201d Heading for the shore As they waited just off the coast, passengers took to social media to share their quarantine horror stories. One man complained he was going hungry because the ship was rationing food. A family of eight started an Instagram account about the hair-pulling endeavor of trying to occupy six small children for days in a tiny, windowless cabin. Michelle Heckert, who said she did her best to strike a positive tone, playing music with a ukulele and releasing videos on Twitter, tweeted the day\u2019s in-cabin entertainment: an instructional video on how to make paper airplanes. The Grand Princess was finally given the green light to return to shore, but it would dock in Oakland, not San Francisco. Officials said Oakland\u2019s outer harbor put it at safer remove from tourists and densely populated areas. To many in Oakland, a city that\u2019s long lived in its glitzier neighbor\u2019s shadow, reopened old wounds, fanning longstanding tensions steeped in racial and environmental discrimination. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling, particularly among people of color in this city, that things keep happening to us and not for us,\u201d Oakland activist Cat Brooks told the Guardian. \u201cWhen something like this [cruise ship] happens, that allows for a breeding ground of hysteria and mistrust.\u201d But the news was more than welcome to those on board the Grand Princess. Cars honked, passengers whooped and cheered as the boat passed underneath San Francisco\u2019s iconic Golden Gate bridge. \u201cWe knew we were headed toward shore,\u201d said Rex Lawson, 86, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, 81. \u201cEverybody was very happy when we pulled under the bridge, they were out on their balcony, yelling and clapping\u201d. The worst, it seemed, was over. But still to overcome was was the colossal task of moving thousands of passengers, an untold number of whom had been infected, off the boat and onto buses, where they\u2019d be transported to hospitals, hotels or military bases for 14 days of quarantine. On Monday morning, just before the Grand Princess pulled in, trucks rumbled to and from the docks along the shoreline like any other day. Four large private passenger buses waited to transport the possibly-infected passengers. Passengers disembarked by order of priority, those with acute medical needs first. Officials said it could take up to three days to unload everybody. But by Friday, five days after the Grand Princess first docked, 14 international passengers still remained on board. Officials said they\u2019d be there at least through the weekend while their home countries arranged transportation. The boat\u2019s 1,000-plus crew is expected to remain on board under quarantine while officials determine a place to dock for good. Quarantine issues emerge Prince Cruises declined to be interviewed for this story, saying that currently \u201call team members are focused on the situation at hand and the well-being of our guests\u201d. But complaints quickly started mounting from passengers concerned that recommended quarantine protocols weren\u2019t being followed. Passengers were in close contact with others as they unloaded the ship. They boarded a bus and sat close to others who might be infected. And many have still gone untested even days after arriving at an air force base for quarantine. Denise Morse, a Davis resident, on Thursday filed a complaint through her congressman, John Garamendi, claiming that safety protocols have been disregarded. \u201cWe\u2019re an incubator for Covid-19,\u201d she said from her room on Travis air force base, where she\u2019s surrounded by a containment fence and under guard 24 hours a day. Morse said that when she first arrived at the base she noticed passengers crammed together as they lined up for food and grabbed condiments out of shared bins. There were no hand-washing stations available in the food areas and the passengers had to serve themselves coffee using their bare hands on the coffee dispenser, she said. On 10 March, the day the Grand Princess first reached Oakland, passengers received an official document under their cabin doors that read: \u201cOnce you arrive at the military installation, you may choose to be tested for Covid-19.\u201d But Morse said that when she and her husband asked to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday, they were told no tests were available. \u201cThey are not testing us. On the ship they gave us a paper that said we would be tested. When we got here (three days ago), they took our temperatures instead,\u201d Morse said. Heckert, also quarantined at Travis air force base, said on Thursday that her family hadn\u2019t been tested, either. Congressman John Garamendi on Thursday filed a complaint with the federal department of Health and Human Services on Morse\u2019s behalf. It was only then, Morse said, that staff began delivering food to passenger\u2019s rooms instead of having them line up to grab plastic boxes from tall stacks. \u201cWe were better off on the ship,\u201d Morse said, adding that cruise ship staff left food outside their door. Eric Olsen, a spokesman for Rep Garamendi, said the congressman sent pictures of the food distribution problems to HHS, which is running the quarantine. \u201cAccording to health guidelines, you\u2019re supposed to be separating people in their rooms,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIf someone is Covid-19 positive, this (mingling) is going to spread the disease. These people are supposed to be getting ready to be released to the public.\u201d As spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said: \u201cOur number one priority was to screen passengers for symptoms, address any underlining health conditions, make sure they had access to their prescription medication, and get them settled into their rooms.\u201d \u201cThis unprecedented response has raised many significant logistical challenges. We have assigned case managers to each of the guests to individually address their needs. We recognize this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can to passengers.\u201d For 86-year-old Rex Lawson, who was traveling with his wife Mardell, the experience hasn\u2019t soured his travel plans forever. His children told him he\u2019s never going on another cruise, but he said it\u2019s hard pass up the free trip Princess Cruises has offered him and his wife. \u201cI don\u2019t say never,\u201d Lawson said. But he might be out a partner. He asked his wife if they might use the free ticket in the future. She\u2019d told him that next time, he\u2019d have to go by himself.

But it depends on how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks.

Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing.</p> \n  <p>But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6c28268f085e564ad83ece\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T00:44:46.728Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New Zealand cancels Christchurch shootings remembrance service</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a pragmatic decision.

From Monday, mass-gatherings of more than 500 people will banned, but will not include schools and universities.</p> \n  <p>Until Friday Morrison insisted he would go to the football to see the Shark\u2019s first NRL match, drawing criticism from his opponents and some public health workers. Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers.</p> \n   <p>Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations.

These measures include:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Limiting non-essential organised gatherings to fewer than 500 people</li> \n   <li>Limiting non-essential meetings or conferences of critical workforce eg healthcare professionals and emergency services</li> \n   <li>Encouraging all Australians to exercise personal responsibility for social distancing measures</li> \n   <li>Initiating measures to protect vulnerable populations, such as reducing visitors to all residential care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>However schools, universities and shopping centres are not included in the ban.</p> \n  <p>Australian Medical Association president <strong>Dr Tony Bartone</strong> said the evidence around schools \u201ccan be somewhat difficult to interpret clearly, and we need to be understanding and follow the evidence in that respect\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>So we will work with, again with the Chief Medical Officer and the other health officers to ensure the timeliness of that. Clearly, where there\u2019s been an outbreak in... the school it\u2019s appropriate that certain schools will be put into quarantine during that time. However, as we get deeper into the evolving pandemic response and effects, we will have to work with the best possible evidence. If we do nothing, if we turn a blind eye, our public hospital system will be overrun, and that is not in the interest of anyone in our community at all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On Saturday morning the president of the Australian Primary Principals Association, <strong>Malcolm Elliott</strong>, told the ABC that \u201csome schools are a little more advanced than others\u201d in their preparation.

In the interests of children and the interest of families, social organisation, but what happens now of course is that we are all on tenterhooks. We\u2019re all unsure about what the spread the virus will be, when it might strike particular schools or how widespread this might become and how quickly.

He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system.</li> \n   <li>To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels.</p> \n  <p>Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. </p> \n  <p>One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b72be8f088d7575592b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:49:21.690Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports <strong>Rory Carroll</strong> in Dublin.<br></p> \n  <p>An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">announced restrictions on Thursday</a>.

It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. </p> \n  <p>The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East.

On Saturday Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said school closures are not yet warranted, though mass gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned in Australia from Monday. He said not everyone should rush out and get tested if they had symptoms. Murphy said that in Australia, \u201cCommunity transmission is so low at the moment that we are focusing our testing on returned travellers or contacts of people who are sympathetic. We don\u2019t want people with an ordinary mild cold in Australia to get tested. We need to preserve the testing for those who needed it.\u201d Elsewhere in the world, the US president Donald Trump, after initially declaring coronavirus a \u201choax,\u201d has declared a national emergency, which he described as \u201ctwo very big words\u201d. He\u2019s freed up $50 billion in federal resources to the states to combat the virus, but refused to take responsibility for lack of testing availability and delays in rolling tests out. And in the UK, mass gatherings are set to be banned. In Australia there are now 197 confirmed cases of coronavirus , including three deaths. From Monday, gatherings of more than 500 people will be banned. The chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy has just said this has put Australia in a good position. We are starting these measures perhaps a little bit before some have said they are needed. We in Australia want to flatten that curve and keep this under really tight control. We do not want to see rapid increases like we have seen in some parts of the world. That is why we are moving early. We have modelling that says an infection could take some months to go right through the community with a flattened curve. But it depends on how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day. Earlier in the day Australia\u2019s shadow health minister Chris Bowen slammed the prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of the virus. Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister Peter Dutton was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing. But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said; No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said: That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine. This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering. A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. \u201cThis is a pragmatic decision. We\u2019re very saddened to cancel, but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn\u2019t create the risk of further harm being done,\u201d she said. Health officials announced the country\u2019s sixth confirmed case of the disease. Australia\u2019s shadow health minister Chris Bowen has criticised Australian prime minister Scott Morrison for not cancelling large public gatherings sooner. From Monday, mass-gatherings of more than 500 people will banned, but will not include schools and universities. Until Friday Morrison insisted he would go to the football to see the Shark\u2019s first NRL match, drawing criticism from his opponents and some public health workers. Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d. Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government; I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers. Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well. But as soon as that advice was clear, I thought it was a gobsmacking lack of judgement for Scott Morrison to continue to go to the football, sending a terrible signal and message to the Australian people. On Australia\u2019s home affairs minister Peter Dutton being tested with coronavirus, Bowen said; \u201cWe wish him the best, this is not a pleasant disease\u201d. However, Bowen said there was \u201ca lack of information before the Australian people, and this confusion makes it worse\u201d. Major supermarkets Coles and Woolworths have announced further restrictions on items such as toilet paper and non-perishable foods as they struggle to cope with panic-buying. The Woolworths website currently appears to be offline as people flock to the site to make purchases. Melbourne bureau-chief Melissa Davey here with you for the next eight hours or so bringing you the latest developments. You can contact me at melissa.davey@theguardian.com or on Twitter. Here in Australia the Victorian government will soon reveal more details about event cancellations following the cancellation of the Grand Prix on Friday. For the first time in almost a century, Sydney\u2019s Royal Easter Show has been cancelled. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has issued a statement saying \u201cthe time has come to put in place social distancing measures to mitigate spread, rather than a strategy based primarily on case finding\u201d. These measures include: Limiting non-essential organised gatherings to fewer than 500 people Limiting non-essential meetings or conferences of critical workforce eg healthcare professionals and emergency services Encouraging all Australians to exercise personal responsibility for social distancing measures Initiating measures to protect vulnerable populations, such as reducing visitors to all residential care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities However schools, universities and shopping centres are not included in the ban. Australian Medical Association president Dr Tony Bartone said the evidence around schools \u201ccan be somewhat difficult to interpret clearly, and we need to be understanding and follow the evidence in that respect\u201d. So we will work with, again with the Chief Medical Officer and the other health officers to ensure the timeliness of that. Clearly, where there\u2019s been an outbreak in... the school it\u2019s appropriate that certain schools will be put into quarantine during that time. However, as we get deeper into the evolving pandemic response and effects, we will have to work with the best possible evidence. If we do nothing, if we turn a blind eye, our public hospital system will be overrun, and that is not in the interest of anyone in our community at all. On Saturday morning the president of the Australian Primary Principals Association, Malcolm Elliott, told the ABC that \u201csome schools are a little more advanced than others\u201d in their preparation. He said; The show should go on, and if it is possible for schools to remain open then they should. In the interests of children and the interest of families, social organisation, but what happens now of course is that we are all on tenterhooks. We\u2019re all unsure about what the spread the virus will be, when it might strike particular schools or how widespread this might become and how quickly. So it is a very difficult thing to plan for, in any real meaningful way. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events. The global death toll reached 5,359, while 142,557 cases have been confirmed. In addition, 70,176 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The institution draws from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. The US president declared a national emergency. Donald Trump, who started out by dismissing coronavirus as a hoax, took the major step of designating it a national emergency. That allowed him to sweep aside a host of rules and regulations in order to try to stop its spread. But he repeatedly refused to accept any responsibility for his own administration\u2019s response to the outbreak. Europe is now the centre of the pandemic, the WHO said. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the continent has more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined apart from China. The UK is set to ban mass gatherings \u2013 a significant U-turn by Downing Street. A Whitehall source briefed reporters that ministers are working on a plan to stop \u201cvarious types of public event, including mass gatherings, beginning next week\u201d. The government has thus deemed such measures unnecessary. The UK death toll reached 11 as the first death in Scotland was confirmed. The nation\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said the patient was an \u201colder person who had underlying health conditions\u201d. The UK could be added to the US\u2019 travel ban, Trump said. Responding to news of a significant uptick in the number of UK cases, Trump indicated he was thinking of extended his ban to a country he has thus far protected, while taking others off the list. UK sporting events and elections were postponed. Almost all professional football in Britain, including a significant portion of the grassroots game, was suspended. Rugby fixtures were put off and the London marathon was postponed. In golf, the Masters, which is played in the US, was also cancelled. Local and mayoral elections due to take place in the UK later this year were put back to 2021. Spain declared a state of emergency, while a host of other countries announced strict new measures. Among them were France, Canada and Cyprus, as well as Bosnia, Switzerland and a string of others. Ivanka Trump working from home after contact with Australian government minister who has the virus. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, who serves in the White House, will not self-quarantine despite coming into close contact with the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier news here. The former chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Clare Gerada, has confirmed she contracted the virus \u2013 and is now recovering: Emotional scenes are playing out across Italy as people sing Italian songs, as well as the national anthem, from their balconies in a show of solidarity as they remain in lockdown country grapples to contain a coronavirus outbreak. In Naples, neighbours sang along to a song by the Neapolitan singer, Andrea Sannino, called \u2018Abbracciame\u2019 (Hug me), while in Turin the choice was a classic by the late Domenico Mudugno, \u2018Meraviglioso\u2019 (wonderful). In Milan, Rome and other places, people sang along to the national anthem Inno di Mameli. Italians have been told to \u201cstay at home\u201d until 3 April. Mauritania has confirmed its first case, according to AFP. The agency reported that the country\u2019s health minister, Mohamed Nedhirou Ould Hamed, said the case involved a recently returned foreigner who tested positive on Friday. In a televised address, he said: He was immediately isolated and the state has all the means at its disposal to take care of those suffering from the virus. A statement from the health ministry, also released on Friday, said the man was an \u201cexpatriate\u201d who had flown into Mauritania from Europe on Monday. He isolated himself after a friend in Europe tested positive for the virus. Health officials discovered he was feverish on Friday morning and he was confirmed positive for coronavirus later in the evening. The health minister also promised, in his televised address, that the government would stop charter flights coming to Mauritania from France. The West African state of Guinea registered its first coronavirus case on Friday too. And Senegal, which shares a border with Mauritania, registered 11 new coronavirus infections on Friday, bringing its total number to 19. Ivory Coast, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Nigeria have all also recently registered coronavirus cases. Eswatini, the land-locked southern African country formerly known as Swaziland, has reported its first confirmed case, its minister of health has said. A 33-year-old woman, who returned from the United States at the end of February and then travelled to Lesotho before returning home to eSwatini, is currently in isolation, Lizzie Nkosi added. The French health minister has announced an increase of 800 cases in the last 24 hours. Olivier V\u00e9ran said the evolution of the spread of the virus was \u201crapid and real\u201d: We now have 3,661 cases, 79 deaths. Of the sick, 154 people re in intensive care. We are only at the beginning of the epidemic and it is progressing, which was expected. V\u00e9ran added that 98% of those who have tested positive have since recovered. France has banned gatherings of more than 100 people across the country as schools began closing on Friday for an indefinite period. The previous maximum was more than 1,000 people. The Eiffel Tower, Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, Louvre, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay and Centre Pompidou have closed. The Archbishop of Paris, Michel Aupetit, said there would be no Sunday masses held in churches on the Paris region. Thousands of jobs are set to go at the Dutch national airline, KLM, as it deals with the impact of the outbreak, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Its chief executive, Pieter Elbers, said KLM will shed as many as 2,000 jobs and ask personnel to work shortened hours, while grounding its fleet of six Boeing 747s from 1 April. In the coming months we\u2019ll reduce 1,500 to 2,000 jobs to mean that not only in the coming weeks, but in the coming months we will have fewer colleagues. The airline\u2019s top official said the job cuts mainly included part-time workers, those destined for retirement and natural attrition. A cruise ship has been docked in isolation in northeastern Brazil after two passengers were found to have symptoms resembling that of the new coronavirus, local authorities say. According to the Associated Press, the Brazilian state of Pernambuco\u2019s health secretariat decided to keep the ship \u2013 with its 318 passengers and 291 crew members \u2013 in isolation in the capital of Recife on Thursday. Officials have not released the name of the ship. Some passengers had disembarked before officials decided to isolate the ship and Brazil\u2019s health authority asked tourist agencies to facilitate the return of those people. Authorities took action to prevent additional passengers from leaving. The first passenger suspected of having the virus was described as a 78-year-old man who displayed respiratory problems. Officials said the man was taken from the ship to a private clinic for treatment and testing for the coronavirus. Authorities reported a second possible case on Friday. That passenger had a fever and difficulty breathing, so was moved to a private health unit onshore to undergo the coronavirus test. The result of the tests will dictate whether the ship\u2019s passengers are placed into quarantine, the state\u2019s health secretary, Andr\u00e9 Longo, said in an interview with the Globo television network. The former Nato secretary general, Javier Solana, has been admitted to hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, a source has told Reuters, adding that his health was evolving positively and that he had been put under observation as a precaution. Solana, 77, served in the role from 1995 to 1999, as European Union high representative for foreign affairs from 1999 to 2009 and was Spain\u2019s foreign minister under prime minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez from 1992 to 1995. He attended an event with the current Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, on Monday. The US death toll has risen to 47 after six more deaths were reported in Washington state and a further one was reported in Colorado \u2013 the first in that state. Local authorities said a woman in her 80s who had underlying health issues has died. Ukraine is closing its borders to foreigners for at least two weeks and will stop all flights, as it reported its first Covid-19 fatality on Friday. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the country\u2019s Security and Defence Council, said the measure will take effect in 48 hours. Minutes later, Ukraine announced the news that a woman in her 70s, who lived in north-west Zhytomyr region and was suffering from double pneumonia after a trip to Poland, had died. The country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, asked elderly people to remain at home and asked employers to let workers work from home, wherever possible. He alsoasked Ukrainians who were on holiday or who work abroad to return home by the time the travel ban comes into effect. Danilov said all Ukrainians would be allowed to return to the country, and those coming back from the nations most affected by the pandemic will have to be quarantined. The ban on foreigners would only be waived for diplomatic workers, he said. Norway has introduced travel restrictions designed to combat the spread of the virus. Ullensaker municipality has said on its website: Foreign travellers from countries outside the Nordics arriving at Oslo airport will have to return home. Norwegians arriving at Gardermoen airport, located outside Oslo, will immediately be sent home into quarantine. Ireland is advising its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution before deciding to travel to other EU member states due to action over the spread of the coronavirus, the country\u2019s foreign minister says. Ireland has previously only urged against all travel to Italy and advised avoiding non-essential travel to China, Iran and Spain. The Associated Press is reporting that a second person who was at Mar-a-Lago with Trump last weekend has tested positive for coronavirus. The agency is citing a Republican party official who it says spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters. The person attended a Trump fundraising at the president\u2019s Florida resort on Sunday. Trump also spent time last weekend with a Brazilian official who tested positive just days later. A deal has been reached for an aid package and Democrats in the House of Representatives will soon pass it, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said. We are proud to have reached an agreement with the administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass [the bill]. Pelosi and the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have been negotiating since Thursday on a multi-billion US dollar package that aims to limit the economic fallout from the pandemic, which has infected 138,000 people worldwide, killed more than 5,000 and closed down schools, sports arenas, theatres and offices across America. The bill would provide for free coronavirus testing and two weeks of paid sick and family leave for those affected by the virus, Pelosi said earlier in the day. It also would expand safety-net programs that help people weather economic downturns. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress have waited to hear from the president before weighing in on the measure. Pelosi does not need their support to pass legislation out of the House but it is unlikely to get far in the Republican-controlled Senate without bipartisan support. The International Monetary Fund has advised all staff at its Washington, DC headquarters to work from home until further notice after an employee was diagnosed with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, a spokesman has said. The fund said it also has suspended all mission travel to European countries designated as Level 3 community spread areas by the Centers for Disease Control, but it \u201cremains fully operational and stands ready to serve its members.\u201d In the UK, mass gatherings are set to be banned as part of the battle against coronavirus in a significant shift in the government\u2019s position, the Press Association reports. A Whitehall source has told the news agency: Ministers are working with the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer on our plan to stop various types of public event, including mass gatherings, beginning next week. We are also talking to businesses and other bodies about the timing of moving towards much more widespread working from home. There are many complex considerations to make all these measures as effective as possible. We will make the right decisions at the right time based on the best scientific evidence. Other countries to introduce stringent measures include Cyprus, Bosnia and Uzbekistan. Cyprus is banning entry to non-residents for 15 days, its president Nicos Anastasiades has announced. From Sunday, only Cypriots, legal residents, diplomats, registered students and specific authorised people will be admitted. Anastasiades asked Cypriots abroad not to travel back to Cyprus unnecessarily and said all private and public educational institutions will remain closed until 10 April. Anastasiades said restrictions at crossing points on the divided island\u2019s ceasefire line would remain in place, asking Cypriots to cross only for \u201cnecessary trips\u201d. Bosnia\u2019s authorities have agreed to require two weeks of isolation starting Monday for all its nationals arriving in the country from abroad. The move is likely to discourage members of the large Bosnian diaspora from visiting during forthcoming Easter holidays. And Uzbekistan has suspended all flights to and from France, Spain, and Britain, as well as barring citizens of six countries \u2013including Iran and Italy \u2013 from entering the country. In addition to Italian and Iranian nationals, Uzbekistan has barred French, Spanish, South Korean and Chinese citizens from entering. The Central Asian country, which had already suspended flights to China, South Korea and Iran, has yet to report any cases of the virus. Canada has unveiled aggressive new measures to contain the outbreak; shutting down parliament and advising against foreign travel, even as Justin Trudeau urged citizens to remain calm in a national address delivered from self-imposed quarantine. He told the nation: We have an outstanding public health authorities who are doing an outstanding job. We will get through this together. Trudeau, whose wife has been confirmed as having contracted the virus, said he remained symptom free. Of course, [working from home] is an inconvenience and somewhat frustrating. We are all social beings after all. But we have to do this because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends \u2013 especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with pre-existing conditions. Officials announced a raft of new measures including closing parliament for five weeks and redirecting incoming international flights to a small number of airports as part of enhanced screening measures. The government also announced it will ban cruise ships with 500 people from docking in the country\u2019s ports until 1 July \u2013 but stopped short of closing the borders. Canada\u2019s health minister, Patty Hajdu, said: Borders don\u2019t stop travellers. Travellers find other ways into countries. Travellers become less honest. Canada\u2019s approach from the very beginning has been to use science and evidence. Instead, the government has asked Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside the country and to limit contact with crowds. Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, said: Social distancing is an important contribution that everyone can make to our control efforts. This means avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings, considering shopping or taking public transport in off-peak hours and greeting one another with a wave or elbow instead of a handshake, kiss or hug. The actions you take today will save lives. This is a serious public health threat, and a crisis as well as an emergency. Officials in Toronto, the country\u2019s largest city, announced the closure of all child care facilities, public libraries and community centres. They also announced the surprise cancellation of all spring break camps and urged residents to reconsider taking public transit. Experts cautioned that no clear blueprints yet exist on now to stem the spread of the virus\u2014 but that certain measures have shown degrees of success. Dr Susy Hota, an infectious disease specialist and the medical director of prevention and control at Toronto\u2019s university health network, said: There\u2019s no complete science behind any of it really \u2014 but it\u2019s worthwhile to explore different ways of trying to control things. That\u2019s where the social distancing makes sense to consider doing it early and trying to reduce the overall impact on everybody. Egypt has reported 13 new cases, bringing the total of cases detected in the country to 93, Reuters quotes its health ministry as saying. The new cases reported include five Egyptians and eight foreigners. The country has recorded two deaths because of coronavirus \u2013 one of a German tourist and another of a 60-year-old woman, the ministry added. Another to reported its first coronavirus cases was Kosovo, which said a 20-year-old Italian woman and a 77-year-old Kosovar man were confirmed sufferers. The health minister, Arben Vitia, has said: Their condition is stable. We are identifying others that were in contact with the two patients and they are being isolated. We are closing land borders but not for Kosovo citizens who want to return, and our citizens will be self-quarantined for 15 days. From March 16 all flights will be cancelled. Local media said the 20-year-old Italian woman was working for a humanitarian organisation, while the man had also arrived from Italy in the past few days. The also government said it would isolate two regions where the first patients were discovered, as well as closing all restaurants and shopping centres. Schools were closed on Wednesday. Uruguay has also confirmed its first four recorded cases, its ministry of health announced in a tweet. All four cases were people who had arrived to Uruguay from Milan, Italy between 3 and 6 March, the ministry said, adding that the patients are stable and at their homes. Suriname has identified its first case, the country\u2019s vice president told the national assembly. Michael Ashwin Adhin said the patient had traveled to the South American country last week from the Netherlands and that borders and airports will close at midnight for all persons and flights. Plans to close off Catalonia have been announced by the northeastern Spanish region\u2019s president, Quim Torra, who called on the central government to help by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways. The evolution of the contagion calls for most drastic action. We need to restrict entry and exit to protect ourselves. While Catalonia is one of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions, major transport hubs come under the mandate of the central government. His call, which would affect Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million residents, came hours after the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said that a national state of emergency would be declared on Saturday. And, in Madrid, the regional president Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso recommended that residents not leave their homes. In Europe, Hungary is closing all schools and will continue education as best as it can via digital channels, its prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has said. In a Facebook video, he said he expected the Hungarian economy to stall soon and it will have to be restarted; an effort the government will participate in. Multiple times during this press conference, Trump has been asked about the Brazilian official whom he met and who subsequently tested positive. He was asked if he was offering different advice to Americans than he\u2019s practising himself. I think they have to listen to their doctors and they shouldn\u2019t be jumping to get the test unless they have it. In response to a followup question Trump said he would be tested \u201cfairly soon.\u201d Asked how long the national emergency would go on for, Trump did not give a specific answer. Trump said: I hope not long [but] it gives us the power it needs to get rid of the virus. He also said that the Trump administration is in touch with other countries dealing with the coronavirus. They\u2019re calling us and asking for advice. They\u2019re calling for advice from the people behind me. Trump again refuses to take responsibility for the US\u2019s response to the spread of coronavirus, which many have said was too slow. Asked about the closure of the White House\u2019s pandemic office under his watch, he said: When you say \u2018me\u2019, I didn\u2019t do it. We have a group of people in my administration we could ask, perhaps ... I don\u2019t know anything about it. You say we did that but I don\u2019t know anything about it. Here\u2019s a little more detail on Trump\u2019s comments in respect of the US\u2019s travel ban. Addressing potentially adding the UK to the list, he said: We are looking at it based on the new numbers that are coming out and we may have to include them in the list of countries that we will, you could say ban or whatever it is, during this period of time, but yeah their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours so we may be adding that and we may be adding a couple of others and we may frankly start thinking about taking some off. Trump also stressed the importance of local governments staying consistent in their steps to fight coronavirus. Governors around the country have issued bans of large gatherings at varying levels. We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions we take. Then Trump made a small tangent to note all the major sporting events that have been postponed, canceled, or dramatically scaled back to prevent transmission of the virus. It\u2019s incredible with what\u2019s happened to the sports of the world. They\u2019ve done a great service. We can learn and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of these doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through. Interesting terms. And very accurate. In a number of weeks I think you will find it\u2019s a very accurate term. It\u2019s important to note that Trump, during a question and answer session following his remarks, was asked whether he or his staff were taking any precautions to make sure they get tests for coronavirus. Trump stressed repeatedly that he and his staff did not have any exposure. I don\u2019t if I\u2019ve had any exposure but I don\u2019t have any symptoms. Trump is asked why the UK was exempted from the travel ban list. He says that was the expert advice and, looking at the increase in the number of cases in the UK, the country may be added to the list soon, while other countries might be taken off it. Trump, who initially called coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d, explicitly refuses to take responsibility for the \u201clag\u201d in testing in the US, blaming what he says were outdated rules and regulations that he says were not designed for this sort of outbreak. Fauci backs him up, saying the CDC-designed system was not designed for this and the US needed the help of private business. Trump also said the United States would take advantage of low oil prices and buy a large quantity of crude to fill the nation\u2019s strategic reserves. Based on the prices of oil, I\u2019ve ... instructed the secretary of energy to purchase, at a very good price, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the U.S. strategic reserve ... We\u2019re going to fill it right up to the top. The US vice president, Mike Pence, says coronavirus is now present in 46 of the 50 states of the union. He says the administration will be able to say when Google\u2019s screening website will be available by Sunday. Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democratic senator in Congress, released a statement welcoming Trump\u2019s invocation of the Stafford Act. His response, blasted out before Trump\u2019s presser ended, is below: I\u2019m pleased the president heeded our calls to invoke the Stafford Act to extend vital financial assistance to help keep communities safe from the coronavirus outbreak. I urge New York and other states to immediately request these newly available funds and for the Trump administration to approve these requests without delay. As other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis. Trump has introduced representatives from partner organisations working with the White House to combat the coronavirus. They include representatives from Walmart, Walgreens, LHC Group, Signify Health. Most of the business people gave brief remarks about how eager their respective companies are to help. Trump then said as part of the coronavirus response \u201cwe\u2019ll be changing a lot of the rules and regulations for future.\u201d [SIC] \u201cI guess that\u2019ll continue to an extent but we hope it never happens but we\u2019ll be changing a lot of the wholes and speculations,\u201d Trump said. Trump added that \u201cI\u2019ve waived interest on all student loans held by government agencies.\u201d The president said he instructed secretary of energy Dan Brouillette to buy \u201clarge quantities\u201d of gasoline \u201cin the US strategic reserve.\u201d Trump has said: To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50bn \u2013 a very important and a large amount for states and territories or localities in our shared fight against this disease. Trump says the federal government is partnering with the private sector to accelerate production of test kits to make them more widely available to Americans. Alongside Trump was Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health expert who is on Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force. He says: We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases. But we\u2019ll take care of that. What\u2019s going on here today is going to help it end sooner than it would have. Dr Birx took a few minutes to explain a new coronavirus website for texting. She held up a chart to explain how the website would work (C-SPAN\u2019s Craig Caplan snapped a picture). Dr Birx also set out how the screening website will work \u2013 saying it will guide people through a series of yes or no questions and then, based on their responses, direct them to where they can get the type of health they need locally. This will include whether or not a test is needed at all. Here\u2019s a little more detail on Trump\u2019s comments. Flanked by aides including vice-president Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah Birx, has said the move will waive a number of other requirements meant to benefit doctors and fight the coronavirus pandemic. There\u2019s been an ongoing concern about the availability of tests for the coronavirus. Trump said his team expected \u201chalf a million additional tests will be available early next week\u201d. \u201cWhich will bring probably 1.4 million tests next week and five million in a month,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.\u201d Trump also refers to the sort of drive-through testing systems that have been seen in other countries and that are designed to minimise the exposure of medical staff. He stresses that the US authorities do not want people to get tested if it\u2019s not necessary. The president also thanks a series of private enterprises for their work in equipping the US with some of the tools with which to battle the spread of the virus; including Google, which he says will set up a screening website. Trump claims as many as half a million coronavirus tests will be made available next week, while millions more will follow. Trump says the order will give broad new authority to the US health secretary to waive a series of laws and regulations to give healthcare operators more flexibility as the battle the spread of the virus. The US president says the step will \u201copen up access to up to $50bn\u201d and ordered all 50 states to set up centres to deal with the virus and activate contingency plans. Trump is speaking now. He opens by saying the US has made more progress than \u201cother areas of the world\u201d, attributing that to an \u201cearly\u201d decision to \u201cclose the borders\u201d. Denmark is shutting its borders to most foreign visitors for a month from Saturday, in a move unprecedented in peacetime as part of efforts to halt the spread of coronavirus. The restrictions will come into force at 11am GMT on Saturday and continue until at least 13 April, the country\u2019s prime minister Mette Frederiksen has said. All tourists, all travel, all vacations, and all foreigners who cannot demonstrate a credible reason to enter Denmark will be denied entrance at the Danish border. Danish citizens and foreigners working in Denmark will still be free to enter and leave the country. The transport of goods, including foods, medicine and industry supplies, will also not be affected, she said. The country of 5.7 million people has reported 801 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far and no deaths. Large swathes of Denmark have been in lockdown since Thursday after the government shut all schools and universities and sent home all public sector workers with non-critical jobs in an effort to curb the spread of the disease. The government has notified neighbouring countries Germany, Norway and Sweden as well as the European Commission, Frederiksen said, adding that authorities would need a few days to fully establish the border controls. What is a US national emergency? Donald Trump, as US president, has the power to declare a national emergency, which gives power to the federal government to more freely redistribute funds to state and local governments in a time of the crisis. The president is set to declare a national emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak under the Stafford Act, which was signed into law in 1988 and is designed to encourage local municipalities to design and run their own disaster mitigation efforts, with federal assistance. The last time Trump declared a national emergency was in February 2019 when he declared a national emergency to divert funding for his border wall. That national emergency was declared under a different act, the 1976 National Emergencies Act. Amid reports he\u2019s preparing to declare a national emergency, the US president Donald Trump is due to speak soon. Our US politics live blog will be covering it and I\u2019ll post those updates that are relevant to the pandemic here as well. In addition to the measures we reported earlier, Poland says it will ban foreigners from entering the country from Sunday and impose a 14-day quarantine on its citizens returning home. Morawiecki has said: The state will not abandon (its citizens). However, in the current situation we cannot allow ourselves to keep borders open to foreigners. Nadine Dorries, a junior health minister in the UK\u2019s government who tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week, says her mother has now been confirmed as having contracted the virus. Azerbaijan has banned wedding celebrations and other public events, the authorities have said the day after the country recorded its first death. The measures, which come into force on Saturday, also include shuttering museums, cinemas and theatres. The authorities said the country\u2019s border with Georgia will be closed for 10 days and that all large cultural and sporting events will be postponed by a month. The former Soviet country said on Thursday that a woman who had been quarantined after returning from neighbouring Iran had died from the virus. Schools and universities in the country have been closed since the beginning of March and the authorities extended the closure of the border with Iran for another two weeks on Thursday. Azerbaijan has so far recorded 19 cases. Tunisia will immediately suspend prayers in mosques, close cafes at 4pm every day, and ban all cultural, sports and economic gatherings to combat the spread of the coronavirus, its prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh has said. The government has also closed Tunisia\u2019s maritime borders, suspended all flights to and from Italy, in addition to reducing flights with Egypt, Germany, Britain and France. Tunisia has confirmed 16 cases; mostly among recent arrivals from Europe. And the disease is expected to hit its crucial tourism sector hard. In London, parliament is limiting visitor access from Monday and introducing restrictions on overseas travel. The Speakers of the Commons and the Lords, Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Lord Fowler, have said: We are resolved that parliament should, insofar as possible, continue to fulfil its important constitutional duties of passing legislation, holding government to account and, crucially, representing the views of the people of the United Kingdom and making their voice heard. In order to preserve the operation of parliament, it is our duty to take proportionate and reasonable measures to reduce the risk to those who work on the parliamentary estate and those who have to visit. We are clear that now is the time to be pragmatic; everyone in the country is being asked to strike a balance and it is right that we do the same. It is in this spirit that we have decided to implement a number of restrictions relating to overseas travel and visitor access. These steps have been developed in conjunction with Public Health England and reflect the government\u2019s current approach. Members of the public wishing to enter the parliamentary estate solely to view Westminster Hall will not be admitted. The number of people in Germany with coronavirus has climbed again \u2013 this time to 3,634. The eighth death in the country was announced on Friday and a German man died in Egypt last week. In a brief press conference, the chancellor Angela Merkel pledged government support for the economy and for society \u201con all levels\u201d. She described the widespread closure of schools, the announcement of a massive credit programme for businesses and a work reduction programme to support workers and employers as far-reaching measures that would help ease the burden. In contrast to the financial crisis of 2008/9, she said: Here we\u2019re dealing with an opponent, if I may put it like that \u2013 a virus that we don\u2019t know, where we don\u2019t know how we can combat it either, through vaccines or medicine. And that\u2019s why we have to act where we can do so in the most vigorous way we can. Merkel said she hoped all citizens would show solidarity by keeping their distance. She said it was an \u201capparent paradox\u201d that the weakest, oldest and those with pre-existing conditions could be best helped if social contact was avoided Meanwhile, Berlin\u2019s senate has decided \u2013 along with 12 of Germany\u2019s 16 other states \u2013 to close all schools and kindergartens. To its list of cultural institutions forced to close, which included theatres, opera houses museums and concert halls, it has now added nightclubs and bars. The famous fish hall in the northern port city of Hamburg has closed for the first time in its 300-year history, authorities said. India has reported its second coronavirus death. Its ministry of health and family welfare said the person lived in the capital, New Delhi. In Poland, public gatherings are to be limited to 50 people, restaurants, bars and casinos are to close and no inbound flights will be allowed from Sunday onwards, the country\u2019s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said. He said food deliveries would still be allowed and the flight ban would not include charter flights. The American singer, Kelis, has cancelled her two UK gigs next week, which were scheduled for Manchester on Monday and London on Tuesday. She has said: The health and well-being of you, me, our families, friends, and our greater community is of utmost importance ... I look forward to seeing you soon and in the meantime, please take care of yourselves and each other. The singer, who is touring to mark 20 years since the release of her debut album, Kaleidoscope, said she hope the shows can be rescheduled for the summer. The number of cases in Germany has increased from the 3,000 reported earlier on Friday to 3,062, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. It said five people had died after testing positive for the virus. Speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, a State Department official has confirmed the Chinese ambassador was \u201csummoned with regard to what the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said over Covid-19\u201d. Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian made the accusation on Thursday on his Twitter account. An editorial in the official China Daily on Friday intensified a war of words with the United States, blasting \u201cChina-bashers\u201d. Earlier this week, the US national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, said China reacted slowly to the emergence of the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing. The US State Department has summoned the Chinese ambassador over a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson\u2019s comments about claims that the US military was responsible for bringing the new coronavirus to the province of Wuhan at the start of the outbreak. That\u2019s just breaking now on Reuters. Some more interrogation now of that \u2018Herd Immunity\u2019 strategy which appears to be a par of the UK government\u2019s response to the pandemic. While questioning the logic that underpins it, this piece by a virologist in The Converstion online journal questions how much of the discussion around herd immunity is actually part of the policy being pursued. Jeremy Rossman, Honorary Senior Lecturer in Virology and President of Research-Aid Networks, University of Kent, argues: A delay strategy when combined with surveillance and containment, as recommended by the WHO, could be very effective in combating the spread of COVID-19. Yet if we slow the spread of the virus but are relying on herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable people, we would still need 47 million people to be infected. Many of Britain\u2019s biggest insurers are pulling down the shutters to new travel insurance customers, with Aviva, Direct Line and Churchill the latest to stop selling policies as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Responding to the moves, the consumer body Which? said the government, insurers and the travel sector needed to \u201curgently\u201d work together to tackle the challenge because \u201cthe industry depends on people having the confidence to travel knowing they will be covered\u201d. On Wednesday 11 March, LV became the first big insurer to stop selling travel insurance to new customers. Then on Friday 13 March, Direct Line and Churchill said they had taken a decision to temporarily suspend the sale of travel insurance to new customers \u201cso we can focus on our existing customers\u201d. The World Health Organisation has been rolling out details of a new disease Solidarity Response Fund. It enables private individuals, corporations and institutions around the world to come together to directly contribute to global response efforts, and has been created by the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, together with WHO. The director general of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said earlier that Europe is now at the centre of the global coronavirus outbreak. School closures lasting four weeks could cut 3% from the UK\u2019s GDP, costing the economy billions of pounds, according to research being considered by the government as it weighs up the benefits and risks of shutting down classrooms. Advisers at the Department for Education and No 10 are examining a range of options from complete closure of all schools and colleges in England, which would affect around 7 million children, to more nuanced policies. Measures being looked at include those effected in Japan, where schools sent home individual classes and age groups when a certain percentage of children were infected, and Austria, where elementary schools have stayed open to effectively act as daycare for the children of essential workers. Belgium has followed a similar path. Other countries have closed all schools. Extraordinary times - or carnage - in the business world. After we reported earlier that Lufthansa was considering an application for financial aid from the German government news now also breaks that Delta Airlines is in talks with the White House regarding support that can be provided. That\u2019s according to a memo to employees from the company\u2019s CEO, and which has been reported by Reuters. Peru has announced it will suspend all flights to and from Europe and Asia for 30 days beginning on Monday, March 16. The government announced the measure via supreme decree on Friday just two days after closing all its schools until the end of the month and ordering travelers from France, Spain, Italy and China to quarantine themselves for 14 days on arrival in the country. The country had 28 Coronavirus cases as of Friday morning, according its health ministry. Gatherings of more than 300 people have been banned while concerts and football matches have been cancelled or postponed. The Andean country is a major tourist destination and Canatur, the main tour operators union, says the $5.2bn sector is in crisis. Cancelled trips from Europe and Asia represent $650m in lost revenue and the loss of some 800,000 direct and indirect jobs, it said on Thursday. The Scottish government has confirmed the first coronavirus related death in Scotland. Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Catherine Calderwood said: I am saddened to report that a patient in Scotland who has tested positive for Coronavirus has died in hospital. I offer my deepest sympathy to their friends and family at this difficult time. The patient, who was being treated by Lothian Health Board was an older person who had underlying health conditions. No further information will be available to protect patient confidentiality. The British government strategy of striving to achieve \u2018herd immunity - by broadening the peak of the epidemic, and allowing immunity to build up among the population - is beginning to come under greater scrutiny. Critics including the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt have expressed concern about the decision to delay more drastic measures, such as school closures. Sir Patrick Vallance, England\u2019s chief scientific adviser, has defended the approach, seeking to underline that it is epidemiology that is guiding the decision not to impose more draconian restrictions on the public\u2019s day-to-day lives immediately. But among others asking questions about the strategy is Anthony Costello, a paediatrician, research scientist and former director of mother, child and adolescent health at WHO. In this twitter thread, he states that vaccines are a safer way to develop herd immunity, without the risks associated with the disease itself and asks: \u201cIs it ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of an uncertain future benefit\u201d He also asks if the herd immunity strategy conflicts with WHO Policy, adding: \u201cAfter the announcement of this being a pandemic, Dr Tedros, Director General WHO, said \u2018The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u2019\u201d The London marathon has been postponed until October 4, organisers have just announced. Hugh Brasher, the event\u2019s director, said: \u201cThe world is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of COVID-19 and public health is everyone\u2019s priority. \u201cWe know how disappointing this news will be for so many \u2013 the runners who have trained for many months, the thousands of charities for which they are raising funds and the millions who watch the race every year.\u201d Greek health authorities have announced further preventative measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, saying all bars, malls, restaurants, take-aways and beauty parlours have been ordered closed as the number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 190. Supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies and other private health stores can remain open. Earlier Friday, the Greek ministry of culture said all archaeological sites and state-run museums would stay shut until at least March 30, citing the extraordinary circumstances. The move was announced after it emerged that several sites had reported shortages of staff and guards because of Covid-19 concerns. Announcing the introduction of the extra measures, health minister Vassillis Kikilis said it was clear that not all Greeks were adhering to restrictions that had been introduced for their protection. \u201cI had said that we would enforce whatever measure was needed to protect our people,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cToday we are extending the measures so as not to enable coronavirus to spread. Firstly, because new cases have appeared. Secondly, because the restrictive measures are not being adhered to.\u201d Of the 190 confirmed cases, 47 are currently hospitalised in isolation wards around the country. The world\u2019s citizens are being put at risk because of a lack of leadership, according to the former UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, writing today for the Guardian. Brown also called for much greater collaboration on a global scale to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, asking: Why is there, as yet, no internationally coordinated medical project \u2013 equivalent to the wartime Manhattan Project \u2013 mobilising all available global resources to discover a coronavirus vaccine and to fast-track a cure? Brown also takes aim at a familiar opponent, populism, writing that the very idea of global collaboration \u2013 and the convening of what would be a \u201cvirtual\u201d G20 \u2013 sits uneasily with what he describes as the \u201cAmerica first\u201d, \u201cChina first\u201d, \u201cIndia first\u201d and \u201cRussia first\u201d populist nationalism of recent years. The outbreak in Venezuela ( which earlier confirmed its first two cases of coronavirus) could hardly come at a worse time for Venezuela, which despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil, reports Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogota. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. The country\u2019s health services are among the hardest hit by the crisis, with hospitals regularly facing power outages while basic supplies - from latex gloves to routine antibiotics - are often hard to come by. 4.5m people have fled Venezuela, with health care workers and disease specialists among them. Around 3.4 percent of confirmed coronavirus patients have died, according to the World Health Organization, a rate that analysts say would likely be much higher in Venezuela. \u201cJust one case in a hospital could lead to transmission within the system, putting already sick patients at risk,\u201d Kathleen Page, associate professor and medical doctor at Johns Hopkins University, and Tamara Taraciuk Broner, a Venezuela expert at Human Rights Watch, wrote this week in Foreign Policy. \u201cThere is no capacity for complex care due to a lack of basic X-rays, laboratory tests, intensive care beds, and respirators.\u201d Yesterday, Venezuela\u2019s president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared a health emergency ahead of any confirmed cases of Covid-19, banning flights from Europe and neighbouring Colombia. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau - whose wife tested positive for Covid-19 following a trip to the UK - has told a press conference that he has no symptoms of the coronavirus and he is feeling good. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau announced Thursday evening that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and plans to remain in isolation for the next two weeks. Her symptoms have been described as mild. He said that Canada is looking to reduce the number of airports receiving visitors from overseas The leading German business daily, Handelsblatt, is reporting that Lufthansa, the nation\u2019s flagship airline, will apply to the German government\u2019s multibillion liquidity fund for help due to the financial fallout from the coronavirus. In an internal video message to employees, the airline\u2019s CEO, Carten Spohr, said the company would look to the German government for help, as well as entering discussions with governments in the other countries where it has a subsidiary, about possible state aid. A spokesman for the company, Europe\u2019s largest-grossing airline, which last week announced it would cut the number of its flights by 50% in response to the health crisis, confirmed the reports. Apple\u2019s worldwide developer\u2019s conference, the company\u2019s biggest annual event where it reveals the changes heading its software over the coming year, will be online only for the first time, it said today. \u201cThe current health situation has required that we create a new WWDC 2020 format,\u201d said Phil Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. The company is avoiding the word \u201ccancellation\u201d, instead the press that this year\u2019s even, which will take place in June, \u201cwill take on an entirely new online format packed with content for consumers, press and developers alike\u201d. The event the phone-buying public will be most interested in, the keynote speech that launches the conference, has been streamed live online for several years. But behind the scenes, WWDC is an important annual occurrence for the community of developers who work on iOS and macOS apps, offering them their only real chance for face-to-face conversations with Apple staff. Apple is also committing $1m to local organisations in San Jose, where the conference would have taken place, to offset revenue loss. Security forces in Iran are to empty the streets of cities across Iran in the next 24 hours in a drive to fight the spread of the new coronavirus, according to state television. The move came as the World Health Organization (WHO) said Iran needed to do more to contain the disease. Tehran has recorded 514 people killed and 11,364 diagnosed infections, making Iran one of the worst affected countries outside China. Iranian officials have repeatedly complained that many Iranians have ignored calls to stay home and avoid travel, Reuters reports. \u201cOur law enforcement and security committees, along with the interior ministry and provincial governors, will be clearing shops, streets and roads,\u201d state TV cited Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri as saying at a meeting about the virus. \u201cThis will take place in the next 24 hours.\u201d Back at the WHO press conference and Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies program, has said that each country must decide on measures to protect its own population. As part of an overall strategy there is a place inside national borders for restricting movement. Earlier, he compared the pandemic to the way in which HIV was treated, where those who had tested positive were in a position to protect others. Berlin\u2019s mayor, Michael M\u00fcller has announced that the German capital\u2019s public transport system is to be drastically scaled back to an \u201cemergency service\u201d in line with other measures to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, and in order to protect its staff and passengers. Buses and trams will run a skeletal service from now on, until at least until the end of the easter holiday, with passengers asked to enter buses by the middle door, rather than the front. Tickets will have to be bought in advance because they will no longer be available from the driver. So far no plans have been publicised over whether the S-Bahn train service which runs through the city, is to be scaled down. Unlike the rest of the transport network, it is owned and operated by the national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn. A press conference later today will follow a meeting ofBerlin\u2019s senate place this afternoon is expected to make more details known. Demand for public transport has already fallen, over fears of getting coronavirus. And with schools, kindergartens and most institutions either closed or due to close on Monday, and many people working from home, it is expected demand will further decrease in the coming days. Meanwhile Deutsche Bahn has said while it has no plans to curtail its train service, passengers with tickets for journeys they now no longer feel able to take, will be able to rebook journeys at a later date at no extra cost. Mixed messages have been coming out of Mexico today, where health experts expect localised spread of coronavirus to begin in the last week or March or first week of April, according to reports. By then, health officials say the country will have 20,000 tests ready to go, and private and public labs across the country prepped for testing. So far, Mexico has 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 with no deaths. The biggest threat still lies from people already infected entering the country, which is why the government is considering introducing travel restrictions and extra surveillance on travellers from the US. \u201cThe possible flow of coronavirus would come from the north to the south. If it were technically necessary, we would consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance,\u201d the deputy health secretary, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, told a news conference last night. \u201cMexico wouldn\u2019t bring the virus to the United States, rather the United States would bring it here.\u201d On the other hand, in response to Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban on 26 European countries, US-bound passengers flying on the national airline, Aeromexico, will from today be required to spend 14 days in Mexico before taking a connecting flight. The airline had already imposed a similar rule for passengers travelling from China. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the announcement unleashed furious reactions on social media with some tweeters accusing the government of prioritising American lives over Mexicans. Europe is now the world centre for the coronavirus outbreak, according to the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. In a press briefing at WHO headquarters, he said that Europe had more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined apart from China. The UK government\u2019s coronavirus strategy and the plan to build up herd immunity is facing mounting growing criticism from the scientific community. More experts are questioning the failure to test more suspected cases and the decision to hold back on the more drastic social distancing measures introduced in many other countries. Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at Edinburgh University, says the UK strategy is \u201cdangerous\u201d. Peter Drobac, a doctor in global health and infectious disease at Oxford University, says the \u201cthe UK is really out on a limb\u201d. Speaking to the BBC he added: They waited too long to respond, and we really have to question the wisdom of the idea that we can time social distancing interventions just right to blunt the peak. They are taking an approach which puts them alone in the world. And I think it\u2019s a gamble. The broadcaster and physicists Prof Brian Cox tweeted his doubts about the lack of testing. Professor Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization, outlined his concerns about the herd immunity strategy in a Twitter thread. Schools in England should be remain open until the government calls for their closure, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, told a conference of head teachers. \u201cIn the overwhelming majority of situations, there is absolutely no need to close a school or send pupils or staff home. Obviously there is action to be taken in the event of a positive test but even then, your local health protection team can help stabilise the situation,\u201d Williamson told the annual conference of the Association of School and College Leaders in Birmingham. \u201cAt present we are clear that the best course of action is to keep schools open unless you are advised to close by Public Health England. \u201cThe chief medical officer has said the impact of closing schools on children\u2019s education will be substantial, but the benefit to public health would not be. The government is particularly mindful of the strain on public services like the NHS that would be caused by key workers having to stay home to look after their children as a result of school closures. \u201cWe will be constantly reassessing this position based on what the chief medical officer and the government chief scientific adviser tell us about whether the evidence would require us to close schools in the best interests of children and the best interests of teachers. Only in line with this clear advice will we take this step.\u201d The Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has tested negative for the coronavirus, his son told Fox News on Friday following media reports that his father, who recently met with Donald Trump, had tested positive. \u201cThe test is negative,\u201d Eduardo Bolsonaro told Fox News Channel in an interview. The news follows some confusion today after local media in Brazil reported that Bolsonaro had tested positive. Bolsonaro himself has lashed out on Twitter at \u201cfake news\u201d. Switzerland has announced it is closing all schools and is to provide around 10bn Swiss francs in aid for businesses hit by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe situation is difficult,\u201d the Swiss president, Simonetta Sommaruga, told reporters, as the government listed a range of measures to halt the spread of the virus after the number of positive tests in the country ballooned to more than 1,000. Local elections have been postponed until May next year in England. The contest were due to be held in May for 118 councils in England along with eight posts for directly elected mayors, including for the mayor of London. A councillor in an English village where one of the first UK cases of coronavirus was confirmed has described the government\u2019s strategy of tackling the disease as \u201ca crime against our country\u201d. Samantha Flower, who is a member of the Conservative party and a social care manager for Sheffield City council, said: \u201cI\u2019m very concerned. They [the UK government] are saying they want as many people to get this disease to create a herd immunisation. But it won\u2019t. My suspicion is that they don\u2019t have the money for social care or NHS so that the weak and the old die. \u201cI\u2019m saying that as a Conservative councillor and I don\u2019t care if I get sacked. You judge a society by how they treat their vulnerable people. You judge leadership by how it treats its most vulnerable people. \u201cHow do we care for them \u2013 by saying it would be better for pretty much everyone to get this disease when we know that our loved ones are going to die? It\u2019s not OK.\u201d Flower is a Conservative councillor on High Peak borough council and represents the Derbyshire village of Burbage, where one of the first known UK cases of Coronavirus was confirmed. Burbage primary school and a nearby medical centre were temporarily closed after a parent tested positive for the virus on 27 February, when just 15 cases had been confirmed in the UK. She added: \u201cWe could follow the World Health Organization\u2019s advice and stop this now but the government\u2019s chosen not to. Our prime minister has just said to us \u2018your loved ones are going to die\u2019 and that\u2019s not OK. It\u2019s abhorrent. It\u2019s a crime against our country. We have the measures and capabilities to prevent this. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be an alarmist but the World Health Organization has set very comprehensive guidance and we\u2019re not following it.\u201d The global death toll of the coronavirus pandemic has passed 5,000, according to tallies kept by both Johns Hopkins university in the US and the Reuters news agency. Both source their information from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. Spain has become the latest country to declare a state of emergency after the number of confirmed cases in the country passed 4,200 and the death toll rose to 120. Spain is the second-worst affected EU country after Italy. The president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, tested positive on an initial coronavirus test, but his son cautioned against the press jumping to conclusions. Reports claimed the White House was to hold an emergency meeting on the diagnosis after Bolsonaro dined with Trump last week. In Britain, 208 more cases of coronavirus have been detected since yesterday, bringing the total number of confirmed Covid-19 patients to 798 \u2013 a rise of 35%. There have been 10 deaths so far from the virus in the UK. The Queen has cancelled forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden, London, as a sensible precaution amid the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, as a driver on the London underground transport network tested positive for Covid-19. A number of sports fixtures have been cancelled or postponed, including the Champions League and Europa League, England\u2019s cricket tour of Sri Lanka, the Masters golf tournament, and all professional football in England and Scotland. France limited public gatherings to no more than 100 people, as countries around Europe brought in a range of stringent measures in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. The first cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Venezuela, where the country\u2019s healthcare system has already been under massive strain in recent years. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said that the country is suspending classes at public and private schools starting on Monday, Reuters reports. \u201cEarly today, two cases were certified,\u201d Rodriguez said in a televised statement. \u201cOne 41-year-old citizen was traveling in the United States. The other was traveling in Spain.\u201d The two both arrived on a flight from Spain and both have been put in quarantine, she said. This is Ben Quinn picking up the liveblog now.

A statement said: As a sensible precaution and for practical reasons in the current circumstances, changes are being made to The Queen\u2019s diary commitments in the coming weeks. In consultation with the Medical Household and Government, Her Majesty\u2019s forthcoming visits to Cheshire and Camden will be rescheduled. Audiences will continue as usual. Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice. The death toll of the global coronavirus pandemic has passed 5,000 since the virus was first identified in December, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins university. The site, which has been running an interactive map showing the number of infections reported around the world, reports 5,065 deaths so far, out of 136,929 confirmed cases. The total number of patients that have recovered from the disease is 69,623, Johns Hopkins reports. The region with the highest death toll so far is the Hubei province of China, where the Covid-19 disease first emerged, with 3,062 deaths, followed by Italy, Europe\u2019s worst affected nation, with 1,016 deaths, then Iran with 514 deaths. All figures are those officially reported. Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Eduardo, has tweeted to say that his father\u2019s coronavirus test is not yet complete. It appears that although Bolsonaro\u2019s initial test has come back positive, he is awaiting the results of a second, definitive test. Meanwhile, however, the Fox Business network is reporting that the White House is due to hold an urgent meeting on Bolsonaro\u2019s positive coronavirus test. The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Scotland increased to 85 in the latest daily figure, an increase of 25 from yesterday, Aamna Mohdin reports. A total of 3,314 Scottish tests have been carried out, of which 3,229 tests were confirmed negative. Greater Glasgow and Clyde had the largest number of positive cases, 21, followed by Lothian with 20 cases. The increase in positive cases follows the government\u2019s advice to cancel events with over 500 people to reduce the potential impact on emergency services. The figures come as the Scottish Conservatives cancelled their spring conference due to the coronavirus pandemic. The event was due to take place in Perth in mid-May, but will now be moved to later in the year. Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said: It\u2019s become clear we have no option but to postpone the party conference that was planned for May. The same goes for a party convention that was due to go ahead later in March. Wales\u2019 Six Nations game at home against Scotland on Saturday became the latest sport event to be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The announcement comes just hours after the Welsh Rugby Union insisted earlier on Friday the game would \u201cgo ahead as planned\u201d. The organisers of the Boston Marathon have announced that the event is to be postponed until 14 September. The Spanish government is to declare a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus epidemic, paving the way for drastic containment measures after the number of confirmed cases in the country passed 4,200 and the death toll rose to 120, Sam Jones reports from Madrid. In an urgent appearance on Friday afternoon, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the cabinet would convene on Saturday to declare an emergency by activating article 116 of the constitution. Its provisions allow the government to limit the movement of people and vehicles in specified places, to temporarily requisition goods, to take over factories and businesses, to ration the consumption of basic items, and to issue the necessary orders to ensure the provision of services. The article has not been used since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers\u2019 strike. The state of emergency will initially apply for two weeks, but can be extended with parliamentary approval. Spain is the European country most affected by the outbreak after Italy, which has confirmed 15,000 cases and more than 1,000 deaths. The decision came after the government of neighbouring Portugal also enacted a state of alert as the number of cases in the country reached 78, explaining the situation was now \u201ca fight for our survival and for the protection of Portuguese lives\u201d. As well as ordering the closure of schools and universities, it said the number of customers allowed in bars and restaurants would be reduced. The Madrid authorities have not ruled out a lockdown of the capital, the mayor said on Friday morning, as the number of cases in the region reached 2,000. Jos\u00e9 Luia Mart\u00ednez-Almeida told Antena 3 TV that he had not discarded the idea of locking down the city, saying it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d not to look at every possible scenario. He added: \u201cWe can\u2019t say that it\u2019s going to happen immediately, nor can we say we\u2019ve ruled it out.\u201d The mayor also suspended licenses for terraces and seating areas outside bars and caf\u00e9s in the capital, urging owners to shut them down before it became mandatory. The mayor said \u201cstricter measures would be needed\u201d to halt the spread of the virus, adding that children\u2019s play areas in parks would be closed from Friday. Hours earlier, authorities in the Basque country had activated a civil protection plan, which allows the regional government to order the confinement of people to stop the spread of the disease. \u201cWe need to use all containment and prevention measures as the situation is serious. We\u2019re not over the worst yet,\u201d the Basque president, I\u00f1igo Urkullu, said on Friday morning. The Basque country has confirmed 346 cases of the coronavirus, and here have been 11 deaths. On Thursday night, the regional government of Catalonia ordered around 70,000 people in four municipalities in the Barcelona region to remain in their homes for a fortnight after a steep increase in Coronavirus cases in the area. Igualada, Vilanova del Cam\u00ed, Santa Margarida de Montbui and \u00d2dena have been placed in lockdown after the number of cases linked to a hospital in Igualada rose to 58 on Thursday. \u201cNo one is allowed out of these affected areas,\u201d the regional government said on Thursday evening. \u201cOnly emergency personnel and vehicles bringing fuel and food supplies will be allowed to move around the area.\u201d The move comes almost a week after neighbourhoods in a small town in the northern region of La Rioja were placed in lockdown after a cluster of cases was traced to a funeral in the nearby Basque Country. Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is now warning against all but essential travel to the regions that the Spanish Ministry of Health have designated as areas of community transmission of coronavirus. They are Madrid and La Rioja, and the municipalities of La Bastida and Vitoria (both in the Basque Country) and Miranda de Ebro (in Castilla y Le\u00f3n). Augusta National has not ruled out hosting the Masters later in 2020 after postponing the first major of the year, as scheduled for April, Ewan Murray reports. A statement issued from the club on Friday followed the model of the PGA Tour, which scrapped the Players Championship after just 18 holes and three subsequent tournaments. The Masters, which began in 1934, has been contested each year since the end of the second world war. Care homes across the United Kingdom are banning visits from friends and family and keeping residents indoors in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus, Amelia Hill reports. The government has not told care providers to shut their doors to all non-essential visits but the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, chair of the Commons health and social care committee, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday he was \u201cpersonally surprised that we\u2019re still allowing external visits to care homes\u201d. Mario Kreft, the chair of Care Forum Wales, which represents more than 450 care and nursing homes, advised people on Thursday morning to stay away. \u201cSimply put, not visiting care homes is likely to save people\u2019s lives,\u201d Kreft said. He called for bureaucracy to be cut so older people who no longer needed hospital care could be transferred to care homes, freeing up hospital beds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything that we can to ensure that people are safe, and I would say this to anybody who wants to visit a loved one in a care home to think very, very carefully because totally accidentally, this virus could be transmitted,\u201d he said. The Jack Ma Foundation, the charitable foundation set up by the founder of Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, has announced plans to donate 500,000 testing kits and a million masks to the US. Ma said in a tweet: Drawing from my own country\u2019s experience, speedy and accurate testing and adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals are most effective in preventing the spread of the virus. We hope that our donation can help Americans fight against the pandemic\u201d The foundation has already helped sourcing and delivering materials to combat Covid-19 to other countries suffering outbreaks, including South Korea, Italy and Iran. Ma\u2019s donation follows the purchase of 31 tons of medical supplies from China by the Italian government, which arrived in Rome early this morning. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau tested positive for Covid-19 just over a week after a high-profile event in London where she was filmed hugging the singer Leona Lewis and kissing the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, Matthew Weaver reports. The wife of the Canadian prime minister was also photographed at the Wembley Arena We Day event on 4 March alongside the F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the actor Idris Elba. Four days later, Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau went to an International Women\u2019s Day party attended by the former supreme court president Lady Hale. It is feared Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau may have contracted the virus during her London trip. She reported feeling unwell following her return to Canada earlier this week. The University of Oxford has announced that it has six students who have tested positive for Covid-19, and that it may switch to \u201cmore extensive use of technology for teaching and assessment\u201d next term. The university said in a statement: To date, six students have been diagnosed positive for coronavirus at the University. All are receiving all necessary support and medical attention and are recovering well. The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Louise Richardson, has now written to all staff and students to outline new measuresdesigned to ensure the University remains open and operational as far as possible while following the latest public health advice. The measures include advice to all UK undergraduates to return home as soon as possible after the end of term today, unless there is a compelling reason to stay in Oxford. The move is designed to reduce the pressure on colleges and academic departments. Accommodation is being made available for those students who are unable to return home. The small number of exams which were due over the Easter break have all been cancelled or rearranged. Students have been notified and will be kept informed as new arrangements are made Comprehensive and detailed contingency plans are also being drawn up for the next University term, including more extensive use of technology for teaching and assessment. The University will update staff and students when these plans are finalised shortly. Formula One has called off the Bahrain and Vietnamese Grand Prix after the cancellation of Sunday\u2019s Australian season-opener due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Guardian sports desk reports. Bahrain, the second race on the calendar which was due to take place on Sunday 22 March, had already been scheduled to be run without spectators under floodlights at the Sakhir circuit. Vietnam\u2019s first Formula One Grand Prix had been scheduled for 5 April on the streets of Hanoi as the third round of the season. Both races have now been postponed just over 12 hours after the Australian Grand Prix was officially abandoned following a positive coronavirus test from a McLaren team member. According to the latest figures from the Department of Health, there are now 798 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, 208 more than yesterday. Update: Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s son, Eduardo, has tweeted to say that his father\u2019s coronavirus test is not yet complete The president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for coronavirus, according to local media. The reports of a positive test come after Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary was found to have the disease following a trip to the US. His son Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman who was also on the trip, tweeted that his father \u201cis not exhibiting any signs of the disease\u201d Bolsonaro dined with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night and videos and photos, including some on Wajngarten\u2019s own Instagram account, showed the press secretary, Bolsonaro and Trump all in close proximity. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. Bolsonaro has downplayed the crisis. On Wednesday, he said \u201cOther flus kill more than this\u201d and has also called concern over coronavirus \u201coversized\u201d. Romania\u2019s interim prime minister, Ludovic Orban, announced on Friday that he and other senior party leaders were going into a 14-day self-imposed quarantine after a party colleague tested positive for coronavirus, Kit Gillet reports. The senator, Vergil Chitac, had attended a recent party leadership meeting. Orban also announced that all ministers in his cabinet would be tested for the virus, and would remain isolated in their offices in order to avoid direct contact with others. He recommended that journalists be tested, too. As of Friday afternoon, Romania had 73 confirmed cases of the virus, with no fatalities. Six individual have been discharged from hospital. Schools have already been cancelled across the country, with events of over 100 people banned and museums shut. On Friday, the Romanian Football Federation announced that it was suspending all games until the end of the month. Authorities in France are tightening controls on mass gatherings, limiting numbers to no more than 100, after previously saying no more than a 1,000 would be allowed. The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, told TF1 television that the new limit would come into force immediately. The idea is that we can slow the progression and the circulation of the virus 100 people - that means that there will inevitably be signficant consequences for the theatres and the cinemas. The coronavirus has killed 61 people in France and infected 2,876, according to figures released by the health ministry late on Thursday. Austria has just announced it is following Italy in closing almost all shops except for supermarkets and chemists, Kate Connolly reports. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that the communities of Paznautal and St Anton would be placed under quarantine. The coronavirus epidemic is causing inreased stress and anxiety, particularly among people with existing mental health problems, practitioners and campaigners have said, Jessica Murray and Harriet Sherwood report. Reactions to the crisis can include feeling overwhelmed, fearful, sad, angry and helpless, according to experts. Some people may have difficulty sleeping or concentrating. Fear of contact with others, travelling on public transport or going into public spaces may increase, and some people will have physical symptoms, such as an increased heart rate or upset stomach. The World Health Organization has acknowledged that the crisis is generating stress, and has advised people to avoid watching, reading or listening to news that causes feelings of anxiety or distress. Stephen Buckley, of the mental health charity Mind, said: \u201cWe know that the coronavirus and its impact are causing stress and worry for many people. If you already have a mental health problem, it\u2019s possible that the worries of coronavirus may be affecting how you\u2019re coping.\u201d Anyone from anywhere in the world arriving in Malta will have to undergo two weeks of mandatory self-quarantine, the country\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, announced on Friday. Anyone breaking the order will face a \u20ac1,000 fine for each breach, the Times of Malta reports. Police will carry out spot checks to ensure that the quarantine is observed. The paper quoted Abela as saying: If someone breaches it every day of the quarantine, then they will have to pay \u20ac14,000. We will not tolerate people not abiding by quarantine terms. Malta closed all schools, universities and childcare centres earlier this week. Cyprus has been told that a much-anticipated trip to the island by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall next week will be postponed because of the global pandemic, Helena Smith reports. The royals were due to spend three days in the former British colony in a tour that also included visits to Bosnia and Jordan. It was to be the first royal visit since Queen Elizabeth\u2019s trip to Cyprus in 1993. A Clarence House spokesman said: Owing to the unfolding situation with the coronavirus pandemic, the British government has asked Their Royal Highnesses to postpone their spring tour to Bosnia, Cyprus and Jordan. Health authorities in Cyprus\u2019s internationally recognised southern sector have confirmed 14 cases of coronavirus so far. Another five more have been announced in the island\u2019s breakaway Turkish-run north, bringing the total to 19 islandwide. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, believes more needs to be done to coordinate international action on tackling the coronavirus, his official spokesman has said, Heather Stewart, the Guardian\u2019s political editor, reports. In a briefing to reporters on Friday, his spokesman said: The prime minister believes that this is a crisis which affects countries around the globe, and does require a global response. He added that Johnson has discussed the handling of the outbreak with presidents Macron and Trudeau in the past few days, and will hold more talks with leaders today. Former chancellor Alistair Darling told the BBC\u2019s Today on Friday that he was concerned about the lack of coordination. He said: One of the reasons that the global economy recovered 10 years ago was because of international cooperation. We all did the same thing, from communist China to republican-led United States, international cooperation at the moment is in something of short supply. A civil protection plan has been activated by I\u00f1igo Urkullu, the president of the Basque country, which allows the Spanish region\u2019s government to order the confinement of people to stop the spread of the disease. \u201cWe need to use all containment and prevention measures as the situation is serious. We\u2019re not over the worst yet,\u201d Urkullu said on Friday morning. The Basque country has confirmed 346 cases of the coronavirus, and here have been 11 deaths. Separately Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) warned against all but essential travel to the regions that the Spanish Ministry of Health have designated as areas of community transmission of coronavirus. They are Madrid and La Rioja, and the municipalities of La Bastida and Vitoria (both in the Basque Country) and Miranda de Ebro (in Castilla y Le\u00f3n). In Scotland, launch events for the Edinburgh International Festival have been cancelled and Scottish football authorities have postponed the rest of the season, following advice from the Scottish government to scrap large gatherings above 500 people. The Edinburgh International Festival announced it will cancel all gatherings associated with its 2020 programme launch, initially set to run from 18th to 25th of March in Edinburgh and London. Instead the Festival is creating a digital event to be broadcast live on 18th March, 12pm on its Facebook page. Fergus Linehan, festival director at Edinburgh International Festival, said: \u201cAt this point, the Festival is almost 5 months away. For now we remain committed to running the International Festival as planned. In hope that the pandemic will be curbed by August, we must continue to provide security for our artists and for our sector. \u201cWe hope that in August, our Festival will provide a much-needed moment of joy after what will have been a challenging summer. To reassure our audiences, we have also revised our refunds policy to offer anyone with Coronavirus related concerns a ticket refund.\u201d The Scottish FA and Scottish Professional Football League announced the postponement of this weekend\u2019s and following midweek\u2019s fixtures, starting with tonight\u2019s Premiership match between Motherwell and Aberdeen and the Championship match between Queen of the South and Ayr United. The suspension will also affect non-professional and grassroots games until further notice, Ian Maxwell, Scottish FA chief executive said. Ethiopia has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, Agence-France Presse reports, shortly after Kenya became the first east African country to report a case of the disease. A 48-year-old Japanese man who had arrived in the country on 4 March 4 from Burkina Faso was confirmed to have contracted the virus, the French news agency reported the Ethiopian health ministry as saying. He is undergoing medical follow-up and is in a stable condition. Those who have been in contact with this person are being traced and quarantined. PA Media reports that a school in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, has been closed due to a case of coronavirus. Lanark Grammar school in Lanark was closed by South Lanarkshire Council and NHS Lanarkshire. Dr John Logan, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in public health medicine, said: We would like to reassure all staff and parents that the risk of contracting coronavirus from this individual is very low. Our public health team is in the process of identifying and contacting the limited number of people who were in very close contact with the confirmed case and issuing public health advice. We want to reassure these teachers and parents - and indeed everyone at this time - that they should follow the most up-to-date healthcare advice, which can be found on the NHS Inform website. We would like to thank everyone at the school for their cooperation and support. We are working towards reopening the school on Monday. Tony McDaid, executive director for education at South Lanarkshire council, said: The health and safety of our staff and young people are of paramount importance to us. As soon as we were notified of this matter we immediately met with NHS Lanarkshire\u2019s public health officials and agreed that to close temporarily as a precaution would be the most appropriate step to take. We of course regret the inconvenience this will cause but hope parents, carers and others will understand our reasons for this course of action and fully support our decision. We will keep all parents, staff and teachers updated during this period. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has advised Britons against all but essential travel to Madrid and some other regions of Spain. We are advising against all but essential travel to the regions of Madrid, La Rioja and the municipalities of La Bastida, Vitoria and Miranda de Ebro. Airlines are continuing to run flights as normal to and from these areas. Turkey has announced its second confirmed case of Covid-19, two days after the virus finally reached the tourism and travel hub, Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, reports. The new patient is a relative of the first, who contracted the novel coronavirus after a visit to Europe. Both are in isolation and are in a stable condition, health minister Fahrettin Koca said on Friday morning. The new case follows extra measures announced Thursday evening by Ibrahim Kalin, a senior aide to president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to contain the spread of the virus. Turkey\u2019s spring school holiday will be moved up one week to 16 March, after which there will be at least one week of online remote teaching. Universities will also be closed for at least three weeks from Monday and all sports events will take place without spectators until the end of April. Turkey, a tourist hub linking Europe and western Asia, had around 50 million visitors last year. It also hosts the largest number of refugees in the world, including some 3.5 million Syrians. Aid agencies have warned of possibly catastrophic consequences if the coronavirus reaches vulnerable undocumented and refugee populations in the region. Hospitals in Istanbul and the capital Ankara have been set up to test and quarantine patients suspected of having the virus. The border with Iran, one of the worst affected countries, remains shut, and flights to several destinations with high rates of infection were cancelled last month. International travel for public servants is now under review. On Thursday, Kalin also advised against all travel excluding extraordinary circumstances and 14-day self-quarantine on return to Turkey for all citizens and foreigners. Erdo\u011fan is still set to meet with his German and French counterparts in Istanbul next Tuesday, as well as possibly Boris Johnson, for talks on the fighting in Syria\u2019s Idlib province. In her inaugural speech, Greece\u2019s first female president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, has urged citizens to comply with the emergency measures announced by health authorities to stem the spread of coronavirus, reports Helena Smith in Athens. Speaking after taking the oath of office in a ceremony dominated by Covid-19, the progressive former high court judge singled out the pandemic, underlying the risk it posed especially for the elderly. \u201cWe are called upon, as an absolute priority, to effectively confront the recent coronavirus pandemic which is a real danger for older citizens,\u201d she told the nation emphasising that the restrictions were vital \u201cso as not to sow panic and prompt the collapse of the health system\u201d. Sakellaropoulou, who was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of MPS when she was nominated for the post in January, was sworn in before an almost empty chamber as parliamentarians, in line with a government ban on mass gatherings, stayed away. There were no handshakes in a ceremony depicted on state-run TV as being both swift and subdued, if also emotionally charged. Greek health authorities have so far declared 117 confirmed Coronavirus cases and one death. The country was among the first in Europe to shut schools and universities. On Thursday, after revealing the fatality, the government announced that cinemas, theatres, gyms and nightclubs would also be closed. A 66-year- old man, who contracted the virus during a tour of religious sites in Israel and Egypt, died after waging a week-long battle for his life in a hospital in the western port city of Patras. Michelle O\u2019Neill, Northern Ireland\u2019s deputy first minister, has broken ranks with government colleagues and urged the immediate closure of schools and colleges to slow coronavirus, reports Rory Carroll in Dublin. The Sinn F\u00e9in member said the region should buck the decision by Boris Johnson to keep UK education facilities open and instead emulate Ireland\u2019s shutdown. O\u2019Neill said: People are rightly concerned about the impacts on their families and their children and as a parent, I share those concerns and I have been contacted by many parents who did not send their children to school this morning. To protect the public, schools and colleges should now be closed. There has been contradictory medical evidence and in that context my view is that we should err on the side of caution. On Thursday, Sinn F\u00e9in agreed with the decision to keep schools open but the example south of the border, and restrictions announced by sporting clubs and churches, paved a U-turn. Earlier on Friday, Arlene Foster, the first minister and leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said schools would need to close but at a later, unspecified date. Northern Ireland has recorded 20 cases of Covid-19. The split happened hours before the publication of an official report into the cash-for-ash scandal that is expected to censure Foster. From Monday, almost no-one will be allowed to enter or leave the Czech Republic, as it effectively closes its borders in response to the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the world. According to a report on expats.cz, all foreign nationals without residence will be barred from entering, while all Czech citizens and holders of residence permits will be barred from leaving. The only exceptions to the ban will be Czech nationals and holders of residence permits returning to the country - although they may face quarantine - and those who live within 50km of the borders with Austria and Germany and work in those countries. A further 13 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 38, Public Health Wales has announced. On Friday Dr Robin Howe, incident director for the Covid-19 outbreak response at PHW, said the new cases include four people in the Caerphilly area and two in the Swansea area, the Press Association reported. Dr Howe said: All patients are being managed in clinically appropriate settings based on the assessment of a specialist infectious disease consultant.\u201d Public Health Wales is working with our partners in the Welsh Government, the wider NHS in Wales, and others now that we have entered the delay phase of the UK Coronavirus action plan. This is now not just an attempt to contain the disease, as far as possible, but to delay its spread\u201d Kate Connolly, our correspondent in Berlin, reports that 3,000 people in Germany now have coronavirus. Six people have so far died. Berlin, Bavaria and two other states are the first to announce the blanket closure of schools and kindergartens. Two others, the worst-hit state of North Rhein Westphalia where over 1,000 are infected, and Rheinland Pfalz, are expected to make similar decisions later today. Michael M\u00fcller, the mayor of Berlin, said public transport is also due to be reduced to a minimum. In the Bundestag legislation has been passed this morning allowing companies to access compensation if they put their employees on so-called \u2018Kurzarbeit\u2019 or reduced working hours, enabling them to continue paying them their full wage. The law in all its detail will be fully enacted within the next ten days. \u201cWe will not leave anyone alone,\u201d Olaf Scholz, the finance minister said. In addition Scholz and the economics minister Peter Altmaier are planning billions of Euros of liquidity help for businesses, in an effort to protect firms and jobs. Meanwhile the German Football League, the DFL has announced that Bundesliga and second league matches will be halted from next Tuesday until 2 April. Matches this weekend will continue to take place, but without spectators. This morning at a regular press conference which the head of the Robert Koch Institute, the leading public health and safety body in Germany has been holding for the past two and a half weeks, its director, Lothar Wieler said public health bodies had three aims in their attempts to tackle the virus. To try to \u2018level off\u2019 the epidemic curve, to ensure the most seriously ill don\u2019t end up having to be hospitalised at the same time. To try to speed up the adaptation of hospitals to cope with an increase in intensive care beds and patients who will need respiratory assistance. He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system. To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus. \u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d. Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels. Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress. Ireland is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports Rory Carroll in Dublin. An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles. The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest. \u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement. Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government announced restrictions on Thursday. Harris told a media briefing: People need to remain calm about the food supply. The fear of looting should not arise. We\u2019ve had no looting incidents yet. People have been calm and well-mannered in terms of their shopping. We are there but that\u2019s primarily to provide reassurance and help with traffic flow. The garda training college at Templemore, in county Tipperary, is being considered as a medical centre or quarantine facility. The staff union for the NHS, the GMB, is calling on the UK government to requisition all private hospital beds if more capacity is needed to treat patients seriously ill as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. In a statement, GMB London called on the government to act now to give itself the legal powers it would need to take control of private sector hospitals. Warren Kenny, GMB London regional secretary, said: There are approximately 128,000 overnight beds in the NHS in England. Only a small number of these are intensive care beds. It is not clear what the current numbers are of beds in private sector hospitals but estimates put the figure somewhere in the region of 8,000. Some of these will also be intensive care beds. GMB London know that all sorts of contingency plans will be being drawn up in the background by very capable medical and scientific advisers to deal with the emergency. Some of these plans will involve cooperation with private sector hospitals. However, the Government and their advisers must have available to them the powers to requisition these hospital beds if required to increase capacity to deal with the crisis. In particular, using these beds to divert non-coronavirus-related treatments from NHS hospitals may make sense. This could be particularly the case in London. The electorate will expect the government to be able to mobilise all health capacity - be it public or private - to deal with what the Prime Minister has described as \u2018the worst public health crisis for a generation\u2019. The private health sector cannot be excluded from this mobilisation. UK rail unions are reporting widespread anger among tube workers and loss of trust in the Transport for London management, amid fears over workers\u2019 exposure to infection on the London Underground, Gwyn Topham, the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, reports. The RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: There\u2019s a growing sense of anger amongst tube staff that they are being cut adrift in what is clearly a dangerous front-line environment in terms of the coronavirus spread. We cannot allow this situation to continue and we want an urgent top level summit to address this crisis of confidence. The union will take whatever action is required to protect the well-being and livelihoods of our members. A spokesperson said: Our members have the right to a safe working environment and we will issue guidance to retreat to a place of safety if they think their well-being and personal safety is being compromised. A British woman who died in Bali after contracting coronavirus has been named in Australian media as Kimberley Finlayson. Finlayson died earlier this week in a Bali hospital after coming down with Covid-19 while on holiday with her husband, Ken, who has since tested negative for the virus. She was said to have suffered from a series of pre-existing medical conditions. Sanglah Hospital director, Wayan Sudana told 7NEWS.com.au: \u201cBased on information from Bali Health Agency the laboratory test result of the husband of the Covid-19 patient number 25 are complete. The lab test result is negative.\u201d The Scottish government has opened an advice helpline for businesses following yesterday\u2019s announcement that gatherings over 500 will be advised to cancel from Monday, Aamna Mohdin reports. Economy secretary Fiona Hyslop said the government wrote to all planning authorities this week encouraging them to relax their approach to the enforcement of planning restrictions on shop delivery times and opening hours. Scotland\u2019s football authorities announced they would \u201center discussions\u201d with the Scottish government before deciding whether to postpone matches. In a joint statement, the Scottish Professional Football League and Scottish FA confirmed games would go ahead as planned this weekend. Following the discussion with the Scottish government, the football authorities will \u201cprovide clear and unequivocal advice\u201d on what happens to games from next week. The Scottish FA confirmed they would also take part in a Uefa video conference call on Tuesday to discuss whether Euro 2020 will need to be cancelled. Scotland are due to face Israel in the Uefa Nations League play-off semi-final against Israel on 26 March at Hampden Park. The Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast has been looking at the question of whether the UK National Health Service is fit to tackle the developing coronavirus pandemic. The NHS is bracing for a major surge in hospital admissions as the coronavirus outbreak continues to grow. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, made a firm commitment to helping the NHS get \u201cwhatever it needs\u201d. Denis Campbell, the Guardian\u2019s health policy editor, tells Rachel Humphreys there is genuine concern among staff that the service will not be able to cope in the event of a sustained crisis of the type being seen in Italy. The Premier League, the Football League and the Women\u2019s Super League and Championship have suspended all matches until 3 April in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Paul MacInnes reports. An unprecedented development, it follows the revelation overnight that several Premier League clubs have members of staff, including players and coaches, who are displaying symptoms of the virus. All schools in Croatia are to shut from Monday, the country\u2019s prime minister announced on Friday morning. Andrej Plenkovic told reporters: The whole world is at war with the virus. The responsibility of every citizen is an essential discipline that will affect the spread of the epidemic. I call on everyone to be accountable and to listen carefully to the instructions and to all public health professionals. The headquarters will continue with all its activities as before, twice a day at 9 am and at 4 pm.\u201d Everybody is thinking about closing schools. Our health experts say that a very small percentage of those infected are below the age of 20. But children are especially important, and we will stop teaching from Monday for two weeks. Reuters currently has the country down as having 27 cases, but a reader who sent in details of the schools closures says the most recent figure is 31. From Monday, all schools in the German state of Bavaria will be shut until the end of the Easter holidays on 19 April, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung reports. The five week holiday means almost no child in Bavaria will be able to go to school or kindergarten, with emergency care organised in only a few cases, according to the paper. Bavarian prime minister Markus S\u00f6der also announced that he would ban visits to retirement homes and hospitals and that events with more than 100 visitors would be banned unless they were absolutely necessary. The climbing season on Mount Everest has been called off amid fears over the coronavirus pandemic, Pete Pattisson reports. The Nepal government suspended all mountaineering permits on Thursday and, as we reported earlier, will stop issuing on-arrival tourist visas, dealing a devastating blow to the country\u2019s tourism industry. Nepal\u2019s tourism minister Yogesh Bhattarai told the Guardian, \u201cWe will review the decision if the situation improves, but for now everything has been cancelled. Those who have paid for climbing permits will be refunded.\u201d The Chinese government has also cancelled all expeditions from the north side of Everest. The announcement comes as Nepal enters its peak tourist season when tens of thousands of trekkers and mountaineers were expected to test themselves among the highest mountains in the world. Trekking and climbing are a lucrative and vital source of revenue for Nepal. Last year the government earned over \u00a33.5 million from issuing climbing permits on peaks above 6000 metres, including Everest. Despite its impact, the decision appears to have the support of the tourism industry. Mingma Sherpa, the director of Seven Summit Treks, Nepal\u2019s biggest and arguably most successful expedition company, supported the move. \u201cNo doubt our business will suffer but who will be responsible if the virus spreads on the mountain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mountain is here, it\u2019s not moving anywhere. People can come and climb next year.\u201d Nuru Janbu Sherpa, the CEO of International Sherpa Adventure, a trekking and expedition company said, \u201cIt\u2019s a positive decision as it will help to contain the spread of the virus. If waiting six months helps to protect people, we have no problem with suspending our business.\u201d However, Sherpa warned that the decision will hit many low wage labourers who depend on climbing for their livelihood. The mountaineering industry in Nepal has suffered a series of setbacks in recent years. Climbing on Everest was effectively called off following an avalanche in 2014 and the 2015 earthquake. Last year, the government was widely criticised for failing to manage the huge numbers of climbers on the peak, which some claimed contributed to the deaths of 11 mountaineers. Nepal has had just one confirmed case of the coronavirus, said Basu Dev Pandey, the director of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease hospital in Kathmandu, but he warned the country was at risk due its location between China and India. In a further blow to the economy, last week Qatar barred entry to travellers from 14 countries, including Nepal, leaving tens of thousands of migrant labourers unable to start work in the emirate. Almost 30% of Nepal\u2019s GDP comes from remittances sent by its migrant workers, who are largely based in the Gulf and Malaysia. PA Media has more details on the London underground train driver who has tested positive for coronavirus. The man, who works on the tube\u2019s Jubilee Line, has been off work this week after returning to the UK from holiday in Vietnam, sources told the news agency. An internal message to staff said the driver, based at the North Greenwich depot, had been self-isolating but had tested positive for Covid-19. The memo said: The operator is receiving support from health services and is continuing to follow Public Health England (PHE) advice to self-isolate. The train operator has recently returned from a trip abroad, where it is thought the illness may have been contracted. Rail union leaders wrote to the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, on Thursday, voicing concern about what advice transport workers are being given. The letter said: We are writing jointly as representatives of workers in the transport industry to implore you to break your silence and give leadership on measures that public transport can take to tackle coronavirus. Transport workers are receiving different advice from different companies - and in some cases even within the same company - about what actions to take in the event of suspected or actual illness. There is concern of \u2018over-managing\u2019 attendance procedures and how they are being applied. Clearly, if someone is told to self-isolate they should not then be penalised by their employer for doing so in the interest of public health, yet this is currently the case in the rail and bus industries. Our privatised transport system is not conducive to swift and co-ordinated responses. There is apparently no consistency across the public transport network in how transport workers will be treated if they fall ill. Companies where employees work side by side with transport workers employed by another company are being treated differently, leading to confusion and frustration. The Scottish government is advising that gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled next week, as the number of positive cases jumps to 60 yesterday. Were you planning on attending an event or a trip that might now not go ahead? If so, please get in touch with the Guardian reporter Aamna Mohdin, who is based in Edinburgh, at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com. Barack Obama is to blame for shortcomings in the United States government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, Donald Trump has said. But not to worry, he has fixed the problems by slashing red tape. In the UK, a hospital left a patient with coronavirus on a ward of critical ill patients while she was being tested, according to a local newspaper report. The Basingstoke Gazette reports that it was told by an employee of Basingstoke and North Hampshire hospital that the woman, who was showing coronavirus symptoms, was moved into a ward with critically unwell women. However, Hampshire NHS Trust says that the reports are completely untrue. According to the paper: The unwell patient remained on the ward around critically ill people for hours until results revealed she had coronavirus. Nurses in normal uniform and without protective gear moved her. The member of staff contacted this newspaper after being appalled by the practice which they claim will lead to a \u2018dangerous spread\u2019 of the disease and warns the hospital is on the brink of an outbreak. Now a patient who was forced to temporarily share the ward with the Covid-19 sufferer is displaying symptoms of the disease. You can read more on the Basingstoke Gazette website. England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka has been officially called off due to the global spread of the coronavirus, Ali Martin reports. The decision was announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board and their Sri Lankan counterparts on Friday morning while Joe Root\u2019s players were out in the middle playing the second day of their final warm-up fixture in Colombo. The two-match series, part of the World Test Championship, was due to start in Galle next Thursday. But with England supporters due to begin travelling out to the island in the coming days, and apparent unease among the squad about the situation, a postponement became inevitable. The World Health Organisation is using its Twitter feed to highlight the important role that women play - often unpaid and unrecognised - in handling outbreaks such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. Uefa has postponed all Champions League and Europa League fixtures next week because of the coronavirus, the Guardian\u2019s sport desk reports. Two Europa League games, those between Sevilla and Roma as well as Inter and Getafe, had already been postponed this week and on Thursday next week\u2019s game between Manchester City and Real Madrid was suspended. On Friday morning the European governing body announced that all games next week had been suspended. Authorities in Madrid, the capital of Spain, have not ruled out a lockdown of the capital, the mayor said on Friday, as the number of cases in the region reached 2,000, Sam Jones reports from the city. Jos\u00e9 Luia Mart\u00ednez-Almeida told Antena 3 TV that he had not discarded the idea of locking downthecity, saying it would be \u201cirresponsible\u201d not to look at every possible scenario. He added: We can\u2019t say that it\u2019s going to happen immediately, nor can we say we\u2019ve ruled it out. The mayor also suspended licenses for terraces and seating areas outside bars and caf\u00e9s in the capital, urging owners to shut them down before it became mandatory. He said \u201cstricter measures would be needed\u201d to halt the spread of the virus, adding that children\u2019s play areas in parks would be closed from Friday. On Thursday night, the regional government of Catalonia ordered around 70,000 people in four municipalities in the Barcelona region to remain in their homes for a fortnight after a steep increase in Coronavirus cases in the area. Igualada, Vilanova del Cam\u00ed, Santa Margarida de Montbui and \u00d2dena have been placed in lockdown after the number of cases linked to a hospital in Igualada rose to 58 on Thursday. The regional government said on Thursday evening: No one is allowed out of these affected areas. Only emergency personnel and vehicles bringing fuel and food supplies will be allowed to move around the area. The move comes almost a week after neighbourhoods in a small town in the northern region of La Rioja were placed in lockdown after a cluster of cases was traced to a funeral in the nearby Basque Country. The government of the Czech Republic has also declared a state of emergency, restricting the opening hours of restaurants and cafes, closing gyms and sports facilities, and requiring people returning from high risk countries to quarantine themselvs. According to a report in Prague Morning, the rules will permit restaurants and cafes to open only between 6am and 8pm, while refreshments at shopping centres will be banned altogether. Those organising weddings have been asked to keep their guest lists to a maximum of 30 people, while funerals may be attended to 100 people. According to prime minister Andrej Babis: \u201cWe are also banning theatre, music, film and other performances, sports, cultural, religious, community, dancing, traditional events and other meetings.\u201d The Czech government will also require people returning from all high-risk countries to quarantine themselves, widening a requirement so far only applied to those returning from Italy, foreign minister Tomas Petricek said on Twitter on Friday. The list includes Austria, Belgium, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iran, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and the US, Prague Morning reported. Bulgaria has become the latest European country to declare a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s parliament voted unanimously on to declare the state of emergency until 13 April after the number of confirmed cases in the country rose to 23. It will allow for travel bans to and from countries with large coronavirus outbreaks, the closing of schools and universities, and permit police to intervene when imposed isolation of infected people is not observed. The government also plans a revision of the 2020 state budget to allocate more funds to support the healthcare system, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov told deputies. In news that will be worrying for those of us who travel on the Tube to work every morning, a London Underground driver has tested positive for coronavirus, sources told PA. Earlier this week we reported that Transport for London had stepped up cleaning protocols across its Tube and bus networks. The Portuguese government has put the country on a \u201cstate of alert\u201d and ordered the closure of schools and universities as the number of cases reached 78, Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent reports. It said the move was intended to ensure that \u201ccivil protection and security forces\u201d were ready to react to the situation \u201cpromptly\u201d. The government said the opening hours of shopping centres would be limited to avoid overcrowding and that the number of customers in bars and restaurants would be limited. It added: \u201cThis is a fight for our survival and for the protection of Portuguese lives.\u201d The country\u2019s football league was also suspended. Irish authorities are reportedly trying to identify 10,000 beds around Ireland as a contingency for coronavirus, Rory Carroll reports from Dublin. The Health Service Executive is attempting to source beds in hospitals, hotels, military barracks, student accommodation and other sites for a possible surge in cases, according to RTE. The National Public Health Emergency Team said the delay phase measures announced on Thursday \u2013 such as closing schools and universities and banning big public gatherings \u2013 may slow infections so that 200 people a week catch the virus over five weeks instead of 500 people a week catching the virus over two weeks. The goal is to give health services and society time to handle the pandemic. Simon Harris, the health minister, on Friday said environmental health workers would meet people returning from Spain and Italy. He asked such people to not go to work and curb social interactions for two weeks. \u201cIt is not quite self-isolate, but to restrict their movements.\u201d Ireland has 70 confirmed cases. Northern Ireland has 20. Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, said the region would close schools at some point. The Premier League are expected to convene at 10.30am to determine what happens next. This is an unprecedented time but all 20 clubs will need to come to an unanimous decision for any action to be taken and government officials are also being kept in the loop. The EFL board are likely to follow action taken by the Premier League, who at 9.30pm on Thursday said all of this weekend\u2019s games would \u201cgo ahead as scheduled\u201d before, an hour later, releasing a statement confirming Friday morning\u2019s emergency meeting. In terms of press conferences, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s has been canned, as has Frank Lampard\u2019s. Steve Bruce and Eddie Howe, however, are scheduled to speak as planned imminently. Read more on our football live blog: Egypt has reported its first Covid-19 death of an Egyptian citizen, hundreds of miles away from Luxor, the city at the centre of outbreaks of the virus, Ruth Michaelson reports from Cairo. According to state media and the Egyptian ministry of health, a 60-year-old woman in the Nile Delta town of Mansoura \u201cwas administered a PCR test and tested positive for the coronavirus on Wednesday evening,\u201d after arriving at a local chest hospital with acute pneumonia. Mansoura is 465 miles away from the ancient city of Luxor, where increasing numbers of tourists have reported infection after departure. The woman was transferred to quarantine and died Thursday night. It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East. A German tourist transferred from Luxor to a hospital in the resort town Hurghada died last Sunday from the virus. The outbreak in Mansoura shows that the virus is spreading inside Egypt. \u201cThe 13 new coronavirus cases include six who showed no symptoms and had contracted the virus after coming into contact with people who previously tested positive,\u201d said government-owned outlet Al-Ahram. Egypt\u2019s health ministry continued to update the number of official cases, but has not regularly named the location of infections. The country\u2019s minister for education announced earlier this week that schools were banned from trips in the governorates of Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada due to outbreaks of the virus. The ministry also announced that a school in the central district of Zamalek would close and parents and teachers self-isolate for a fortnight \u201cas a precautionary measure, after a parent of one of the school students was in contact with a foreigner who tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d As the disease shows signs of spreading, some in Cairo attempted to retain a sense of business as usual even as Egypt was battered by a freak storm forcing many to stay indoors. Certain bars and clubs in Cairo announced they would test patrons temperatures on entry. School classes in Belgium have been suspended from Monday, as the the country\u2019s national security council implemented a number of measures to combat the spread of coronavirus. Other measures include the closure of all restaurants and bars by midnight and the cancellation of all recreational, cultural and sporting events while restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s and nightclubs are ordered to shut at midnight until 3 April. Pharmacies and grocery shops will remain open as normal, while other shops must close at weekends, Eurativ.com reports. The health minister of Kazakhstan has announced that two Kazakh citizens have tested positive for coronavirus the first cases of the disease in the Central Asian country, after returning to the country from Germany. The patients are staying in a specialised hospital in Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest city, Reuters reports him as saying. The British clinical psychologist Simon Baron Cohen has revealed on Twitter that he has advised all staff in his laboratory to work from home. Baron Cohen, who is professor of developmental psychopathology at the University of Cambridge, included a link in his tweet to a Medium article that claimed that just one day\u2019s delay to implementing social distancing measures could increase the spread of coronavirus by up to 40%. Could the US president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, be infected with coronavirus? She was pictured last week standing next to Australian home affairs minister Peter Dutton, whose diagnosis was revealed today. The UK government\u2019s chief scientific officer Sir Patrick Vallance has appeared on BBC Radio 4\u2019s agenda setting news programme Today to defend the measures announced last night by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to combat the spread of Covid-19 in the UK. Many people had criticised the measures, which appeared comparatively relaxed compared to those taken by other countries, even in Europe, as too little, too late. But Vallance said that the government\u2019s reasoning was \u201cbased on which interventions are going to have the biggest effect.\u201d He said the government\u2019s plan was to reduce the peak of the epidemic, \u201cpull it down and broaden it,\u201d which he said everyone agreed was the best approach. The government wanted to encourage \u201cherd immunity\u201d among the population, Vallance said, suggesting that it would be worse to suppress the disease completely then for it to return in the autumn If you suppress something very hard, when you release those measures it bounces back at the wrong time so our aim is to try and reduce the peak, broaden the peak, not to suppress it completely. So because most people get a mild illness, to build up some degree of herd immunity as well, so that more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission, at the same we protect those who are most vulnerable. The UK cabinet minister who went into self-isolation earlier this week has tested negative. Anne Marie Trevelyan, the secretary of state for international development, said she would nevertheless self-isolate for seven days. All major public events have been banned in Kenya after it confirmed the first case of coronavirus in east Africa. The patient is a woman who had returned to the country from the United States via the UK. Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe told reporters on Friday morning I want to inform you that the Ministry of Health has confirmed the first coronavirus case in Kenya. The case is a Kenyan citizen who travelled back to Nairobi, returning from the United States of America via London, United Kingdom, on March 5, 2020. Kagwe told a news conference the government had suspended all public gatherings, sporting events, open-air religious meetings and \u201call events that are of a huge public nature\u201d, Reuters reported. He also warned traders that \u201cThis is not the time to make abnormal profits by charging abnormal prices\u201d. All rugby fixtures in France have been suspended. In the UK, a student at the University of Hertfordshire who has tested positive for coronavirus was a resident of campus student halls, the Guardian has been told. A reader, the parent of another student, has written in to say that students are fearful because the university has said it will not close. Deep cleaning is taking place at the infected student\u2019s flat, the Guardian was told. According to a statement on the university website: A student studying at the University of Hertfordshire has tested positive for Covid-19. We are working closely with the NHS and Public Health England to support the affected student, who is being looked after at home. We want to reassure our students, their parents and our staff that the health, safety and security of our community is always our highest priority. The risk of the virus being passed on to other people on campus is low, we continue to follow PHE and government advice and the university is continuing to operate as normal. As a precaution, we have cleaned the affected areas in accordance with Public Health England advice. Here is a video of the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s announcement that all non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people are to be suspended from Monday. Nepal has announced that visa-on-arrival has been suspended for all visitors to the country and that all foreign arrivals entering the country from tomorrow must stay in self-quarantine for 14 days. Here is the official announcement on the Nepali department for immigration website. Turkey has announced its second coronavirus patient, the day after the government implemented a number of new measure to try to stem the spread of the virus. The health minister, Fahrettin Koca, wrote on Twitter that the second patient, whose test results came on Thursday evening, was from the circle of people close to the first patient diagnosed on Wednesday. It comes after the presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin announced that Turkish schools will be closed for one week and universities for three weeks from 16 March, and all sports events will be played without spectators until the end of April. At a news conference following a meeting of ministers at the presidential palace, Kalin also said that President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s foreign visits and programmes will be postponed for some time due to the spread of the virus, according to Reuters. Kalin said primary, middle and secondary schools would initially be closed for one week and after that students will receive remote online teaching from 23 March. Turkey was the last of the world\u2019s major economies to report an outbreak, though all its neighbours except war-ravaged Syria had reported cases. Spanish-language Twitter feeds have been reporting that Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested positive for coronavirus, Dom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro. It comes after Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary was found to have the disease following a trip to the US, but the reports are being denied as fake news and none of Brazil\u2019s main media sites have confirmed them. Bolsonaro has taken a test, however, according to local media, and the results will be ready on Friday. His son Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman who was also on the trip, tweeted that his father \u201cis not exhibiting any signs of the disease\u201d. On Thursday, the Brazilian government confirmed media reports that Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, tested positive following the US trip he was also on, along with ministers, congressmen and the first lady, Michelle Bolsonaro, as well as Eduardo Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro dined with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night and videos and photos, including some on Wajngarten\u2019s own Instagram account, showed the press secretary, Bolsonaro and Trump all in close proximity. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday. The Intercept has reported that aside from Wajngarten, three other members of the delegation have also reported feeling flu-like symptoms and been tested, quoting an anonymous source. It did not name the three others. Meanwhile conservative Brazilians planning pro-Bolsonaro demonstrations across Brazil that are attacking Congress on Sunday have begun sharing images of people wearing masks \u2013 but are insisting the protests, which Bolsonaro himself endorsed, will go ahead. Bolsonaro has cancelled an interview for the launch of CNN Brasil due to air the same day, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper site reported. Yesterday we reported that a number of UK universities, including the LSE and the Manchester Metropolitan university, had decided to move classes online to combat the spread of coronavirus. But it appears students across the country have called on their universities to do the same. Many other universities across the world have already decided to close their doors and continue semesters remotely, or even to postpone teaching altogether. Change.org says it is hosting more than 40 petitions relating to university measures across the UK, with most calling for teaching to move online. Kajal Odedra, the UK executive director of Change.org, said: Hundreds of people around the UK are turning to Change.org to start petitions around coronavirus and how this global health issue is affecting their community. Coronavirus-related petitions are the biggest trend on Change.org right now and we expect more petitions to be started over the coming days as people wrestle to get the information they need to prepare for the virus. This is Damien Gayle in London taking control of the liveblog now, as the sun moves across the world from Asia towards Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As ever, I will be posting updates from the Guardian\u2019s network of correspondents across the world, as well as the most-important updates from the news wires and social media. If you have any news that you think we should be reporting on the live blog, please do get in touch. You can reach me on email at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. With the huge interest in the coronavirus story, I won\u2019t be able to reply to all messages, but I\u2019ll do my best to look at all of them. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle who will be bringing you the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic for the next while. For those of you just waking up, below is our latest coronavirus At a Glance summary piece, as well as the very fresh and more in-depth wrap of the key developments over the last few hours. The latest blog summary is here. The Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has confirmed via Twitter that he has coronavirus. \u201cThis morning I woke up with a temperature and sore throat. I immediately contacted the Queensland Department of Health and was subsequently tested for Covid-19. I was advised by Queensland Health this afternoon that the test had returned positive,\u201d he wrote. Dutton has been admitted to hospital, per Queensland health\u2019s general advice. Earlier today, Dutton did not attend his usual Today Show interview. Host Allison Langdon said it was \u201ca stomach bug\u201d. As stated in his release today, Dutton said he woke up with the symptoms this morning and got the test back this afternoon. Universities and colleges across the US are halting teaching, moving lessons online, and even asking students to move out of campus accommodation in an attempt to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Dozens of institutions \u2013 including UCLA, NYU, Yale and Princeton \u2013 are cancelling in-person lessons in favour of online teaching. Harvard and Amherst have gone as far as to ask their students to move out, disrupting the lives of thousands of students in the process. The first case of someone suffering from Covid-19 can be traced back to 17 November, according to media reports on unpublished Chinese government data. The report, in the South China Morning Post, said Chinese authorities had identified at least 266 people who contracted the virus last year and who came under medical surveillance, and the earliest case was 17 November \u2013 weeks before authorities announced the emergence of the new virus. The Chinese government was widely criticised over attempts to cover up the outbreak in the early weeks, including crackdowns on doctors who tried to warn colleagues about a new Sars-like virus which was emerging in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province. Singaporeans have been advised by the country\u2019s health ministry to defer all non-essential travel to Italy, France, Spain and Germany. China\u2019s city of Yichang in central Hubei province will loosen travel curbs adopted to rein in a coronavirus outbreak, allowing people to move in and out, the government said on Friday, in a statement on its website. It will also allow the return of people from outside the province, employing a \u201chealth code\u201d monitoring system that makes use of mobile telephone. Nepal has closed all of its Himalayan peaks including Mount Everest this climbing season because of fears of the coronavirus outbreak, a government minister said on Friday, Reuters reports. Nepal, home to eight of the world\u2019s 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest, gets more than four million dollars in permit fees for the world\u2019s highest peak and other mountains every year. Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai said expeditions to all peaks in the March-May spring season had been suspended. \u201cClimbing this season has been closed,\u201d Bhattarai told Reuters. \u201cIt is as a precaution for that,\u201d he added, when asked it its was because of the coronavirus. Nepal has confirmed just one case of the coronavirus - a student studying in China on a trip home - out of 450 people tested. The suspension of expeditions in Nepal will affect hundreds of foreign climbers now preparing for the spring season, a window of relatively good weather between the end of the bitterly cold winter and the rainy season, which begins in June. Everest, the world\u2019s highest mountain at 8,850 metres (29,035 feet), is on the border between Nepal and the Chinese region of Tibet. China announced the closure of its side of the mountain on Thursday. The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the food service industry to review its policies. This brushing off of illness is common in many places within the food service and restaurant industry and has been for many years. But with the recent coronavirus outbreak, being sick is no longer something people can shrug off given the illness\u2019 ability to spread rapidly and efficiently. The culture around sick leave in the food service industry is that it is nearly nonexistent. The CDC says that 15% of food workers have paid sick leave. That means a bulk of people in the industry are part of the 32 million American workers who are without paid sick leave. Poor sick leave policies are an \u201cindustry standard\u201d in food service, particularly fast food, said Judy Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Center. The US does not have a federal sick leave policy, with 12 states and Washington DC having paid sick leave laws. A nurse on the frontline of Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has described the experience as \u201cwar-like\u201d. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock as the country tries to halt the spread of a virus that has so far claimed over 1000 Italian lives. Among the dead was a 59-year-old doctor and close friend of Roberta Re, a nurse at Piacenza hospital in Emilia-Romagna, the region with the second highest number of cases. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience I would compare to a world war,\u201d Re told the Guardian. \u201cBut it\u2019s a war that isn\u2019t fightable with traditional arms \u2013 as we don\u2019t yet know who the enemy is and so it\u2019s difficult to fight. The only weapon we do have to avoid things getting even worse is to stay at home and to respect the rules, to do what they did in China, as this is paying off.\u201d A summary of the latest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak, below: Today\u2019s Covid-19 news so far has included the effects of the virus on sports stars, politicians, religious ceremonies, New York City, the Nikkei and the United Nations \u2013 as the number of deaths worldwide approached 5,000. Here is what has been going on: A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus. She is the first known case at the world body\u2019s New York headquarters. New York state banned all gatherings with 500 or more people as New York City declared a state of emergency. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints suspended all of its worship services globally because of the spread of the coronavirus. The Vatican closed all Catholic churches across Rome to stem the spread of the virus. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, tested positive for coronavirus. Justin Trudeau in self-isolation. Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first confirmed infection among Premier League players. The Australian share market closed 4.4% up after falling almost 7% on opening. India registered its first coronavirus death: a 76-year-old man in Karnataka who had fallen sick on returning to India on 29 February after a pilgrimage to Mecca. Japan again insisted that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer, hours after Donald Trump added to speculation that the coronavirus pandemic could force them to be postponed or cancelled. Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris Resort announced they would close through the end of the month, starting at the close of business Sunday. Ghana and Gabon confirmed their first cases, becoming the ninth and tenth countries in sub-Saharan Africa to register positive cases. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison advised against non-essential travel, and, from Monday, gatherings over 500 people. He said he would be attending a football match this weekend. The advice did not extend to schools and universities. The Australian Grand Prix was cancelled, after a member of the McLaren Racing Team tested positive for Covid-19. A second person has tested positive for coronavirus in Turkey, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. In Vietnam, there is also a risk of British nationals being turned away from, or asked to leave, hotels in Vietnam, the British Embassy in Hanoi said in a statement on Twitter. \u201cYou are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate for 14 days even after you have arrived in Vietnam if you either develop flu-like symptoms, or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested for coronavirus. There are also increased restrictions on British nationals wishing to visit Vietnam. \u201cFrom 12 March, Vietnam has suspended its visa waiver programme for British nationals. There are reports that e-visas have also been suspended and the Vietnamese embassy in London will not be processing visa applications until further notice. \u201cThe Vietnamese embassy in London say that it is possible to get a visa, but there is uncertainty around the replacement process and timeline for such applications.\u201d The statement added that British citizens are \u201cstrongly advised\u201d to familiarise themselves with these risks before travelling. So far, 10 British citizens are among those who have tested positive for the virus. Key attractions across Hanoi, as well as the ancient town of Hoi An, in central Vietnam, have closed, while several areas in Quang Ninh province, including Ha Long Bay, a Unesco world heritage site, and Bai Tu Long Bay, have also stopped receiving visitors. A total of 44 cases have so far been confirmed across the country. The British embassy in Hanoi has warned UK travellers of a risk that they will be placed in \u201csafe but basic\u201d quarantine centres and turned away from hotels if they travel to Vietnam, where a cluster of cases has been linked to a flight from London. Tens of tourists believed to have been exposed to the virus on board a flight that arrived in Hanoi on 2 March have been placed in isolation. Meanwhile, a growing number of Vietnam\u2019s most popular holiday attractions have closed their doors to tourists. The country appeared to have contained the virus after recording no new cases for 22 days. But over the past week, 28 new infections have been confirmed. The British embassy in Hanoi said on Friday that there is \u201ca high risk for British nationals of being put into 14 days of quarantine, either on arrival or during your trip to Vietnam, regardless of your route. It added: Vietnamese quarantine centres are safe but basic, not guaranteed to meet Public Health England\u2019s standards.\u201d JP Morgan is calling a global recession. They have \u2018dramatically\u2019 revised their forecasts for two main reasons, they said in a note: A sudden stop. The breadth of \u201csocial distancing\u201d is increasing at a dramatic pace. Italy is now in total lockdown and the US as well as other countries are suspending flights from a wide range of nations. A broad range of public events has been canceled for the coming weeks. Markets spasm. Financial conditions are tightening sharply as perceptions of credit quality across a wide range of asset classes deteriorates and market liquidity dries up. Credit spreads and market measures of corporate and sovereign default risk have widened markedly. The bank says: We now see a 1H20 contraction in GDP that is both significant and spreads across nearly all of the global, we believe that our forecast represents an event best characterised as a recession. The Australian market has finished up 4.4% for the day, after being down as much as 8% during the day. That\u2019s a range of more than 12 percentage points, representing an extraordinary rollercoaster ride of a day. Earlier, the Reserve Bank made a dramatic intervention in the markets in a bid to stop a credit crunch, pumping AU$8.8bn (US$5.3) in short-term funding into the banks. It did this by agreeing to buy assets such as portfolios of loans from the banks for cash, and then sell them back the same assets later on. While the late rally erased losses experienced on Thursday, when the market dived 7.4%, the damage inflicted since coronavirus selling began on 20 February still means all gains since the start of last year have been wiped out. India has registered its first coronavirus death: a 76-year-old man in Karnataka who had fallen sick on returning to India on 29 February after a pilgrimage to Mecca. He died on Tuesday and was later confirmed to have tested positive. Officials are tracing all the people he came into contact with. As the number of cases rose to 73, the Delhi government ordered the closure of all schools, colleges, and cinemas till 31 March and made it mandatory for shopping malls, government offices and public spaces to be disinfected every day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has told all ministers not to travel abroad. With the Indian Premier League \u2013 a hugely popular cricket tournament \u2013 starting on 29 March, the government has advised against going ahead with it but left the decision to the organisers. Google confirmed today that one of its employees in Bengaluru is infected. The man had recently returned from Greece. On Thursday, the Indian stock market saw the worst crash since 2008, crashing by 2,919 points. Japan has again insisted that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer, hours after Donald Trump added to speculation that the coronavirus pandemic could force them to be postponed or cancelled. The country\u2019s Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, said Tokyo 2020 organisers would continue to plan for a \u201csafe and secure\u201d Games, due to open on 24 July. Trump had caused consternation among Japanese officials when he told suggested on Thursday that postponing the Olympics for a year was preferable to holding events in empty venues. Trump told reporters in the White House that he \u201cjust can\u2019t see having no people there\u201d. \u201cMaybe they postpone it for a year... if that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, adding that he preferred that idea to \u201chaving empty stadiums all over the place. I think if you cancel it, make it a year later that\u2019s a better alternative than doing it with no crowd.\u201d Trump and Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, discussed the coronavirus and Olympic preparations in a phone call on Friday morning, but did not raise the issue of cancelation or postponement, according to a Japanese government account of the call. Trump later appeared more upbeat about the Olympics\u2019 prospects, tweeting that he had told Abe \u201cthat the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job, one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!\u201d Despite the massive disruption the outbreak has caused to sporting competitions around the world, Japanese officials have spent several days trying to quash speculation that the Games could become the sports world\u2019s biggest victim of the virus. Preparations for the Olympic Games continued on Thursday, although on a much smaller scale than usual, due to the coronavirus outbreak. The traditional lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece, was held without spectators present, and with only a small number of delegations, officials and journalists in attendance. After the Greek actress, Xanthi Georgiou, ignited the flame using the sun\u2019s rays and a parabolic mirror at the Temple of Hera, the head of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, said the Games\u2019 organisers were committed to the \u201csuccess\u201d of the games, despite \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d. Bach added: \u201cWe\u2019re strengthened in this commitment by the many authorities and sports organisations around the world who are taking so many significant measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s opposition leader Simon Bridges has tweeted his approval of the announcement by Australia\u2019s prime minister Scott Morrison in the last hour that from Monday all non-essential mass gatherings will be banned. He has urged his country\u2019s government, led by Jacinda Ardern, to do the same. New Zealand has five confirmed cases of Covid-19 and two probable cases. The country has not had any new cases in five days. Singapore will deny from Monday entry or transit to visitors who have been in Italy, France, Spain or Germany in the last 14 days, as part of measures to control the fast-spreading coronavirus, the health ministry said on Friday. The southeast Asian travel hub, which also advised against non-essential travel to the four countries, will immediately halt docking by cruise ships, it added. Singapore has a similar ban in place for travellers from Iran, South Korea and China, where the virus first surfaced late last year. RNZ reports a further two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in French Polynesia, a day after the territory announced its first confirmed case, which was the first confirmed case in the Pacific Islands. President Edouard Fritch announced yesterday that French Polynesian politician Maina Sage had been confirmed with the virus after returning from Paris on 7 March. Sage was resting at home in self-isolation in Tahiti. She is French Polynesia\u2019s representative in the French National Assembly (French Polynesia being an overseas French collectivity). During her time in Paris, Sage served on a National Assembly commission with France\u2019s culture minister Franck Riester, who has also been confined in France after contracting Covid-19. Today, RNZ reports that two more cases have been confirmed \u2013 one of whom was a person close to Sage and the other was a Swiss tourist who fell ill on the atoll of Fakarava. He has been flown to Tahiti. There has been widespread fear across the Pacific region about the coronavirus outbreak. An epidemic of measles across the Pacific last year highlighted the potential for transmission of infectious diseases, adding to existing burdens on public health systems from non-communicable diseases. Here\u2019s our report from yesterday: In short, the position of Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison is, as he has just said: \u201cPeople can go about their normal essential business they do each day.\u201d They should however avoid gatherings over 500 people \u2013 excluding schools and university lectures \u2013 from Monday, and reconsider non-essential travel. Morrison also says Parliament will continue as normal. Australia\u2019s New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian says, \u201cIt\u2019s safe to go to school. When it\u2019s not, we will shut down that particular school and work with the school community to reopen at the appropriate time.\u201d Australian PM Scott Morrison is asked: So you are willingly going to a game this weekend which from Monday - a mass gathering, which you recommend people don\u2019t attend. How is that responsible? I think you misunderstand the point of what we\u2019re doing on Monday. These are stepped responses. We are not of great concern right now in terms of where those gatherings might be today, but in the weeks ahead, this will change. This is a matter of scaling our response. The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks, it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says, \u201cI do have still plans to go to the football on Saturday. This is an arrangement we are putting in place for next week as a precaution. This is an early-stage action that we are undertaking to make sure we get ahead of this. I would be going on on Saturday because I had previously planned to, and these are measures we are putting on from next week, and there are further measures that will come in over time, I would expect.\u201d Australia\u2019s Scott Morrison said that by advising against mass gatherings he was acting on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principals Committee. That committee will also be the principal advisory body to the new national cabinet. The cabinet will be made up of COAG members \u2014 premiers and chief ministers. They will also establish a national coordinating mechanism to ensure the response is consistent across jurisdictions. The members of that cabinet is who you see before you here today, and we will be working very closely together to ensure there is a consistency of response, that there is a coordination of response. We simply say to the Australian people that we will manage this carefully in your interests. What we are announcing today is just another step. It is precautionary. It is getting ahead of this to ensure that we can minimise the impact on your health and we can ensure with confidence the ability for people to be accessing the health services that they and their families will need. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is speaking now. \u201cWe are not suggesting people should interrupt their normal daily work. It\u2019s just avoiding those particular circumstances where transmission can be accelerated,\u201d he says. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the government now advises Australians to reconsider non-essential travel. I also want to say that we have also decided through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that we know advise all Australians to reconsider your need to travel overseas at this time, regardless of your destination, age or health - if your travel is not essential, consider carefully whether now is the right time. It is \u201cLevel-Three\u201d travel advice he says. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison says the government will be advising against \u201cnonessential, organised gatherings of persons of 500 or more.\u201d \u201cThat of course does not include schools. It does not include university lectures. It does not mean people getting on public transport or going to airports or things of that nature.\u201d In Australia now, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is speaking at a COAG meeting: The goal here is very straightforward -that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been going about it in a very careful way. There\u2019s been an abundance of caution in our approach - it is simply to slow the rate of transmission of the coronavirus within Australia. That is done through the containment mechanisms that have been already put in place, in New South Wales, Victoria or anywhere else. The containment processes of self-isolation, identifying and tracing of contacts, all of these measures worked to successfully slow the rate of transmission of this virus. The government will be moving to a position from Monday where they advise against mass public gatherings of 500 people or more. But this does NOT include schools and universities, says Morrison. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking now from a Council of Australian Governments meeting after it was reported that the government has been advised mass gatherings should be cancelled. Government leaders met in Parramatta on Friday for the COAG meeting, where chief health officers told them urgent social distancing measures were necessary to slow the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Morrison says: In the course of today a number of things became very clear based on the advice received from the Australian Health Protection Principals Committee, which is is the health officers, Chief Medical Officers of each state and territory and the officer from the Commonwealth. There was growing evidence, as we were receiving, particularly over the course of the day, of greater community transmission of the coronavirus throughout Australia. There was has also been as a result of the, what occurred in the United States and across Europe, the disruption of some international supply chain - matters that deal with some medical equipment which we now will be addressing over the course of the next few days. These issues are not constrained toAustralia. They are impacting around the world and they are matters that now need to be addressed here in Australia, like they are in many other countries. As a result of the advice which was pulled together today by the professionals, what we resolved is to form a National Cabinet to deal with the [coronavirus spread throughout Australia] The Australian market has come roaring back in afternoon trade to be less than 2% down for the day. It\u2019s not entirely clear what\u2019s caused the dramatic turnaround, but the most likely answer is that the Reserve Bank has pumped $8.2bn into short-term bank funding this morning. The AFR reports that the funding package was designed to head off a looming credit squeeze caused by market panic over the coronavirus crisis and US president Donald Trump\u2019s cack-handed response to it. Benchmark index the ASX200 fell as much as 8% on Friday but by 3pm was surging upwards to be just 1.78% below Thursday\u2019s closing price. South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since the country\u2019s first patient was confirmed on 20 January, raising hopes that Asia\u2019s biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said 110 new cases had been confirmed on Thursday - compared to 114 a day earlier - taking the total to 7,979. But 177 fully recovered patients were released the same day, it added. Officials said the number of new infections in Daegu, the southern city at the centre of the outbreak, and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang had declined \u201cdramatically\u201d, but there were concerns over a spike in cases at a call centre in Seoul, where 102 people have tested positive, and a government office in the administrative capital Sejong. Daegu and North Gyeongsang account for about 90% of cases in South Korea, with 60% of infections linked to the Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a secretive religious sect with 210,000 followers. Despite the encouraging news, the country\u2019s prime minister, Chung-Sye-kyun, who is leading efforts to contain the outbreak in Daegu, warned against complacency. \u201cThe battle against the coronavirus has now become a global fight going far beyond Daegu,\u201d he said. The 110 cases detected Thursday, and reported by the KCDC on Friday, was the lowest number of daily infections in more than two weeks, and well below the 500-600 daily increases reported early this month. One death was confirmed on Thursday, bringing the country\u2019s total to 67. Sixty-one of the latest cases were from Daegu, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has just tweeted about his wife Sophie\u2019s confirmed case of Covid-19: Here is the official (2015) guidance video from the World Health Organization on how to wash those hands of yours. The WHO says: \u201cHand hygiene, either with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand rub, is one of the best ways to avoid getting sick and spreading infections to others. Indeed, hand hygiene is an easy, inexpensive, and effective mean to prevent the spread of germs and keep everyone healthy.\u201d More official WHO tips here. The last of Apple\u2019s 42 stores in China reopened Friday, as the country slowly goes back to work following weeks of quarantine that forced the closure of businesses, AFP reports. The firm announced on February 1 that it would shut all its stores, corporate offices and contact centres across the mainland as the epidemic rapidly spread. Apple\u2019s stores have gradually been reopening over the past few days and a spokeswoman for the company told AFP the remaining few would throw their doors open Friday. The company\u2019s website shows its stores now have \u201cspecial operating hours\u201d. As we report the latest coronavirus news today, please send me any tips or relevant news on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is due to speak speak shortly, following reports that the government has been advised mass gatherings should be cancelled. We\u2019re also hoping for an update on the economy, following a 6% drop on the ASX200. The Guardian is tracking global infections below: Australia\u2019s Central Coast has confirmed its first coronavirus case, the ABC reports: In Australia, Queensland state health says there are now 35 cases in the state, as of Friday 13 March. The statement does not say how many cases are new but out understanding is that this means there are eight new cases, up from 27 yesterday. The statement says: Currently, all cases are in South-East Queensland, excluding one individual in Kingaroy and one individual in Rockhampton. Contact tracing is underway for all new cases, in addition to the previously confirmed cases. We will notify the community if any other public health alerts are required. Queensland Health is urging anyone who has been overseas in the last 14 days and has a fever or any respiratory symptoms to see a doctor immediately. In Australia, expert health advice reportedly given to the prime minister and state premiers says all gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled immediately to halt the spread of coronavirus. Government leaders met in Parramatta on Friday for a Council of Australian Governments meeting, where chief health officers told them urgent social distancing measures were necessary to slow the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The advice is unconfirmed, but, if correct, would appear to mandate the closure of schools and universities, as well as sporting events and concerts. The Guardian has contacted government authorities seeking their response. As the Catholic and Mormon churches close services over coronavirus fears, a Catholic church in Hong Kong has started streaming its mass to worshipers online. Similar arrangements have been made in Singapore and elsewhere at various churches, temples and mosques. With an iPad on a small tripod, Father Thomas Law of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in downtown Hong Kong is broadcasting mass to worshippers to their homes via online streaming as a way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The church was formerly packed during daily morning mass and on Sundays, but the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong has suspended mass and liturgies since Feb. 15 in line with government health guidelines promoting social distancing. Many churches in Hong Kong have taken their services online due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Chinese-ruled city, which has reported 130 cases and three deaths. These are the most recent figures from China, where we are expecting detail soon on new infections and the number of infections that are from Wuhan, specifically. Mainland China reported eight new cases of the virus on March 12, continuing a decline after 15 new cases on March 11th. There were seven new deaths. In the US, Barack Obama has tweeted about the coronavirus: US president Donald Trump also took to Twitter to share a helpful update: Metro Manila, home to 12 million people, is preparing for a lockdown that will be imposed from Sunday in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus. All schools will be closed, mass gatherings suspended, and many public sector workers told to stay home, following a spike in cases in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte has also imposed a ban on domestic land and sea travels to and from Manila, which will begin on 15 March and last 30 days. The number of cases in the country has risen from 10 on Sunday to 52 by Thursday evening, and there is concern about the virus spreading rapidly through cramped slum areas. Metro Manila, also known as the National Capital Region, includes 16 cities, including Manila. On Thursday, Duterte was tested for the virus, though he has not experienced symptoms. Five people in the country have now died after becoming infected. Here is what we know so far about Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis and the implications for Chelsea and the Premier League. Chelsea\u2019s full squad have gone into self-isolation after winger Hudson-Odoi tested positive to the coronavirus, the club said in a statement. Hudson-Odoi displayed cold symptoms on Monday morning and has stayed away from the club since then. His test result was returned on Thursday night. The club said despite testing positive, the 19-year-old was \u201cdoing well and looking forward to returning to the training ground as soon as it is possible\u201d. The Blues have also closed two buildings at their training facility. PA media reports Chelsea are scheduled to play at Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon but the match looks unlikely to proceed. The remainder of the Premier League season, in fact, is in doubt with the League to hold a meeting on Friday to determine a course of action in response to the coronavirus. Tom Hanks has tweeted a photograph of himself and Rita Wilson, after the pair confirmed yesterday that they had tested positive for coronavirus. In the image Hanks writes: \u201cHello folks. Rita Wilson and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us. We have Covid-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else. There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. We are taking it one day at a time... Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball. Hanx.\u201d The baseball line is from his 1992 film A League of Their Own: More on Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau\u2019s positive coronavirus diagnosis now from the Guardian\u2019s Leyland Cecco. The wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has tested positive for Covid-19 following a trip to the United Kingdom. Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau announced Thursday evening that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and plans to remain in isolation for the next two weeks. Her symptoms have been described as mild. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBeing in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.\u201d The prime minister remains \u201cin good health with no symptoms\u201d according to his office, but will work in remotely for the next two weeks. He plans to address Canadians on Friday. Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi has tested positive for coronavirus, the club reports. We understand that Hudson-Odoi is first Premier League player to be infected. The club wrote on its website: Chelsea men\u2019s team player Callum Hudson-Odoi had a positive test result for Coronavirus returned this evening. Chelsea personnel who had recent close contact with the player in the men\u2019s team building will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. These will include initially the full men\u2019s team squad, coaching staff and a number of backroom staff. It is expected that those who did not have close contact with Callum will return to work in the coming days. In the meantime, the men\u2019s team building, one of several separate buildings at our training ground, will remain closed. The rest of our training facility, Stamford Bridge and our other facilities are operating as normal. While most major sporting events have been canceled, mushers in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race are continuing their 1,000-mile march west across Alaska, AP reports. Officials with the world\u2019s most famous sled dog race announced Thursday they have postponed post-race events in response to the new coronavirus. The Iditarod has postponed both the awards banquet set for 22 March and the meet the mushers event set for 21 March, both in Nome, where the winner is expected some time next week. Gabon and Ghana confirmed their first cases of coronavirus on Thursday, becoming the ninth and tenth countries in sub-Saharan Africa to register positive cases. The region has so far been less badly hit by coronavirus than Europe or China. Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal, Cameroon, Togo, South Africa, Burkina Faso and Democratic Republic of Congo have also registered cases. In a statement, Gabon\u2019s government said its case was a 27-year-old Gabonese man who had returned from France on 8 March. Ghana\u2019s health ministry said its two cases were people who had returned recently from Norway and Turkey. \u201cThese are imported cases of Covid-19. Both patients are currently being kept in isolation and are stable,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Sub-Saharan Africa did not confirm its first coronavirus infection until Feb. 28 in Nigeria, but experts warn that rising cases could test already fragile health systems. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife Sophie has tested positive for coronavirus, AP reports. This story is breaking. We will have further details soon. We reported earlier that Prime Minister Trudeau was self-isolating after his wife returned from a visit to the UK with flu-like symptoms, including a fever. South Korea reported 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the country\u2019s total infections to 7,979, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The latest numbers are in line with a downward trend in new cases, slightly down from the 114 recorded on Thursday. Theme parks at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida and Disneyland Paris Resort will be closing through the end of the month, starting at the close of business Sunday, the Walt Disney Company announced. The company said in a statement Thursday that the decision was made \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d to protect guests and employees amid the global outbreak of the new coronavirus. The decision came hours after the announcement of the planned closure of Disneyland in California, AP reports. Additionally, Disney Cruise Line will suspend all new departures beginning Saturday and continuing through the end of the month, the statement said. The Walt Disney Company will pay its cast members during that closure period, according to the release. The hotels at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris will remain open, along with the shops and restaurants at Disney Springs at Walt Disney World and Disney Village at Disneyland Paris, according to the news release. How Taiwan is containing coronavirus \u2013 despite diplomatic isolation by China Using phone tracking to enforce mandatory quarantine is one example of how Taiwan has managed to contain the spread of coronavirus, with just 48 confirmed cases of infection to date, including one death, reports Michelle Yun from Taipei. That\u2019s despite the island located just 130km (80 miles) from mainland China, the centre of the virus outbreak which has reported more than 80,000 cases and 3,000 deaths. A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, according to a note sent to UN missions, making the woman the first known case at the world body\u2019s New York headquarters. \u201cAs of today, the Philippine Mission is in lockdown, and all personnel are instructed to self-quarantine and to seek medical attention should they develop the symptoms. We are assuming that all of us have been infected,\u201d wrote Philippines acting UN Ambassador Kira Azucena in a message seen by Reuters. According the online UN directory of diplomatic staff, there are about 12 diplomats at the Filipino mission, which is on 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The sick diplomat represented the Philippines in the UN General Assembly\u2019s legal affairs committees. Azucena said the diplomat was last at UN headquarters on Monday for about half an hour when she was asymptomatic. She came down with flu-like symptoms on Tuesday and visited her doctor. \u201cShe got the call today that she tested positive for Covid-19,\u201d Azucena wrote on Thursday. The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case. The 193-member world body began implementing coronavirus prevention measures at its Manhattan headquarters this week. A two-week conference on women\u2019s rights was cut to one day, several other planned large conferences canceled, most smaller meetings cut, UN missions asked to limit the number of diplomats they send to meetings, and at least half the several thousand UN staff who normally work in the building will be working from home by next week. From Hong Kong, we have an update on the pet Pomeranian which tested positive for Covid-19 last week: blood tests have returned a negative result. The dog was taken into quarantine after its owner was diagnosed with the illness. Successive tests on samples taken from its nose and mouth showed a \u201cweak positive\u201d result in the dog, leading health experts to declare it was likely a case of human-to-animal transmission. Other epidemiologists were more circumspect, and said blood tests were needed first, to see if it had any virus antibodies in its system. Blood tests taken on 3 March returned yesterday showed there was no measurable antibodies in the dog. But authorities maintained the dog was infected. \u201cThe negative serological test result does not suggest that the dog is not infected with the virus,\u201d the Hong Kong government said. \u201cIt is known in some asymptomatic or mild cases of human infections with other types of coronavirus that antibodies may not always develop. It is also not uncommon to have a negative result in the earlier stages of infection as it often takes 14 days or more for measurable levels of antibodies to be detected. \u201c Gene sequencing of the virus detected on the dog and in its owner showed them to be very similar, suggesting the virus did likely spread from the person to the animal. \u201cThere currently is no evidence that pet animals can be a source of infection of Covid-19,\u201d the department added.\u201d \u201cPet owners should not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets.\u201d Asian markets opened in freefall on Friday, extending a global rout that saw bourses experience their worst day in decades on fears of a recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Tokyo\u2019s benchmark Nikkei index nosedived more than seven percent shortly after the open, with markets around the region plummeting after a historically bad trading day in the US and Europe. The Nikkei average extended its fall and is currently down 10%. New Zealand\u2019s benchmark NZX 50 slumped 7.9 percent. Trading was briefly halted on South Korea\u2019s stock exchange when the benchmark KOSPI index fell 6.8 percent. The falls came after dramatic scenes on other global markets, with the Dow losing 10 percent, or around 2,350 points, to 21,200.62, in its worst session since 1987. London also had its worst day since the 1987 crash and Frankfurt its blackest day since 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Paris suffered its worst one-day loss ever. Analysts said President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a ban on travel to the US from Europe deeply rattled investors, and measures intended to shore up business and markets were proving insufficient, AFP reports. In Australia, travel agency Flight Centre will close 100 stores. AAP reports that Flight Centre has also scrapped its earnings guidance due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company said on Friday that the stores will close before June 30, and sales staff will transfer to other stores, as part of moves to slash costs. Flight Centre shares were down by 17 per cent at $16.26 by 1148 AEDT and have lost 60 per cent of their value since February 20 amid a wider market sell-off. Australian stock market dives more than 7% again The Australian market has dived more than 7% for the second day in a row as coronavirus panic grips traders. At 12.20pm the benchmark ASX200 index was down 7.5%. Trading remains volatile but so far today the market is plumbing depths not seen since early 2016, wiping out almost three years of gains. The Vatican on Thursday closed all Catholic churches across Rome to stem the spread of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 1,000 people across Italy, AFP reports. The papal vicar for Rome said the churches would reopen when a broader Italian government crackdown on public gatherings expires on April 3. \u201cThe faithful are consequently exempt from their obligation to fulfil the festive precept,\u201d a statement from Cardinal Angelo De Donatis said. The Vatican had spent days resisting having to take the drastic measure of shuttering places of worship in the overwhelmingly Catholic country. It closed its museums and even the Saint Paul Basilica - parts of its soaring dome designed by Michelangelo - to tourists as the death toll continued to mount. The Vatican also banned mass across the country and called off all weddings and funerals. But the churches themselves stayed open as long as the faithful followed government regulations and remained a metre (three feet) apart while inside. It was not immediately clear when Rome\u2019s churches had last been forced to close en masse. The Nazis and Italian Fascists kept Pope Pius XII confined to the Vatican during World War II. But at least some Rome churches kept their doors open during the war. In an address to the nation on Thursday night, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro has called for nationwide demonstrations in support of his far-right government that have been widely seen as anti-Congress to be postponed because of the coronavirus crisis - which has already infected his press secretary. Brazil has 77 confirmed cases. \u201cThe spontaneous and legitimate movements scheduled for March 15 attend the nation\u2019s interest,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cHowever faced with recent facts they need to be rethought. Our health and our families must be preserved. The moment is unity, serenity and good sense.\u201d Earlier, Bolsonaro suggested postponing the events during a Facebook Live with his health minster Luiz Henrique Mandetta, during which both wore masks. Organisers have decided to cancel the events, local media reported. In New Zealand, Auckland mayor Phil Goff has cancelled the Pasifika festival this weekend due to coronavirus. Auckland is New Zealand\u2019s largest city, home to more than one million people. Goff said at least 40,000 people were expected to attend the festival from all around the Pacific region and the risk of spreading the virus to the Islands was too high. Last year the annual festival was also cancelled as the security threat was raised, coming just days after the March 15 Christchurch terror attacks. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern is expected to make further announcements on travel restrictions today, after taking advice overnight. New Zealand has five confirmed cases of the virus, and more than 9000 people at home in self-isolation. A number of New Zealand politicians including finance minister Grant Robertson and speaker Trevor Mallard have cancelled upcoming overseas trips due to the virus, saying they will conduct their meetings via skype instead. The number of coronavirus infections globally now stands at 128,343, according to Johns Hopkins University. The virus has claimed the lives of 4,720 people since virus was first detected in China. Now for the latest from China, where a senior Chinese medical adviser said on Thursday that the global coronavirus pandemic could be over by June if countries mobilise to fight it. China declared the peak had passed there as new cases in Hubei fell to single digits for the first time on Thursday. \u201cBroadly speaking, the peak of the epidemic has passed for China,\u201d said Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission. \u201cThe increase of new cases is falling.\u201d Zhong Nanshan, the government\u2019s senior medical adviser, told reporters that as long as countries take the outbreak seriously and are prepared to take firm measures, it could be over worldwide in a matter of months. \u201cMy advice is calling for all countries to follow WHO instructions and intervene on a national scale,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all countries could get mobilised, it could be over by June.\u201d Speaking to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, President Xi Jinping similarly expressed confidence, state television reported. \u201cMy estimate of June is based on scenarios that all countries take positive measures.\u201d The Fijian Broadcasting Corporation is reporting that production on Survivor\u2019s 41st season has been postponed over coronavirus concerns. Production of the show, which will be filmed in Fiji, has been postponed to mid-May. This is your friendly reminder to wash your hands often and thoroughly. If you\u2019re looking for a new song to take you through the motions, here is Gloria Gaynor with a hand-washing rendition of I Will Survive: Virgin Australia is also reducing its international and domestic routes in response to lowered demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Virgin Australia has confirmed that a cabin crew member has tested positive for coronavirus. The airline company is not confirming the flight or route today. Earlier today, American Airlines announced that a pilot had tested positive. American Airlines Group Inc said on Thursday a pilot based out of Dallas-Fort Worth tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cAmerican\u2019s Chief Medical Officer and leaders from our pilots\u2019 office have been in touch with the pilot,\u201d the company said in a statement. Argentina is going into virtual shutdown with the announced suspension of the arrival of all flights from the US, EU, UK, China, South Korea, Japan and Iran for the next 30 days. The measure goes into force starting tomorrow Friday. It\u2019s not clear yet what will happen with flights already on their way to Argentina today arriving Friday. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Argentina jumped Thursday from 21 to 31, authorities announced. For the first time three of these cases were locally contracted, as opposed to all the cases until now, which involved persons arriving from abroad, mostly from Italy. There has been one death so far, a 64-year-old man arriving from France. Argentina is also cancelling all concerts and sports events, among them Argentina\u2019s Lollapalooza where Gun\u2019s N Roses, Travis Scott, The Strokes, Gwen Stefani and Lana del Rey were scheduled to perform. Sports matches will be permitted as long as they are played without public present The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is suspending all of its worship services globally because of the spread of the new coronavirus. The decision was made hours after Utah\u2019s governor recommended limiting group gatherings in the state to no more than 100 people for at least two weeks. The Utah-based faith sent a letter Thursday to members informing them of a decision that also calls on a temporary suspension of all church activities until further notice. The move comes a day after the faith announced it would hold a major conference in early April without attendees. It is first time since a 1957 flu epidemic that the religion has taken the step of barring church members from attending in person. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is temporarily halting his trademark rallies as his campaign bows to the coronavirus outbreak that is rapidly reshaping the nation\u2019s political landscape. The rallies have long been Trump\u2019s most potent political weapon: They energize the candidate, give him a powerful platform from which to attack his adversaries and allow his team to collect a treasure trove of voter data. The two leading Democratic contenders, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, canceled their scheduled rallies earlier this week. New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman has just reported that US President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign staff have been told to work remotely while a \u201cdeep cleaning and sanitation\u201d of campaign offices takes place. While you are securing your home for a period of social distancing or home isolation behind a wall of toilet paper, spare a thought for those who do not have the option of a safe place to hibernate. Australian homeless advocacy organisations have called for more temporary housing to be made available in preparation for widespread community transmission of Covid-19. Here\u2019s Kate Colvin, from Victoria\u2019s Council to Homeless Person\u2019s: People with pre-existing health conditions and the elderly who contract Covid-19 are particularly vulnerable to experiencing severe symptoms. People who are experiencing homelessness are more likely to have poor health due to exposure to extreme heat and cold and living in substandard accommodation, which is poorly ventilated or damp. Having limited finances also makes it hard for people to access healthcare and medication to manage chronic underlying illnesses. Read Jack Banister\u2019s full report on this issue: As we report the latest coronavirus news today, please send me any tips, relevant news or well wishes for Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, who confirmed on Thursday that they have tested positive for Covid-19, on Twitter @helenrsullivan. My DMs are open. Here is New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio speaking earlier about the decision to declare a state of emergency in the city. Princess Cruises, the operator of two ocean liners that were quarantined after they became hotbeds for coronavirus infections, said on Thursday it would suspend voyages of all its 18 ships for two months. The suspension upends an industry already struggling with cancellations following the outbreak, and comes after Finland\u2019s Viking Line temporarily paused operations of its river ships and ocean liners around the world, Reuters reports. \u201cNever ... in the 20 years I have served in this company, have we been tested in ways we have been tested over the past 40 days,\u201d Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, said on the operator\u2019s official YouTube channel, addressing the decision to suspend operations. \u201cThis is perhaps the most difficult decision in our history.\u201d Shares of parent Carnival Corp, which have already lost over half their value since the start of the year, tumbled a further 18%. Rivals Royal Caribbean Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings were also down. The Australian market tumbled almost 7% on opening, setting it up for a second day running of heavy losses due to the coronavirus crisis. Blue chip stocks tumbled as they began trading shortly after 10am, with shares in big miners BHP and Rio, both of which fell overnight in London, where they are also listed, tumbling 6.8% and 4.55% respectively. Australia\u2019s biggest bank, CBA, fell 4.33% while rival ANZ was down 7.17% and NAB, which cancelled a capital raising last night due to the volatile market, plunged 8.11%. The Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled after a member of the McLaren team tested positive for coronavirus. Here is everything we know so far: Confusion engulfed the season-opening Australian Grand Prix hours before the cars were due on track before the race was eventually cancelled amid fears over the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cFollowing the confirmation that a member of the McLaren Racing Team has tested positive for Covid-19 and the team\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Australian Grand Prix, the FIA and Formula 1 convened a meeting of the other nine team principals on Thursday evening,\u201d a joint statement from FIA, Formula 1 and the Australian Grand Prix Corporation read. \u201cThose discussions concluded with a majority view of the teams that the race should not go ahead. The FIA and Formula 1, with the full support of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation (AGPC) have therefore taken the decision that all Formula 1 activity for the Australian Grand Prix is cancelled.\u201d On Thursday night, McLaren withdrew after one of its team members returned a positive test for Covid-19, casting a huge shadow over the viability of the weekend\u2019s racing at Albert Park. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio declared a state of emergency Thursday in the city, saying he anticipated that New York could see as many as 1,000 cases next week. He said that the emergency order allows for the city to take certain actions, but that none of them had been activated, including closing down public transportation, AP reports. New York City officials moved swiftly Thursday to address a false text message spreading on social media claiming that the police department was planning to put containment actions in place this weekend to address the spread of the coronavirus, including a shutdown of Metro-North rail lines and limited subway service. De Blasio called the claims \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201coff base\u201d during an afternoon news conference discussing the decision to declare the state of emergency. He speculated the information leaked from scenario planning and said it was not from plans being put in place. De Blasio said a total shutdown would be unrealistic for a variety of reasons, including that it would make it impossible for people like health care workers to get around. Later he tweeted, \u201cNO, there is NO TRUTH to rumors about Manhattan being quarantined. Whoever is spreading this misinformation, PLEASE STOP NOW!\u201d The New York Police Department responded to the message tweeting from NYPD News: Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Aaron Donovan confirmed to The Associated Press that there were no plans to suspend railroad service. The state of New York has reported more than 320 cases of the virus, 95 of them in New York City. New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday that New York would ban all gatherings with 500 or more people to battle the coronavirus. The cancellations Thursday rolled in like clockwork as act after act announced changes to their touring schedules. Among them were the Who, Cher, Blake Shelton, Dan + Shay and Billie Eilish, who was set to play New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Broadway theatres announced that they would close immediately and remain dark through April 12. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coronavirus live blog. The effect of the virus on major sporting events continues today, as Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta tests positive for Covid-19 and the Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled. Markets are expected to suffer further blows after a disastrous day on Thursday. The Australian market fell almost 7% on opening, setting it up for a second day running of heavy losses due to the coronavirus crisis. The Australian Grand Prix has been cancelled. A member of the McLaren Racing Team has tested positive for Covid-19. Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta has tested positive for coronavirus. In a statement the club said Arsenal employees who have had recent close contact with Arteta will now self isolate. 121 people at Italy\u2019s Juventus F.C. are self isolating after footballer Daniele Rugani tested positive for the virus. There is heightened concern at the White House after a picture emerged of a top Brazilian government aide, who has tested positive for coronavirus, standing right next to Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend. French President Emmanuel Macron described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201cthe most serious health crisis France had faced in a century\u201d. This was the first time he has addressed the French on the outbreak. UK prime minister Boris Johnson said that many families \u201care going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d, as he indicated a shift in the government\u2019s approach to coronavirus from \u201ccontain\u201d to \u201cdelay\u201d. The EU condemned Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral ban on travel from 26 European countries. The presidents of the European commission and European council defended Europe\u2019s record in managing the pandemic and sharply criticised the White House for its failure to consult its allies. President Trump\u2019s handling of the virus outbreak was also criticised by top federal health official Dr Anthony Fauci who described the US\u2019s lacklustre approach to coronavirus testing \u201ca failing\u201d. Markets continued to plummet today as the US and UK stock exchanges suffered their worst performance since Black Monday in 2008. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares suffered its second worst day ever. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau revealed he is self-isolating after his wife returned from a visit to the UK with flu-like symptoms, including a fever.

      "bodyText": "He fingered the microphone and put his lips up close. He shook hands with everyone he could. Donald Trump, who promised you\u2019re going to win so much you\u2019ll get sick of winning, might also just make you sick. In the White House rose garden on Friday, the US president defied the advice of medical experts standing behind him and behaved like a one-man coronavirus cannon. Trump declared a national emergency (\u201ctwo very big words\u201d, said the man known for his misspelled tweets) that would release up to $50bn to combat the pandemic, which this week topped 2,000 cases and had the lamps going out all over America. Reporters wanted to know whether this 73-year-old man with a poor diet \u2013 his former doctor reportedly hid cauliflower in his mashed potatoes \u2013 is putting himself and others at risk. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s press secretary tested positive for coronavirus days after taking part in meetings with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Should Trump therefore self-isolate? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know that I had exposure, but I don\u2019t have any of the symptoms,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd we do have a White House doctor and, I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. And I asked them that same question, and they said, \u2018You don\u2019t have any symptoms whatsoever.\u2019 And we don\u2019t want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant.\u201d But later another reporter pushed him harder, noting that a person without symptoms might still be infected. Question: \u201cAre you being selfish by not getting tested and potentially exposing \u2013 \u201d Trump: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t going to be tested.\u201d Question: \u201cAre you going to be?\u201d Trump: \u201cMost likely, yeah. Most likely.\u201d Question: \u201cWhen do you think that will happen?\u201d Trump: \u201cNot for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway. Fairly soon.\u201d Coronavirus is a crisis of a different magnitude from those faced by Trump before. It has upended daily life and left liberals cursing the cosmic dice: how come Tom Hanks is infected while Trump gets off scot-free? When the celebrity businessman has his back to the wall, he calls for the cavalry of corporate America. At Friday\u2019s press conference he rolled in business titans to save the day, treating them to plenty of handshakes and little social distancing. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world,\u201d he said, presumably hoping to reassure the stock market. \u201cThey\u2019re standing right behind me and to the side of me ... they\u2019re celebrities in their own right.\u201d Trump announced that \u201cdrive-thru\u201d testing centers would be set up in parking lots at CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens stores. This, he hopes, will resolve a spectacularly awful time lag in testing kits being made available. America has been put to shame by South Korea. The wartime president Harry Truman used to keep a sign on his desk that said: \u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d Trump, however, seems eager to wash his hands of the matter, if not actually wash his hands. \u201cYeah, no, I don\u2019t take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Then Yamiche Alcindor of PBS asked why, in 2018, Trump had dissolved the White House\u2019s National Security Council directorate for global health security and biodefense. Like a schoolboy caught red-handed, he blustered: \u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s a nasty question because what we\u2019ve done is \u2013 and Tony has said numerous times that we\u2019ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing. And when you say \u2018me\u2019, I didn\u2019t do it. We have a group of people I could \u2013 \u201d Alcindor followed up. Trump rambled: \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2013 it\u2019s the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.\u201d It is not the first time he has resorted to the word \u201cnasty\u201d when asked a tough question by a woman of colour. The buck stops here.",

Following a meeting with state premiers on Friday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced mass gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The announcement has thrown sporting codes into chaos, spun the arts industry into disarray and led to the cancellation of major events such as the Royal Easter Show and the Melbourne Grand Prix. But despite that, Australia\u2019s famous cluster of theme parks on the Gold Coast say they intend to keep operating. In a statement on Saturday, Village Roadshow, the owner of major parks Movie World, Sea World and Wet\u2019n\u2019Wild, said that after discussions with the Queensland government it believed \u201cthe nature of our business does not apply to this advisory\u201d. The company said it would put in place \u201cadditional stringent hygiene and safety measures\u201d including \u201can increased number of hygiene hand-washing stations,\u201d \u201cupdated signage\u201d about hand-washing techniques and on-site nurses to address the spread of the virus, but would not close. \u201cAt Village Roadshow Theme Parks, the safety and wellbeing of our guests and team members is our utmost priority,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe Council of Australian Government\u2019s advice today regarding public gatherings was directed at static-seated events of more than 500 people for a duration of over two hours. \u201cBased on our discussions with the state government, the nature of our business does not apply to this advisory.\u201d That\u2019s despite other major theme parks including Disneyland and Universal Studios in the US announcing their closure. Disney announced on Friday that it would shut down its California theme parks until the end of March over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, while Florida\u2019s Disney World would close to guests from Sunday. Comcast\u2019s Universal Studios theme park in southern California also said it would close from Saturday and expected to reopen 28 March. The Queensland Electoral Commission will also insist that voters go to the polls for local government elections in the state on 28 March. \u201cThe forthcoming Queensland elections are essential public events required to ensure the continuity of democratic representation and public administration across the state,\u201d the Queensland electoral commissioner, Pat Vidgen, said. \u201cIt is extremely unlikely that more than 500 people would ever be in a polling booth at any one time, and electors generally only spend a short period of time in a booth. \u201cThe ECQ will continue to monitor advice being issued by health authorities to ensure that the elections are conducted with minimal risk to the health and safety of Queenslanders.\u201d Home affairs minister Peter Dutton, a Queensland resident, has taken the state\u2019s coronavirus figure to 35.

But the rodent is in the sights of another predator \u2013 a mammoth drone carrying hundreds of kilograms of deadly poison. This scene could soon be playing out across New Zealand\u2019s most rugged wilderness as the Department of Conservation (DoC) considers a new high-tech strategy to halt the country\u2019s biodiversity crisis. A drone, which is seven metres long and looks like a mini-helicopter, is being developed to wipe out pests in areas that humans simply can\u2019t access due to steep cliffs, deep ravines and impenetrable vegetation. Conservation rangers usually hike into remote spots to lay bait stations and traps to kill stoats, rats and possums; invasive species the government has vowed to eradicate from the whole country by 2050. For hard to reach parts of the wilderness, manned helicopters have been extensively used by DoC, but the department is now investigating cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives in an increasingly climate-aware age. By the hour, drones are two-thirds cheaper than helicopters, and emit 85% less carbon, drone manufacturers say \u2013 a priority for a left-leaning government that has committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. Drones are more precise than helicopters, and are able to drop their bait loads within centimetres of the target, an important consideration when accidental poisonings of endangered native species are still occurring. \u201cRestoring nature so indigenous species can thrive requires new tools and technologies,\u201d minister of conservation Eugenie Sage said. \u201cDrones have the potential to be a game-changer.\u201d Brent Beaven, head of the Predator Free 2050 programme at DoC, said more than 1 million hectares of land was being targeted for pest eradication \u201cso there\u2019s plenty of New Zealand\u201d for the drones to deal with. \u201cWe are in a changing world, we can use helicopters for a lot of stuff, but our carbon footprint needs to track towards zero, we need to be looking at other options,\u201d Beaven said. \u201cMy dream is that one day we\u2019ll have artificial intelligence devices that will detect the presence of a pest somewhere that will automatically link to a messaging service that will send a drone out \u2013 wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d Beaven said after three years of exterminating pests on 117 offshore islands the next phase of the project was \u201cscience\u201d. A sum of NZ$790,000 (\u00a3390,000) has been awarded to Kiwi startup Environment &amp; Conservation Technologies (ECT) to engineer drone technology designed to withstand the unique challenges of the New Zealand bush, which include harsh sub-alpine environments and violent, unpredictable weather. ECT has undertaken similar pest eradication programmes using drones in the Pacific and the Galapagos islands. In the Galapagos, an infestation of black and brown rats was threatening the survival of the vulnerable, ground-dwelling bird population, and two drones were deployed by ECT to drop 1.5 tonnes of bait over 184 hectares in two days. The South American regional director of Island Conservation, Karl Campbell, who worked alongside ECT said drones saved the conservation group hundreds of thousands of dollars, and were far quicker and less invasive than traditional pest eradication measures. Helicopters were previously used. \u201cThe use of drones is more precise; it also increases feasibility, and reduces eradication costs of invasive rodents in small and mid-size islands worldwide,\u201d Campbell said. The successful eradication of the rat invasion on the Galapagos is thought to be a world first. Using knowledge gained in the Galapagos project, Sam Vye of ECT said the potential for drones in the conservation arena was \u201cexciting\u201d; though he ruled out weaponising the machines for armed pest extermination from the sky. \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s environment has extreme terrain and vegetation type and can be extremely dangerous for people on the ground to lay bait stations,\u201d Vye said. \u201cUsing a drone we can actually fly in slightly more dangerous conditions than a manned helicopter, including to remote islands which are expensive for helicopters to get to. Compared to a manned helicopter, it also comes down to the precision and the placement of baits.\u201d The drone being developed for use in the New Zealand back country will be able to carry up to 170kg of bait. It requires only a drone pilot on the ground and an office worker to control it. So far the government has totally eradicated introduced pests from 117 offshore islands, and is now focusing its attention on the mainland. The drone trial will run over the next two years and involve three phased stages of testing.",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak include: The global death toll reached 5,359, while 142,557 cases have been confirmed In addition, 70,176 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The institution draws from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. The US president declared a national emergency Donald Trump, who started out by dismissing coronavirus as a hoax, took the major step of designating it a national emergency. That allowed him to sweep aside a host of rules and regulations in order to try to stop its spread. But he repeatedly refused to accept any responsibility for his own administration\u2019s response to the outbreak. Europe now at the centre of the pandemic, WHO says Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the continent has more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined \u2013 not including China. Downing Street U-turn as UK prepares to ban mass gatherings A Whitehall source briefed reporters that ministers are working on a plan to stop \u201cvarious types of public event, including mass gatherings, beginning next week\u201d. UK death toll reaches 11 as Scotland\u2019s first death is confirmed The nation\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said the patient was an \u201colder person who had underlying health conditions\u201d. UK could be added to the US\u2019s travel ban, Trump says Responding to news of a significant uptick in the number of UK cases, Trump indicated he was thinking of extended his ban to a country he has thus far protected, while taking others off the list. UK sporting events and elections postponed Almost all professional football in Britain, including a significant portion of the grassroots game, was suspended. Rugby fixtures were put off and the London Marathon was postponed. In golf, the Masters, which is played in the US, was also cancelled. Local and mayoral elections due to take place in the UK later this year were put back to 2021. Host of countries announce strict new measures Among them are Spain, which also declared a national emergency, France and Canada, as well as Cyprus, Bosnia and Switzerland. Ivanka Trump working from home after contact with infected Australian government minister Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, who serves in the White House, will not self-quarantine despite coming into close contact with the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton.",

And furthermore, we must be honest with the American people and communicate as effectively and directly as we can with all of the scientific information that we can provide.</em><em>Further, and most importantly, our response to this entire crisis must be guided by the decisions of doctors, scientists, and researchers, not politicians. </em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And then Sanders pivoted to his signature issue, healthcare.

      "bodyText": "That does it for me on the west coast as we close out a very busy day for coronavirus news. Here are some of the day\u2019s key moments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that a deal has been reached with the Trump administration that would provide relief to help deal with the fallout of coronavirus. The legislation would provide: paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. The Washington Post has reported that a second person who visited President Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend has tested positive for coronavirus. It\u2019s the second person in as many days who\u2019s had coronavirus and been near the president, a widely reported germaphobe. International passengers are still stuck on the Grand Princess, the stricken cruise ship that docked in Oakland early this week. Fourteen passengers will likely remain there for the weekend. Officials initially said it would take three days to clear all passengers from the boat. It\u2019s now day 5. Trump blasted PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor for pressing him on whether he takes responsibility for axing the Global Health Security team in the National Security Council, which was set up in the wake of the Ebola outbreak to make sure that the government response to a pandemic would be coordinated. Former officials describe it as the lynchpin of the response mechanism. Trump called the question \u201cnasty.\u201d The outbreak of the new coronavirus has been boon for a number of companies, including those that sell disinfecting wipes, hand sanitizers and toilet paper. But the pandemic also has sales soaring on another bathroom item: the bidet. Home product company Brondell, which sells various types of bidet toilet seats, heated and unheated, has seen an increase in sales over the last few days, a company spokesperson told Business Insider. The spokesperson said Brondell is selling a bidet on Amazon every two minutes, or about one thousand units per day. The company reportedly earned $100,000 in one day this week through Amazon sales, an \u201cexponential\u201djump from its average daily sales. San Francisco mayor London Breed on Friday put a 30-day pause on evicting tenants who cant pay rent due to impacts from the coronavirus. The San Fransisco Examiner reports that Breed is using her legal authority under a local emergency declaration to prevent evictions and is putting the prohibition in place for an initial 30-day period, with the possibility that it could be extended for an additional 30 days. Trump raised eyebrows during the today\u2019s press conference from the Rose Garden when he indicated that the US government is working with Google to build a nationwide website to help people decide whether to get tested. Turns out, it\u2019s not true. The Verge reports that \u201ca much smaller trial website made by another division of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is going up\u201d and that it would only be able to direct people to testing facilities in the Bay Area. Debbie Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, showed a flowchart during the press conference that explained how the website would function. She suggested it would be a way for people to enter symptoms and get directed to a nearby \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing facility. Verge points out that very few details are known about this website, including its URL, when it will launch or how it will work. But what is certain is that Google didn\u2019t build it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that a deal has been reached with the Trump administration that would provide relief to help deal with the fallout of coronavirus. Trump hasn\u2019t yet said publicly whether he backs it. \u201cWe are proud to have reached an agreement with the Administration to resolve outstanding challenges, and now will soon pass the Families First Coronavirus Response Act,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter. The legislation would provide paid emergency leave with two weeks of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave. It would also expand federal funding for Medicaid to support local, state and tribal health care systems. The announcement comes after Trump denounced the deal in a press conference from the Rose Garden, saying \u201cwe just don\u2019t think they\u2019re giving enough. We don\u2019t think the Democrats are giving enough,\u201d the President said. CNN has more. The California Teachers Association, the most powerful education group in the state, is asking California governor Gavin Newsom to close all K-12 schools and community colleges to prevent the spread of coronavirus. It would be the first state in to adopt such a dramatic measure. Health officials are publicly considering slowing the flow of people across the US-Mexico border. But this time, it\u2019s Mexico that\u2019s eyeing border restrictions. Reuters reports that Mexico so far has only 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus and no deaths \u2014 a sliver of the 1,000 cases and dozens of deaths in the US that have been linked to the virus. That means that some in Mexico are looking at the US as a threat. \u201cThe possible flow of coronavirus would come from the north to the south. If it were technically necessary, we would consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance,\u201d deputy health secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell said at a Friday news conference. \u201cMexico wouldn\u2019t bring the virus to the United States, rather the United States would bring it here.\u201d The Washington Post has reported that second person who visited President Trump\u2019s private Mar-a-Lago estate last weekend has tested positive for coronavirus, according to emails from Republican party officials to other guests who were present. That\u2019s the second person in as many days who\u2019s had coronavirus and been near the president. A Brazilian official who met Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend also tested positive for coronavirus. The unfolding health crisis appears to be edging closer to Trump, a widely reported germaphobe. Alabama\u2019s governor Kay Ivey has issued a state of emergency after the state the state saw its first confirmed case of coronavirus. State of Emergency declarations can make it easier for a state or city access to federal aid. Congress appropriated more than $8 billion to deal with coronavirus and it appears as though even that will fall short. Nearly 19,000 schools have or will close across the US, affecting more than 8.1m students and counting, according to Education Week, one of the few outlets tracking school closures nationally. There are roughly 76 million students in US schools. That number will likely rise as coronavirus spreads to Midwest and rural areas of the country. Hours before the House was scheduled to vote on a package that would provide assistance those affected by the coronavirus outbreak, President Trump criticized the proposal, throwing a compromise into question. \u201cWe don\u2019t think they\u2019re giving enough,\u201d Trump said, referring to Democrats during a midday press conference from the Rose Garden. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing what\u2019s right for the country.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California had previously announced the House would go forward on a vote later in the day on a sweeping package that includes a new paid sick provision, additional unemployment benefits, free virus testing and additional funds for food assistance. The compromise appears to have gotten hung up on a big payroll tax cut, Trump\u2019s highest priority in terms of an economic response to the disaster. The New York Times has more. ABC News is reporting that international passengers are still stuck on board the Grand Princess, the ill-fated cruise ship that docked in Oakland this week Monday. Fourteen of those passengers will reportedly remain at least through the weekend. Public health officials and the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said they expected it would take three days to disembark all passengers. It\u2019s now day five. Passengers who left the ship earlier this week have been transported to military bases and hotels for 14 days of quarantine. The Guardian has spoken with multiple individuals inside quarantine who\u2019ve complained they still haven\u2019t been tested for the coronavirus despite asking for one to be administered. San Francisco Chronicle has posted a tally of cases of the new coronavirus across the Bay Area. The number of total coronavirus cases include: \u2022 277 in California, including 168 in the Bay Area \u2022 1,668 in the U.S., including 41 deaths: 5 in California, 31 in Washington state, 2 in Florida, 1 in New Jersey, 1 in Georgia and 1 in South Dakota \u2022 More than 137,000 in the world and more than 5,000 deaths. More than 69,000 have recovered. Additionally, San Francisco\u2019s mayor London Breed announced emergency child care plans for school closures. Starting Monday, the city\u2019s recreation centers and libraries will suspend regular programming to operate as emergency care facilities and will The provide recreation, learning and three meals a day. Children of healthcare workers, disaster service workers and low-income families will be eligible. Santa Clara County, just outside San Francisco, is banning gatherings of more than 35 people out of concern for coronavirus. More and more gatherings have been canceled across the Bay Area, but so far the ban on groups numbering more than 35 appears to be one of the most conservative approaches to gatherings in California. Twitter is a afire with criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s response to a question from PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor about the president\u2019s responsibility over the nation\u2019s lack of preparedness after he called the question over cuts his administration made to NSC a \u201cnasty one.\u201d But some have pointed out that his response also demonstrated a limited understanding of what an administration actually does. Asked about the cuts, Trump said: \u201cYou say I did that, I don\u2019t know anything about it... It\u2019s the administration. Perhaps they do that, let people go. You used to work for a different newspaper than you do know,\u201d he told Alcindor, turning a question over basic preparedness into a personal one. The Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor Julian Borger has additional insights: Yamiche Alcindor\u2019s \u201cnasty\u201d question to Trump was about the axing of the Global Health Security team in the National Security Council, which was set up in the wake of the Ebola outbreak to make sure that the government response to a pandemic would be coordinated. Former officials describe it as the lynchpin of the response mechanism. In May 2018, John Bolton, national security adviser at the time, got rid of the whole office, as he did not see pandemics as a priority national security threat. Trump\u2019s claim that he knew nothing about it, and still knows nothing about it (on a day he declares a national emergency over a pandemic) is extraordinary. Here\u2019s video of the exchange: Earlier today Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the favorite candidate of grassroots progressives in the 2020 Democratic primary, delivered his own speech on Coronavirus. Before the hourlong press conference Trump held Friday afternoon, Sanders spoke in Vermont: Needless to say we must massively increase the availability of test kits for the coronavirus and the speed at which the tests are processed. We need to anticipate significant increases in hospital admissions, which means that we will need more ICU units and ventilators, we will need more doctors, nurses, and medical personnel of all kinds - and we must make sure that these frontline personnel are well protected from the diseases they are treating. I have talked to nurses recently who worry very much about whether they are getting the kind of knowledge and equipment they need so that they do not get sick. We need to significantly improve our communications and collaboration with other countries to ensure that we are learning everything that we can about the successes and failures of other countries as they deal with this crisis. And furthermore, we must be honest with the American people and communicate as effectively and directly as we can with all of the scientific information that we can provide.Further, and most importantly, our response to this entire crisis must be guided by the decisions of doctors, scientists, and researchers, not politicians. And then Sanders pivoted to his signature issue, healthcare. He argued that the crisis is a reason the country needs to adopt Medicare for All. But as we struggle with this crisis, it is also important that we learn the lessons of how we got to where we are today, and what we must do in the future so that we are better prepared for similar crises that may come. Poll after poll already shows us that the American people understand that we must do what every other major country on earth does, and that is to guarantee healthcare to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege. As we begin to see the failures and vulnerabilities of the current healthcare system, my guess is that those numbers and the demand for universal healthcare will only go up. Here is the unsettling moment Trump hit out at PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor, after she asked him about his closure of the White House\u2019s pandemic response team in 2018: During his press conference in the White House Rose Garden, Trump has said that he doesn\u2019t \u201ctake responsibility at all\u201d for the delays in testing for coronavirus. You can watch the moment here: Here\u2019s how some viewers have been responding: Multiple times during this press conference Trump has been asked about the Brazilian official who met the president and tested positive for Coronavirus. He was asked if he was offering different advice to Americans than he\u2019s practicing himself. \u201cI think they have to listen to their doctors and they shouldn\u2019t be jumping to get the test unless they have it,\u201d Trump said. In response to a followup question Trump said he would \u201cprobably\u201d be tested \u201cvery soon.\u201d Asked how long the national emergency would go on for, Trump did not give a specific answer. \u201cI hope not long,\u201d Trump said. But, he added, \u201cit gives us the power it needs to get rid of the virus.\u201d He also said that the Trump administration is in touch with other countries dealing with the Coronavirus. \u201cThey\u2019re calling us and asking for advice. They\u2019re calling for advice from the people behind me,\u201d Trump said. Here\u2019s quite an awkward moment from Trump\u2019s speech that has been spotted and shared by one viewer The spread of the Coronavirus has not been lost on Trump, his team, and the businesspeople at this press conference. At one point vice president Mike Pence said \u201cThe truth is, we now have coronavirus cases in 46 of the American states.\u201d The Guardian has a regularly updated map tracking the spread of Coronavirus cases across the country. See it here. It\u2019s important to note that Trump, during a question and answer session following his remarks, was asked whether he or his staff were taking any precautions to make sure they get tests for Coronavirus. Trump stressed repeatedly that he and his staff did not have any exposure. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve had any exposure but I don\u2019t have any symptoms,\u201d Trump said. Back at the podium, Trump stressed the importance of local governments to stay consistent in their steps to fight coronavirus. A number of governors around the country have issued bans of large gatherings at varying levels. \u201cWe must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions we take,\u201d Trump said. Then Trump made a small tangent to note all the major sporting events that have been postponed, canceled, or dramatically scaled back to prevent transmission of the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible with what\u2019s happened to the sports of the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a great service.\u201d Trump continued: \u201cWe can learn and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of these doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through. Interesting terms. And very accurate. In a number of weeks I think you will find it\u2019s a very accurate term.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, the top Democratic senator in Congress, released a statement welcoming Trump\u2019s invocation of the Stafford Act. His response, blasted out before Trump\u2019s presser ended, is below: \u201cI\u2019m pleased the president heeded our calls to invoke the Stafford Act to extend vital financial assistance to help keep communities safe from the coronavirus outbreak. I urge New York and other states to immediately request these newly available funds and for the Trump administration to approve these requests without delay. \u201cAs other steps are considered, the president must not overstep his authority or indulge his autocratic tendencies for purposes not truly related to this public health crisis.\u201d Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration is already coming under heavy criticism, and not just because he was about 30 minutes late to deliver it. First of all, his decision to announce it by saying \u201cnational emergency, two very big words\u201d hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. His delivery has also been questioned, as well as his strange aside on Google: And then there was his decision to shake hands with members of his team: There are still questions over Trump\u2019s status at the moment, as he has recently came into contact with at least one person who has tested positive for coronavirus. Trump moved on to introducing representatives from partner organizations working with the White House to combat the coronavirus. They include representatives from Walmart, Walgreens, LHC Group and Signify Health. Most of the business people gave brief remarks about how eager their respective companies are to help. Trump then said as part of the Coronavirus response \u201cwe\u2019ll be changing a lot of the rules and regulations for [the] future\u201d. \u201cI guess that\u2019ll continue to an extent but we hope it never happens but we\u2019ll be changing a lot of the wholes and speculations,\u201d Trump said. Trump added: \u201cI\u2019ve waived interest on all student loans held by government agencies.\u201d The president said he instructed the secretary of energy, Dan Brouillette, to buy \u201clarge quantities\u201d of gasoline \u201cin the US strategic reserve\u201d. Dr. Deborah Birx took a few minutes to explain a new Coronavirus website for texting. She held up a chart to explain how the website would work (C-SPAN\u2019s Craig Caplan snapped a picture). Trump in his remarks said that as part of the national emergency declaration, \u201cthe action I am taking will open up $50 billion.\u201d Trump, flanked by aides including vice-president Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah Birx, also said the move will waive a number of other requirements meant to benefit doctors and fight the Coronavirus pandemic. There\u2019s been an ongoing concern about the availability of tests for the Coronavirus. Trump said his team expected \u201chalf a million additional tests will be available early next week.\u201d \u201cWhich will bring probably 1.4 million tests next week and five million in a month,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.\u201d Donald Trump on Friday afternoon declared a national emergency to address the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic. The declaration, made from the White House Rose Garden during a press conference, comes as the Trump administration grapples with the ongoing outbreak. Donald Trump is late to this press conference where he\u2019s expected to declare a national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tardiness is unlikely to allay ongoing tensions among the American public about the federal government\u2019s plans for fighting the Coronavirus. Daniel Strauss taking over the blog here for a bit. Over in Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster. The Dallas Morning News has more: Gov. Greg Abbott is declaring a \u201cstate of disaster\u201d over coronavirus disease 2019, and announced that the state on Friday opened a drive-through testing center in San Antonio, with ones to follow soon in Dallas, Houston and Austin. Under state law, in such a disaster, Abbott becomes \u201ccommander in chief of state agencies, boards, and commissions having emergency responsibilities.\u201d As he did with the four drive-through testing centers, the governor can direct supplies, equipment, materials and facilities to mitigate the disaster. Abbott also is directing state health care regulatory agencies to tell nursing homes, assisted living centers and hospitals to restrict visitation. While he didn\u2019t by executive order ban mass gatherings, Abbott strongly discouraged large meetings until public health officials have a better grasp of how many Texans have contracted COVID-19 or are at risk of doing so. Virginia closes schools amidst coronavirus concerns Virginia governor Ralph Northam just announced that Virginia schools will be closed for a minimum of two weeks as the spread of Covid-19 continues in the area. The announcement means that all schools in the DMV area \u2013 Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia \u2013 will be closed for most of the month. Major US companies tell their employees to work from home Thousands of employees of major US companies have been instructed to work from home if they are able to given the spread of Covid-19. Ford, General Motors and AT&amp;T have all told their employees to work from home if possible. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have instructed their staff in New York City to work from home as the number of cases in the New York City metro area rises. Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s business editor Dominic Rushe on the effect coronavirus is having on employees and the economy: The long-term economic impact of the shuttering of America will take weeks if not longer to assess. Michael Pearce, senior US economist at CapitalEconomics, said the escalating response to the crisis from the US government, closing schools, banning large gatherings, will take a \u2018sharp toll on the economy\u2019. Capital Economics has cut its US growth forecast for 2020 to just 0.6%, down from 1.8%. Nancy Pelosi holds brief press conference on coronavirus aid package Speaker Nancy Pelosi just gave a short press conference \u2013 taking no questions from reports \u2013 detailing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act that House Democrats are planning to pass today. Pelosi said the bill\u2019s main component is \u201ctesting, testing, testing\u2019. \u201cThis legislation facilitates free testing for everyone who needs a test, including the insured,\u201d she said. The speaker also said that federal sick leave and unemployment support was also a priority. During the press conference, which only lasted a few minutes, Pelosi did not divulge any information on how talks with her Republican counterparts in the White House are going. Trump is expected to speak in the Rose Garden at 3pm for his own press conference on the coronavirus outbreak. House majority leader says chamber will vote on coronavirus aid package today House Democratic majority leader Steny Hoyer released a statement saying the House will put up the coronavirus aid package up for a vote regardless of whether they have the support of their Republican colleagues. Hoyer said a vote will take place no earlier than 2:30, after Speaker Nancy Pelosi has a press conference on the bill at 2pm. We\u2019ll be tuning in. Delta airlines to reduce capacity to by 40% In response to the coronavirus outbreak, Delta just announced that it is reducing its capacity by 40% \u2013 the largest capacity reduction in the company\u2019s history. The company said it will eliminate all flights to Europe, with the exception of London, for the next 30 days with the possibility of extension. It will also be trying to cut down its workforce, offering voluntary, short-term unpaid leaves and will reduce the number of consultants and contractors it works with. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is set to give a press conference in 15 minutes on a coronavirus aid package the House deliberated on this morning. What is a national emergency? Donald Trump, as president, has the power to declare a national emergency, which gives power to the federal government to more freely redistribute funds to state and local governments in a time of the crisis. The president is set to declare a national emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak under the Stafford Act, which was signed into law in 1988 and is designed to encourage local municipalities to design and run their own disaster mitigation efforts, with federal assistance. The last time Trump declared a national emergency was in February 2019 when he declared a national emergency to divert funding for his border wall. That national emergency was declared under a different act, the 1976 National Emergencies Act. The Guardian\u2019s voting rights reporter Sam Levine: Louisiana will postpone its April 4 presidential preference primary amid ongoing concern over coronavirus, Kyle Ardoin, the state\u2019s top election official announced on Friday. The Democratic contest will be postponed until June 20. Ardoin is acting to the contest using a provision in state law that allows him to move an election in an emergency situation, according to the Advocate. Louisiana is the first state to postpone its primary election as the nation tries to contain the spread of the virus. Election officials in other states are rushing to implement last-minute changes to safeguard against the virus. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose this week ordered local election officials to relocate all polling stations from senior centers and assisted living facilities. Some election officials in Illinois and Florida are taking similar steps. Throughout the country, local election offices are taking extra sanitization steps, providing wipes and hand sanitizer at polling stations. More reports are suggesting that Donald Trump will be declaring a national emergency at a 3pm press conference today. Miami mayor tests positive for coronavirus The mayor of Miami, Florida Francis Suarez has tested positive for coronavirus, the Miami Herald is reporting. Suarez attended an event with a Brazilian government official earlier this week who has since tested positive with coronavirus. Suarez announced earlier this week that he was not displaying any symptoms, but self-quarantined himself out of safety precaution once he learned that one of Bolsonaro\u2019s staff members tested positive. Suarez was one of several politicians who interacted with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and his staff, along with Donald Trump and his staff, when they came to Miami earlier this week. Earlier today, reports said Bolsonaro tested positive for coronavirus, but now other reports are saying the test came back negative. Trump may declare national emergency at 3pm press conference Three Bloomberg reporters are saying that multiple sources have told them that Donald Trump will announce a national emergency over coronavirus at a press conference this afternoon. Declaring a national emergency will allow an easier flow of federal aid to state and local governments who are responding to outbreaks. There are multiple reports that the White House Chief of Staff\u2019s has called for an \u201curgent meeting\u201d among staff because of news that Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who met with Donald Trump Saturday, has reportedly tested positive for covid-19. Donald Trump just tweeted that he will hold a press conference at 3pm EST on coronavirus. We got a sneak peak of what he will say from a tweet he posted moments earlier. He said the 40 coronavirus-related deaths in the US is due to the \u201cvery strong border policy\u201d in place. \u201cIf we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!\u201d he wrote. Keep in mind that the number of cases in the US has been rising dramatically over the past few weeks, yet Trump has stuck to praising himself and his administration for having a handle on a situation that is getting increasingly dire. Boston Marathon postponed until September State and local officials have postponed the Boston Marathon until 14 September over fears of the coronavirus outbreak. The race was originally scheduled for 20 April. WGBH reported that this is the first time the marathon has been delayed in its 124-year history. About 30,000 people run the marathon each year. States experiencing dramatic coronavirus outbreaks are unable to use Medicaid more freely to respond to the outbreak by expanding medical care, the Los Angeles Times is reporting. The White House has tools it can use to assist states looking to bolster their healthcare efforts, but so far, the Trump administration has not made any moves to ease the burden on states. As coronavirus has intensified in the US over the last few weeks, Trump has tried to downplay the effect that the illness will have on Americans. He called the illness Democrats\u2019 \u201cnew hoax\u201d and has compared it to the flu, which has a far lower mortality rate. Additionally, as the LA Times point out, Seema Verna, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has been a champion of conservative states who have been trying to cut the number of people on Medicaid. Here\u2019s more from the LA Times: Months into the current global disease outbreak, the White House and senior federal health officials haven\u2019t taken the necessary steps to give states simple pathways to fully leverage the mammoth safety net program to prevent a wider epidemic. That\u2019s making it harder for states to quickly sign up poor patients for coverage so they can get necessary testing or treatment if they are exposed to coronavirus. And it threatens to slow efforts by states to bring on new medical providers, set up emergency clinics or begin quarantining and caring for homeless Americans at high risk from the virus. Ted Cruz extends his self-quarantine Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said in a statement that he has extended his self-quarantine after learning that another person he interacted with on 3 March has tested positive for Covid-19. Cruz tweeted on Sunday that he was in self-quarantine after learning that an attendee at the Conservative Political Action Conference he interacted with tested positive for coronavirus. Cruz said in today\u2019s statement that his self-quarantine was supposed to end tonight and he is showing no symptoms, but will extend his self-quarantine until 17 March. Utah passes bill banning abortions if Roe v. Wade is overturned Yesterday, the Utah state legislature passed a bill that would ban all elective abortions \u2013 which excludes abortion procedures for maternal health or procedure disease \u2013 if Roe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. The bill is a signal that conservative states are gearing up for an overturn of the decision in the near future. Under Donald Trump, the Supreme Court has had two conservative appointees who have had reservations about Roe v. Wade and the right to abortion. Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments for June Medical Services v. Russo, a case from Louisiana about a law that significantly restricts abortion access by requiring doctors at abortion clinics to be registered at nearby hospitals. The law is similar to one the Supreme Court overturned in 2016. The swing vote for the decision is likely to be chief justice John Roberts, who is known for being an institutionalist who does not like to disturb precedent. Good morning, this is Lauren Aratani taking over. The US Food and Drug Administration just sent out word that they will allow New York state\u2019s health department to begin authorizing labs to conduct their own testing for Covid-19 once their tests have been validated. Testing has been a serious concern in New York state and the US overall, with many fearing there is a shortage of available and quick testing for people who are showing symptoms. New York governor Andrew Cuomo told CNN that the US is \u201cway behind on testing\u201d and called the \u201cfederal bottleneck\u201d so bad that he authorized New York officials to contract private labs for testing. US Central Command Commander General Kenneth McKenzie is briefing reporters at the Pentagon on the strikes yesterday against Iranian-backed Shia militia facilities in Iraq. You can watch it here. Trump is weighing in on what he wants approved by legislators today - and unsurprisingly it his payroll tax cut plan, not some of the more directly coronavirus-related measures that Democrats on Capitol Hill have been trying to get passed. The house is expected to continue discussion on a coronavirus economic stimulus package when it opens - you\u2019ll be able to watch it here. Noam Levey is reporting for the LA Times on how the Trump administration isn\u2019t allowing states to use Medicaid more freely to respond to the coronavirus crisis by expanding medical services. One reason federal health officials have not acted appears to be President Trump\u2019s reluctance to declare a national emergency. That\u2019s a key step that would clear the way for states to get Medicaid waivers to more nimbly tackle coronavirus, but it would conflict with Trump\u2019s repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the epidemic. Another element may be ideological: The administration official who oversees Medicaid, Seema Verma, has been a champion of efforts by conservative states to trim the number of people enrolled. Read it here - LA Times: Trump administration blocks states from using Medicaid to respond to coronavirus crisis It is K-9 Veterans Day today. Not an official holiday, of course, but one that is being observed by Donald Trump, who has just issued a White House statement about it. On National K-9 Veterans Day, I join our Nation in celebrating and honoring the important job performed each day by America\u2019s dedicated working dogs who support our military. Established in 1942, the K-9 Corps is a critical part of our armed forces. Since its founding, more than 30,000 dogs have served in America\u2019s military, with approximately 2,500 active Military Working Dogs currently helping to defend our freedom. The president goes on to praise again Conan, the working dog that was part of the raid that lead to the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in October last year. Here\u2019s a clip of the president appearing with Conan back in November. Associated Press is reporting that the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) has endorsed Joe Biden for president, an influential nod of support that could bolster his 2020 Democratic campaign. The endorsement by Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California on Friday is the latest testament of a growing coalescence of support for Biden\u2019s White House bid says AP. Biden\u2019s campaign has seen a resurgence powered by black voters, who have helped cement his front-runner status after commanding wins in several recent primaries, including in South Carolina, in several Southern states and just this week in Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me that he is the best person, not just to beat (President Donald) Trump, but he is the person to lead at this time,\u201d Bass said in an interview. \u201cI think him having a long-standing history of working with African American communities, most notably in his own state but around the country, was qualitatively different from the other candidates.\u201d Bass said she held off endorsing a candidate because two CBC members, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, were running for president. Booker and Harris have since dropped out and endorsed Biden. The CBC as a whole is not officially endorsing a candidate, Bass said, but the majority of members have already announced support for Biden. Although Biden has strong support within the African American community, especially among older voters, concerns have been raised about his ability to energize young and progressive voters. \u201cAs this race settles down, it is my job personally and the job of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to be extremely clear with people in our districts what is at stake here, and what is at stake is their future,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job that we\u2019ve all been doing over the last 3 1/2 years, but we have to step it up.\u201d Asked whether Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard should drop out of the race to unite the party before the Democratic National Convention, Bass said she believes the primary process needs to run its course and allow every voter the chance to weigh in. \u201cI would never be in a position to say, \u2018You need to drop out,\u2019\u201d Bass said. \u201cI do think, though, that math is math.\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was on CBS This Morning talking about the coronavirus, and particularly about the availability - or lack of - testing kits in the US. Here\u2019s the clip: Politico this morning also have a look at what a difference the virus outbreak is going to make to election campaigning this year. Both Biden and Sanders\u2019 teams have already been ordered to work from home. Strategists are gaming out how the lack of in-person campaigning might affect Trump and Biden. Trump\u2019s signature mega-rallies, a source of psychic uplift for the president, are on ice. Biden, a tactile politician whose best moments are often on rope lines interacting one-on-one with voters, will be denied those opportunities for the foreseeable future. Fundraising is also being disrupted. Biden has been forced to move his donor events online. And on Wednesday, the president scrapped a much-anticipated fundraiser. There\u2019s another element - how the president is viewed to have handled the emergency is going to be a big factor in November\u2019s vote now Read it here - Politico: Coronavirus consumes Trump\u2019s reelection bid YouGov and Yahoo! News conducted a poll between March 10 - 11 looking at what Americans felt about the Trump administration\u2019s handling of coronavirus, and it doesn\u2019t make for great reading for the president. 53 percent of the polled US adults did not have faith in the president to tell the truth about the threat of the new coronavirus. Women were less likely to trust the president than men. Newsweek has more on the poll here. It can\u2019t help when the president makes notable errors and omissions when announcing coronavirus measures. Our Voting Rights Editor Ankita Rao has been talking to people for who it is Bernie or bust, people who will support Sanders, but will not back Biden - even against Donald Trump. This year, Martha Baez, a 54-year-old who works in finance, is planning to vote for Sanders in the New York primary, and will not vote for Biden if he is the nominee in November. But she said her real issue was not with the specific candidate, but losing trust in the Democratic party. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I should put aside my values and vote out of fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe DNC needs an overhaul, it lacks values, real leaders that represent the people not its donors.\u201d Read it here - Bernie or Bust: the Sanders fans who will never vote for Biden Incidentally Ankita has been asking people to get in touch if coronavirus is changing their plans for voting in Florida next week. Misyrlena Egkolfopoulou at Bloomberg has been looking at the impact coronavirus is likely to have on the race for the White House. It\u2019s an added challenge for all three campaigns. With the Democratic race down to two candidates - and with Biden solidly in the lead - interest in the contest would naturally shrink somewhat. Combine that with the pandemic\u2019s overwhelming impact on the economy and daily life, getting voters\u2019 attention is going to be difficult - and expensive. Aside from the obvious reduction in hand-shaking and picking up babies for those cute pictures, the teams are going to have to get more creative digitally. Read it here - Bloomberg: Coronavirus roils 2020 race, forcing a virtual campaign season The president is tweeting - and he is criticising the federal agency responsible for keeping the US safe from coronavirus - and of course somehow it is Barack Obama\u2019s fault as well. He claims, without providing any evidence, that changes he has made now mean that widespread testing for coronavirus will shortly start. There has been widespread criticism of the administration over the lack of testing - just eight tests were carried out on Tuesday. Good morning. It is very much not politics as normal as the US continues to get to grips with the fall-out from the coronavirus outbreak, and the administration\u2019s attempts to handle it. Colleges across the US have begun canceling and curtailing graduation ceremonies, and March Madness is off. The president will be meeting industry executives about the Covid-19 response at 1:30pm. There is a bit of voting action due at the weekend. The Northern Mariana Islands don\u2019t take part in November\u2019s presidential election, but they do have a Democratic caucus tomorrow. It awards six pledged delegate - and in 2016 they broke four-two in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favour over Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden currently leads Sanders 881 to 725. Coronavirus is affecting the candidates\u2019 ability to campaign in public - Joe Biden will take part in a virtual town hall in Illinois at 5pm.",

      "bodyText": "The devastation wrought on the Australian stockmarket by the coronavirus pandemic has made it impossible for companies to raise fresh money, with two bank funding injections totalling at least $2.5bn called off. Billions of dollars in other attempts to raise money have also been cancelled as investors close their wallets after two wild weeks of trading erased more than a year\u2019s worth of gains. \u201cEffectively, the window to raise capital is closed,\u201d said fund manager Geoff Wilson of Wilson Asset Management, who himself this week canned a plan for one of his funds to buy between $10m and $20m worth of shares back from investors. Asked if he thought it would open again any time soon, he said: \u201cNo. \u201cIt would only be the desperate who would be raising [money] at the moment,\u201d another market observer said. On Thursday evening, after the biggest one-day fall on the Australian market since 1987, NAB abandoned plans to raise about $2bn by selling investors notes \u2013 financial instruments that pay a steady flow of coupons. It\u2019s believed the decision was taken following what sources said were \u201crobust\u201d discussions by the NAB board. Smaller rival Macquarie followed suit on Friday morning, as the market was again plunging, yanking a $500m note issue of its own. The notes, known as hybrids because they have some of the characteristics of shares and some of the characteristics of debt, carry greater risk than either because they are the first to take losses when things go wrong. But they are extremely popular with Australian mum-and-dad investors who have confidence in the strength of the country\u2019s banking sector because they provide relatively high returns. The prices of both were set last month, before the virus smashed the market. But after the falls in the share prices of the banks \u2013 on Friday night, NAB\u2019s share price was down by a third since 20 February and Macquarie\u2019s down almost a quarter over the same period \u2013 those prices became wildly unrealistic. Sources said that if the NAB and Macquarie notes had been issued at pre-crash values then their prices would have immediately crashed once they began to trade, making investors angry and leaving the banks looking like they were under financial pressure. \u201cIf they\u2019d proceeded with it they would have been slaughtered when they came on,\u201d one market source said of the NAB notes. \u201cObviously it\u2019s bad for the investors but it\u2019s also really bad for NAB. \u201cWhich bank wants to issue capital at a massive discount?\u201d Sources say figuring out new prices for the notes was too hard because the markets were too volatile \u2013 a point proven on Friday when, after dropping 8% in early trade, the benchmark ASX 200 rallied to finish the day up more than 4%. Also on Friday, Pengana Private Equity Fund abandoned a $470m capital raising, telling the market that \u201ccurrent market volatility makes it impossible to conduct an orderly process\u201d. The previous day, corporate lender Metrics Credit Partners handed more than $340m back to investors after falling well short on its hopes to raise up to $640m and list a fund on the ASX. Wilson said the market as a whole was in a \u201cfear phase\u201d. \u201cThis is the steepest fall we\u2019ve ever seen in the market,\u201d he said. He said it combined the speed of the falls experienced in the crash of 1987 with the relentlessness of the 2008-09 global financial crisis, when markets around the world fell day after day after day. \u201cThis is the steepest fall we\u2019ve ever seen in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the start of the bear market [in 1987] to the bottom, that was about 50% and it took seven weeks. \u201cThis has been faster. \u201cWe\u2019re a month in and we\u2019re down something like 30%.\u201d",
