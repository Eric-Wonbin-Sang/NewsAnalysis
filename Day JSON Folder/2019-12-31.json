We\u2019re both good at what we do, and after years of slogging away, her latest project has taken off in a big way, with a whole new set of opportunities opening up. I want to feel happy for her in an uncomplicated way, but the moments of envy and \u201cwhy not me?\u201d keep creeping in, and I\u2019ve found myself turning down invitations to catch up because of it. How can I handle those feelings in a healthy way and get back to celebrating her achievement?</strong></p> <p>The comedian Billy Connolly tells a story about going back to his hometown and stopping at the pub to see his old mates. He dreads it because he knows that until the moment he opens the door everyone in that pub is perfectly happy with their lives. But then he walks in, and the lives that seemed full and warm just moments ago suddenly seem tinny and empty to the people who have to live them. He hates making his friends feel tinny.</p> <p>This is a way of saying that your friend is going to be feeling just as weird about this transition as you are. She knows how much of her own story is luck and she knows that your talent is equal to hers, which means that when she goes to sleep in the hotels that look so glamorous from the outside I promise you, on the struggling-artist sacrament of cheap wine, that she feels like she shouldn\u2019t be there. So the good news is you\u2019re in this together. You both want a friendship that doesn\u2019t embarrass you.</p> <p>I think that\u2019s what envy is, often: just curdled embarrassment. It\u2019s not that we resent someone having what we want so much as we\u2019re humiliated by the reminder that we didn\u2019t get it. So your task might be speak candidly to yourself about why your friend\u2019s success makes you squeamish and embarrassed. It could be that you think if you\u2019d worked harder, you could be there too; it might be that deep down you aren\u2019t proud of everything you\u2019ve produced. Whatever uncomfortable thought is at the root of those feelings (and I\u2019d lay good money it\u2019s about yourself) you should pull it out by the roots of its hair and squeeze it until it dies.</p> <p>Then you should go and do the best work you\u2019ve ever done. Take your irritation and make it fuel. Write about it. Tear up what you\u2019ve written and eat it. Do whatever you have to do to get the flywheel in your brain cranking until time goes stripy. Lose yourself in the work, splash in it, hate it, drink it, collapse in a heap at the end of the day knowing you did what Annie Dillard tells writers to do: \u201cspend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time\u201d.</p> <p>Who cares if it gets recognised?

      "bodyText": "It is not exactly glamorous work. Measuring sheep farts is smelly, time consuming and expensive. But for Dr Suzanne Rowe, a scientist who is breeding strains of sheep that emit less methane than regular flocks, there is nothing more important she feels she could be doing. \u201cNew Zealand has really become a global leader in this space and there\u2019s a lot of buzz around at the moment \u2013 it\u2019s hugely exciting,\u201d she says. The release of methane gas from New Zealand sheep and cattle accounts for one third of the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, the single largest contributor in the country. Since 1990, methane gas from stock has increased by 10%, according to the ministry of the environment, along with a 70% increase in dairy cattle and a 44% drop in sheep numbers. Accordingly, methane has found itself in the crosshairs of the government\u2019s climate action policy, and scientists around the country are being given the green light to run free with their best and brightest ideas to lower emissions. Agriculture \u2018must be part of the solution\u2019 In November, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, pushed the Zero Carbon Act through parliament with cross-party support, saying the world was \u201cundeniably warming\u201d and all greenhouse gases must be reduced to net zero by 2050 in order to honour agreements made under the Paris climate accords. \u201cWe have to start moving beyond targets,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cWe have to start moving beyond aspiration. We have to start moving beyond hope and deliver signs of action.\u201d Under the zero carbon legislation, the methane targets are separated out from other greenhouse gases, with the goal of reducing biogenic methane by 10% by 2030, and 24-47% by 2050. \u201cAgriculture is incredibly important to New Zealand,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it also needs to be part of the solution. That is why we have listened to the science and also heard the industry and created a specific target for biogenic methane.\u201d In Nelson, at the top of the South Island, the Cawthron Institute has recently been awarded government funding to cultivate and research a red native seaweed known as Asparagopsis armata. The agriculture minister, Damien O\u2019Connor, has said if this seaweed is able to be mass produced, it could be a \u201cgame-changer for farmers here and around the world\u201d as it has been proven to reduce stock methane emissions by as much as 80% when added as a feed supplement at quantities as low as 2%. \u201cThe holy grail is going to be getting enough of the stuff,\u201d Cawthron chief executive Prof Charles Eason told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s got a complicated life cycle. One of the barriers to getting this to market is growing enough of the stuff in ways that are cost effective to make it commercially viable.\u201d O\u2019Connor said the potential of the seaweed not only in New Zealand but around the globe was \u201chuge\u201d. \u201cOther products typically provide reductions of between 10% and 20%,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralian research estimates that if just 10% of global ruminant producers adopted Asparagopsis as an additive to feed their livestock, it would have the same impact for our climate as removing 50 million cars from the world\u2019s roads.\u201d Building cattle for a climate-altered future Several hundred kilometres north in the Waikato city of Hamilton \u2013 the heart of dairy country \u2013 Dr Bjorn Oback from AgResearch has been given NZ$10m in government funding to design a \u201cclimate-smart cow\u201d. There are more cows than people in New Zealand and while they have become a mainstay of the economy they also draw the ire of environmentalists for their high emissions profile, intensive impact on the land and muddying and polluting waterwarys. Oback says specialised breeding programmes can \u201ctake decades\u201d to reach their desired outcome, but using genetic modification his team can design a climate-smart cow much more quickly and precisely \u2013 though the process remains controversial. As well as working towards manipulating the genes that control methane admissions , Oback is also focused on designing cattle that will thrive in a climate-altered future \u2013 animals that are more heat tolerant, hardy and productive. The five-year programme is only three months in, but is already targeting coat colour adapation \u2013 creating cows that are lighter in colour, making them more heat-tolerant. An important feature of the programme was using \u201celite\u201d cattle, Oback said, so not only would they emit less methane and be climate adaptive \u2013 they\u2019d also be super performers. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a high-performing elite dairy background, and then we\u2019re putting mutations on top of it.\u201d Oback\u2019s work is intertwined with Rowe\u2019s research into low emitting sheep in the south of the country. For Oback to study \u2013 and try to manipulate \u2013 the genes of low-emitting stock, he is invested in the survival of Rowe\u2019s flocks, who are now in their third generation. Rowe and her team\u2019s work is creating a buzz in the agricultural community, because not only do her sheep have low methane emissions, they also produce more wool and are shown to be hardier and healthier than normal sheep.

Domestication and breeding animals is something everybody is familiar with and it\u2019s cumulative. If you breed an animal tomorrow the affect is always there and the offspring that come after them always have that effect.\u201d Many of the methane reduction programmes in New Zealand are in their nascency, with climate smart cows at least five years away and the mass roll-out of Asparagopsis armata at least five to ten. But agricultural scientists and farmers say after decades of indecision and uncertainty concrete action is finally underway in New Zealand \u2013 and it is drawing global attention. Myles Allen is a climate change scientist at Oxford University and head of its Climate Dynamics group. He recently visited New Zealand and said he was impressed with how engaged industry leaders, government and the farming community were. \u201cI only wish New Zealand could convince others \u2026 to take such a sensible approach.\u201d he said.",

Arsenal are a front-foot team, their mindset is to attack and they will remain that way under Arteta\u2019s charge. What he wants is to put a structure in place which will provide numbers on offensive and defensive transitions, allow for options on the ball and spaces between the lines. The early signs in this regard have been encouraging. What he needs to learn is the capacity of the players to operate at his tempo, to make the right decisions and execute them.</p> <p>The balance of the midfield will be key and, more precisely, how to find a role for Mesut \u00d6zil. Arteta\u2019s predecessor, Unai Emery, tried everything with \u00d6zil but there was always the feeling that the off-the-cuff playmaker was not a natural fit for his style.</p> <p>Arteta has given \u00d6zil the central attacking midfield platform that he craves in each of his games so far \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/26/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">draw at Bournemouth</a> and then Chelsea \u2013 and there have been positive signs. \u00d6zil has created chances, although his ability to do that has never been in doubt. With \u00d6zil, it is all about creating an environment; to have him switched on rather than drifting; to find a consistency that has often proved elusive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/29/arsenal-frailties-chelsea-defeat-mikel-arteta\">Arsenal\u2019s innate fatalism means Chelsea loss may not surprise Arteta | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMesut is putting in everything he has and his numbers, physically, have improved so much,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cOn his own he can\u2019t do it.

Arsenal are a front-foot team, their mindset is to attack and they will remain that way under Arteta\u2019s charge. What he wants is to put a structure in place which will provide numbers on offensive and defensive transitions, allow for options on the ball and spaces between the lines. The early signs in this regard have been encouraging. What he needs to learn is the capacity of the players to operate at his tempo, to make the right decisions and execute them. The balance of the midfield will be key and, more precisely, how to find a role for Mesut \u00d6zil. Arteta\u2019s predecessor, Unai Emery, tried everything with \u00d6zil but there was always the feeling that the off-the-cuff playmaker was not a natural fit for his style. Arteta has given \u00d6zil the central attacking midfield platform that he craves in each of his games so far \u2013 the draw at Bournemouth and then Chelsea \u2013 and there have been positive signs. \u00d6zil has created chances, although his ability to do that has never been in doubt. With \u00d6zil, it is all about creating an environment; to have him switched on rather than drifting; to find a consistency that has often proved elusive. \u201cMesut is putting in everything he has and his numbers, physically, have improved so much,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cOn his own he can\u2019t do it. He needs the collective structure, organisation and his teammates. He needs the team to play in a certain way to facilitate his strengths more and more in the game. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do. \u201cI put him in the team if I see every day that his attitude, desire and understanding of what we\u2019re trying to do is there. The moment that this changes, then he won\u2019t play.\u201d Arteta felt a connection between his players and the Emirates crowd during the Chelsea game that \u201cprobably for a long time hasn\u2019t been seen\u201d. But will the bitter late twist have an impact on their confidence? \u201cThat\u2019s my worry now,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cI hope the result doesn\u2019t affect them too much. They were all physically blown and disappointed in how the game ended because they didn\u2019t feel they deserved that but we have to move on. They have to respond. This is the challenge.\u201d",

He wants a new attacking player and not only because he is likely to allow the out-of-favour Olivier Giroud to depart. He has been linked with a host of players, including Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund, Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha and Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 of Lyon. Two of the club\u2019s wingers, Pedro and the in-form Willian, are out of contract in the summer.</p> <p>In addition Lampard would take a left-sided defender, with Bournemouth\u2019s Nathan Ak\u00e9, formerly of Chelsea, a prime target and available for \u00a340m due to a buy-back clause. Lampard also likes the Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell, although any deal for him is unlikely in January.

      "bodyText": "Frank Lampard has insisted he will be at the heart of a \u201cjoined-up\u201d recruitment strategy at Chelsea as the club prepare to enter the January market to bolster their hopes of a top-four Premiership finish. Chelsea, whose transfer ban for breaking Fifa rules regarding under-18 foreign players was lifted after an appeal to the court of arbitration for sport, have been guilty of a lack of coherent planning, particularly regarding signings blocking the first-team pathway for academy youngsters. Lampard arrived last summer with the club suspended from the market and he has blooded a clutch of homegrown players, most notably Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham. Reece James and Callum Hudson-Odoi have also featured. Many supporters would be disappointed if their progress were to be interrupted. But Chelsea have \u00a3150m to spend and Lampard has made it clear he wants to widen his options. He wants a new attacking player and not only because he is likely to allow the out-of-favour Olivier Giroud to depart. He has been linked with a host of players, including Jadon Sancho of Borussia Dortmund, Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha and Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 of Lyon. Two of the club\u2019s wingers, Pedro and the in-form Willian, are out of contract in the summer. In addition Lampard would take a left-sided defender, with Bournemouth\u2019s Nathan Ak\u00e9, formerly of Chelsea, a prime target and available for \u00a340m due to a buy-back clause. Lampard also likes the Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell, although any deal for him is unlikely in January. Manchester City also want Chilwell. \u201cWe are certainly joined up on recruitment,\u201d Lampard said, before the New Year\u2019s Day trip to Brighton. \u201cI know we haven\u2019t done anything yet so there is no proof in that but we are joined up.

Below what she calls the \u201cskin surface\u201d of the ocean, the submersibles carefully filter seawater and take a snapshot of what\u2019s in it.</p> <p>Her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/06/plastics-microplastics-ocean-study\">team found that at a depth of 200m</a>, there were nearly 15 bits of plastic in every liter of water, similar to the amount found at the surface of the so-called garbage patches. The remote samplers were still finding plastic at their maximum depth of 1km. But it is just the start of the hunt. \u201cAfter two to three years of work the honest truth is we have only one set of samples from one portion of the world\u2019s entire ocean,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The group\u2019s work is among the first to count the exact amount of plastic below the ocean surface, and to show that plastic waste is abundant at lower depths. Scientists have speculated about this for years. Richard Thomson, the oceanologist who first coined the term \u201cmicroplastic\u201d in 2004 to describe difficult-to-capture bits under 2mm in length, has suggested that large amounts could be found in the deep ocean and sea floor.</p> <p>And a 2017 paper from Van Sebille\u2019s group predicted that, based on the amount of plastic entering the ocean and the potential ways it is known to sink, 196m tons of plastic may have settled from the surface into the deep ocean since 1950.</p> <p>The next steps are to show where the plastic comes from, and to ascertain how it moves from the surface, where it is relatively easy to both find and track, to the depths.</p> <p>The conventional view is that it is very hard to track ocean microplastic back to its source. But even very small bits of plastic don\u2019t necessarily look the same. By examining how laser light scatters when it hits different bits of plastic, researchers can create a fingerprint. The plastic found in Monterey Bay, for example, didn\u2019t resemble the plastics used in local fishing equipment, but was mostly Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polymer used in disposable packing, indicating it probably came from land.</p> <p>How plastic descends to the deep ocean is, for the most part, a mystery. Because of its low density, most commercial plastic floats. It needs help to get below the surface. Plastic can become attached to ocean detritus that sinks, or fragment under the sun or waves, or find its way into something\u2019s stomach.</p> <p>Choy\u2019s team identified two kinds of animals, red crabs and translucent, filter-feeding creatures called giant larvaceans, which consume plastic and moving it to deeper water \u2013 either by eating it near the surface and expelling it lower down, or in the case of the larvaceans, in a layer of mucous they periodically discard and let sink.</p> <p>This sort of unwitting animal transit has been observed in many species. A 2011 study examining plastic in fish in the north Pacific Ocean estimated that they ingested around 12,000 tons a year. In a later paper Van Sebille\u2019s group noted that if the number held across the entire ocean, 100,000 tons of plastic could be inside animals at any one time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>The search for the missing maritime plastic</strong> has opened new frontiers of research.

      "bodyText": "Every year, 8m tons of plastic enters the ocean. Images of common household waste swirling in vast garbage patches in the open sea, or tangled up with whales and seabirds, have turned plastic pollution into one of the most popular environmental issues in the world. But for at least a decade, the biggest question among scientists who study marine plastic hasn\u2019t been why plastic in the ocean is so abundant, but why it isn\u2019t. What scientists can see and measure, in the garbage patches and on beaches, accounts for only a tiny fraction of the total plastic entering the water. So where is the other 99% of ocean plastic? Unsettling answers have recently begun to emerge. What we commonly see accumulating at the sea surface is \u201cless than the tip of the iceberg, maybe a half of 1% of the total,\u201d says Erik Van Sebille, an oceanographer at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. \u201cI often joke that being an ocean plastic scientist should be an easy job, because you can always find a bit wherever you look,\u201d says Van Sebille. But, he adds, the reality is that our maps of the ocean essentially end at the surface, and solid numbers on how much plastic is in any one location are lacking. It is becoming apparent that plastic ends up in huge quantities in the deepest parts of the ocean, buried in sediment on the seafloor, and caught like clouds of dust deep in the water column. Perhaps most frighteningly, says Helge Niemann, a biogeochemist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, it could fragment into such small pieces that it can barely be detected. At this point it becomes, Niemann says, \u201cmore like a chemical dissolved in the water than floating in it\u201d. The 276 miles of coastline that runs from the narrow mouth of San Francisco Bay, past the open water of Monterey Bay to the scenic mountains and redwood forests of Big Sur, is the land border of America\u2019s largest National Marine Sanctuary. To anyone visiting the beaches near Santa Cruz or driving the coastal highways, it appears remarkably unspoiled. That is not the whole story. For the past two years, scientists from the nearby Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute have been using customised remote-control submersibles to take samples of the near-invisible plastic drifting far below the surface. \u201cJust because you don\u2019t see it, doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there\u201d says Anela Choy, a professor of oceanography at the University of California San Diego, and the lead researcher on the project. Below what she calls the \u201cskin surface\u201d of the ocean, the submersibles carefully filter seawater and take a snapshot of what\u2019s in it. Her team found that at a depth of 200m, there were nearly 15 bits of plastic in every liter of water, similar to the amount found at the surface of the so-called garbage patches. The remote samplers were still finding plastic at their maximum depth of 1km. But it is just the start of the hunt. \u201cAfter two to three years of work the honest truth is we have only one set of samples from one portion of the world\u2019s entire ocean,\u201d she says. The group\u2019s work is among the first to count the exact amount of plastic below the ocean surface, and to show that plastic waste is abundant at lower depths. Scientists have speculated about this for years. Richard Thomson, the oceanologist who first coined the term \u201cmicroplastic\u201d in 2004 to describe difficult-to-capture bits under 2mm in length, has suggested that large amounts could be found in the deep ocean and sea floor. And a 2017 paper from Van Sebille\u2019s group predicted that, based on the amount of plastic entering the ocean and the potential ways it is known to sink, 196m tons of plastic may have settled from the surface into the deep ocean since 1950. The next steps are to show where the plastic comes from, and to ascertain how it moves from the surface, where it is relatively easy to both find and track, to the depths. The conventional view is that it is very hard to track ocean microplastic back to its source. But even very small bits of plastic don\u2019t necessarily look the same. By examining how laser light scatters when it hits different bits of plastic, researchers can create a fingerprint. The plastic found in Monterey Bay, for example, didn\u2019t resemble the plastics used in local fishing equipment, but was mostly Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polymer used in disposable packing, indicating it probably came from land. How plastic descends to the deep ocean is, for the most part, a mystery. Because of its low density, most commercial plastic floats. It needs help to get below the surface. Plastic can become attached to ocean detritus that sinks, or fragment under the sun or waves, or find its way into something\u2019s stomach. Choy\u2019s team identified two kinds of animals, red crabs and translucent, filter-feeding creatures called giant larvaceans, which consume plastic and moving it to deeper water \u2013 either by eating it near the surface and expelling it lower down, or in the case of the larvaceans, in a layer of mucous they periodically discard and let sink. This sort of unwitting animal transit has been observed in many species. A 2011 study examining plastic in fish in the north Pacific Ocean estimated that they ingested around 12,000 tons a year. In a later paper Van Sebille\u2019s group noted that if the number held across the entire ocean, 100,000 tons of plastic could be inside animals at any one time. The search for the missing maritime plastic has opened new frontiers of research. A decade ago the discovery of microplastics sparked a radical shift in the conception of plastic pollution. Scientists revealed the existence of billions of pieces of plastic almost too small to see, definitely too small to catch, and easily eaten by the tiniest sea creature. Now they are making startling new discoveries about the extent of plastic pollution. On a cool, gray June day in London, Alexandra Ter Halle, a researcher with Paul Sabatier University, in France, was on a sailboat just below Tower Bridge taking samples of water from the Thames. It was the crew\u2019s first stop on a tour of 10 European estuaries, and the other scientists on board were doing familiar work, counting microplastic particles with microscopes, and characterising the bacteria in the samples. Ter Halle\u2019s samples, though, would have to wait until she was back at her university, where she has specialized equipment for the detection of nanoplastistics \u2013 plastics that have broken down to sizes below a thousandth of a millimeter, smaller than a single cell. Two years ago her group was the first to detect these particles in seawater. Ter Halle employs techniques similar to those used by forensic scientists to detect chemicals at crime scenes: the samples are ignited into a gas, bombarded with electrons, and separated across an electric field to measure their weight and charge. They can\u2019t be conventionally seen, only detected. Nanoplastic research is still in its infancy. But laboratory tests show that unlike microplastics, nanoplastics are small enough to accumulate within the bloodstreams and cell membranes of a range of organisms, even passing the blood-brain barrier in a test on Japanese medaka fish, and cause various toxic effects, including neurological damage, and reproductive abnormalities. \u201cThis question of where is all the plastic in the sea \u2026 For 40 years we sought out plastic we could see. Now we reach the nanoscale, which is very particular, very reactive, and we have to begin again,\u201d says Ter Halle. The huge amounts of plastic on the ocean surface were what originally sparked public and scientific interest in the plastic problem. In this way, they acted like a buoy, pointing the way to something much larger beneath the surface. The deep ocean is, as Choy puts it, \u201cthe world\u2019s largest habitat\u201d. We\u2019re just beginning the accounting of how much of our plastic has ended up there. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 January 2020 to set out the full name of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.",

      "bodyText": "A number of sporting events have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Keep up-to-date with the latest developments here. March The women\u2019s T20 World Cup concludes in Australia, with the hosts recovering from an opening defeat to India to join them in the semi-finals with England. South Africa are favourites to join them, with the final on Sunday 8 March. The men\u2019s and women\u2019s Six Nations are set to conclude, but matches involving Italy have been postponed \u2013 although England\u2019s men\u2019s game in Rome on 14 March is set to go ahead. Formula One returns with the traditional curtain-raiser in Melbourne, which is set to go ahead despite coronavirus fears. Lewis Hamilton will begin his bid to match Michael Schumacher\u2019s haul of seven world titles. Elsewhere, it\u2019s arguably the biggest week in horse racing at the Cheltenham Festival, while England play two Test matches in Sri Lanka. Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will battle for the final Euro 2020 places as 16 teams are cut down to four in the play-offs. England\u2019s women head to the States to face the USA, Japan and Spain in the SheBelieves Cup. The Major League Baseball season gets under way, and the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Boat Races take place on the Thames. April The first LPGA major of the year, the ANA Inspiration, is held in California. One week later, it\u2019s over to Augusta for the first men\u2019s golf major of the year, with Tiger Woods defending his Masters title. The Chinese Grand Prix, slated for Shanghai, has been postponed indefinitely, while the first-ever Vietnam Grand Prix in Hanoi remains in the balance. Other sporting highlights include the Grand National \u2013 with Tiger Roll chasing a hat-trick of wins \u2013 the start of cricket\u2019s County Championship season, the London Marathon and two weeks of tension at the Crucible, as Judd Trump battles to retain his world snooker title. May It\u2019s a month of finals, with the men\u2019s and women\u2019s FA Cup showpieces at Wembley, the women\u2019s Champions League in Vienna and the men\u2019s Champions League in Istanbul. Not forgetting the Scottish Cup, Europa League and EFL play-offs, with football\u2019s richest game, the Championship play-off final, offering a lucrative place in the Premier League. The first of cycling\u2019s three Grand Tours, the Giro d\u2019Italia, is set to start in Budapest, although the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy means the entire event is in doubt. The Netherlands hosts an F1 Grand Prix, with the Indy 500 and Monaco GP also taking place. Thrill seekers might also want to head to Cardiff for the Nitro World Games \u2013 the largest action sports event ever held in the UK. June Another event with a question mark over it, Euro 2020 is set to be held this month in 12 different cities from Dublin to Baku. England and Wales are the only qualified home nations so far, with Scotland and Republic of Ireland in the play-offs. England will play their group games at Wembley, plus the semi-finals and final - if they get that far. Gareth Southgate\u2019s side are in Group D with Croatia, Czech Republic and a play-off winner. Wales are in Group A, with a trip to face Italy and two other games in Azerbaijan, against Switzerland and Turkey. If that sounds tough, spare a thought for the play-off winners who end up in Group F \u2013 with Germany, France and holders Portugal. Sixteen teams will progress from the groups into a straight knockout. The Copa Am\u00e9rica takes place in Argentina and Colombia, and there\u2019s plenty of action away from football. England play three home Tests against the West Indies, and there are three golf majors as the US Open, women\u2019s US Open and women\u2019s PGA are contested in the US. There are also three big rugby union finals, with the Premiership, Pro14 and Super Rugby trophies to be won. The Tour de France sets off from Nice on the long road to Paris. It\u2019s hard to bet against another Team Ineos winner, but will it be defending champion Egan Bernal, or can Geraint Thomas or Chris Froome secure another British win? Speaking of which, this could be a big month for Andy Murray, with Queen\u2019s Club and a potential Wimbledon return as he continues his fightback from injury. July It\u2019s the biggest sporting event on earth; 11,000 athletes from more than 200 nations, competing in 339 events across 33 sports. The 32nd Olympic Games, the second to be held in Tokyo, will dominate the sporting summer \u2013 providing coronavirus does not lead to a postponement. While Rio 2016 suffered from big distances between venues and poor infrastructure, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem in Tokyo. Thirteen of the venues, including the National Stadium, are within 5km of the athletes\u2019 village, although the marathon and walking events will be in the northern city of Sapporo, due to concerns over heat. British medal hopes include Dina Asher-Smith in the 200m and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in heptathlon, Adam Peaty in the pool, Laura Kenny in the velodrome and 11-year-old skateboarder Sky Brown. New events to watch out for include 3-on-3 basketball, surfing, speed climbing, skateboarding and karate, while baseball and softball will be popular draws in Japan after being brought back to the Games. The British summer of sport should also be in full swing. Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep are looking to defend their Wimbledon titles, while Lewis Hamilton will go for a seventh British Grand Prix crown at Silverstone. After Shane Lowry\u2019s memorable win at Portrush last year, can anyone end the long wait for an English winner at Royal St George\u2019s in The Open? August The ECB\u2019s controversial new cricket tournament, The Hundred, finally kicks off this summer. Eight new city franchises have drafted players, with men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams competing for a place in the inaugural finals in August. Time will tell if the bold new format - 15 six-ball overs, then a 10-ball final over - will draw more casual fans than the disbanded Women\u2019s Super League, or the men\u2019s county-based T20 Blast, which will continue. Two weeks after the Olympic closing ceremony, the torch is passed to the Paralympic Games. Also set for Tokyo, the Paralympics will welcome 4,400 athletes competing in over 500 events. British names to watch out for include runner Sophie Hahn, former swimming medallist turned para-canoeist Charlotte Henshaw and Amy Truesdale, who is chasing gold in the new para-taekwondo event. Elsewhere, England complete what\u2019s sure to be an entertaining Test series against Pakistan, while the year\u2019s third and final grand tour, the Vuelta, begins with a jaunt to the Dutch city of Utrecht. The domestic football season kicks off too, with the Premier League and Football League returning early in August. September Europe are bidding to retain the Ryder Cup trophy they won emphatically in France two years ago, as the USA takes over hosting duties. Europe lead 7-2 in wins since the turn of the century and will fancy their chances of an away win at Whistling Straits. The lakeside Wisconsin course looks and feels like Scottish links, complete with sheep, stone bridges and testing weather conditions. September also sees T20 Blast finals day, the Royal London Cup final and the county championship\u2019s closing rounds. The Tour of Britain begins with a first-ever visit to Cornwall, while the road cycling world championships take place amid the peaks of Vaud and Valais in Switzerland. October There\u2019s a double helping of T20 World Cups in 2020, with the men\u2019s tournament also taking place in Australia at some of cricket\u2019s most iconic venues, from the Gabba to the MCG. England will be on the hunt for another trophy, and revenge after their dramatic late defeat to the West Indies in 2016. The Windies, the hosts or familiar foes New Zealand are all potential semi-final opponents for England if they progress from their Super 12s group. Ireland and Scotland, meanwhile, will hope to make it out of their preliminary groups after qualifying for the tournament. Elsewhere, the Champions League group stages will be heating up, and F1 enters the home straight with races in Japan and the USA. Super League\u2019s showpiece finale, the grand final, takes place at Old Trafford, before an Ashes series between England and Australia which concludes at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. November The Formula One season reaches its climax in Abu Dhabi, and there are year-ending showdowns in men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis, plus golf in Dubai. Two of the biggest horse races in the world, the Melbourne and Breeders\u2019 Cups, will be contested, and the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations will kick off \u2013 although the hosts are yet to be confirmed. December The sporting year ends with a few festive staples \u2013 the PDC world darts championship returns, and there will be the usual post-Christmas football and horse racing action. The Club World Cup will return to Qatar, 12 months on from Liverpool\u2019s victory. The European cross-country athletics championships will be held in Ireland, snooker\u2019s UK Championship will be played out in York, and one hero from the past year will win the BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year award. \u2026 and here\u2019s what you might have missed: January A big month for tennis began with the ATP Cup, a new team event won by Novak Djokovic\u2019s Serbia, who beat Rafa Nadal\u2019s Spain in the final. Djokovic wasn\u2019t done there, going on to win the Australian Open final after an epic battle with Dominic Thiem. Sofia Kenin was the unexpected women\u2019s champion, fighting back to beat Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in a classic final. From Djokovic\u2019s altercation with an umpire to the bushfire haze that hung over Melbourne, the tournament was beset by controversies. In cricket, England completed a dramatic comeback to win the Test series in South Africa, with victory at the Wanderers securing a 3-1 win. In football, Aston Villa booked their place at Wembley with a two-legged semi-final win over Leicester. Dean Smith\u2019s side will play Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, after they limped over the line in a derby double-header with United. Elsewhere, Peter Wright shocked the darting world on New Year\u2019s Day, beating favourite Michael van Gerwen 7-3 in the PDC world final. Wayne Warren took the BDO title, becoming the oldest ever champion at 57 \u2013 but the event suffered from poor crowds and low prize money. In snooker, Stuart Bingham beat Ali Carter and off-table distractions to win the Masters. February In the first weekend of the month, all eyes were on Miami for Super Bowl LIV. The Kansas City Chiefs earned their first NFL championship for 50 years, rallying to beat a San Francisco side who had one hand on the Vince Lombardi trophy in the fourth quarter. The NBA\u2019s All-Star weekend in Chicago was overshadowed by the death of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, in a helicopter crash. Tyson Fury became a world heavyweight champion again, completing a remarkable recovery from depression and addiction issues. He ended Deontay Wilder\u2019s unbeaten round by seventh-round knockout in Las Vegas; his opponent later claimed that his elaborate ring-walk costume had sapped his energy. The Six Nations kicked off, with France surging towards a potential grand slam with home wins over England and Italy and an away victory in Cardiff \u2013 before the coronavirus outbreak left organisers battling to complete the tournament. Cycling\u2019s UAE Tour was cancelled with two stages left to race, with Chris Froome among the field of riders quarantined before being allowed to return home. Manchester City were hit by a two-season ban from the Champions League, but kept their on-field focus to beat Real Madrid in their last-16, first-leg encounter. It was a welcome boost for English clubs after Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea lost their first legs. Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten Premier League run was also ended by Watford, but they remain on course to canter to the title.",

      "bodyText": "The UK could have had its hottest ever day in December after the Met Office said it has provisionally recorded a new maximum temperature of 18.7C (65.66F). Forecasters took the measurement at Achfary in the Highlands on Saturday, which would be the hottest day of the month on record in Britain if validated. It would beat the current top December temperature of 18.3C (64.94F), which was taken at Achnashellach in the Highlands in 1948. At 3am on Sunday the Met Office recorded a temperature of 16.8C at Cassley in Sutherland, which was the highest on record in Scotland for a 29, 30 or 31 December. The unseasonal Scottish warmth has been put down to a meteorological phenomenon known as the Foehn Effect. This is a change from wet and cold conditions on one side of a mountain to warmer and drier conditions on the other side. Dry air heats more quickly so as it descends it warms up much faster than on the cold side. The most notable Foehn events tend to occur across the Highlands, where the moist prevailing westerly winds encounter high ground along Scotland\u2019s west coast. On Saturday, the northern part of Scotland was experiencing southerly winds. The lowest temperature recorded on the same day was 1.7C (35.06F) in Writtle, Essex. If the temperature is confirmed it will be the second time a temperature record for the Highlands has been broken this month. A record temperature of 16.8C has already been verified for Cassley in Sutherland, which was recorded at 3am on Sunday 29 December. Northern Wales and north-east England were also unseasonably warm on Saturday night. Temperatures of 13.3C were recorded in Chillingham Barns, Northumberland and 11.5C in Rhyl, north Wales.

Critics are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/10/best-films-2019-us-no-9-uncut-gems\">going crazy about</a> Sandler\u2019s performance, including speculation about a possible Oscar \u2013 though it\u2019s unlikely the Academy will forgive him for the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/08/jack-and-jill-review\">Jack and Jill</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/grown-ups-film-review\">Grown Ups</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Hellboy II: The Golden Army</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw19ktMTZeA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uw19ktMTZeA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em><strong>Film, US, 2008 \u2013 out 1 January</strong></em></p> <p>Few superhero movies boast production design anywhere near as impressive as director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s darkly ravishing Hellboy movies, led by a makeup-caked Ron Perlman as a human-like half-demon raised as a superhero.

Now his oeuvre includes True History of the Kelly Gang: the first great modern (ie talkies era) movie about Ned Kelly, adapted from Peter Carey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/16/100-best-novels-true-history-kelly-gang-peter-carey\">critically acclaimed</a> and idiosyncratically written 2000 novel of the same name.</p> <p>The story follows Ned as a child (Orlando Schwerdt), then as a young man (George MacKay) engaged in various violent exploits. Old bucket-face respects his mother (Essie Davis) but is understandably miffed about that time she sold him off to a dangerous, mentor-like criminal with a fabulously bushy beard (Russell Crowe). The film\u2019s cinematography (from Ari Wegner) is weepingly beautiful and the tone menacingly poetic.</p> <h2><strong>Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>TV, US, 2020 \u2013 out 17 January</strong></em></p> <p>The comedian Josh Thomas continues a tradition pursued by many talented Australians over the years: making a hit local production then fobbing off overseas. Thomas\u2019s hit show was Please Like Me, the charming ABC dramedy that attracted many plaudits (including an Emmy nomination) and a significant audience overseas. In his next show, which he created and wrote, Thomas stars as an overwrought 25-year-old living at home with his single dad and two teen sisters, one of whom has autism.</p> <h2><strong>The Gloaming</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrfcoJQlruk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HrfcoJQlruk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em><strong>TV, Australia, 2020 \u2013 out 1 January</strong></em></p> <p>Don\u2019t miss this intensely moody, Scandi-noirish police procedural thriller created and written by Vicki Madden.

But this dopey and occasionally riotously funny film holds up on rewatch.</p> <h2><strong>Psycho</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Film, US, 1960 \u2013 out 11 January</strong></em></p> <p>Psycho is one of the best and most famous films from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, who made everybody feel very uneasy about taking a shower in a hotel. Or maybe just taking a shower, period. The film is so deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness, and so undisputed as a classic, it\u2019s easy to forget the director\u2019s many bold decisions \u2013 including killing off his protagonist halfway through. Whatever you do, don\u2019t cry \u201cspoiler\u201d \u2013 the grisly demise of Marion Crane, who runs off from her job with a bag of cash and hides in the Bates Motel (big mistake) is one of cinema\u2019s most famous death scenes.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Avenue 5 season 1 (TV, out 21 January), The Movies (TV, out 15 January), Galveston (film, out 19 January), Speed (film, out 1 January), Prisoners (film, out 15 January), The Prestige (film, out 1 January), Escape From New York (film, out 15 January).</p> <h2><em><strong>SBS On Demand</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>The New Pope</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRhZ0mIATrM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WRhZ0mIATrM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em><strong>TV, Italy/Spain/France/US, 2020 \u2013 out 16 January</strong></em></p> <p>This is a continuation of The Young Pope, the Italian auteur Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s fiendishly good drama about a rock\u2019n\u2019roll pontiff \u2013 played by Jude Law \u2013 engaged in various kinds of political manoeuvring and horse trading. In The New Pope, which will roll out in weekly double episodes, Pius XII (Law) is in a coma and the titular character (John Malkovich) is placed on the papal throne. Sorrentino is a very interesting visual director, with an exuberant and expressionistic style.</p> <h2><strong>The Infinite Man</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX4jku_LRDY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lX4jku_LRDY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em><strong>Film, Australia, 2014 \u2013 out 13 January</strong></em></p> <p>I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/10/from-animal-kingdom-to-the-babadook-the-best-australian-films-of-the-decade\">recently described</a> the writer/director Hugh Sullivan\u2019s zany time travel comedy as an \u201cunderappreciated gem of a film\u201d. Here\u2019s your chance to appreciate it. Josh McConville plays a sad-sack scientist who uses a time machine to try to recreate the perfect weekend away with his girlfriend (Hannah Marshall). Things do not go to plan, escalating into an increasingly chaotic plot full of double-backs and parallel timelines. The Infinite Man is a lot of fun \u2013 and part of a particularly strong suite of Australian films arriving on SBS in January.</p> <h2><strong>Burning Man</strong></h2> <p><em><strong>Film, Australia, 2011 \u2013 out 24 January</strong></em></p> <p>The writer/director Jonathan Teplitzky\u2019s searing drama gradually builds empathy for its protagonist. Burning Man kicks off as a disorientating portrait of the whirlwind life of Bondi Beach-based chef Tom (Matthew Goode), who drinks hard and is terribly unpleasant to strangers. In the second act, Teplitzky begins the task of endearing the audience to him, revealing Tom lost the love of his life (Bojana Novakovic) to cancer.</p> <p>Told in a scrambled nonlinear style, with top-shelf editing from Martin Connor and creative cinematography from Gary Phillips, the film thrillingly builds a dreamy and sometimes nightmarish atmosphere. Goode is fearless in the lead role, and Teplitzky\u2019s use of food as a metaphor for memory (some to devour, others to throw away and forget) is inspired.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Shrill season 2 (TV, 25 January), Twin (TV, 1 January), Continuum seasons 1 to 4 (TV, 3 January), Strange Colours (film, 27 January), Predestination (film, 13 January), Lantana (film, 27 January), The Death of Stalin (film, out now), Love &amp; Mercy (film, out now).</p> <h2><em><strong>ABC iView</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Doctor Who</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkEB0ysv7sM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkEB0ysv7sM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em><strong>TV, UK, 2020 \u2013 out 2 January</strong></em></p> <p>Everybody\u2019s favourite show about an extraterrestrial Time Lord whooshing through the universe in an old-school blue police box returns.

There are no new episodes in January, but a stack of old ones on iView that make decent holiday viewing.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions: </strong>Brassic season 1, Defending the Guilty (TV, out now).</p> <h2><em><strong>Amazon Prime</strong></em></h2> <h2><strong>Amores Perros</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHZuzC9ZEw0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eHZuzC9ZEw0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><em><strong>Film, Mexico, 2000 \u2013 out 1 January</strong></em></p> <p>The first feature film of the fascinating director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (whose subsequent work includes 21 Grams, Birdman and The Revenant) paints a raw and squeamishly vivid picture of Mexico City.

      "bodyText": "Netflix Uncut Gems Film, US, 2019 \u2013 out 31 January The sibling writer/directors Benny and Josh Safdie are becoming go-to guys for superstar actors who want to shed their celebrity baggage. Robert Pattinson led their terrifically grimy, Scorsesean 2017 film Good Time, and now it\u2019s Adam Sandler\u2019s turn in the Safdies\u2019 new streetside drama, Uncut Gems. The actor, who of course is best known as a boneheaded comedian, plays Howard Ratner, a gambling-addicted New York City jeweller who gets his mitts on rare opals, which he hopes will relieve him of his financial troubles. Critics are going crazy about Sandler\u2019s performance, including speculation about a possible Oscar \u2013 though it\u2019s unlikely the Academy will forgive him for the likes of Jack and Jill and Grown Ups. Hellboy II: The Golden Army Film, US, 2008 \u2013 out 1 January Few superhero movies boast production design anywhere near as impressive as director Guillermo del Toro\u2019s darkly ravishing Hellboy movies, led by a makeup-caked Ron Perlman as a human-like half-demon raised as a superhero. In Hellboy II: The Golden Army (the best of the series) this attitude-filled, tomato-coloured character fights to save humanity from the grip of a terrible enemy after an ancient truce is broken \u2013 that old chestnut! Honourable mentions: Messiah (TV, out 1 January), Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park II, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, The Bourne Identity (film, all out 1 January), Dracula (TV, release date TBC). Stan True History of the Kelly Gang Film, Australia, 2020 \u2013 out 26 January Nobody evokes a sense of festering dread quite like the auteur Justin Kurzel, who is carving out one of the most interesting bodies of work of any Australian film-maker this century (including Snowtown and the under-appreciated video game adaptation Assassin\u2019s Creed). Now his oeuvre includes True History of the Kelly Gang: the first great modern (ie talkies era) movie about Ned Kelly, adapted from Peter Carey\u2019s critically acclaimed and idiosyncratically written 2000 novel of the same name. The story follows Ned as a child (Orlando Schwerdt), then as a young man (George MacKay) engaged in various violent exploits. Old bucket-face respects his mother (Essie Davis) but is understandably miffed about that time she sold him off to a dangerous, mentor-like criminal with a fabulously bushy beard (Russell Crowe). The film\u2019s cinematography (from Ari Wegner) is weepingly beautiful and the tone menacingly poetic. Everything\u2019s Gonna Be Okay TV, US, 2020 \u2013 out 17 January The comedian Josh Thomas continues a tradition pursued by many talented Australians over the years: making a hit local production then fobbing off overseas. Thomas\u2019s hit show was Please Like Me, the charming ABC dramedy that attracted many plaudits (including an Emmy nomination) and a significant audience overseas. In his next show, which he created and wrote, Thomas stars as an overwrought 25-year-old living at home with his single dad and two teen sisters, one of whom has autism. The Gloaming TV, Australia, 2020 \u2013 out 1 January Don\u2019t miss this intensely moody, Scandi-noirish police procedural thriller created and written by Vicki Madden. Based in Tasmania, the plot follows two detectives (Emma Booth and Ewen Leslie) as they investigate some very strange goings-on. Read my review of it here. Honourable mentions: Utopia seasons 1-3 (TV, 10 January), Sunday Bloody Sunday (film, 18 January), Sweet Smell of Success (film, 30 January), Mystery Road season 1 (TV) and Mystery Road (film, both out 2 January), The Pope of Greenwich Village (film, 20 January). Foxtel Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy Film, US, 2004 \u2013 out 1 January Will Ferrell\u2019s legacy will forever be tied to his highly memorable performance as Ron \u201ckind of a big deal\u201d Burgundy, an obnoxious childlike TV news presenter who signs off every bulletin with advice he is incapable of applying to his own life: \u201cYou stay classy, San Diego.\u201d You\u2019ve probably already seen the director Adam McKay\u2019s 70s-set cult classic comedy, in which Burgundy butts heads with a female newsreader (Christina Applegate) who wants his job. But this dopey and occasionally riotously funny film holds up on rewatch. Psycho Film, US, 1960 \u2013 out 11 January Psycho is one of the best and most famous films from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, who made everybody feel very uneasy about taking a shower in a hotel. Or maybe just taking a shower, period. The film is so deeply ingrained in the collective consciousness, and so undisputed as a classic, it\u2019s easy to forget the director\u2019s many bold decisions \u2013 including killing off his protagonist halfway through. Whatever you do, don\u2019t cry \u201cspoiler\u201d \u2013 the grisly demise of Marion Crane, who runs off from her job with a bag of cash and hides in the Bates Motel (big mistake) is one of cinema\u2019s most famous death scenes. Honourable mentions: Avenue 5 season 1 (TV, out 21 January), The Movies (TV, out 15 January), Galveston (film, out 19 January), Speed (film, out 1 January), Prisoners (film, out 15 January), The Prestige (film, out 1 January), Escape From New York (film, out 15 January). SBS On Demand The New Pope TV, Italy/Spain/France/US, 2020 \u2013 out 16 January This is a continuation of The Young Pope, the Italian auteur Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s fiendishly good drama about a rock\u2019n\u2019roll pontiff \u2013 played by Jude Law \u2013 engaged in various kinds of political manoeuvring and horse trading. In The New Pope, which will roll out in weekly double episodes, Pius XII (Law) is in a coma and the titular character (John Malkovich) is placed on the papal throne. Sorrentino is a very interesting visual director, with an exuberant and expressionistic style. The Infinite Man Film, Australia, 2014 \u2013 out 13 January I recently described the writer/director Hugh Sullivan\u2019s zany time travel comedy as an \u201cunderappreciated gem of a film\u201d. Here\u2019s your chance to appreciate it. Josh McConville plays a sad-sack scientist who uses a time machine to try to recreate the perfect weekend away with his girlfriend (Hannah Marshall). Things do not go to plan, escalating into an increasingly chaotic plot full of double-backs and parallel timelines. The Infinite Man is a lot of fun \u2013 and part of a particularly strong suite of Australian films arriving on SBS in January. Burning Man Film, Australia, 2011 \u2013 out 24 January The writer/director Jonathan Teplitzky\u2019s searing drama gradually builds empathy for its protagonist. Burning Man kicks off as a disorientating portrait of the whirlwind life of Bondi Beach-based chef Tom (Matthew Goode), who drinks hard and is terribly unpleasant to strangers. In the second act, Teplitzky begins the task of endearing the audience to him, revealing Tom lost the love of his life (Bojana Novakovic) to cancer. Told in a scrambled nonlinear style, with top-shelf editing from Martin Connor and creative cinematography from Gary Phillips, the film thrillingly builds a dreamy and sometimes nightmarish atmosphere. Goode is fearless in the lead role, and Teplitzky\u2019s use of food as a metaphor for memory (some to devour, others to throw away and forget) is inspired. Honourable mentions: Shrill season 2 (TV, 25 January), Twin (TV, 1 January), Continuum seasons 1 to 4 (TV, 3 January), Strange Colours (film, 27 January), Predestination (film, 13 January), Lantana (film, 27 January), The Death of Stalin (film, out now), Love &amp; Mercy (film, out now). ABC iView Doctor Who TV, UK, 2020 \u2013 out 2 January Everybody\u2019s favourite show about an extraterrestrial Time Lord whooshing through the universe in an old-school blue police box returns. The twelfth season of Doctor Who marks the second season starring Jodie Whittaker, who plays the Thirteenth Doctor (the most recent incarnation of the aforementioned extraterrestrial Time Lord). Hard Quiz TV, Australia, 2016-2019 \u2013 out 1 January ABC TV keep pumping out seasons of Hard Quiz, because they know they\u2019re onto a good thing. The show\u2019s host, Tom Gleeson, finessed his \u201chard\u201d schtick in the Hard Talk segments in The Weekly With Charlie Pickering, and we\u2019re all grateful he got a spin-off gameshow to call his own. There are no new episodes in January, but a stack of old ones on iView that make decent holiday viewing. Honourable mentions: Brassic season 1, Defending the Guilty (TV, out now). Amazon Prime Amores Perros Film, Mexico, 2000 \u2013 out 1 January The first feature film of the fascinating director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (whose subsequent work includes 21 Grams, Birdman and The Revenant) paints a raw and squeamishly vivid picture of Mexico City. It is told in a triptych structure that crosses tones and genres, from realism to melodrama, telling three separate stories connected by a car crash. Dogs are present in each story in this blisteringly powerful film. Ilana Glazer: The Planet Is Burning TV, US, 2020 \u2013 out 3 January Ilana Glazer, one of the stars of Broad City, gets her own standup comedy special. Talking points include homophobes, Nazis, the patriarchy and the sub-par standard of women\u2019s razors. Honorable mentions: Ted Bundy: Falling For A Killer season 1 (TV, 31 January), Pi, The Tenant, The Goonies (film, 1 January), Midsommar (film, 3 January). Disney+ Diary of a Female President TV, US, 2020 \u2013 out 17 January A comedy series about 12-year-old Cuban American girl Elena (Tess Romero) who pursues her dream of becoming president, told through voice-overs taken from her diary. Actor, rapper and director Gina Rodriguez executive produces the show, and appears as an adult version of Elena, in flash-forwards depicting her future political campaign. High School Musical: The Musical: The Series: The Singalongs TV, US, 2020 \u2013 out 17 January This gets a special mention purely because the people at Disney+ have had the audacity to insert another colon into the title. Seriously, that\u2019s three colons. I dare you to create another title with another colon. Double dare you. Triple dare. Honourable mentions: Lizzie McGuire seasons 1 and 2 (TV, out 1 January), Short Circuit (TV, 24 January), all five Ice Age movies (the first four arrive on 1 January and the fifth, Ice Age: Collision Course, arrives on 15 January). Apple TV+ Little America TV, US, 2020 \u2013 17 January Does the American dream exist anymore in these modern, cynical, Trump-menaced times? The marketing materials for Little America suggest an answer in the affirmative. Inspired by true stories, this anthology series promises to go \u201cbeyond the headlines\u201d to explore hopeful narratives about immigrants living in America.

      "bodyText": "Two climate patterns that have been influencing Australia\u2019s ongoing drought, deadly bushfire weather and record-breaking heat have shifted towards neutral, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. The changes should reduce the chances of hot winds from the west that have been adding to the extreme risk of bushfires in the south-east. But Dr Andrew Watkins, the head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, told Guardian Australia the damage caused by the two patterns \u2013 the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and a negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM) \u2013 would likely remain for several months. He said the change in SAM towards more neutral conditions would reduce the chance of westerly winds that had brought heat and dangerous fire conditions. \u201cWe can\u2019t rule the westerlies out of course, but at least the odds of more bad fire weather starts to reduce,\u201d he said. On Monday, the IOD dropped into neutral from a phase that sees cooler ocean temperatures off the north-west of Australia, causing moisture to be drawn away from the continent. But Watkins said: \u201cThe damage from the positive IOD and the negative SAM has been done \u2013 the landscape is extremely dry. This means that fire danger will remain high for some time. \u201cAnd it certainly does not mean the end of the drought \u2013 that will take some time; many months, especially for those rivers to rise again and for the soils to even reach average wetness.\u201d Watkins said the IOD had been acting \u201clike a wall\u201d and blocking a separate system that delivers monsoon rains to northern Australia. Weakening trade winds also meant the monsoon had a greater chance of forming and moving over northern Australia. \u201cIf you have a look at northern Australia \u2013 even just Darwin \u2013 it\u2019s been very hot and dry. Much hotter than a normal buildup,\u201d he said. \u201cDarwin has had well over 20 days above 35C this month when its record is nine. They are desperate to see rain.\u201d The bureau\u2019s models had already accounted for the retreat of both the SAM and IOD in its longer term rainfall outlooks for January and beyond, Watkins said. The bureau\u2019s climate experts have said the IOD and the SAM have combined with climate change to deliver Australia\u2019s recent run of record-breaking heat. Australia recorded its hottest day on record on 18 December, with an average maximum temperature of 41.9C (107.4F), beating the previous record by 1C that had been set the previous day. Rainfall across most of the continent has been well below average in 2019. Spring 2019 was the driest and second-hottest on record, and also the worst on record for dangerous bushfire weather.",

Ghosn also enjoys political cover and patronage from several other senior figures in the country\u2019s ruling class, one of whom told the Guardian that he would not be extradited to Japan and said state officials had been instructed by political leaders to ignore arrival formalities for Ghosn at Beirut airport. Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan.</p> \n<p>Ghosn\u2019s re-entry to a country in which multinational business affairs are opaque and blended into national politics augurs poorly for Japanese prosecutors who remain determined to prosecute him. Cooperation from Lebanese authorities is far from guaranteed, however, and an often lax rule of law is likely to mean the trail of his financial dealings will go cold.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s back now and he\u2019ll be celebrated,\u201d said one senior official. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of admiration for what he\u2019s done in business.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ghosn on Tuesday sought to portray himself as a refugee from injustice and political persecution in Japan \u2013 which has been heavily criticised for an unusually high rate of convictions and a <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/10/call-eliminate-japans-hostage-justice-system-japanese-legal-professionals\">culture described as \u201chostage justice\u201d</a> by some experts \u2013 rather than as a fugitive from the law.

      "bodyText": "Carlos Ghosn\u2019s flight from criminal charges in Japan to Lebanon was aided by Lebanese state officials who were instructed by political leaders to smooth his arrival. The former boss of Nissan and Renault landed at Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport in Lebanon on Monday morning and said in a statement that he was escaping a \u201crigged\u201d Japanese justice system. He reportedly hid in a musical instrument box to abscond from his home in Tokyo, which was under 24-hour camera surveillance as part of his bail conditions. In his statement Ghosn said he would \u201cno longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed\u201d. Ghosn had surrendered his passports under the terms of his bail and had been barred from leaving Japan. \u201cI have not fled justice, I have escaped injustice and political persecution,\u201d Ghosn said, adding that he could now \u201cfinally communicate freely with the media and look forward to starting next week\u201d. Ghosn, 65, was ousted as chair of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi carmaking alliance after he was arrested in November 2018 on charges that he had underreported his income from Nissan by $80m (\u00a360m). Ghosn has said the charges were part of a plot by Nissan executives to oust him. He was awaiting a trial in Tokyo that was due to start in April. Ghosn attended a pre-trial hearing in Tokyo\u2019s district court on Christmas Day. He was given a low-key but warm welcome in Lebanon, where he is regarded by many as a national hero. Ghosn was born in Brazil but his parents were Lebanese and he spent some of his childhood in Beirut. Armed members of Lebanon\u2019s internal security forces were present on Tuesday outside a Beirut mansion identified in court documents as belonging to Ghosn. Lebanon\u2019s former foreign minister Gebran Bassil has been a robust backer of the expatriate businessman. Ghosn also enjoys political cover and patronage from several other senior figures in the country\u2019s ruling class, one of whom told the Guardian that he would not be extradited to Japan and said state officials had been instructed by political leaders to ignore arrival formalities for Ghosn at Beirut airport. Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan. Ghosn\u2019s re-entry to a country in which multinational business affairs are opaque and blended into national politics augurs poorly for Japanese prosecutors who remain determined to prosecute him. Cooperation from Lebanese authorities is far from guaranteed, however, and an often lax rule of law is likely to mean the trail of his financial dealings will go cold. \u201cHe\u2019s back now and he\u2019ll be celebrated,\u201d said one senior official. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of admiration for what he\u2019s done in business.\u201d Ghosn on Tuesday sought to portray himself as a refugee from injustice and political persecution in Japan \u2013 which has been heavily criticised for an unusually high rate of convictions and a culture described as \u201chostage justice\u201d by some experts \u2013 rather than as a fugitive from the law. Ghosn had been under strict bail conditions that included 24-hour surveillance and a bond payment of \u00a51.5bn (\u00a310.4m) that he will probably now lose. The statement did not give details of his escape route or how he evaded Japanese authorities, and his representatives declined to comment further. The Lebanese TV news channel MTV reported that Ghosn hid in a musical instruments case before flying to Istanbul and then on to Beirut. His lawyers were still in possession of three of his passports on Tuesday, one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters. However, Reuters reported that senior Lebanese foreign ministry sources said Ghosn had entered Lebanon legally on a French passport and used his Lebanese ID with normal security procedures. The governments of Lebanon and France both said they had no prior knowledge of Ghosn\u2019s departure from Japan. Lebanon\u2019s general security directorate said he entered Beirut in a legal manner and there were no reasons for action or legal proceedings against him, according to the Lebanese news agency NNA. France\u2019s foreign ministry said it was not aware that Ghosn had jumped bail until alerted by the media. Ghosn had received consular assistance from his arrest as well as regular contact by France\u2019s ambassador to Japan, the ministry said in a statement. The junior economy minister Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher said she had been \u201cvery surprised\u201d by the news when she learned of it in the media. Ghosn\u2019s status as the architect of the partnership between Renault and Nissan meant he was formerly able to call on top political connections across the world. The former French president Nicolas Sarkozy visited Ghosn in Tokyo as recently as October, with the knowledge of the current president, Emmanuel Macron. Ghosn\u2019s flight could have implications for Greg Kelly, the former Nissan director who was accused of aiding and abetting his boss\u2019s efforts to hide extra income.

The campaign of maximum pressure was supposed to force Iran to accept a worse deal than the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement on which Donald Trump walked out in 2018.

The US comes out of this tit-for-tat round weaker and with fewer options. It is not clear whether the US has a plan for what happens now. The campaign of maximum pressure was supposed to force Iran to accept a worse deal than the 2015 multilateral nuclear agreement on which Donald Trump walked out in 2018. The oil and banking embargo on Iran have been highly effective in damaging the Iranian economy, but have failed to make Iran bow to US demands for Tehran to give up its military stake in Middle East conflicts and its enrichment of uranium. Instead, Iran has hit back against tanker traffic in the Persian Gulf, and Saudi oil facilities, while ratcheting up pressure on the US military presence in Iraq. US officials have talked in recent days about \u201crestoring deterrence\u201d against such moves with air strikes against KH targets, and have warned they are ready to escalate by taking the fight into Iranian territory. US deterrence however is undermined by having given Iran so little to lose, and by the vacillation of the president, who is entering an election year claiming he has extricated the country from costly foreign wars, while simultaneously wanting to appear tough in the standoff with Iran. \u201cTo those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don\u2019t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time!\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday, but he sent the tweet while on his way to his golf course in Palm Beach. He was convinced that maximum pressure would bring Iran to the negotiating table as a supplicant, but instead it has added to the chaos. No one \u2013 almost certainly not even Trump \u2013 knows how he is going to respond.",

In a lawsuit filed in US court in Los Angeles on Monday, Uber and Postmates argued however that the law violates federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process. Uber said it will try to link the lawsuit to another legal challenge filed by associations representing freelance writers and photographers. In mid-December, the two groups argued the new law would unconstitutionally affect free speech by limiting how many stories they can produce. The California Trucking Association filed the first challenge to the law in November on behalf of independent truckers. The latest challenge includes two independent workers who wrote about their concerns with the new law. \u201cThis has thrown my life and the lives of more than a hundred thousand drivers into uncertainty,\u201d ride-share driver Lydia Olson wrote in a Facebook post cited by Uber.

It joined Lyft and DoorDash in a vow to each spend $30m(\u00a323m) to overturn the law at the ballot box in 2020 if they don\u2019t win concessions from lawmakers next year. \u201cThe one clear thing we know about Uber is they will do anything to try to exempt themselves from state regulations that make us all safer and their driver employees self-sufficient,\u201d Gonzalez said in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, Uber chief executives will continue to become billionaires while too many of their drivers are forced to sleep in their cars.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Rebecca Long Bailey makes very valid points about the need for an imaginative, transformative agenda (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\" title=\"\">We can take the Labour party back into power. Here\u2019s how</a>, Journal, 30 December). One crucial feature she ignores is that the electoral system is now so distorted and so loaded against Labour ever gaining a majority of seats that the party cannot do it alone.</p> <p>I was expelled from the Labour party in 2017 for advocating a progressive alliance to secure victory for progressive candidates in seats that Labour cannot win. I stood aside as a Green party parliamentary candidate in 2019 in an attempt to unseat Jeremy Hunt in his South West Surrey constituency. The local Labour party could not support this approach because of its rulebook.</p> <p>It is only through Labour supporting a one-off progressive alliance underpinned by a commitment to a fair voting system \u2013 under which we would have no need for pre-election tactical alliances \u2013 that Labour can find its way back to leading a government of the left. Will any of the current candidates for the Labour leadership offer up this realistic route back to power?<br><strong>Steve Williams</strong><br><em>Godalming, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Long-Bailey writes that Labour \u201cmust pledge to upend the broken political system that has held back our communities for decades. Wealth and power must be returned to the people of Britain, and their desire for control over their own lives and the future of their communities must be at the heart of our agenda.\u201d Does that mean she is committed to a radical programme of constitutional reform, beginning with PR for elections to Westminster?</p> <p>As a new Labour party member who has joined only to have a vote in the leadership contest, my choice will be determined by the need for every vote to count, a renewal of our political institutions and for a radical programme of decentralisation of power. Locally is the best way to address the climate crisis, too.<br><strong>Lyn Dade</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Much of Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s piece appeared to be jargon-filled waffle. While the Tories are (possibly falsely) promising to put extra money into the NHS, to increase police numbers, and to revise the Treasury spending formula in order to spend more outside London, Long-Bailey is offering to \u201cupend the broken political system\u201d, to \u201ctake the conversation from Westminster to the workplaces and social spaces\u201d and to \u201crevive this progressive patriotism\u201d.</p> <p>I wonder how many people at the school gates, in A&amp;E departments and supermarket queues will be saying: \u201cOf course! Stuff the NHS, I\u2019ll vote for for a conversation about upending the political system.\u201d</p> <p>Can other Labour leadership candidates please explain in clear language how they would plan to improve this country for everyone, in order to take the fight to the Tories?<br><strong>Nadine Grieve</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the various plans put forward by Emily Thornberry and Rebecca Long-Bailey, there is very little that amounts to a recognition of those underlying factors which generated a loss of Labour votes. The cliche of rebuilding communities and trust demands a recognition of issues such as the social fracture created by an emphasis on higher education at the expense of further and vocational education, the loss of \u201cgood\u201d jobs and the refusal to address the absence of public value for essential forms of employment such as that of care. Slogans such as \u201call jobs should be good jobs\u201d might be just one of the policies that might be more relevant to millions of people than pious remarks about trust and engagement.<br><strong>Mary Evans</strong><br><em>Patrixbourne, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 I felt dismayed as I read Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s prospectus to return Labour to power. Seven paragraphs of dark imagery (\u201causterity\u201d, \u201cnightmare\u201d, \u201cbroken system\u201d, \u201cplunging living standards\u201d) offer scant hope of a Labour revival. Candidates for the leadership take note: scolding the Tories for their past failings is not enough. We need a spirited vision of a competent and kind Labour government.<br><strong>Declan Cadogan</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email <a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit <a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\">gu.com/letters</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\">Click here</a> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</strong></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Rebecca Long Bailey makes very valid points about the need for an imaginative, transformative agenda (We can take the Labour party back into power. Here\u2019s how, Journal, 30 December). One crucial feature she ignores is that the electoral system is now so distorted and so loaded against Labour ever gaining a majority of seats that the party cannot do it alone. I was expelled from the Labour party in 2017 for advocating a progressive alliance to secure victory for progressive candidates in seats that Labour cannot win. I stood aside as a Green party parliamentary candidate in 2019 in an attempt to unseat Jeremy Hunt in his South West Surrey constituency. The local Labour party could not support this approach because of its rulebook. It is only through Labour supporting a one-off progressive alliance underpinned by a commitment to a fair voting system \u2013 under which we would have no need for pre-election tactical alliances \u2013 that Labour can find its way back to leading a government of the left. Will any of the current candidates for the Labour leadership offer up this realistic route back to power? Steve Williams Godalming, Surrey \u2022 Rebecca Long-Bailey writes that Labour \u201cmust pledge to upend the broken political system that has held back our communities for decades. Wealth and power must be returned to the people of Britain, and their desire for control over their own lives and the future of their communities must be at the heart of our agenda.\u201d Does that mean she is committed to a radical programme of constitutional reform, beginning with PR for elections to Westminster? As a new Labour party member who has joined only to have a vote in the leadership contest, my choice will be determined by the need for every vote to count, a renewal of our political institutions and for a radical programme of decentralisation of power. Locally is the best way to address the climate crisis, too. Lyn Dade London \u2022 Much of Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s piece appeared to be jargon-filled waffle. While the Tories are (possibly falsely) promising to put extra money into the NHS, to increase police numbers, and to revise the Treasury spending formula in order to spend more outside London, Long-Bailey is offering to \u201cupend the broken political system\u201d, to \u201ctake the conversation from Westminster to the workplaces and social spaces\u201d and to \u201crevive this progressive patriotism\u201d. I wonder how many people at the school gates, in A&amp;E departments and supermarket queues will be saying: \u201cOf course! Stuff the NHS, I\u2019ll vote for for a conversation about upending the political system.\u201d Can other Labour leadership candidates please explain in clear language how they would plan to improve this country for everyone, in order to take the fight to the Tories? Nadine Grieve London \u2022 In the various plans put forward by Emily Thornberry and Rebecca Long-Bailey, there is very little that amounts to a recognition of those underlying factors which generated a loss of Labour votes. The cliche of rebuilding communities and trust demands a recognition of issues such as the social fracture created by an emphasis on higher education at the expense of further and vocational education, the loss of \u201cgood\u201d jobs and the refusal to address the absence of public value for essential forms of employment such as that of care. Slogans such as \u201call jobs should be good jobs\u201d might be just one of the policies that might be more relevant to millions of people than pious remarks about trust and engagement. Mary Evans Patrixbourne, Kent \u2022 I felt dismayed as I read Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s prospectus to return Labour to power. Seven paragraphs of dark imagery (\u201causterity\u201d, \u201cnightmare\u201d, \u201cbroken system\u201d, \u201cplunging living standards\u201d) offer scant hope of a Labour revival. Candidates for the leadership take note: scolding the Tories for their past failings is not enough. We need a spirited vision of a competent and kind Labour government.

Citing the EU member\u2019s constitutionally regulated separation of powers, he added that the government did not comment on positions or allegations raised in matters before the courts. Monday\u2019s ruling was met with protests outside the district court in Famagusta, where female activists lambasted the proceedings as a miscarriage of justice.

Elucidating on his judgment before a packed court in Paralimni, the town closest to Ayia Napa, where the incident allegedly took place, Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said the Briton had been motivated by feelings of anger and shame after discovering that some of the Israelis had used their mobile phones to record her having consensual sex in a hotel room with one of the group. \u201cHer guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt,\u201d he said, emphasising that the teenager had voluntarily elected to revoke the fabricated rape claim.

      "body": "<p>An NHS hospital in Norwich has had to close four beds in its high dependency unit because it does not have enough nurses to staff them.</p> <p>Norfolk and Norwich university hospital (NNUH) decided on Monday to temporarily shut the beds in the Gissing ward of its critical care complex.</p> <p>The beds, which are used for seriously ill patients, have been shut despite flu and other viruses that circulate at this time of year leaving more patients than usual suffering from breathing problems.</p> <p>Hospital managers told doctors in an email that: \u201cA decision has been made to temporarily close our GHDU beds and reduce to 20 bed capacity on our CCC [critical care complex] from today as the nursing staffing is insufficient to keep Gissing open.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Norwich hospital confirmed later: \u201cWe have temporarily reduced the number of high dependency beds at NNUH from 24 to 20 in order to maintain national intensive care staffing standards. During this time the HDU area on Gissing ward will be repurposed for general surgical patients. We are actively recruiting specialist staff to reopen those four beds for HDU as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>The closure is another stark illustration of both the lack of staff in the NHS, which in England has around 100,000 vacancies, and the extra strain winter is putting on hospitals.</p> <p>The Norfolk and Norwich has come under particular pressure in recent weeks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/20/doctors-told-to-use-least-unsafe-option-in-norwich-hospital\">The Guardian recently disclosed </a>that it was so overwhelmed by demand that it had told senior doctors to make \u201cthe least unsafe decision\u201d when treating patients.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/19/nine-in-10-nhs-bosses-say-staffing-crisis-endangering-patients\">NHS bosses warned recently</a> that staff shortages were now so widespread that patients\u2019 safety and quality of care are under threat.</p> <p>Derriford hospital in Plymouth has also come under intense pressure in a winter that has seen more cases than usual of both flu and norovirus, the winter vomiting bug.</p> <p>It told staff on Monday that the sheer weight of demand for care meant it had started the day \u201cat 104% [bed] occupancy\u201d and on \u201cblack alert\u201d \u2013 an official admission by an NHS trust that it is struggling to cope.</p> <p>It added: \u201cWe recognise teams are stretched with outliers and appreciate the efforts needed to ensure ward rounds go ahead as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Sue Crossland, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said lack of social care support over the festive season was partly to blame for the \u201cextreme stress on the system\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEvery acute trust I know is suffering with overwhelming demand for beds, which are all full. This is putting pressure on emergency departments, which are getting towards standstill, and acute medical units, which are trying to help absorb the flow into hospital.</p> <p>\u201cThe demand for admission is overwhelming and there is so little movement due to social care being less accessible over the extended holiday period. Patients are sick, lots are requiring admission but beds are full with both sick and waiting for social care patients,\u201d Crossland said.</p> <p>Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for EveryDoctor, an organisation of grassroots doctors, said: \u201cIt is absolutely appalling that adult high dependency unit beds are being closed in an NHS hospital due to unsafe staffing levels. These beds are used by patients requiring a high level of care from skilled professionals. These patients now won\u2019t receive that specialised care, and they will suffer for it.</p> <p>\u201cThe current situation \u2013 hospitals on black alert up and down the country, cancelled cancer operations, closed HDU beds \u2013 highlights that the government\u2019s NHS austerity cuts have gone too far, and patients\u2019 lives are now at risk because NHS trusts do not have the resources to care safely for patients\u201d.</p> <p>In a message, managers at Southend hospital thanked staff for their hard work over Christmas but added that: \u201cNot surprisingly [we] have tipped into [an] internal critical [incident] this morning\u201d because of the large number of patients it had decided to admit but did not have a bed for.\u201d</p> <p>One doctor at Southend, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cThe situation in A&amp;E is unsafe every day due to there being nowhere for patients waiting for a hospital bed. This results in nowhere to see new patients, including at times the inability to receive blue [light] emergency calls into the resuscitation room.\u201d</p> <p>Hospitals have taken steps to prepare for winter, including opening \u201cescalation\u201d or overflow wards in which to look after patients, paying for some patients who are nearing discharge to be moved to a care home and installing temporary portable wards in their grounds.</p> <p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cHospitals have more beds open than this time last year, but flu and norovirus are adding pressure at a time when the NHS is already looking after significantly more people than ever before. The NHS has already looked after a million more people in A&amp;E this year compared to last, and at this particularly busy time it\u2019s really important that the public help our hardworking staff by getting their flu vaccine now, using the free NHS 111 phone and online service for urgent medical needs, and seeing their local pharmacist for minor ailments before they get worse.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An NHS hospital in Norwich has had to close four beds in its high dependency unit because it does not have enough nurses to staff them. Norfolk and Norwich university hospital (NNUH) decided on Monday to temporarily shut the beds in the Gissing ward of its critical care complex. The beds, which are used for seriously ill patients, have been shut despite flu and other viruses that circulate at this time of year leaving more patients than usual suffering from breathing problems. Hospital managers told doctors in an email that: \u201cA decision has been made to temporarily close our GHDU beds and reduce to 20 bed capacity on our CCC [critical care complex] from today as the nursing staffing is insufficient to keep Gissing open.\u201d A spokesman for the Norwich hospital confirmed later: \u201cWe have temporarily reduced the number of high dependency beds at NNUH from 24 to 20 in order to maintain national intensive care staffing standards. During this time the HDU area on Gissing ward will be repurposed for general surgical patients. We are actively recruiting specialist staff to reopen those four beds for HDU as soon as possible.\u201d The closure is another stark illustration of both the lack of staff in the NHS, which in England has around 100,000 vacancies, and the extra strain winter is putting on hospitals. The Norfolk and Norwich has come under particular pressure in recent weeks. The Guardian recently disclosed that it was so overwhelmed by demand that it had told senior doctors to make \u201cthe least unsafe decision\u201d when treating patients. NHS bosses warned recently that staff shortages were now so widespread that patients\u2019 safety and quality of care are under threat. Derriford hospital in Plymouth has also come under intense pressure in a winter that has seen more cases than usual of both flu and norovirus, the winter vomiting bug. It told staff on Monday that the sheer weight of demand for care meant it had started the day \u201cat 104% [bed] occupancy\u201d and on \u201cblack alert\u201d \u2013 an official admission by an NHS trust that it is struggling to cope. It added: \u201cWe recognise teams are stretched with outliers and appreciate the efforts needed to ensure ward rounds go ahead as soon as possible.\u201d Dr Sue Crossland, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said lack of social care support over the festive season was partly to blame for the \u201cextreme stress on the system\u201d. \u201cEvery acute trust I know is suffering with overwhelming demand for beds, which are all full. This is putting pressure on emergency departments, which are getting towards standstill, and acute medical units, which are trying to help absorb the flow into hospital. \u201cThe demand for admission is overwhelming and there is so little movement due to social care being less accessible over the extended holiday period. Patients are sick, lots are requiring admission but beds are full with both sick and waiting for social care patients,\u201d Crossland said. Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for EveryDoctor, an organisation of grassroots doctors, said: \u201cIt is absolutely appalling that adult high dependency unit beds are being closed in an NHS hospital due to unsafe staffing levels. These beds are used by patients requiring a high level of care from skilled professionals. These patients now won\u2019t receive that specialised care, and they will suffer for it. \u201cThe current situation \u2013 hospitals on black alert up and down the country, cancelled cancer operations, closed HDU beds \u2013 highlights that the government\u2019s NHS austerity cuts have gone too far, and patients\u2019 lives are now at risk because NHS trusts do not have the resources to care safely for patients\u201d. In a message, managers at Southend hospital thanked staff for their hard work over Christmas but added that: \u201cNot surprisingly [we] have tipped into [an] internal critical [incident] this morning\u201d because of the large number of patients it had decided to admit but did not have a bed for.\u201d One doctor at Southend, who asked not to be named, said: \u201cThe situation in A&amp;E is unsafe every day due to there being nowhere for patients waiting for a hospital bed. This results in nowhere to see new patients, including at times the inability to receive blue [light] emergency calls into the resuscitation room.\u201d Hospitals have taken steps to prepare for winter, including opening \u201cescalation\u201d or overflow wards in which to look after patients, paying for some patients who are nearing discharge to be moved to a care home and installing temporary portable wards in their grounds. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cHospitals have more beds open than this time last year, but flu and norovirus are adding pressure at a time when the NHS is already looking after significantly more people than ever before. The NHS has already looked after a million more people in A&amp;E this year compared to last, and at this particularly busy time it\u2019s really important that the public help our hardworking staff by getting their flu vaccine now, using the free NHS 111 phone and online service for urgent medical needs, and seeing their local pharmacist for minor ailments before they get worse.\u201d",

But that understates the cultural significance of fishing to a nation surrounded by water. The freedom to make a living from the sea is vital to many communities\u2019 sense of self-sufficiency and self-esteem. It reaches deep into a national sense of independence, which is why the common fisheries policy (CFP) has felt like an affront to sovereignty. Yet when the UK leaves the European Union at the end of January , few believe we will be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/02/uk-take-back-control-london-fisheries-convention-michael-gove\" title=\"\"> \u201ctaking back our waters\u201d</a>. Fishing\u2019s symbolic potency means it will loom larger than many industries in the coming awkward trade compromise.</p> <p>The parable of the fish tells of a painful adjustment: from Brexit as abstract celebration of sovereignty to Brexit as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/31/myth-brexit-bonanza-uk-fishing-exposed-no-deal\" title=\"\">realisation of limitations</a> on UK power. There will be an 11-month transition during which the terms of the CFP still apply, but then the UK becomes an \u201cindependent coastal state\u201d under UN maritime convention. Its waters are its own to manage within an \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d extending 200 nautical miles from the shore. That should feel like taking back control, which is why fishermen were enthusiastic about Brexit. The reality will feel different. About 60% of the fish caught in UK waters is taken by EU ships. British boats get around 15% of their haul from non-British waters. Other coastal states have their own fishing communities with their own identities and interests to protect. They can also pool their negotiating power relative to the UK via the European commission. In theory, Britain has a strong card to play with its newfound legal rights of exclusivity. Europeans want to be able to catch UK fish. Come <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759021/25_November_Political_Declaration_setting_out_the_framework_for_the_future_relationship_between_the_European_Union_and_the_United_Kingdom__.pdf\" title=\"\">January 2021</a>, Boris Johnson could supposedly banish EU boats and deploy the Royal Navy to enforce a British monopoly.</p> <p><strong>July deadline</strong><br>That scenario exists only as nationalistic fantasy. The UK is as interested in selling processed goods to Europe as it is in catching fish. British consumers eat relatively little local seafood. We import cod from (non-EU) Norway and Iceland. We sell crayfish and crab to France and Spain. <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/78/7811.htm\" title=\"\">The UK exports 80% of its catch.</a> The majority goes to the EU, facilitated by frictionless borders. After Britain leaves the customs union and single market, those goods will face a range of new checks, labelling requirements and hygiene inspections. Maintaining access to EU consumers will matter more to British negotiators than excluding continental boats from UK waters, especially when many of those vessels catch fish we do not want. Few diners begrudge the Danes their share of North Sea sprats for use in pig feed.</p> <p>Before talks about a comprehensive trade deal have even begun, the EU side will demand ongoing access to UK waters and Mr Johnson will acquiesce because the clock will be ticking.

      "bodyText": "Fisheries make up a tiny proportion of the UK\u2019s economic activity \u2013 roughly 0.1%; around three-quarters of that is on the processing side of the industry. But that understates the cultural significance of fishing to a nation surrounded by water. The freedom to make a living from the sea is vital to many communities\u2019 sense of self-sufficiency and self-esteem. It reaches deep into a national sense of independence, which is why the common fisheries policy (CFP) has felt like an affront to sovereignty. Yet when the UK leaves the European Union at the end of January , few believe we will be \u201ctaking back our waters\u201d. Fishing\u2019s symbolic potency means it will loom larger than many industries in the coming awkward trade compromise. The parable of the fish tells of a painful adjustment: from Brexit as abstract celebration of sovereignty to Brexit as realisation of limitations on UK power. There will be an 11-month transition during which the terms of the CFP still apply, but then the UK becomes an \u201cindependent coastal state\u201d under UN maritime convention. Its waters are its own to manage within an \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d extending 200 nautical miles from the shore. That should feel like taking back control, which is why fishermen were enthusiastic about Brexit. The reality will feel different. About 60% of the fish caught in UK waters is taken by EU ships. British boats get around 15% of their haul from non-British waters. Other coastal states have their own fishing communities with their own identities and interests to protect. They can also pool their negotiating power relative to the UK via the European commission. In theory, Britain has a strong card to play with its newfound legal rights of exclusivity. Europeans want to be able to catch UK fish. Come January 2021, Boris Johnson could supposedly banish EU boats and deploy the Royal Navy to enforce a British monopoly. July deadline That scenario exists only as nationalistic fantasy. The UK is as interested in selling processed goods to Europe as it is in catching fish. British consumers eat relatively little local seafood. We import cod from (non-EU) Norway and Iceland. We sell crayfish and crab to France and Spain. The UK exports 80% of its catch. The majority goes to the EU, facilitated by frictionless borders. After Britain leaves the customs union and single market, those goods will face a range of new checks, labelling requirements and hygiene inspections. Maintaining access to EU consumers will matter more to British negotiators than excluding continental boats from UK waters, especially when many of those vessels catch fish we do not want. Few diners begrudge the Danes their share of North Sea sprats for use in pig feed. Before talks about a comprehensive trade deal have even begun, the EU side will demand ongoing access to UK waters and Mr Johnson will acquiesce because the clock will be ticking. The deadline for a fisheries deal is July, and if that cannot be settled quickly the prospects for a deal on anything else slip away. The prime minister\u2019s climbdown can be predicted with confidence because it has been rehearsed already. From the backbenches he accused Theresa May of linking fisheries and a future trade deal in terms that were \u201cnot what was promised to the people of this country\u201d.

He and Tice say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We put country before party or person.<strong> </strong>History will clearly show this. Standing down in over 300 seats effectively guaranteed a Boris majority, the only question was its size. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that we have not succeeded in our main goals. </p> \n   <p>We have changed politics for good in many ways since launching under 9 months ago. We are now assessing thoughts and ideas as to what our next steps might be.

Burgon writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Brexit also became an issue of trust.

During the Conservative leadership contest Johnson proposed raising the threshold for the higher rate of income tax from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. This would do nothing for those on low or average earnings, and most of the benefit would go to the richest 10% of households, who would each gain about \u00a32,500 a year.

Within sectors where margins are particularly tight \u2013 not least retail, care and hospitality - thousands of jobs have been lost over the last year as overheads mount.<br></p> \n   <p>Looking ahead, the independence of the Low Pay Commission must be respected. We can only push on with substantial increases to minimum wage rates if economic conditions allow.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong> said this increase would put pressure on businesses. Hannah Essex, the BCC\u2019s co-executive director, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Businesses want to pay their staff a good wage. But many have struggled with increased costs in a time of great economic uncertainty. Raising wage floors by more than double the rate of inflation will pile further pressure on cashflow and eat into training and investment budgets.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e0b0bad8f08c397226429b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-31T09:20:05.499Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Corbyn provokes anger from Labour critics with NY message glossing over impact of election defeat</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, which means it\u2019s time for political leaders to issue their new year\u2019s messages. It is hard to know why they bother (particularly given that they are now expected to produce a Christmas message too just the week before). If they say something bland, no one takes any notice. And if the message is noteworthy, that\u2019s probably for the wrong reasons \u2013 as <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> is discovering this morning.</p> \n  <p>His message contains no direct reference to the general election, although there is an oblique reference to it in the opening line \u2013 which must count as a very late, but unbeatable, entry for the prize of understatement of the decade.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>2019 has been quite the year for our country and for our labour movement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The rest of the message talks about how the Labour party will be \u201cthe resistance to Boris Johnson\u201d. I will post it in full because it does not seem to be available online.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And now we are not just entering a new year but a new decade. And the period ahead could not be more important.</p> \n   <p>It will be crucial if we are to stop irreversible damage being caused by the climate crisis and the particular effects that has on people in the global south.</p> \n   <p>If we are to stop the pain plaguing our country: food banks, poverty and people struggling to get by. If we are to protect our precious NHS.</p> \n   <p>It won\u2019t be easy. But we have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson. We will be campaigning every day. We will be on the frontline, both in parliament and on the streets.</p> \n   <p>Protecting our public services. Protecting healthcare free at the point of use. Protecting our communities, in all their brilliant diversity. And standing up for internationalism, global solidarity and cooperation, and working with movements and parties seeking social justice and change all over the world.</p> \n   <p>And make no mistake, our movement is very strong. We are half a million people and growing. We are in every region and nation of our country.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re not backed by the press barons, by the billionaires or by the millionaires who work for the billionaires. We\u2019re backed by you. We are by the many, for the many.</p> \n   <p>2020 and the years ahead will be tough. No one is saying otherwise. But we\u2019re up for the fight. To protect what we hold dear. And to build to win and to transform.</p> \n   <p>The fight continues. There is no other choice.</p> \n   <p>So if you\u2019re with us already, I can\u2019t wait to meet the challenges ahead together. But if you\u2019re not, join us. Join Labour today. Together we can bring about real change for our country, for the many and not just the few.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>All of this (apart from the reference to how the party membership has soared) is the sort of thing that Corbyn might reasonably have said at the end of 2015, when he had just taken over as leader of the Labour party.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has faced fierce criticism from current and former Labour MPs after releasing a new year message that made no direct reference to his crushing election defeat while insisting the party had a role as \u201cthe resistance to Boris Johnson\u201d. (See 9.20am, 10.59am, 11.04am, 11.43am, 11.54am, 12.18pm and 4.20pm.) Some of them suggested it confirmed fears that Corbyn was a politician more comfortable with protest than he was with obtaining and exercising power. Neil Coyle MP said Labour would be better able to resist Johnson if Corbyn had not led it to its worst result since 1935. The former MP Phil Wilson said that, far from resisting Johnson, Corbyn had enabled him to continue as PM. And the former minister Dame Anne McGuire said Corbyn was \u201cdelusional\u201d. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice minister, has announced that he is standing for the Labour deputy leadership. (See 2.33pm.) The former Conservative chancellor George Osborne has said that Tories want Rebecca Long Bailey to be the next Labour leader. (See 2.22pm.) A survey of Conservative party members suggests they want Boris Johnson to go ahead with a \u00a39bn tax cut that would mostly benefit the richest 10%. (See 12.51pm.) That\u2019s all from me for 2019. Happy new year. Earlier I quoted the Labour MP Neil Coyle criticising Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s new year message. (See 9.20am.) Since then he has beefed up his attack in a longer quote for PoliticsHome. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. Since this is the last blog of 2019, I would like to wish you all a very happy new year and to thank you all for reading the blog and other Guardian journalism. And I would particularly like to thank you if you contribute comments below the line. It has been an extraordinarily intense and busy and dramatic year for the blog and for many readers the fact that there is always stimulating, intelligent comment BTL is a big bonus. In October I was told we had accumulated 2.6m comments on this blog alone over the course of the year. God knows what the figure is now, but you are one of our most important commenting communities at the Guardian and we treasure you hugely. I\u2019ve also become more and more convinced, the longer I\u2019ve been doing this job, that my reporting is sharper, more accurate, more informed and more fair-minded because of the feedback I get from you BTL. Thanks. And if you contribute to the Guardian, through a subscription or through membership, thank you even more. During the general election both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn seemed to have discovered the magic money tree. But we haven\u2019t found it at the Guardian, and so we are dependent on revenue from readers and advertisers to keep the lights turned on and the computer screens flickering. I\u2019ll be wrapping up the blog fairly soon, but I hope to be back on Thursday. In a New Year\u2019s message to supporters Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, and Richard Tice, its chairman, say they are still deciding what will happen to the party in 2020. Earlier this month Farage said he would rename it the Reform party after Brexit, but he is not confirming that today. He and Tice say: We put country before party or person. History will clearly show this. Standing down in over 300 seats effectively guaranteed a Boris majority, the only question was its size. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that we have not succeeded in our main goals. We have changed politics for good in many ways since launching under 9 months ago. We are now assessing thoughts and ideas as to what our next steps might be. This does not need to be rushed, tempting though it is. In their message Farage and Tice also claim that, if they had not set up the Brexit party, Boris Johnson would not have become prime minister. There is much to celebrate: we are going to leave the EU on 31st January! The remoaners are crushed and most of the Brexit blockers in parliament are now gone. Remember this is thanks to the Brexit party. Without us, Boris would not have become PM. The Conservative party knew that to win, they had to copy many of our policies and ideas. As I have said before, according to May at 10, the recent Seldon/Newell book about Theresa May\u2019s premiership, Johnson himself also thinks Farage was crucial to his becoming PM. In an article for the Jewish Chronicle Ruth Smeeth, who was a Labour MP until she lost her seat in the election, claims that no serving member of the shadow cabinet deserves to be elected as the next leader because none of them did enough to support people like her when they were complaining about the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism. She says: Unless the next leader has a record of publicly attacking racism in the party, demanding expulsions, standing by the whistleblowers and supporting JLM [the Jewish Labour Movement] as the sole Jewish affiliate to the party then they will not get my vote and nor should they get your support. That means that no currently serving member of the shadow cabinet deserves our vote ... Yes, they would pay lip service when the anti-Jewish hate was at its worst. Some even addressed meetings of Labour MPs and said how awful it was that committed Jewish socialists like Margaret Hodge, Luciana Berger, Louise Ellman and I were being abused \u2014 but then they sat in shadow cabinet meetings and nothing changed. Richard Burgon\u2019s Tribune article offers one of the fuller versions available of what has become the standard Corbynite analysis of Labour\u2019s election defeat; that Brexit was the main problem for the party, and that Corbyn\u2019s leadership could not have been the main problem because he was also leading the party when it did much better in 2017. Burgon writes: Brexit also became an issue of trust. The failure to \u201cget it done\u201d meant many people simply did not believe we\u2019d be able to deliver on our ambitious manifesto. Put simply, the mood was: if you won\u2019t honour the referendum, then why should we trust your pledge to deliver a huge house building programme, a \u00a310 per hour minimum wage or scrap tuition fees? Regaining that trust is the first step towards winning. Initial assessments of YouGov, Ashcroft and Datapraxis data suggest Labour lost, more or less, the same numbers of votes to both remain and leave parties. In rebuilding, Labour must be the champion of the whole working-class: whether in towns and cities, whether remain or leave, and ensure we are a party that reflects the diversity of the working-class in 21st century multicultural Britain. Nostalgia has no role to play in making Labour successful again. Burgon does not set out a detailed plan for what the party should do next, but he says that it would be a mistake to abandon Corbyn\u2019s transformational policies, that the party should set up a special commission to look into why it lost in leave seats and that in future its campaigning should focus on promoting 10 key manifesto policies. Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, has announced that he is standing for the Labour deputy leadership. As Burgon said before Christmas when he revealed that he was considering standing, part of his pitch will be that he is a total Jeremy Corbyn loyalist who nominated Corbyn for the leadership in 2015 (when he was thought to have no chance of winning). This differentiates him from Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, who is seen as the favourite for the deputy leadership post, even though she has not declared her candidature yet. Two other candidates who are definitely standing are Dawn Butler, the shadow minister for women and equalities, and Khalid Mahmood, a shadow Europe minister. According to the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, Conservatives want Rebecca Long Bailey to be the next leader of the Labour party. Supporters of Long Bailey, who is seen as the candidate most favoured by Corbynites at the top of the party, would argue that it does not make sense for politicians to give strategic advice to their opponents and that, if Osborne is saying this in public, that must be because he sees Long Bailey as a threat. Perhaps. But there is no evidence that Long Bailey would be more of a threat to the Tories than, say, Sir Keir Starmer, and a recent BMG poll found that people say they would prefer Starmer, Jess Phillips or Yvette Cooper to replace Jeremy Corbyn than Long Bailey, who was on just 2%. Sometimes it is just best to assume politicians are telling the truth. At this stage polling about the Labour leadership candidates is not necessarily very helpful because voters don\u2019t know much about some of the candidates. The same BMG poll suggests 61% of people say they have never heard of Long Bailey. But it is assumed that Long Bailey would be more likely than some of her rivals to continue the broad thrust of Corbynism \u2013 which presumably explains why Osborne does not see her as a threat. According to a YouGov index, Long Bailey is the 54th most popular Labour politician in the UK (out of 98). That puts her ahead of Lisa Nandy (55th), but behind Keith Vaz (51st). But this is not a particularly useful measure. The YouGov index is based on an average of rolling poll findings from May 2018, and so it is not up to date. And politicians are ranked according to their positive opinion score. Long Bailey has a positive opinion of just 6% (only 6% of people say they rate her positively), but her negative score (people with a negative view of her) is just 8%, making a net score of -2. Jeremy Corbyn comes fifth in this list because his positive rating is 21%. But his negative rating is 61%. The Labour politician at the top of the list is Ed Balls. Since the general election Boris Johnson has been claiming that the Conservatives are now a \u201ctotally different party\u201d because of the success he had at winning over working-class voters and voters in the north (not always the same people, of course). There is some evidence to back up what he is saying; the party is now more popular with working-class voters than it is with middle-class voters. But the character of a party is not just determined by who votes for it. What is even more important is who its MPs are, and who its members are, and a ConservativeHome survey of party members today suggests that the membership has yet to embrace Johnson\u2019s new-found proletarianism. During the Conservative leadership contest Johnson proposed raising the threshold for the higher rate of income tax from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. This would do nothing for those on low or average earnings, and most of the benefit would go to the richest 10% of households, who would each gain about \u00a32,500 a year. According to an Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis (pdf), this would also cost \u00a39bn. A genuine one nation party would not go near a policy like this. But when ConservativeHome asked members if Johnson should stick with this proposal, or drop it, about two-thirds of them said he should honour the promise. Johnson appears to be in a strong position. But these findings suggest that reconciling the demands of his party\u2019s longstanding members with the interests of its new, non-traditional supporters won\u2019t be straightforward. The Daily Mirror\u2019s Kevin Maguire, one of the most high-profile Labour-supporting commentators in the media, thinks Jeremy Corbyn sounded \u201cclueless\u201d in his New Year\u2019s message. Tom Blenkinsop, a Labour MP from 2010 to 2017 and a longstanding critic of Corbyn\u2019s, has an even harsher take on the new year message. Sir Vince Cable, the former Lib Dem leader, has told the Daily Mail in an interview that the party\u2019s decision to go into the election promising to revoke Brexit was a \u201cmistake\u201d. He explained: There is an adage in politics \u2013 \u2018if you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing\u2019. Liberal Democrat canvassers found themselves explaining endlessly to voters on doorsteps that the proposal to revoke article 50 would only apply in the event of a democratic earthquake, and the election of a majority Liberal Democrat government. At the start of the election campaign the Lib Dems confirmed that their policy was to revoke Brexit. But as it became clear that this was unpopular with voters, because it sounded undemocratic, the party increasingly focused on its support for a second referendum (a more likely outcome, because it was an option backed by Labour and the Lib Dems). But Cable said, even though the prospect of the Lib Dems obtaining the majority that would allow them to revoke Brexit was most improbable, that did not stop people getting angry about the idea. \u201cCommentators could sustain derision about the likelihood of this outcome, but also outrage about the implications,\u201d he said. Phil Wilson, who was Labour MP for Sedgefield until he lost his seat at the election, says that, far from being part of the resistance to Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn has been one of Johnson\u2019s \u201cenablers\u201d \u2013 helping him to stay PM. The Labour MP Gareth Thomas also seems unimpressed by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s new year message. And Caroline Flint, who was a Labour MP until she lost her seat at the election, seems astonished that Corbyn did not directly mention the election result in his message. The Scottish government has said that the increase in the national living wage announced today (see 9.53am) does not go far enough. This is from Jamie Hepburn, its fair work minister, who says the Scottish government urges organisations to pay the voluntary Living Wage Foundation\u2019s living wage instead. While I welcome any increase to workers\u2019 hourly rate of pay, the increases announced today, following a decade of UK government austerity, do not go far enough. The UK national living wage is still not a real living wage - even for those who will receive the full rate \u2013 and it cannot be right that workers aged 18 to 25 receive a lower rate of pay. That is why the Scottish government supports the payment of the real living wage of \u00a39.30 per hour. Unlike the UK national living wage, this is a minimum rate which applies to all workers over the age of 18. While pay legislation remains reserved to the UK government, we continue to encourage every organisation, regardless of size, sector or location to ensure all staff receive a fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work. More than 200,000 people have signed a change.org petition protesting against the knighthood awarded to Iain Duncan Smith. The former work and pensions secretary, who was responsible for the implementation of the controversial universal credit system, was named in the new year honours list, which recognises the \u201cachievements and service of extraordinary people\u201d in the UK. The petition, started by an NHS psychiatrist, says that Duncan Smith was \u201cresponsible for some of the cruellest most extreme welfare reforms this country has ever seen\u201d which have led to \u201csuffering and impoverishment\u201d. It describes his knighthood as an \u201cinsult to the hundreds of thousands of vulnerable individuals across this country who are suffering as a result of his policies\u201d and calls for his title to be dropped. And here is another former Labour MP on the Jeremy Corbyn message. Michael Dugher briefly served in Corbyn\u2019s first shadow cabinet before being sacked in January 2016 for disloyalty. He left parliament in 2017. More reaction to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s new year\u2019s message. This is from Dame Anne McGuire, Labour MP for Stirling from 1997 to 2015 and a former minister. Here is the video version of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s controversial New Year\u2019s message. (See 9.20am.) In the Guardian today my colleague Rajeev Syal reports that Angela Rayner is expected to endorse Rebecca Long Bailey for the Labour leadership in the new year, contrary to intense speculation that she might instead pursue a leadership bid of her own. Here are some of the Labour leadership stories in the other papers. Sebastian Payne in the Financial Times (paywall) says the Labour left is divided over who is best placed to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. He says: Corbyn supporters initially focused on Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow business secretary ... But her pitch of \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d [in a Guardian article yesterday] has not been universally well received. One senior party figure described it as a \u201cconfection of nothingness\u201d. Another official said the article \u2014 which has been in gestation for more than a week \u2014 confirmed Ms Long Bailey was \u201ca reluctant leader and it seems people are realising that now\u201d ... Ms Long Bailey\u2019s status as the left\u2019s main candidate is under threat from Ian Lavery, the party chair who is close to Mr Corbyn ... One Corbyn ally said the influence of the powerful Unite trade union was behind Mr Lavery\u2019s decision to challenge Ms Long Bailey. \u201cI think that Unite \u2014 specifically [leader] Len McCluskey and [Corbyn ally] Karie Murphy \u2014 are disaffected with Becky for some reason and they are encouraging Ian Lavery to run. From their point of view, the beauty of Ian is Corbynism without Corbyn. But I don\u2019t see him appealing to voters in London and the cities or university towns.\u201d But Henry Yorke in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) says Labour \u201cmoderates\u201d think Lavery is only floating the idea he might run to boost Long Bailey\u2019s chances. He says: Toby Perkins, the MP for Chesterfield, urged colleagues not to be \u201cfooled\u201d, adding that it was \u201cpurely an attempt to convince us that [Ms Long-Bailey] is not a far left choice\u201d. \u201cHe won\u2019t really stand, she will,\u201d he added. His concerns were echoed by a trade union source, who told The Daily Telegraph they had seen no evidence to suggest that Mr Lavery was preparing a \u201cserious bid\u201d to replace Mr Corbyn. They added that wielding a second candidate from Mr Corbyn\u2019s wing of the party would help \u201cmake the left look stronger\u201d, thereby increasing Ms Long-Bailey\u2019s chances of winning. Henry Zeffman in the Times (paywall) says Rayner is being urged by some of her supporters not to back Long Bailey for Labour leader. He says: Ms Rayner is being urged by her allies not to reciprocate when she announces her own campaign. One source said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear what Rebecca gets out of Angela\u2019s support but not clear what Angela gets out of it. She\u2019ll walk deputy either way. But if she backs Rebecca she\u2019ll be dragged into the hard-left warfare.\u201d Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun says some leadership candidates fear Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s allies on Labour\u2019s national executive committee will shorten the timescale for the leadership contest to boost the chances of Long Bailey winning. He says: The race to replace the 70 year-old veteran socialist formally opens next week and was expected to run until the end of March. But some of the contenders have learned senior party officials are now trying to impose an end date of Saturday, March 7 instead. In addition, the wannabe candidates fear they will only be allowed two weeks to tie down the support of the required number of formal backers to allow them to run. Under rule changes enforced last year to lessen MPs\u2019 power over the selection, hopefuls must win the support of at least 5% of affiliated members, including at least two unions, or 5% of constituency parties, on top of 21 MPs. A shorter contest is seen to significantly benefit Mr Corbyn\u2019s inner circle\u2019s preferred choice, Rebecca Long Bailey. The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank specialising in issues affecting those on low and middle incomes, has welcomed the increase in the national living wage (see 9.53am) - although it says the government plan to increase it to \u00a310.50 an hour by 2024 is \u201cnot risk free\u201d. Nye Cominetti, an economic analyst at the foundation, said: This latest ramping up of the legal wage floor will boost the pay packets of millions of workers. With the government committed to delivering one of the highest wage floors in the world by 2024, we are set for another parliament of big pay rises for the UK\u2019s lowest earners of around five per cent a year. This ambition is welcome but not risk free. It should be matched by a renewed commitment to swiftly evaluating evidence of the impact of such large and sustained minimum wage rises - and acting on that evidence if problems emerge. Today the government has announced that the national living wage (the minimum wage for over-25s) will increase by four times the rate of inflation. The Treasury press notice about the move is here, and my colleague Richard Partington\u2019s news story is here. Business groups have expressed some concern about the move. The Federation of Small Businesses said increases in the NLW on this scale could be self-defeating. In a statement Craig Beaumont, the FSB\u2019s director of external affairs and advocacy, said: Four in ten small employers say they will raise prices in response to an NLW increase of this magnitude. One in four say they will recruit fewer workers, one in five will cancel investment plans, and one in ten will consider redundancies. There\u2019s always a danger of being self-defeating in this space: wage increases aren\u2019t much good to workers if prices rise, jobs are lost and there\u2019s no impact on productivity because employers are forced to cut back on investing in tech, training and equipment. We\u2019re already seeing signs of a cooling labour market. Within sectors where margins are particularly tight \u2013 not least retail, care and hospitality - thousands of jobs have been lost over the last year as overheads mount. Looking ahead, the independence of the Low Pay Commission must be respected. We can only push on with substantial increases to minimum wage rates if economic conditions allow. And the British Chambers of Commerce said this increase would put pressure on businesses. Hannah Essex, the BCC\u2019s co-executive director, said: Businesses want to pay their staff a good wage. But many have struggled with increased costs in a time of great economic uncertainty. Raising wage floors by more than double the rate of inflation will pile further pressure on cashflow and eat into training and investment budgets. Good morning. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, which means it\u2019s time for political leaders to issue their new year\u2019s messages. It is hard to know why they bother (particularly given that they are now expected to produce a Christmas message too just the week before). If they say something bland, no one takes any notice. And if the message is noteworthy, that\u2019s probably for the wrong reasons \u2013 as Jeremy Corbyn is discovering this morning. His message contains no direct reference to the general election, although there is an oblique reference to it in the opening line \u2013 which must count as a very late, but unbeatable, entry for the prize of understatement of the decade. 2019 has been quite the year for our country and for our labour movement. The rest of the message talks about how the Labour party will be \u201cthe resistance to Boris Johnson\u201d. I will post it in full because it does not seem to be available online. And now we are not just entering a new year but a new decade. And the period ahead could not be more important. It will be crucial if we are to stop irreversible damage being caused by the climate crisis and the particular effects that has on people in the global south. If we are to stop the pain plaguing our country: food banks, poverty and people struggling to get by. If we are to protect our precious NHS. It won\u2019t be easy. But we have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson. We will be campaigning every day. We will be on the frontline, both in parliament and on the streets. Protecting our public services. Protecting healthcare free at the point of use. Protecting our communities, in all their brilliant diversity. And standing up for internationalism, global solidarity and cooperation, and working with movements and parties seeking social justice and change all over the world. And make no mistake, our movement is very strong. We are half a million people and growing. We are in every region and nation of our country. We\u2019re not backed by the press barons, by the billionaires or by the millionaires who work for the billionaires. We\u2019re backed by you. We are by the many, for the many. 2020 and the years ahead will be tough. No one is saying otherwise. But we\u2019re up for the fight. To protect what we hold dear. And to build to win and to transform. The fight continues. There is no other choice. So if you\u2019re with us already, I can\u2019t wait to meet the challenges ahead together. But if you\u2019re not, join us. Join Labour today. Together we can bring about real change for our country, for the many and not just the few. All of this (apart from the reference to how the party membership has soared) is the sort of thing that Corbyn might reasonably have said at the end of 2015, when he had just taken over as leader of the Labour party. But after four years as leader, two election defeats, one of which was devastating after an election Corbyn voted for, the lack of introspection, or self-criticism, is remarkable. Here is some reaction from Labour figures not on the Corbynite wing of the party. From Neil Coyle, the Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark From the former Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick From Tom Hamilton, an adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader From Darren Murphy, a former No 10 adviser in the Blair era It looks as if it is going to be a quiet news day but, as usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "With European investors now heading off for the New Year celebrations, we can take a look at how markets around the world fared in 2019. MSCI World Index: up 24% UK FTSE 100: up 12% Europe-wide Stoxx 600: up 23% China\u2019s CSI 300: up 36% Japan\u2019s Nikkei: up 18% US Nasdaq: up 35% (still trading today) US S&amp;P 500: up 28% (still trading today) So, a sparkling year -- including the biggest jump in global stocks since 2009. But some of this rally is a recovery from the slump in autumn 2018. Plus, 2020 could derail the rally if we see renewed trade tensions, a global slowdown, or new Brexit worries. That\u2019s probably all for me for this year (although I might pop back with the Wall Street close, if I can be dragged away from New Year festivities). Very best wishes for 2020 from us all here. See you next year! GW Newsflash: European stock markets have now all closed for the year. This leaves the Stoxx 600 index of leading EU companies up 23% for 2019, underlining what a strong year it has been. France\u2019s CAC ended the day very slightly lower, while Amsterdam\u2019s AEX index dipped by 0.2%. 2019 was a particularly strong year for US tech companies, although every sector did pretty well. These charts from Bloomberg show how technology outpaced the rest of the market, while energy firms lagged behind. Back in the UK, the Bank of England is facing fresh criticism over its spending habits, after blowing nearly \u00a3100,000 on its summer party. The bill for the annual shindig wen up, despite the Bank promising MP it was keeping expenditure under review. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains: Spending on the Bank of England\u2019s summer party crept closer to \u00a3100,000 this year despite Threadneedle Street promising MPs it would put the expensive event under review. Figures released by the central bank showed that party planners racked up a bill of \u00a396,188 on the event, which hosted nearly 2,500 staff and their families at the Bank\u2019s sports club in Roehampton, south-west London in July. Costs for the annual party \u2013 known as Governors\u2019 Day \u2013 included more than \u00a352,200 on food and soft drinks and nearly \u00a330,000 on family entertainment, which in 2018 involved a treasure hunt, bake-off competition, fun run and bouncy castle. That was on top of nearly \u00a32,000 for equipment and \u00a312,000 for \u201cother\u201d undisclosed expenses. The total is slightly higher than the \u00a395,673 spent on Governors\u2019 Day in 2018, and while the increase is marginal \u2013 about \u00a3515 \u2013 it will raise questions over whether the bank is serious about reviewing its costs... Wall Street is also ending 2019 with a whimper. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 61 points, or 0.2%, in early trading. Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to sign the Phase One trade deal on 15 January hasn\u2019t enthused traders - little wonder, as they\u2019ve been waiting for this to happen for months. This still leaves the Dow up an impressive 22% this year. Newsflash: The preliminary trade deal between America and China will be signed in two week\u2019s time. President Trump has just tweeted the details --claiming that the agreement is \u201cvery large and comprehensive\u201d. This Phase One deal was finally nailed down over two weeks ago. It is thought to include China pledging to buy more US agricultural goods, and also stronger protection for intellectual property right. But many of the thornier issues, such as Beijing\u2019s massive subsidies for its own companies, are not resolved. Donald Trump\u2019s trade advisor, Peter Navarro, has predicted that markets will keep rallying in 2020. Speaking on CNBC, Navarro predicted the Dow would jump to 32,000, from 28,462 last night. That would be a gain of 12%, on top of the 22% gains seen in 2019. Newsflash: Greece\u2019s stock market has ended 2019 up a remarkable 50%. During the eurozone crisis, the idea of Greece\u2019s\u2019 stock exchange outpacing the rest of Europe would have sounded quite bizarre. But as 2019 drew to a close, the Athens bourse was \u2013 by some distance \u2013 the best-performing European exchange. The Athens General Index (ATG) of Greece\u2019s 60 biggest firms has just closed at 916 points, close to last week\u2019s five-year high. It started the year at 613 points. Two factors drove the rally. Greece\u2019s bailout ended in August 2018, after a grim eight-year grind of spending cuts and tax rises that drove the country into a deep recession. Greece has now rolled back the capital controls enforced in 2015 to prevent a run on its banks, but still has to hit challenging budget surplus targets. Second, the left-wing Syriza government of Alexis Tsipras was replaced in July 2019 by a more market-friendly right-wing administration. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis is now cutting taxes, and pledging to abolish regulations and slash red tape. Mr Mitsotakis declared in September. \u201cOne stone at a time, we\u2019re setting the foundations of the country\u2019s regeneration.\u201d Banks had a particularly strong year, with Attica and Piraeus both gaining over 250% in 2019. Utility companies and infrastructure providers also rallied, as Athens looks for more investment from overseas. But long-term investors have still suffered badly. Back in 2007, when the credit crunch struck, the ATG was trading at over 5,200 points. It was still at 2,000 \u2013 more than double today\u2019s levels \u2013 when the first bailout request landed in 2010. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s stock market has just posted its best annual performance in three years, despite stumbling over the line today. The FTSE 100 index of top UK-listed shares has closed at 7,542 points. That\u2019s a 12.1% gain for the year, as it ended 2018 at just 6728. But the rally ended with a whimper. The FTSE 100 ended the last, shortened, trading day down 44 points or 0.6%. That\u2019s its second daily fall in a row, following 11 days of rising prices in the aftermath of Boris Johnson\u2019s election win. Trading was very light today, with many investors already wrapped up for the year. There have also been signs of profit-taking in recent days, after global markets enjoyed their best year in a decade. Athletics fashion chain JD Sports was the top riser in London, gaining 140% in the last 12 months as it continues to defy the high street crisis. Housebuilders also had a good year, with Barratt and Taylor Wimpey both gaining 50%. David Madden of CMC Markets says the construction industry should benefit from the resolution of the Brexit crisis, although there are still uncertainties ahead: The solid win by the Conservative party in the recent general election helped drive up the share price of the house builders, but there has been a new development on the Brexit front. Judging by the plans Prime Minister Johnson has, a no-deal Brexit after the transition period at the end of 2020 might be an option, so uncertainty could continue to hang over the housing industry in 2020. There has been a belief in certain sections of the City that investment has been delayed because of Brexit, so we could see more of that. On the plus slide for the housing market, the Bank of England are unlikely to hike rates until Brexit has been wrapped up. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says markets have flourished in 2019 -- and they could keep shining in 2020. He writes: As the decade comes to an end, it is clear the global stock market rally that began in March 2009 continues to be in place. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P rose 34.8% and 28.5% respectively. This is a contrast to the depressed levels in December 2018 following the end of year decline in 2018. If we compare with September 2018, the S&amp;P 500 is up a more modest but still respectable 9.8%. Markets have also been very calm and stock market volatility as measured by the S&amp;P VIX has been remarkably low for most of 2019. Back in the markets, sterling is enjoying a late rally. The pound has gained three-quarters of a cent to $1.319 against the US dollar, a two-week high. That\u2019s dragging down multinational stocks in London, shaving 42 points off the FTSE 100 today. What a difference a year makes. China\u2019s stock market had a torrid 2018, slumping by 24%, which was the worst performance by a major index. But 2019 has been much brighter. The Shanghai and Shenzen markets have clawed back all those losses, rallying by a third this year. Last year\u2019s plunge forced policymakers to act -- by easing monetary policy and raising government spending. The deepening trade dispute with America also forced policymakers to halt efforts to deleverage the economy, and focus on propping up growth. Zhou Longgang, an analyst with Huachuang Securities, says: \u201cThe sharp correction in 2018 pushed valuations of China stocks to record lows, prompting a recovery in 2019, as Beijing rolled out supportive measures to boost the economy.\u201d You can get up to speed on the Ghosn Getaway with this profile: Plus our latest news story on his escape: The most astonishing business story of the day, and for several months, is Carlos Ghosn\u2019s remarkable escape from Japanese authorities. Last night, the former boss of Renault-Nissan popped up in Beirut - a major surprise, as he was under strict controls in Tokyo facing financial misconduct charges. Ghosn, who has denied defrauding the car giant, says he has \u201cescaped injustice\u201d. In a stern statement, he accusing the Japanese system of assuming guilt and being rigged against him, with a trial expected to start next year. He insists: \u201cI have not fled justice \u2013 I have escaped injustice and political persecution.\u201d But how did Ghosn leave Japan, given he had surrendered all his passports? He was also being tracked by police, having been charged with understating his salary and transferring $5m of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest. One theory, worthy of a Hollywood film, is that he made his getaway in a musical instrument case! The theory is that a group of \u2018musicians\u2019 turned up at the Ghosn residence in Tokyo for a performance, and left with the former auto magnate crammed into one of their boxes..... China\u2019s stock market has closed for 2019, after a very strong year. The CSI 300 index, which contains the biggest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzen markets, has rallied by 36% since January. That\u2019s quite surprising, given the damage caused to China\u2019s economy by the US trade war. But policymakers have responded to slowing growth by pledging new stimulus measures, cutting borrowing costs and trying to boost infrastructure spending. This has lifted markets, meaning China\u2019s shares have grown faster than Wall Street this year (and a lot faster than the UK market). Having enjoyed such a strong year, the markets appear to be taking an end-of-term breather. Last night, the US stock market closed in the red, with the Dow down 182 points or 0.6% at 28,462. European markets have now opened lower, with the FTSE 100 dipping by 0.3% (Germany and Italy are closed). That doesn\u2019t dent this year\u2019s rally, and is probably due to profit-taking. But it also reflects some caution about next year. You might expect some relief that the Phase One trade deal between Washington and Beijing will be signed shortly. But, investors are now wondering when Phase Two will ever be reached, as Stephen Innes of AxiTrader explains: While market volumes are predictably light, investors continue to strike a year-end cautionary tone as December optimism is gradually giving way to 2020\u2019s uncertainty. This despite \u201cTrump\u2019s trade deal in the bag,\u201d according to the President\u2019s hawkish trade adviser Peter Navarro. Sure, the worst-case of a tariff escalation scenario has been seemingly averted. But, once the P1 deal is signed, investors will then press to consider the P2 risks, after all how much more progress can be realistically expected ahead of the US elections next year. Global tech stocks have had a stunning year. Apple, for example, has gained 84%, while Microsoft is up 55%. As these companies have grown steadily bigger, they\u2019ve pushed the wider indices higher too. The rise in world stock prices this year has been quite remarkable, as this chart shows: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s the final trading day of 2019, and what a year it has been! Investors around the world are toasting the best 12 months since the financial crisis, following strong gains in equities around the globe. The MSCI World Index - a broad gauge of stocks in developed markets across the globe - has surged by around 24% in the last 12 months. Starting January at 456 points, it is ending December at 564 points, having hit a record high last week. That beats the 21% gain recorded in 2017, and is the chunkiest move since the recovery from the last financial crisis back in 2009. The rally has been broad-based -- eurozone stocks are up around 20% this year, Japan has gained 18%, while America\u2019s tech-focused Nasdaq is up a sizzling 35% thanks to major players including Apple and Amazon. We\u2019ve seen record highs on Wall Street, while European stocks touched their highest levels since 2015. Shares have been lifted by central bankers, who stepped in (again) with easy money to support the markets. US interest rate cuts, and fresh monetary stimulus in the eurozone, lifted asset prices. Optimism that America\u2019s economy will avoid a recession, and that the US-China trade war will be resolved, also pushed markets higher. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100, though, has lagged slightly behind this year. It has gained around 12%, with political uncertainty and Brexit worries making UK stocks rather unloved. But it has benefitted from a \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019 since this month\u2019s election, which lifted the market for 11 days in a row. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which contains more domestic stocks, had a good year too. It has gained 25% this year, hitting fresh record highs this month. Depending how Brexit plays out, some analysts predict London\u2019s market will rally in 2020. As John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, puts it: The ingredients are there for the FTSE 100 to hit a new high. In comparative terms, UK companies look undervalued and the reasons for not owning UK assets are starting to dissipate. That could precipitate a return to UK equities for investors who previously sold them off. While there has been some volatility and a couple of new index highs, the FTSE 100 is more or less where it was two years ago London trading ends at lunchtime today, so we\u2019ll have a final reckoning of how the year has played out. The agenda 12.30pm GMT: London stock market closes early",

Now, the romance industry\u2019s largest trade group is facing backlash for trying to formally discipline a best-selling author for calling another author\u2019s book a \u201cfucking racist mess\u201d. The controversy started last week, when the Romance Writers of America, a trade association representing nearly 10,000 writers, announced it would discipline author Courtney Milan for publicly criticizing passages in Kathryn Lynn Davis\u2019 Somewhere Lies the Moon for including harmful stereotypes about Chinese women. RWA\u2019s board of directors determined that Milan had \u201cengaged in conduct injurious\u201d to the organization, and that she would be suspended from the group for a year, and barred for life from holding a leadership position.

The S&amp;P 500 index of top US companies has surged by 28% this year, hitting a series of record highs, as Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts, share buybacks and optimism about US growth prospects boosted markets in the world\u2019s largest economy. The tech-dominated Nasdaq index, whose stocks include Netflix, Facebook and Amazon, posted a rise of 35% over the year \u2013 with Apple leading the way by surging 84%. Eurozone stocks also outperformed, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC both up 25%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 18%, helped by the prospect of new stimulus by Shinzo Abe\u2019s government. China\u2019s CSI 300 stock index romped ahead by 36% during 2019, as Beijing cut borrowing costs and hiked spending on construction and infrastructure projects. Stock markets surged despite warnings from the International Monetary Fund in 2019 that the global economy was in its weakest state since the financial crisis a decade ago. The IMF downgraded its forecasts for 2019 and 2020 in October, citing central banks\u2019 limited ammunition to tackle a slowdown and the impact of the US-China trade war. However, Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that a phase one peace deal in the dispute between the word\u2019s two largest economies would be signed this month. During the eurozone crisis, the idea of Greece\u2019s stock exchange outpacing the rest of Europe would have been an outlandish prospect. But as 2019 drew to a close, the Athens bourse was \u2013 by some distance \u2013 the best-performing European exchange. The Athens General Index (ATG) of Greece\u2019s 60 biggest firms gained nearly 50% to 916 points during the last 12 months. Investors returned to Greek stocks after the country\u2019s bailout ended in August 2018, after a grim eight years of deep spending cuts and tax rises. They also welcomed its pro-market rightwing government which took power in July, succeeding the leftwing administration of Syriza and prime minister Alexis Tsipras. But long-term Greek investors have still suffered badly. Back in 2007, when the credit crunch struck, the ATG was trading at over 5,200 points \u2013 more than five times its value today. It was still at 2,000 points when the first bailout request landed in 2010. Global markets have recovered from a late wobble in autumn 2018, when fears of a global downturn hit stocks. Stocks rallied once it became clear that the US central bank was backing away from further interest rate rises. Indeed, the Fed abruptly reversed course with three rate cuts, and also began expanding its balance sheet again. Kyle Rodda, analyst at IG, a City spreadbetting firm, said 2019\u2019s big takeaway for investors around the world was \u201cdon\u2019t fight the Fed\u201d. \u201c2019\u2019s record-setting year for the S&amp;P 500, and even that of Australia\u2019s ASX200, has been underwritten by increasingly accommodative monetary policy from the US Federal Reserve,\u201d Rodda said. Sterling strengthened over the year, although it was a choppy ride. The pound started 2019 at $1.275 against the US dollar, falling below $1.20 by early September as the City feared a disorderly Brexit. It then rallied, spiking at $1.35 after Johnson\u2019s election success, but ends 2019 at $1.31 as investors anticipate tough negotiations with the EU over a free trade deal. The price of gold jumped to $1,525 per ounce, up nearly a fifth during the year. That\u2019s its biggest annual rise in nearly a decade, as some nervous investors looked for a safe haven for their capital. Palladium hit a series of record highs, as demand for the precious metal in automobile exhaust systems exceeded supply.",

The 75-year-old oil painting was reportedly ripped on Saturday while the London gallery was open to the public. Shakeel Ryan Massey, 20, from north-west London, appeared at Camberwell Green magistrates court on Monday charged with criminal damage. He indicated he would deny the charge. The painting, Bust of a Woman, has been removed from display and is being assessed by conservation experts. Tate Modern declined to comment on the condition of the painting. A spokesperson for the gallery said a member of the public had attempted to damage a painting, and a suspect had been \u201cswiftly apprehended\u201d. The Metropolitan police said in a statement: \u201cDetectives investigating an incident of criminal damage at the Tate Modern, Bankside, on Saturday 28 December have charged a man.\u201d Massey was denied bail and has been remanded in custody until a pre-trial hearing at Inner London crown court on 30 January. Bust of a Woman was created in Paris in 1944 during the Nazi occupation. The semi-abstract work portrays the photographer Dora Maar, reportedly Picasso\u2019s lover, sitting on a metal chair wearing a hat and green clothing. Tate Modern is the most popular visitor attraction in the UK, welcoming almost 5.9 million people in 2018. It offers a number of free exhibitions and has an extensive collection of international artworks. In 2012, a prized Mark Rothko painting was vandalised at the gallery, for which a man was sentenced to two years in prison. Vladimir Umanets wrote his name and a statement about the visual movement Yellowism on the painting, claiming it was an artistic act. At London\u2019s National Gallery in 1914, Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Rokeby Venus was slashed by a suffragette, Mary Richardson, who was protesting against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst. The piece was restored and remains on display.",

That this is the most expensive position to reinforce, and Norwich insist they cannot spend \u00a310m on a player, means even links to young talents such as Willem II\u2019s Mike Tr\u00e9sor Ndayishimiye will likely come to nothing. The upside is that there is no pressure to sell either, despite interest in Max Aarons and Ben Godfrey. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <h2>Sheffield United</h2> <p>Chris Wilder is well stocked for forwards but has tended to rely on the same players every week in other positions. He would welcome more strength in depth, especially in midfield and defence. He has a longstanding interest in the Blackburn Rovers centre-back Darragh Lenihan, while Nottingham Forest\u2019s Joe Worrall is also on the radar. Sheffield United\u2019s abundance of forwards, meanwhile, has restricted the playing time of Billy Sharp, in whom clubs including Celtic have expressed an interest. <strong>PD</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19772aa385e5e8ccfb75e420fef3d29494a0ec2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19772aa385e5e8ccfb75e420fef3d29494a0ec2d/192_139_2629_1578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Darragh Lenihan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Blackburn Rovers centre-back Darragh Lenihan has attracted the attention of Chris Wilder at Sheffield United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Barnes/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Southampton</h2> <p>Still financially hamstrung from previous windows, Southampton are unlikely to spend big but Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is keen to strengthen at full-back to ease the workload on C\u00e9dric Soares and Ryan Bertrand.

Does anybody truly believe His Humbleness? In an ideal world, Mourinho would like new full-backs, maybe a centre-back and a back-up striker. Whether the club can sell Christian Eriksen will hold the key to the budget. Mourinho\u2019s first window with Daniel Levy will be an experience. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> <h2>Watford</h2> <p>Recent results and performances have reinforced the belief that Watford already have the players they need to get out of their current predicament, though the defence, weakened by injuries, could be reinforced. Jo\u00e3o Pedro, whose transfer was agreed last year, has arrived from Fluminense but at 18 cannot be expected to have an instant impact. Major outgoings are unlikely though some seldom-used squad members, particularly goalkeepers and midfielders, will leave on loan. <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d6028673c348dd182ff8de5f33e82d8ad4b86ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d6028673c348dd182ff8de5f33e82d8ad4b86ad/0_54_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jo\u00e3o Pedro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jo\u00e3o Pedro has arrived at Watford but at only 18 it could be asking a lot for him to turn their season around.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>West Ham</h2> <p>David Moyes wants to spend after being tasked with saving West Ham from relegation again. A central midfielder has to be a priority and Moyes likes Stoke\u2019s Joe Allen. But there are other holes to fill. West Ham are trying to sign the Middlesbrough goalkeeper Darren Randolph and want more cover up front. <strong>JS</strong></p> <h2>Wolves</h2> <p>Rising interest in Adama Traor\u00e9 is likely to be rebuffed. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo hopes to make a couple of additions to a squad that has coped admirably with its huge workload so far. The injury to Willy Boly means a new centre-back is high on the wish list, and Nuno would also like more options in midfield. A couple of Lille players have been eyed up \u2013 defender Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and midfielder Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 - while Milan\u2019s Franck Kessi\u00e9 and QPR\u2019s versatile Ryan Manning have also attracted interest. <strong>PD</strong></p>",

David Hytner Watford Recent results and performances have reinforced the belief that Watford already have the players they need to get out of their current predicament, though the defence, weakened by injuries, could be reinforced. Jo\u00e3o Pedro, whose transfer was agreed last year, has arrived from Fluminense but at 18 cannot be expected to have an instant impact. Major outgoings are unlikely though some seldom-used squad members, particularly goalkeepers and midfielders, will leave on loan. Simon Burnton West Ham David Moyes wants to spend after being tasked with saving West Ham from relegation again. A central midfielder has to be a priority and Moyes likes Stoke\u2019s Joe Allen. But there are other holes to fill. West Ham are trying to sign the Middlesbrough goalkeeper Darren Randolph and want more cover up front. JS Wolves Rising interest in Adama Traor\u00e9 is likely to be rebuffed. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo hopes to make a couple of additions to a squad that has coped admirably with its huge workload so far. The injury to Willy Boly means a new centre-back is high on the wish list, and Nuno would also like more options in midfield. A couple of Lille players have been eyed up \u2013 defender Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and midfielder Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 - while Milan\u2019s Franck Kessi\u00e9 and QPR\u2019s versatile Ryan Manning have also attracted interest.

      "bodyText": "One of France\u2019s leading chefs has lost his court case against the Michelin Guide after it downgraded his restaurant from three to two stars. In a case that became known as Cheddargate, Marc Veyrat sued the respected guide claiming it had made a \u201cprofoundly offensive\u201d suggestion that he had used the English cheese in one of his signature souffl\u00e9 dishes. He said it was a matter of honour and demanded evidence that the \u201cincompetent\u201d Michelin inspector had even dined at his restaurant, and that they hand over their notes. Michelin accused Veyrat of behaving like a \u201cnarcissistic diva\u201d suffering from \u201cpathological egotism\u201d. Veyrat\u2019s restaurant La Maison des Bois, at Manigod, 1,800m up in the Alps in Haute-Savoie, was downgraded in January 2019, a year after Michelin had awarded it the highest ranking of three stars. Veyrat, 69, said he learned of the downgrade only when he read the guide and it left his kitchen staff in tears and threw him into a profound depression lasting several months. He told France 2 television it was the most terrible thing to have happened to him. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than the loss of my parents, worse than anything,\u201d he said. He claimed the anonymous inspector mistakenly thought he had used English cheddar instead of French reblochon, beaufort and tomme cheese in a souffl\u00e9, when in fact the yellow colour was from saffron. At a hearing in November, he asked the court to order Michelin to hand over inspectors\u2019 bills and judging notes to discover when they had eaten in the restaurant and how they had come to their decisions \u2013 one of the biggest trade secrets in the restaurant business. The chef argued he had the right to know in detail the judging criteria used to evaluate restaurants and how Michelin inspectors were trained. He demanded a symbolic \u20ac1 in damages. His lawyer, Emmanuel Ravanas, said the chef was not seeking to ban criticism. \u201cWe just want to verify the criteria that exist and how they are applied,\u201d he told the court hearing. On the other side, the Michelin guide sought \u20ac30,000 in costs and compensation. \u201cThe court is not there to protect men\u2019s vanity,\u201d the guide\u2019s barrister, Richard Malka, said at the opening of the legal case. Malka said Veyrat\u2019s lawsuit flew in the face of reason and basic constitutional rights of freedom of expression. \u201cMr Veyrat wants France to abandon the principle that restaurant critics should have the freedom to have an opinion because his restaurant has two stars rather than three; because La Maison des Bois is judged to be just excellent rather than brilliant,\u201d Malka told AFP. Veyrat, recognised in France for his trademark wide-brimmed black savoyard hat and smokey glasses, considered that gaining his third Michelin star in 2018 marked his comeback after he was forced to give up cooking for several years following a skiing accident and a 2015 fire at La Maison des Bois. The chef has made his name specialising in traditional dishes using wild herbs collected from around his restaurants and \u201cmolecular gastronomy\u201d, chemistry-inspired recipes. Veyrat said he had been \u201cdishonoured\u201d by the guide. \u201cThe fact they took my virtual scallops to be real scallops when they were made from a base of burbot livers from Lake Geneva shows a lack of competence,\u201d he said. In its ruling, the court at Nanterre, outside Paris, said the chef had produced not \u201ca single piece of evidence\u201d to show any real harm or damage caused to the restaurant. Veyrat admitted business at La Maison des Bois \u2013 where the d\u00e9gustation menus cost \u20ac295 or \u20ac395 \u2013 was booming. \u201cI don\u2019t really need them,\u201d he said of the guide, adding: \u201cAt this rate I wish they\u2019d take away all my stars.\u201d Days before the hearing, the rival Gault &amp; Millau guide named Veyrat one of the 10 \u201cimmortals\u201d of haute cuisine alongside the likes of Alain Ducasse and Guy Savoy.",

Dorothy Thompson, a Court director and former Drax chief executive, defended the party but said the Bank was looking to rein in spending. \u201cThis is an annual event. The cost is \u00a340 per head. There is no alcohol funded. And it is the one large offsite for the institution. But it must be said, as we are stressing, more and more, cost competitiveness and cost control, it is one of the things that is under review,\u201d she said. The Bank has already planned to shut its 32-acre sports ground to staff and lease it to a commercial operator in a bid to cut costs. It means the 2019 Governors\u2019 Day was likely the last to be held at the plush sports centre. The Bank\u2019s incoming governor, Andrew Bailey, who takes the reins from Mark Carney in March, will have to secure a new venue assuming the event continues into 2020. The Bank also cut meal and hotel allowances for staff last year after coming under fire for a \u00a3390,000 travel bill racked up by two of its economics advisers over two-and-a-half years. Anil Kashyap, who serves as an external member of the Bank\u2019s financial policy committee, spent \u00a311,000 on a flight from Chicago to London. His colleague Donald Kohn was found to have separately submitted expenses for an \u00a38,000 flight from Washington to London and \u00a3469 on taxis for one meeting. A statement released by the Bank alongside the 2019 Governors\u2019 Day figures said: \u201cGovernors\u2019 Day is a long-held tradition that is open to all employees including their families, with the aim of recognising their hard work and dedication.\u201d The Bank of England was contacted for further comment.",

And by ending the unrivalled position of marriage we have helped to create the space for deeper discussions about giving legal recognition to other types of personal and caring relationships, such as those between friends, siblings and co-parents.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ef76adfd-3e6a-4062-af84-c50692f86f25\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Civil partnerships were created in 2004 as a means of allowing same-sex couples to enter into a union that guarantees them similar legal rights to those who are married.</p>\n    <p>They were limited to same-sex couples but in October 2018, following a supreme court ruling declaring the existing position discriminatory, the government announced that heterosexual couples would also be entitled to enter the arrangement.</p>\n    <p>There are differences between the two forms of union, partially symbolic and partially matters of substance. For a marriage, the ceremony is solemnised by the couple saying a prescribed form of words; in a civil partnership, the couple can simply sign a document.</p>\n    <p>Marriages can be conducted through either a civil or religious ceremony, at a registry office, church or wherever a venue is licensed. Civil partnerships are secular events, although partners can choose to hold a religious ceremony on the day.</p>\n    <p>Civil partners cannot declare, for legal purposes, that they are married. Civil partnership certificates include the names of both parents of the parties whereas marriage certificates in England and Wales include only the names of a couple's fathers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/26/proposed-law-add-mothers-names-to-marriage-certificates\">for the time being</a>.</p>\n    <p>In terms of annulment the rules are virtually identical, although the clause that permits a marriage to be dissolved if one partner is 'suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form' does not apply to civil partnerships.</p>\n    <p>Likewise, adultery can be grounds for a married couple to divorce though it cannot be relied upon to end a civil partnership.<br></p>\n    <p>Those in civil partnerships and those who are married enjoy the same tax breaks and benefits \u2013 such as the marriage allowance and bereavement payments. Surviving civil partners are treated the same as widows or widowers in terms of rights to state pension.&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>While those who are married and in civil partnerships enjoy extensive legal rights, those who are merely cohabiting \u2013 3.3 million couples at the last estimate \u2013 have no legal protections or property rights if one of them dies.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The couple were joined for the registration by their two children, Eden, four, and Ariel, two, and their parents and friends who acted as witnesses.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, they described what had happened inside the register officer as a \u201cvery stripped back,\u201d simple process, for which they had paid the statutory minimum fee of \u00a346.</p> \n<p>There was no ceremony as such, they added, but they had taken the opportunity to say a few words to each other in front of their children that had been \u201cskipped out on\u201d in the course of five years of campaigning.</p> \n<p>Later, they adjourned for a simple family lunch at a nearby pub, before planning to host a New Year\u2019s Eve party at which friends were invited \u201cto bring the food that they love to cook or makes them feel loved up.\u201d</p> \n<p>The journey had not come without a significant personal cost, as Keiden spoke candidly about the toll on his mental health.</p> \n<p>\u201cAgainst all odds, we succeeded in a legal battle against the government and then, they did what we asked for all along. Not many people can say that.\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we both know with everything gained, some things risk being lost, or at least unspoken.

      "bodyText": "More than five years have passed since Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan tried to form a civil partnership at their local register office, only to be told they could not because they were not of the same sex. On Tuesday after spearheading a long campaign to change the law, they returned to Chelsea Town Hall and walked out as civil partners, joining thousands of others who made history by formally entering into the newly recognised unions on the eve of a new decade. Flanked by friends and family and joined by their two young daughters, the couple said their wish to form a civil partnership had been \u201crooted in our desire to formalise our relationship in a more modern way, focused on equality and mutual respect.\u201d Following Steinfeld and Keidan\u2019s victory at the supreme court in 2018, it is expected that as many as 84,000 ceremonies will be conducted in 2020 as couples take advantage of a right originally legislated for LGBTQI couples. The first is believed to have taken place in Carmarthenshire, where a register office opened at two minutes past midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve for Jake Rayson and Emma Wilson. In London, Steinfeld heralded the new dawn by telling the assembled media and wellwishers: \u201cThere is now a space for new, more modern possibilities for people to express their love and commitment to one another. \u201cThe urgent need to reform cohabitation law so that social policy keeps up with the reality of family life in modern Britain has been brought into greater focus. And by ending the unrivalled position of marriage we have helped to create the space for deeper discussions about giving legal recognition to other types of personal and caring relationships, such as those between friends, siblings and co-parents.\u201d The couple were joined for the registration by their two children, Eden, four, and Ariel, two, and their parents and friends who acted as witnesses. Afterwards, they described what had happened inside the register officer as a \u201cvery stripped back,\u201d simple process, for which they had paid the statutory minimum fee of \u00a346. There was no ceremony as such, they added, but they had taken the opportunity to say a few words to each other in front of their children that had been \u201cskipped out on\u201d in the course of five years of campaigning. Later, they adjourned for a simple family lunch at a nearby pub, before planning to host a New Year\u2019s Eve party at which friends were invited \u201cto bring the food that they love to cook or makes them feel loved up.\u201d The journey had not come without a significant personal cost, as Keiden spoke candidly about the toll on his mental health. \u201cAgainst all odds, we succeeded in a legal battle against the government and then, they did what we asked for all along. Not many people can say that.\u201d he said. \u201cBut we both know with everything gained, some things risk being lost, or at least unspoken. Through this long journey and hard-fought battle, our mental health has suffered, our ability to be civil to each other has been tested, and, crucially, we missed out on that important moment to state clearly what we mean to each other \u2013 not just what we\u2019ve become in the eyes of others,\u201d he said. Elaborating on that later in an interview, he told of how he had started to feel very tired earlier this year \u201cin ways I couldn\u2019t explain\u201d after their historic court win. \u201cI think that I just burn out both physically and mentally. I spoke to the doctor and employers and took five weeks off work to really just take time to recover from the thing we have been through. I am glad I was able to do it and I think the conversation about mental health has changed in society in the last few years and have allowed me to accept that we are not as formidable as we think.\u201d Those involved in the couple\u2019s campaign said they were aware of as many as 80 other civil partnership ceremonies happening around the country on Tuesday, and there were believed to be many more. The academics, who live in Hammersmith, west London, suffered defeat at the court of appeal but were given the go-ahead for a supreme court hearing in August 2017. The panel of supreme court justices, including the court\u2019s president, Lady Hale, heard the couple\u2019s case in May 2018, and the judges later held that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was incompatible with human rights laws on discrimination and family life. The minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, said: \u201cCongratulations to all the couples who are having their civil partnerships today. I am proud that we have helped give thousands across the country the option to have a civil partnership and celebrate their union in a way that works for them.\u201d",

Today\u2019s over-65s are healthier and more active than previous generations and many who are fit and able to work tell us that they have no intention of fully retiring any time soon,\u201d said Stuart Lewis, the founder of <a href=\"https://restless.co.uk/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=GS%20-%20Brand%20-%20GK%20-%20EXA&amp;utm_term=Restless&amp;creative=327835435621&amp;device=c&amp;matchtype=e&amp;adpos=1t1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6I3f_rW_5gIVBrDtCh2_GgeGEAAYASAAEgJZ3_D_BwE#s=1\">Rest Less</a>, a jobs, volunteering and advice site for the over-50s.</p> <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s reasons for continuing to work post state pension age vary wildly. From those who are choosing to top up their pension pots while they still can, to those who want to keep working for the love of the job or for the health and wellbeing benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Sue Cutler, 73, from Hollesley, Suffolk, has worked for an animal medicine trade association since 2001. She now works flexibly for them: she is contracted to do 144 days a year but often works extra days, covering for holidays and other staff absence.</p> <p>\u201cI work for financial reasons and want to continue to work while I\u2019m physically able to, in order to top up my retirement savings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an hour\u2019s commute each way to work but I definitely have no plans to give up work any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>The number of over-65s who are employed has increased by 188% in the last 20 years, from 455,000 to 1.31 million, and the proportion has grown from just over 5% to just under 11%. In the past 10 years the number has increased from 763,000 to 1.3 million \u2013 a 71% increase.</p> <p>Population projections for the UK point to large increases in the number of over-65s in the decades to come, and Lewis said this longevity dividend had the potential to be one of the biggest societal opportunities in modern times.</p> <p>But with around one in four people aged between 50 and the state pension age currently out of work, and older workers who fall out of work remaining out of work for longer than people of other ages, employers need to address their prejudices around older workers, Lewis said.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasing numbers of over-65s in the workplace unlocks enormous potential for employers to embrace a talented, flexible and highly skilled workforce \u2013 but it also requires many employers to change their outdated stereotypes of age in the workplace and reconsider how they engage with and attract talented older employees,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAge is the final frontier in the battle for a diverse, inclusive working environment and we have been encouraged by the growing number of pioneering companies coming forward to embrace the opportunity this presents. For employers who value real diversity of thought, the benefits of having 25-year-olds working in multigenerational teams alongside 65-year-olds can be hugely powerful.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick Thomson, a senior programme manager at the <a href=\"https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/\">Centre for Ageing Better</a>, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the older workforce is the workforce of the future. Employers urgently need to tackle ageism within their organisations if they and their workers are to make the most of these longer working lives.</p> <p>\u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s crucial that people aren\u2019t forced to work in their late 60s and 70s because of financial insecurity, and that the kinds of work people are doing later in life is fulfilling and suitable. Few of us can expect to reach 65 without a disability or health condition, so employers must do more to support health in the workplace.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/milestonesjourneyingthroughadulthood/2019-12-17#care\">recent figures</a> showed, by the age of 56 more than one in five of us can expect to be caring for a loved one. So better rights are needed for carers at work, including measures such as flexible working and paid carers\u2019 leave.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Workers aged 65 and older will be responsible for more than half of all UK employment growth over the next 10 years and almost two-thirds of employment growth by 2060, according to new figures. Analysis of findings from the 2019 seasonally adjusted labour force survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests that by 2030 people aged 65 and over will account for 282,000 new UK employees out of a total 546,000. By 2060 there will be around 746,000 new employees aged 65 and over out of a total employment growth of 1,193,000 \u2013 due in part to baby boomers entering this age group and a greater number of women in work. \u201cOur population is growing and people are living longer, healthier lives. Today\u2019s over-65s are healthier and more active than previous generations and many who are fit and able to work tell us that they have no intention of fully retiring any time soon,\u201d said Stuart Lewis, the founder of Rest Less, a jobs, volunteering and advice site for the over-50s. \u201cPeople\u2019s reasons for continuing to work post state pension age vary wildly. From those who are choosing to top up their pension pots while they still can, to those who want to keep working for the love of the job or for the health and wellbeing benefits.\u201d Sue Cutler, 73, from Hollesley, Suffolk, has worked for an animal medicine trade association since 2001. She now works flexibly for them: she is contracted to do 144 days a year but often works extra days, covering for holidays and other staff absence. \u201cI work for financial reasons and want to continue to work while I\u2019m physically able to, in order to top up my retirement savings,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an hour\u2019s commute each way to work but I definitely have no plans to give up work any time soon.\u201d The number of over-65s who are employed has increased by 188% in the last 20 years, from 455,000 to 1.31 million, and the proportion has grown from just over 5% to just under 11%. In the past 10 years the number has increased from 763,000 to 1.3 million \u2013 a 71% increase. Population projections for the UK point to large increases in the number of over-65s in the decades to come, and Lewis said this longevity dividend had the potential to be one of the biggest societal opportunities in modern times. But with around one in four people aged between 50 and the state pension age currently out of work, and older workers who fall out of work remaining out of work for longer than people of other ages, employers need to address their prejudices around older workers, Lewis said. \u201cIncreasing numbers of over-65s in the workplace unlocks enormous potential for employers to embrace a talented, flexible and highly skilled workforce \u2013 but it also requires many employers to change their outdated stereotypes of age in the workplace and reconsider how they engage with and attract talented older employees,\u201d he said. \u201cAge is the final frontier in the battle for a diverse, inclusive working environment and we have been encouraged by the growing number of pioneering companies coming forward to embrace the opportunity this presents. For employers who value real diversity of thought, the benefits of having 25-year-olds working in multigenerational teams alongside 65-year-olds can be hugely powerful.\u201d Patrick Thomson, a senior programme manager at the Centre for Ageing Better, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the older workforce is the workforce of the future. Employers urgently need to tackle ageism within their organisations if they and their workers are to make the most of these longer working lives. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s crucial that people aren\u2019t forced to work in their late 60s and 70s because of financial insecurity, and that the kinds of work people are doing later in life is fulfilling and suitable. Few of us can expect to reach 65 without a disability or health condition, so employers must do more to support health in the workplace. \u201cAnd as recent figures showed, by the age of 56 more than one in five of us can expect to be caring for a loved one. So better rights are needed for carers at work, including measures such as flexible working and paid carers\u2019 leave.\u201d",

Last Friday, investigators found 50-year-old Tony Williams shot dead on the porch of a vacant home about two blocks away from where two other homeless people, Christina Fowler, 53, and Gregory Corcoran, 40, had been found dead two weeks earlier. Police officials are now investigating whether the three deaths are linked. The deaths in Louisiana\u2019s capital come as homeless advocates worry about an increase in violence against homeless people, and after Donald Trump used the homeless crisis in California as a political stick to try and attack top Democrats such as House speaker Nancy Pelosi and California governor Gavin Newsom. Last week Trump attacked Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who has led the effort to impeach him, and told her to \u201cclean up her filthy dirty district &amp; help the homeless there\u201d.

Trump\u2019s repeated tweets about homelessness have been labeled \u201cvile and reprehensible\u201d by activists. The killings in Baton Rouge are likely to heighten the sense that homeless people are becoming more vulnerable. Amanda Owens says she is part of Baton Rouge\u2019s homeless population and she told the Advocate newspaper the recent crimes have put the community on edge. \u201cDo I have a target on my back or what?\u201d she said. Baton Rouge police are investigating links between the crimes, although it is not yet certain whether homeless people are being targeted, Chief Murphy Paul said Friday. He added that steps are being taken to protect the community, and local shelters are expanding services in the wake of the violence, the Advocate reported Monday. One such shelter, St Vincent de Paul, has increased its capacity, executive director Michael Acaldo said.

      "bodyText": "Grimsby Town have appointed Ian Holloway as manager as they look to stave off the threat of relegation from League Two. The 56-year-old former Bristol Rovers, QPR, Plymouth, Leicester, Blackpool, Crystal Palace and Millwall boss, replaces Michael Jolley, who parted company with the Mariners in November following an expletive-laden rant aimed at local journalists. A statement on the club\u2019s official website read: \u201cGrimsby Town Football Club are delighted to announce the appointment of Ian Holloway as first team manager. With over 600 appearances as a player and taking charge of over 950 games over a 20-plus-year managerial career, Ian will bring invaluable experience to the table for the Mariners.\u201d Speaking to Grimsby\u2019s in-house TV station, Holloway said: \u201cThere\u2019ll be enough time to do gran and grampy duty as well as take on a challenge and get hold of a wonderful old football club like this and try and move it forward. I\u2019m really, really excited about it \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you how excited I am.

There are many elite players that I didn\u2019t include here because to do so would have been duplication. In some cases, I factored in the number and severity of injuries. In the end, I looked or compatible skills and demonstrated teamwork.</p> <p>I\u2019ve put together 11 players because you need a deep bench if you\u2019re going to overcome inevitable injuries and road fatigue to win a championship. At UCLA, Coach Wooden drilled into us that the fittest team is generally also the winningest team because they\u2019re still sprinting down the court on fast breaks when the other team is jogging with their mouths open. Following are my picks for the championship team because they are the fittest, most skilled players of the past 10 years. In alphabetical order:</p> <p><strong>Giannis Antetokounmpo </strong>(Milwaukee Bucks). He can do anything and everything. He could play center if needed as well as excel as forward. I also like his backstory: born in Athens to Nigerian parents, his sheer will power and dedication has made him one of the best players in the NBA. He\u2019s the kind of enthusiastic player who can energize and excite his team.</p> <p><strong>Steph Curry </strong>(Golden State Warriors). His phenomenal long-range shooting makes it impossible to double-team. He\u2019s forced teams to rethink the entire concept of defense. His general calm demeanor seems to spread to the other players, making them more focused and therefore more effective as a team.</p> <p><strong>Anthony Davis </strong>(Los Angeles Lakers). As my center, he\u2019s the consummate Big Man. He can play offense with his back to the basket or facing it. He can shoot the three-pointer or attack the basket. I especially enjoy watching him block so many shots.</p> <p><strong>Joel Embiid </strong>(Philadelphia 76ers). He has the same skill set as Anthony Davis, a master inside the key as well as outside. He\u2019s also a defensive powerhouse.</p> <p><strong>James Harden </strong>(Houston Rockets).<strong> </strong>James surgical shooting skills dominates the game offensively. His step-back jumper is extremely difficult to guard. He\u2019s also great at drawing fouls which puts the opposing team\u2019s starting guard on the bench in foul trouble.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c192e4c1182deb4d1d918e63b23e645613e94a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c192e4c1182deb4d1d918e63b23e645613e94a1/0_0_2594_1730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Davis and LeBron James\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis (3) and LeBron James (23) both made the cut.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Mackson/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Kyrie Irving </strong>(Brooklyn Nets). Every team needs a Larry \u2018Mr. Clutch\u2019 Bird-type shooter who can deliver in those high-pressure moments. Kyrie is that steel-nerves shooter. Fortunately, he\u2019s just as effective defensively as he is offensively. Plus, every team needs someone who can play baritone sax.</p> <p><strong>LeBron James </strong>(Los Angeles Lakers). For me, LeBron represents the ideal player, both on and off the court. He\u2019s too short to play the classic center position, but he can play four other positions with equal skill. Add to that his steady and inspiring leadership that unites a team in purpose. I also admire his commitment to community off the court, not just speaking out for social justice but building a school to promote education. He\u2019s a role model as player and as community member.</p> <p><strong>Ben Simmons </strong>(Philadelphia 76ers)<strong>.</strong> Ben represents the edgy new big player who can do everything the smaller player can. As a point forward, he can\u2019t be guarded. As a teenager, he chose to play basketball over his other favorite sport, Australian rules football. But he brings some the intensity of that physical sport to his basketball game.</p> <p><strong>Klay Thompson </strong>(Golden State Warriors). Clay\u2019s versatility makes him invaluable to my team. He\u2019s a threat at both ends of the court because he\u2019s not only a formidable defender but because he\u2019s a great three-point shooter.</p> <p><strong>Jayson Tatum </strong>(Boston Celtics). Jayson was so impressive in last year\u2019s All-Star Game. He has an incredible range as a shooter, but he\u2019s also a terrific overall player.</p> <p><strong>Trae Young </strong>(Atlanta Hawks). Like LeBron, Trae is an exceptional team leader who does everything possible to set up his teammates for success. Plus, he\u2019s an amazing shooter.</p> <p>The best part of playing this What If game is that I can\u2019t lose. Sure, over the comfort of domestic beer and salty bar nuts with an oldies station piping Bob Seger\u2019s Night Moves on the sound system there might be some heated disagreements about my choices. My name might be taken in vain. More than once. But I\u2019m confident that this team would be an unstoppable juggernaut that would easily be the NBA champions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Carlos Ghosn reportedly fled his Japanese home in a musical instrument case, in an audacious Hollywood movie-style escape masterminded by his wife with the assistance of a Gregorian music band and a team of ex-special forces officers. The escape began when the musicians arrived at Ghosn\u2019s Tokyo residence where he had been living under strict bail conditions that included 24-hour camera surveillance, according to the Lebanese TV news channel MTV. At the end of the performance, as the musicians packed up their instruments, Ghosn \u2013 whose height is stated at 1.7m, or about 5ft 7in, in his Wikipedia entry \u2013 apparently slipped into one of the larger cases and was taken to a small local airport. A private plane was waiting to whisk the former corporate titan to Istanbul, Turkey. From there he appears to have boarded a Bombardier Challenger private jet for a flight to Lebanon, where he arrived before dawn on Monday. The flight path recorded by plane tracking site FlightRadar shows the jet disappear at 4.16am, just as it approached Beirut-Rafic Hariri international airport. Ricardo Karam, a Lebanese television host and friend of Ghosn who has interviewed him several times, confirmed Ghosn arrived in Lebanon on Monday morning. \u201cHe is home,\u201d Karam said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big adventure.\u201d News of the escape came as surprise to the Japanese authorities \u2013 who have charged Ghosn with falsifying records about his personal pay in order to enrich himself \u2013 and Ghosn\u2019s own legal team. Both were shocked that the former Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi boss had managed to flee Japan, despite being subject to round-the-clock surveillance and having surrendered all three of his passports. He is a citizen of Brazil, France and Lebanon. The Japanese ambassador to Lebanon, Matahiro Yamaguchi, was at a party in Beirut when news of Ghosn\u2019s successful escape started leaking out at about 6pm local time on Monday. Approached by MTV at the party, Yamaguchi said the Japanese government had no information. Yamaguchi was then seen texting furiously before leaving the party abruptly without saying goodbye to his hosts. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Ghosn\u2019s lawyer Junichiro Hironaka said he was \u201csurprised and baffled\u201d to learn of the escape from a TV news bulletin. Hironaka told reporters he still had all three of his client\u2019s passports in his possession, and there was immediate speculation that Ghosn travelled on a fresh French or Lebanese passport. \u201cIt would have been difficult for him to do this without the assistance of some large organisation,\u201d Hironaka said at a hastily organised press conference. \u201cI want to ask him, \u2018How could he do this to us?\u2019 \u201cI wanted to prove he was innocent,\u201d said Hironaka, who last saw Ghosn on Christmas Day. \u201cBut when I saw his statement in the press, I thought he doesn\u2019t trust Japan\u2019s courts.\u201d Japanese immigration officials have no record of Ghosn having left the country, the country\u2019s state broadcaster, NHK, said on Tuesday. The news channel said a person resembling Ghosn was recorded by Lebanese officials as entering the country at Beirut airport under a different name. A Lebanese foreign ministry official told Reuters that Ghosn entered the country legally on a French passport and using his Lebanese ID with normal security procedures. The French foreign ministry press office said it had no immediate comment. Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan, meaning it is very unlikely Ghosn will be forced to return. Ghosn, who was born in Brazil to Lebanese parents, moved to Lebanon when he was six and lived in the country before moving to Paris for university. The Lebanese government has been very supportive of Ghosn since his arrest in November 2018 and said he represented \u201cone of Lebanon\u2019s success stories abroad\u201d. After his arrest billboards in Beirut were plastered with the slogan \u201cWe are all Carlos Ghosn\u201d. The escape plan was, according to MTV, organised by Ghosn\u2019s Lebanese wife, Carole, even though he has been prevented from seeing her without express permission from the court as a condition of his \u00a51.5bn (\u00a310.5m) bail. For seven months, the couple were unable to speak to each other at all. \u201cIf this is true, we have to assume that this is a breach of bail conditions,\u201d Hironaka said. \u201cHis act is unforgivable and a betrayal of Japan\u2019s justice system.\u201d Ghosn confirmed through a PR agency in New York late on Monday that he was in Beirut. He was staying at a family home with Carole in Beirut\u2019s upmarket Achrafieh neighbourhood, where private security guards and local police officers are standing guard. A man who described himself as an English neighbour approached the gates on Tuesday morning to leave Ghosn a card reading: \u201cCarlos, welcome home!\u201d The man told Reuters: \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that at last he\u2019s out of being locked up for something which he may or may not \u2013 probably not \u2013 have done.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 January 2020 to correct an error in converting Carlos Ghosn\u2019s height to feet.",

This means the less you damage the bulb, the less sulphur is released, which is why sliced or chopped garlic is nowhere near as potent, or indeed pungent, as crushed, and why whole bulbs stay so gloriously sweet after roasting.</p> <p>But does it really matter, and should we care? <a href=\"https://app.1000cookbooks.com/people/alastair-little\" title=\"\">Alastair Little</a>, who, with the likes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowley_Leigh\" title=\"\">Rowley Leigh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simon-hopkinson\" title=\"\">Simon Hopkinson</a> helped reinvent modern British cooking in the 1980s, isn\u2019t so sure: \u201cI\u2019ve always chopped, pounded, minced, crushed and pressed garlic with no particular logic,\u201d he admits cheerfully, \u201cand to be honest, I\u2019ve never differentiated between them, except when I want to avoid small chunks in a dish.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, Little has become even more laid-back: \u201cMy current favourite method is just to grate the cloves, unpeeled, through a Microplane. You end up with finely minced garlic on one side, and the skin in your hand on the other.\u201d</p> <p>Oddly, the new generation of chefs seem far less gung-ho. \u201cIt all depends on what you want from the garlic,\u201d insists Alex Jackson, chef/co-owner of <a href=\"https://sardine.london/\" title=\"\">Sardine in London</a>, which majors in the food of southern France. \u201cIn Italian and French cuisine, it\u2019s often included only as a background flavour, so my default is to slice it thinly lengthways.\u201d This, he says, is what you\u2019d use in Mediterranean soups, tomato sauces, soffrittos, etc: \u201cIt colours to an even golden brown when you fry it, then breaks down slowly, releasing a subtle taste that won\u2019t overwhelm.\u201d</p> <p>For dishes that require more of a punch, Jackson chops his garlic finely \u2013 very<em> </em>finely if he\u2019s using it raw: \u201cThat\u2019s what you want for persillade or salsa verde, say.\u201d For other \u201craw\u201d sauces and dressings, however, he crushes it to a paste in a mortar (the flat of a large knife on a board with a pinch of sea salt will also do the trick): \u201cYou get a very fine, smooth, pale puree without any lumps.\u201d But bear in mind this is pretty heavy-duty stuff, so use sparingly, \u201cunless it\u2019s for something that\u2019s deliberately very garlicky, like a\u00efoli\u201d.</p> <p>As for the central shoot, don\u2019t worry about that <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/can-you-use-sprouted-garlic-onions-259227\" title=\"\">unless</a> it\u2019s turned green, tough or is peeking out of the end of the clove, says Little, who earlier this year launched <a href=\"https://byalastairlittle.co.uk/\" title=\"\">By Alastair Little</a>, a homemade food delivery service in London. \u201cIf your garlic displays any of those signs, cut it out, because it will be bitter; otherwise, don\u2019t bother\u201d \u2013 a sentiment Jackson does agree with. Life\u2019s too short as it is, anyway.</p> <p>Far more important, Little says, is where your garlic comes from: \u201cAvoid the <a href=\"https://www.ecoandbeyond.co/inspiration/british-swaps/uk-garlic-for-international-garlic/\" title=\"\">Chinese</a> stuff, which seems to have flooded the market in recent years \u2013 the cloves are way too small, and are over-strong.

Alastair Little, who, with the likes of Rowley Leigh and Simon Hopkinson helped reinvent modern British cooking in the 1980s, isn\u2019t so sure: \u201cI\u2019ve always chopped, pounded, minced, crushed and pressed garlic with no particular logic,\u201d he admits cheerfully, \u201cand to be honest, I\u2019ve never differentiated between them, except when I want to avoid small chunks in a dish.\u201d More recently, Little has become even more laid-back: \u201cMy current favourite method is just to grate the cloves, unpeeled, through a Microplane. You end up with finely minced garlic on one side, and the skin in your hand on the other.\u201d Oddly, the new generation of chefs seem far less gung-ho. \u201cIt all depends on what you want from the garlic,\u201d insists Alex Jackson, chef/co-owner of Sardine in London, which majors in the food of southern France. \u201cIn Italian and French cuisine, it\u2019s often included only as a background flavour, so my default is to slice it thinly lengthways.\u201d This, he says, is what you\u2019d use in Mediterranean soups, tomato sauces, soffrittos, etc: \u201cIt colours to an even golden brown when you fry it, then breaks down slowly, releasing a subtle taste that won\u2019t overwhelm.\u201d For dishes that require more of a punch, Jackson chops his garlic finely \u2013 very finely if he\u2019s using it raw: \u201cThat\u2019s what you want for persillade or salsa verde, say.\u201d For other \u201craw\u201d sauces and dressings, however, he crushes it to a paste in a mortar (the flat of a large knife on a board with a pinch of sea salt will also do the trick): \u201cYou get a very fine, smooth, pale puree without any lumps.\u201d But bear in mind this is pretty heavy-duty stuff, so use sparingly, \u201cunless it\u2019s for something that\u2019s deliberately very garlicky, like a\u00efoli\u201d. As for the central shoot, don\u2019t worry about that unless it\u2019s turned green, tough or is peeking out of the end of the clove, says Little, who earlier this year launched By Alastair Little, a homemade food delivery service in London. \u201cIf your garlic displays any of those signs, cut it out, because it will be bitter; otherwise, don\u2019t bother\u201d \u2013 a sentiment Jackson does agree with. Life\u2019s too short as it is, anyway. Far more important, Little says, is where your garlic comes from: \u201cAvoid the Chinese stuff, which seems to have flooded the market in recent years \u2013 the cloves are way too small, and are over-strong. Look for European and homegrown crops instead: the Isle of Wight\u2019s a big producer, and very good it is, too.\u201d \u2022 Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theguardian.com",

Annual changes in the legal wage floor are typically announced alongside the autumn budget. The Conservatives faced criticism earlier this month after including a caveat in the Queen\u2019s speech that the election promise to raise the national living wage to \u00a310.50 by 2024 would only happen \u201cprovided economic conditions allow\u201d. Javid had said at the Tory party conference in September that his party would set a five-year target to raise the low-pay floor from 60% of median earnings in Britain to two-thirds. He also said he would lower the age threshold for the national living wage from 25 to 21. Labour had promised to introduce a real living wage of at least \u00a310 an hour for all workers aged 16 and over immediately, in a policy designed to show it would move faster to support households than the Tories. Average pay packets across Britain remain lower than before the financial crisis, once inflation is taken into account, after one of the worst decades for pay growth since the end of the Napoleonic wars 200 years ago. Annual pay growth has accelerated this year, repairing some of the damage by rising at the fastest rate in 11 years. Unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since the mid 1970s and inflation has remained relatively stable in the past year, hovering below the Bank of England\u2019s target rate of 2%, helping hard-pressed families to repair their finances. Pay growth has started to fall again in recent months, however, against a backdrop of heightened uncertainty over Brexit and a slowdown in the world economy. Campaigners say work no longer guarantees a way out of poverty, with figures suggesting that about 14.3 million people are struggling to make ends meet, including about 9 million people who live in families where at least one adult is working. The latest government announcement does not meet the level outlined by the Living Wage Foundation charity, which sets a voluntary pay floor used by about 6,000 companies calculated to reflect what people need to live on. The Living Wage Foundation sets its \u201creal living wage\u201d at \u00a39.30 an hour and \u00a310.75 an hour in London. Firms including the insurer Aviva, the Nationwide building society and football clubs such as Crystal Palace are among employers committed to paying the real living wage to more than 210,000 workers. The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said the government would set out a future policy framework in the spring for raising the legal minimum pay level over the next five years. Business leaders, however, said the government risked damaging companies at a time of heightened economic uncertainty. Hannah Essex, co-executive director of the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents 75,000 businesses, said the move to raise the wage floor by more than double the rate of inflation in 2020 would \u201cpile further pressure on cash flow and eat into training and investment budgets\u201d at companies across the country. \u201cFor this policy to be sustainable, government must offset these costs by reducing others and impose a moratorium on any further upfront costs for business,\u201d she said, adding that many firms were struggling with rising costs.",

I think we\u2019re on the right track as a club. We\u2019re in a transition period but we\u2019ve seen other clubs do it and come out strong after a couple of years.

Players may well come and go during the January transfer window and Paul Pogba is never likely to be far away from the headlines in that regard. But with the Norwegian promising he will not simply bring players in for the sake of it and risk upsetting his team\u2019s harmony, it is clear Solskj\u00e6r is focusing on what he has at his disposal already.</p> <p>\u201cLast week against Newcastle the average age of the starting outfield players was 23,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Burnley but it was still a young side. We\u2019ll have ups and downs, but hopefully there will be less of the downs.

He\u2019s chipped in with goals. So I\u2019m not worried about goals from our centre-forwards. Mason\u2019s on eight, Marcus I don\u2019t know \u2026 14 or 15? Anthony has quite a few too. Romelu is a good striker and will always score goals but it was time for him to move on. We didn\u2019t find the right one outside our club but we knew we had Mason.\u201d The first month of the new decade will be crucial in Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s long-term vision for United. Players may well come and go during the January transfer window and Paul Pogba is never likely to be far away from the headlines in that regard. But with the Norwegian promising he will not simply bring players in for the sake of it and risk upsetting his team\u2019s harmony, it is clear Solskj\u00e6r is focusing on what he has at his disposal already. \u201cLast week against Newcastle the average age of the starting outfield players was 23,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know about Burnley but it was still a young side. We\u2019ll have ups and downs, but hopefully there will be less of the downs. Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were replaced by two fantastic performances from Ashley Young and Brandon Williams, so that gives me more options moving forward.\u201d One noticeable difference in Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s United as the decade drew to a close was the way they were able to break down Newcastle and Burnley. \u201cWe\u2019re not a Manchester City; we can\u2019t out-play teams like they do yet but hopefully in a few years we can,\u201d he says. There is, by the manager\u2019s own admission, a way to go yet before they can even begin to think about returning to where they were at the start of the 2010s, but if nothing else, there is cautious optimism about what lies ahead at Old Trafford as the new decade begins.",

      "body": "<p>A much celebrated movie poster shows Sue Lyon peering over a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses while sucking a red lollipop under the legend \u201cHow did they ever make a movie of Lolita?\u201d The answer lay in the casting of 14-year-old Lyon in the title role of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/mar/08/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Stanley Kubrick</a>\u2019s film adaptation of the controversial Vladimir Nabokov novel, in which Lolita is 12 years old.</p> <p>Although Kubrick later complained about having to stick to the Hollywood Production Code, he said of Lyon, who has died aged 73, \u201cshe\u2019s a one-in-a-million find\u201d, and Nabokov thought her \u201cthe perfect nymphet\u201d, a noun he coined in his 1955 novel. Her performance in Lolita (1962), her first feature, won the Golden Globe for most promising newcomer. Few film actors can claim such a prestigious start to their careers.</p> <p>Her first three pictures were directed by three cinema greats: Kubrick, John Huston (The Night of the Iguana, 1964) and John Ford (Seven Women, 1966).

      "bodyText": "A much celebrated movie poster shows Sue Lyon peering over a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses while sucking a red lollipop under the legend \u201cHow did they ever make a movie of Lolita?\u201d The answer lay in the casting of 14-year-old Lyon in the title role of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s film adaptation of the controversial Vladimir Nabokov novel, in which Lolita is 12 years old. Although Kubrick later complained about having to stick to the Hollywood Production Code, he said of Lyon, who has died aged 73, \u201cshe\u2019s a one-in-a-million find\u201d, and Nabokov thought her \u201cthe perfect nymphet\u201d, a noun he coined in his 1955 novel. Her performance in Lolita (1962), her first feature, won the Golden Globe for most promising newcomer. Few film actors can claim such a prestigious start to their careers. Her first three pictures were directed by three cinema greats: Kubrick, John Huston (The Night of the Iguana, 1964) and John Ford (Seven Women, 1966). Unfortunately, from such heights there was nowhere else to go but down, and whatever she did, whether professional or personal, Lolita would be evoked without fail. She was born Suellyn Lyon in Davenport, Iowa, the last of five children of Sue Karr Lyon, who worked as a hospital house mother. She was 10 months old when her father died. At 11, to help pay the bills, she got jobs as a model with the JC Penney agency, while still going to school in Los Angeles.

It was after seeing her in the latter that Kubrick suggested that she audition for the part of Lolita, beating, as rumour has it, 800 other young women. \u201cEven in the way she walked in for her interview, casually sat down, walked out, she was cool and non-giggly,\u201d Kubrick recalled. \u201cShe was enigmatic... She could get people guessing about how much Lolita knew about life.\u201d It was just this quality that Lyon brought to her role \u2013 teasing Humbert Humbert (James Mason), the middle-aged British professor, sexually infatuated by her. Lyon retained some of Lolita in The Night of the Iguana, among a group of Baptist teachers in Mexico. As the 16-year-old niece of the leader of the school, she seduces the tour guide, a defrocked priest (Richard Burton), or vice versa. \u201cYou\u2019re as dangerous as you are young and lovely,\u201d he tells her. In contrast, in Ford\u2019s final film, the underestimated Seven Women, Lyon brought an air of naivety to the role of the youngest in a group of Christian missionaries in rural China in 1935. There is a subtle implication that the head of the mission (Margaret Leighton) has more than a maternal interest in the young woman and is jealous of the fascination she holds for an atheist doctor from New York (Anne Bancroft). It was a performance that should have brought Lyon more laurels than it did. Her first grown-up role came as the romantic interest in The Flim-Flam Man (1966), directed by Irvin Kershner. A less good performance might have slowed up the lively comedy in which she played an affluent woman, a potential victim of George C Scott and Michael Sarrazin as a couple of con men. Lyon played Diana Pines in Tony Rome (1967), a typically brash 1960 neo-noir starring Frank Sinatra as the titular private eye, and was the long-suffering wife of the famous stunt man in Evel Knievel (1971), a biopic starring George Hamilton. After making a few low-budget international thrillers and guest appearances in Police Story and Fantasy Island (both 1978), she retired from show business in 1980. Lyon was married and divorced five times. Her husbands were the film-maker Hampton Fancher, Roland Harrison, a photographer and football coach, Gary Adamson, whom she married while he was in prison, Edward Weathers and, in 1985, Richard Rudman, a radio engineer; they divorced in 2002.

      "body": "<p>On 1 July Australia\u2019s goods and services tax will have been in place for 20 years. It is uncontroversial in concept, with no major party advocating its abolition. Every so often there are calls for it to be increased from 10% <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-23/nsw-treasurer-frustrated-by-federal-leaders-killing-tax-reform/11630242\">or expanded</a> \u2013 calls that are usually rebuffed.</p> <p>But just how fraught the GST was to introduce is one of the key insights from the release of cabinet papers by the National Archives of Australia, covering the years 1998 and 1999. There were other concerns: East Timor\u2019s independence, the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the failed republican referendum, and familiar resistance to doing anything but the minimum on climate change.</p> <p>But it was the GST package that dominated debate, inside and outside cabinet.</p> <p>The pledge of a goods and services tax, and its accompanying package of income tax cuts and the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, was the centrepiece of the October 1998 election, which the Coalition won narrowly despite losing the two-party-preferred vote to Kim Beazley\u2019s Labor. As a result it claimed a mandate to implement the GST.</p> <p>Peter Costello, treasurer from 1996 until the defeat of John Howard\u2019s government in 2007, said the cabinet papers failed to capture the drama of the moment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/01/coalition-was-hesitant-to-take-action-on-climate-change-20-years-ago-too-cabinet-papers-show\">Coalition was hesitant to take action on climate change 20 years ago too, cabinet papers show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe introduction of the GST was mammoth,\u201d he said at the embargoed release of the records. \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing like it before and there will be nothing like it again.\u201d</p> <p>One minute simply noted that the treasurer had presented a proposal for tax reform, which was adopted. \u201cThat meeting went for seven hours,\u201d Costello said.</p> <p>There were nine cabinet meetings in four weeks in the middle of 1998, at which Costello was the first to present with the whiz-bang technology of the time \u2013 PowerPoint.</p> <p>There was nervousness about introducing a broad-based 10% tax on sales of goods and services (with specific exemptions).</p> <p>The threshold problem was that in 1995, months out from the 1996 election, Howard had said the GST would \u201cnever ever\u201d be a Liberal policy. That followed the disastrous defeat for the Liberals in 1993 under John Hewson, who had proposed a 15% GST, with only education and health exempted.</p> <p>But Howard had believed in a GST since he was treasurer in Malcolm Fraser\u2019s government in the early 1980s. The tax system was complicated, and services \u2013 an increasingly important part of the economy \u2013 were not taxed. The view was that too much revenue was coming from corporate and personal income tax.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"19db1cc4aa6bb0f7b31cddff6a2313437d4acfca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19db1cc4aa6bb0f7b31cddff6a2313437d4acfca/0_142_2266_1360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Costello and John Howard in cabinet in October 1998\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Costello and John Howard in cabinet in October 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fairfax Media via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201c[Howard] and I had come to an agreement of saying whatever the wisdom of saying \u2018never, ever\u2019 in the first place, we would never, ever say \u2018never ever\u2019, again,\u201d Costello joked.</p> <h2>Overcompensating everyone</h2> <p>What forced the government\u2019s hand was a high court decision in 1997 that declared state sales taxes on goods were unconstitutional. As a stopgap, the commonwealth imposed its own taxes on commodities including tobacco, alcohol and petrol, and returned the revenue to the states. It was unsustainable, and it was the impetus to review and reform the system. </p> <p>After more than a year of work, the government launched its package on 13 August 1998. The cabinet knew it had to be sold to a wary public and allocated $10m for a \u201ccomprehensive campaign explaining proposals for reform of the taxation system\u201d. </p> <p>When Costello presented his draft, the cabinet made a flurry of last-minute changes and suggestions. On 28 July it wanted revisions to \u201chighlight the positive impact the reforms would have on employment and wealth creation, efficiency, and business costs\u201d, to set out more \u201cdramatically\u201d its key measures.</p> <p>The idea was to overcompensate everyone for the introduction of the tax. Treasury analysis must show that \u201cno household type or income ranges loses as a result of the package\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/24/cabinet-papers-show-y2k-fears-spooked-coalition-and-sparked-12bn-in-contingency-plans\">Cabinet papers show Y2K fears spooked Coalition and sparked $12bn in contingency plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The cabinet knew the trigger points, demanding in the final package \u201can explanation of why food should be included in the GST base\u201d, an issue that would later prove crucial. It agreed that the cost of the package would not exceed $4.5bn in 2000-01, and that the revised consumer price index increase would be 2.5% in the first year. But then there was a one-off 4% increase in pensions and benefits from 1 July 2000, at a cost of $220m, again to \u201covercompensate\u201d the recipients.</p> <p>Costello recalled: \u201cI\u2019d walk out of cabinet meetings with lists of suggestions, one goes on for several pages, instructing the treasurer to do better in explaining the role of the tax on this sector, do better on explaining the exemption for diesel fuel, it went on and on.\u201d</p> <p>Barely a fortnight after the <a href=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/tax-reform-not-a-new-tax-a-new-tax-system/overview\">launch of the package</a>, Howard called an early election for 3 October.</p> <p>Beazley attacked the GST as a tax on \u201ceverything from baby food and clothes to schoolbooks, a 10% GST on jobs, on holidays, retirement units, funeral services. A tax from cradle to grave.\u201d</p> <p>But Howard survived, characterising the Coalition\u2019s narrow victory as a \u201cnear-death experience\u201d. </p> <h2>Fresh food exempted</h2> <p>The government still needed one extra vote to get the package through the Senate, and believed it would come from the unpredictable independent Tasmanian senator Brian Harradine.</p> <p>Costello said he had given everything Harradine asked for \u2013 the cancellation of a sex education course, more money for large families \u2013 but in the end the senator told parliament he could not impose such a tax on his children and his grandchildren.</p> <p>Instead it was the Democrats\u2019 leader, Meg Lees, who agreed to pass the bills but insisted on removing GST on fresh food. That decision split the Democrats and was ultimately central to the party\u2019s demise.</p> <p>Costello was opposed to fresh food being excluded because it increased the GST\u2019s complexity. He remembered Hewson\u2019s fatal interview in which he stumbled over whether GST would apply to a birthday cake. \u201cOnce food was exempted from the GST, you had to decide what was the difference between fresh food and restaurant or cooked food, giving rise to ridiculous discussions about the temperature of a chicken,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The GST debate was an ideological one, with the progressive side of politics opposing it as a regressive tax, applicable at the same rate whether someone was rich or poor. But Costello said the real opposition did not come from political parties or earnest economic arguments.</p> <p>\u201cThe most damaging thing was the populist press,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t resist themselves. They would try and find examples of little old ladies whose food bills would go up and they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay their electricity, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay their gas, and they\u2019d have to sit with dressing gowns in their flats because GST would make their lives so miserable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/01/peter-costello-says-australia-feared-indonesian-economy-would-collapse-and-cause-boat-exodus\">Peter Costello says Australia feared Indonesian economy would collapse and cause boat exodus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the introduction got closer, there were more nerves. At one cabinet meeting, Peter Bartels from Coles Myer and Roger Corbett from Woolworths were invited in. One of them said to Costello: \u201cYou are telling us to change 1 billion prices on 30 June. One price at a minute to midnight, another on the stroke of midnight. How we do that?\u201d</p> <p>Costello said: \u201cI had never thought of it in those terms. I began to wonder whether it was a good idea.\u201d</p> <p>Labor had fought the GST at the 1998 election and promised a \u201crollback\u201d at the 2001 poll. It has no plans to do so now, although unease remains. Anthony Albanese has said he is \u201cnot a supporter of expanding regressive taxes\u201d. </p> <h2>Welfare overhaul</h2> <p>The cabinet historian for the National Archives, Assoc Prof Paul Strangio, said after the tumultuous first years of the Howard government, 1998 and 1998 were a period of cabinet \u201cdiscipline and order\u201d, a government \u201cgrown confident and comfortable in its own skin\u201d.</p> <p>There were ideological threads running throughout, some significant, some quirky. Howard was obsessed with removing compulsory student union fees and the cabinet duly agreed, though it would take until 2005 before the government could get that through parliament.</p> <p>In December 1998 the cabinet also approved a move to the socioeconomic status model for public funding of private schools. The education minister, David Kemp, submitted that the new model would allow for \u201cmore equitable and transparent mechanisms for assessment of need, to enable parents to exercise choice and to remove disincentives to private investment\u201d. That model proved controversial, with critics arguing it entrenched high payments to wealthy private schools.</p> <p>The Howard government also overhauled welfare policy, stressing the need for \u201cmutual obligation\u201d. On 17 November 1998 the cabinet agreed that \u201coptical surveillance services\u201d managed by Centrelink be introduced to help investigate serious social security fraud. It was based on a pilot program which had found that in about 40% of cases, \u201cno incorrect payment could be identified\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe department considers that this result, together with the use of private investigators, could attract public criticism.\u201d</p> <p>The cabinet also found time on 16 March 1999 to fret about the film Lolita, an adaptation starring Jeremy Irons that the classification board had given an R rating. The cabinet discussed whether offended MPs would be considered \u201caggrieved persons\u201d under the legislation and therefore able to seek a new classification. It agreed that, if not, the attorney general would seek a review of such a decision. (The movie was controversial as some claimed it promoted paedophilia but it was not banned as some MPs urged.)</p> <p>Beazley said at the time that Howard harrumphing about the film was really about the government trying to woo Harradine, a morals-crusading Christian, to pass the GST legislation.</p> <h2>\u2018Remarkably stable\u2019</h2> <p>Costello said the lessons of the GST for governments contemplating reform were plain: have a clear policy, have a coherent political plan to get it done, have a timetable, neutralise political opponents and develop a mandate.</p> <p>\u201cWe knew who would come out against the GST because we\u2019d been through it all in 1993. We knew that charities were a problem, we knew that churches were a problem, that\u2019s why they all got such good taxation treatment. We knew that states were a problem, that\u2019s why they got the guaranteed revenue.\u201d</p> <p>It was the so-called \u201clock mechanism\u201d \u2013 that not only would all revenue go to the states, but any change to the GST had to be approved by all the states \u2013 that ensured its success, he said. It countered the argument that the GST would inevitably rise or be broadened.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d have said to me in July 2000, do you think there\u2019s any possibility we\u2019ll be sitting here in 20 years\u2019 time without any material changes to the GST, I\u2019d have said none whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have been better if we got our policy in full, but we didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it be worth going back and trying to get [fresh food included]? I don\u2019t think so, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get it. You\u2019d probably be forced into even worse compromises if you tried.\u201d</p> <p>The GST has worked, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s just remarkably stable\u201d.</p>",

There were other concerns: East Timor\u2019s independence, the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the failed republican referendum, and familiar resistance to doing anything but the minimum on climate change. But it was the GST package that dominated debate, inside and outside cabinet. The pledge of a goods and services tax, and its accompanying package of income tax cuts and the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, was the centrepiece of the October 1998 election, which the Coalition won narrowly despite losing the two-party-preferred vote to Kim Beazley\u2019s Labor. As a result it claimed a mandate to implement the GST. Peter Costello, treasurer from 1996 until the defeat of John Howard\u2019s government in 2007, said the cabinet papers failed to capture the drama of the moment. \u201cThe introduction of the GST was mammoth,\u201d he said at the embargoed release of the records. \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing like it before and there will be nothing like it again.\u201d One minute simply noted that the treasurer had presented a proposal for tax reform, which was adopted. \u201cThat meeting went for seven hours,\u201d Costello said. There were nine cabinet meetings in four weeks in the middle of 1998, at which Costello was the first to present with the whiz-bang technology of the time \u2013 PowerPoint. There was nervousness about introducing a broad-based 10% tax on sales of goods and services (with specific exemptions). The threshold problem was that in 1995, months out from the 1996 election, Howard had said the GST would \u201cnever ever\u201d be a Liberal policy. That followed the disastrous defeat for the Liberals in 1993 under John Hewson, who had proposed a 15% GST, with only education and health exempted. But Howard had believed in a GST since he was treasurer in Malcolm Fraser\u2019s government in the early 1980s. The tax system was complicated, and services \u2013 an increasingly important part of the economy \u2013 were not taxed. The view was that too much revenue was coming from corporate and personal income tax. \u201c[Howard] and I had come to an agreement of saying whatever the wisdom of saying \u2018never, ever\u2019 in the first place, we would never, ever say \u2018never ever\u2019, again,\u201d Costello joked. Overcompensating everyone What forced the government\u2019s hand was a high court decision in 1997 that declared state sales taxes on goods were unconstitutional. As a stopgap, the commonwealth imposed its own taxes on commodities including tobacco, alcohol and petrol, and returned the revenue to the states. It was unsustainable, and it was the impetus to review and reform the system. After more than a year of work, the government launched its package on 13 August 1998. The cabinet knew it had to be sold to a wary public and allocated $10m for a \u201ccomprehensive campaign explaining proposals for reform of the taxation system\u201d. When Costello presented his draft, the cabinet made a flurry of last-minute changes and suggestions. On 28 July it wanted revisions to \u201chighlight the positive impact the reforms would have on employment and wealth creation, efficiency, and business costs\u201d, to set out more \u201cdramatically\u201d its key measures. The idea was to overcompensate everyone for the introduction of the tax. Treasury analysis must show that \u201cno household type or income ranges loses as a result of the package\u201d. The cabinet knew the trigger points, demanding in the final package \u201can explanation of why food should be included in the GST base\u201d, an issue that would later prove crucial. It agreed that the cost of the package would not exceed $4.5bn in 2000-01, and that the revised consumer price index increase would be 2.5% in the first year. But then there was a one-off 4% increase in pensions and benefits from 1 July 2000, at a cost of $220m, again to \u201covercompensate\u201d the recipients. Costello recalled: \u201cI\u2019d walk out of cabinet meetings with lists of suggestions, one goes on for several pages, instructing the treasurer to do better in explaining the role of the tax on this sector, do better on explaining the exemption for diesel fuel, it went on and on.\u201d Barely a fortnight after the launch of the package, Howard called an early election for 3 October. Beazley attacked the GST as a tax on \u201ceverything from baby food and clothes to schoolbooks, a 10% GST on jobs, on holidays, retirement units, funeral services. A tax from cradle to grave.\u201d But Howard survived, characterising the Coalition\u2019s narrow victory as a \u201cnear-death experience\u201d. Fresh food exempted The government still needed one extra vote to get the package through the Senate, and believed it would come from the unpredictable independent Tasmanian senator Brian Harradine. Costello said he had given everything Harradine asked for \u2013 the cancellation of a sex education course, more money for large families \u2013 but in the end the senator told parliament he could not impose such a tax on his children and his grandchildren. Instead it was the Democrats\u2019 leader, Meg Lees, who agreed to pass the bills but insisted on removing GST on fresh food. That decision split the Democrats and was ultimately central to the party\u2019s demise. Costello was opposed to fresh food being excluded because it increased the GST\u2019s complexity. He remembered Hewson\u2019s fatal interview in which he stumbled over whether GST would apply to a birthday cake. \u201cOnce food was exempted from the GST, you had to decide what was the difference between fresh food and restaurant or cooked food, giving rise to ridiculous discussions about the temperature of a chicken,\u201d he said. The GST debate was an ideological one, with the progressive side of politics opposing it as a regressive tax, applicable at the same rate whether someone was rich or poor. But Costello said the real opposition did not come from political parties or earnest economic arguments. \u201cThe most damaging thing was the populist press,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t resist themselves. They would try and find examples of little old ladies whose food bills would go up and they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay their electricity, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to pay their gas, and they\u2019d have to sit with dressing gowns in their flats because GST would make their lives so miserable.\u201d As the introduction got closer, there were more nerves. At one cabinet meeting, Peter Bartels from Coles Myer and Roger Corbett from Woolworths were invited in. One of them said to Costello: \u201cYou are telling us to change 1 billion prices on 30 June. One price at a minute to midnight, another on the stroke of midnight. How we do that?\u201d Costello said: \u201cI had never thought of it in those terms. I began to wonder whether it was a good idea.\u201d Labor had fought the GST at the 1998 election and promised a \u201crollback\u201d at the 2001 poll. It has no plans to do so now, although unease remains. Anthony Albanese has said he is \u201cnot a supporter of expanding regressive taxes\u201d. Welfare overhaul The cabinet historian for the National Archives, Assoc Prof Paul Strangio, said after the tumultuous first years of the Howard government, 1998 and 1998 were a period of cabinet \u201cdiscipline and order\u201d, a government \u201cgrown confident and comfortable in its own skin\u201d. There were ideological threads running throughout, some significant, some quirky. Howard was obsessed with removing compulsory student union fees and the cabinet duly agreed, though it would take until 2005 before the government could get that through parliament. In December 1998 the cabinet also approved a move to the socioeconomic status model for public funding of private schools. The education minister, David Kemp, submitted that the new model would allow for \u201cmore equitable and transparent mechanisms for assessment of need, to enable parents to exercise choice and to remove disincentives to private investment\u201d. That model proved controversial, with critics arguing it entrenched high payments to wealthy private schools. The Howard government also overhauled welfare policy, stressing the need for \u201cmutual obligation\u201d. On 17 November 1998 the cabinet agreed that \u201coptical surveillance services\u201d managed by Centrelink be introduced to help investigate serious social security fraud. It was based on a pilot program which had found that in about 40% of cases, \u201cno incorrect payment could be identified\u201d. \u201cThe department considers that this result, together with the use of private investigators, could attract public criticism.\u201d The cabinet also found time on 16 March 1999 to fret about the film Lolita, an adaptation starring Jeremy Irons that the classification board had given an R rating. The cabinet discussed whether offended MPs would be considered \u201caggrieved persons\u201d under the legislation and therefore able to seek a new classification. It agreed that, if not, the attorney general would seek a review of such a decision. (The movie was controversial as some claimed it promoted paedophilia but it was not banned as some MPs urged.) Beazley said at the time that Howard harrumphing about the film was really about the government trying to woo Harradine, a morals-crusading Christian, to pass the GST legislation. \u2018Remarkably stable\u2019 Costello said the lessons of the GST for governments contemplating reform were plain: have a clear policy, have a coherent political plan to get it done, have a timetable, neutralise political opponents and develop a mandate. \u201cWe knew who would come out against the GST because we\u2019d been through it all in 1993. We knew that charities were a problem, we knew that churches were a problem, that\u2019s why they all got such good taxation treatment. We knew that states were a problem, that\u2019s why they got the guaranteed revenue.\u201d It was the so-called \u201clock mechanism\u201d \u2013 that not only would all revenue go to the states, but any change to the GST had to be approved by all the states \u2013 that ensured its success, he said. It countered the argument that the GST would inevitably rise or be broadened. \u201cIf you\u2019d have said to me in July 2000, do you think there\u2019s any possibility we\u2019ll be sitting here in 20 years\u2019 time without any material changes to the GST, I\u2019d have said none whatsoever. \u201cIt would have been better if we got our policy in full, but we didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it be worth going back and trying to get [fresh food included]? I don\u2019t think so, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get it. You\u2019d probably be forced into even worse compromises if you tried.\u201d The GST has worked, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s just remarkably stable\u201d.",

The prime minister began 2020 with a message acknowledging a \u201ctough past 12 months\u201d with the terrible bushfires that have claimed the lives of so many Australians\u201d, before moving into the reasons he believed the nation could remain optimistic. \u201cThere\u2019s also been the drought that continues and of course, the floods earlier last year,\u201d he said, in a video message also featuring Jenny Morrison. \u201cBut one thing we can always celebrate in Australia is that we live in the most amazing country on earth and the wonderful Aussie spirit that means that we will always overcome whatever challenges we face. That we will always look optimistically into our future. \u201cThere\u2019s no better place to raise kids anywhere on the planet, and we\u2019re all so grateful that we can live in this amazing country, and that\u2019s something we can always give thanks for as we enter into their new year.\u201d Fires stretched from Gippsland in Victoria to Nowra, south of Sydney, on New Year\u2019s Eve, with emergency plans including heading into the ocean in some coastal towns. Southerly winds were predicted to continue whipping up the east coast, with no relief in sight for exhausted fire crews. At least nine people have been confirmed dead since the start of the NSW bushfires, which have blazed for more than a month, with the entire south coast impacted. On Tuesday afternoon, the NSW fire commissioner reported two people had died in Cobargo and one was missing, feared dead, in Belowra. Cobargo\u2019s historic main street went up in flames earlier on Tuesday. It had been evacuated earlier in the day. In Victoria, fires scorched through more than 200,000 hectares in east Gippsland, with more than 4,000 people evacuated to the beach in the town of Mallacoota. Four people were missing in Victoria late on Tuesday afternoon, and at least seven emergency warnings remained in place for the region. Earlier on New Year\u2019s Eve Morrison fronted the camera, through social media, to pay tribute to 28-year-old Samuel McPaul, the young soon-to-be father, who died on Monday when his truck flipped in the Green Valley fire in Jingellic, near the NSW-Victoria border. \u201cIt is an unimaginable loss and one felt by the entire country,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI have seen the impact and devastation of these fires first hand, but I have also seen communities pulling together, and caring for each other with a remarkable spirit,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis is the Australian way. We have stood up to these terrible disasters before and we have come through the other side. We will rebuild and we will stay strong.\u201d Labor leader Anthony Albanese said new year was \u201cusually a time of joy\u201d but the recent months had made it \u201cchallenging\u201d for many Australians in his own message, which he shot with his dog Toto. \u201cI hope that the new year brings relief to everyone dealing with the harsh reality of the bushfire crisis,\u201d he said in a social media message. \u201cI hope it gets easier for our brave firefighters who have been putting themselves in harm\u2019s way for so many months now. \u201cWe think of those who have lost their lives and their loved ones at this extremely difficult time of grief.

A submission by the foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, the minister for the environment, Robert Hill, and the minister for resources and energy, Warwick Parer, reported the Kyoto agreement was \u201cfair and realistic\u201d and met \u201call of Australia\u2019s primary objectives\u201d. Key to those was Australia\u2019s insistence on differentiated emissions reduction targets for developed countries, \u201creflecting individual circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Another \u201cimportant achievement\u201d, the submission said, was \u201csecuring agreement to emissions from the land use change and forestry sector being treated in essentially the same way as those from other anthropogenic sources\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/23/australia-has-changed-its-historic-data-on-carbon-emissions-what-happened\">This controversial deal still allows Australia to claim it is meeting its international obligations, even while its emissions are going up, or flatlining at best</a><strong>.</strong></p> <p>Australia negotiated an increase in emissions <strong> </strong>limited to 8% above 1990s levels for the period from 2008 to 2012 at Kyoto \u2013 one of only three countries not required to make cuts. That would still be a \u201cconsiderable challenge\u201d, the cabinet heard, although other wealthy countries had pledged more significant cuts. Europe promised to reduce emissions by 8% and Japan and Canada by 6%.<br><br>The submission argued Australia\u2019s commitment represented \u201ca cut in our projected business-as-usual growth of 30%\u201d, comparable to the average for industrialised countries.

      "bodyText": "The Coalition\u2019s history of reluctance to take action on climate change was alive and well in 1998 and 1999, with cabinet records giving a familiar insight into debates still raging 20 years on. As last year\u2019s cabinet papers release illustrated, the government was nervous in the lead-up to the international climate summit in Kyoto at the end of 1997, not wanting to commit to anything it perceived could harm Australia\u2019s interests. By March 1998, the cabinet was acknowledging the good deal Australia believed it had negotiated. A submission by the foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, the minister for the environment, Robert Hill, and the minister for resources and energy, Warwick Parer, reported the Kyoto agreement was \u201cfair and realistic\u201d and met \u201call of Australia\u2019s primary objectives\u201d. Key to those was Australia\u2019s insistence on differentiated emissions reduction targets for developed countries, \u201creflecting individual circumstances\u201d. Another \u201cimportant achievement\u201d, the submission said, was \u201csecuring agreement to emissions from the land use change and forestry sector being treated in essentially the same way as those from other anthropogenic sources\u201d. This controversial deal still allows Australia to claim it is meeting its international obligations, even while its emissions are going up, or flatlining at best. Australia negotiated an increase in emissions limited to 8% above 1990s levels for the period from 2008 to 2012 at Kyoto \u2013 one of only three countries not required to make cuts. That would still be a \u201cconsiderable challenge\u201d, the cabinet heard, although other wealthy countries had pledged more significant cuts. Europe promised to reduce emissions by 8% and Japan and Canada by 6%. The submission argued Australia\u2019s commitment represented \u201ca cut in our projected business-as-usual growth of 30%\u201d, comparable to the average for industrialised countries. It also noted its disappointment there had been no progress on commitments to cut emissions from developing nations. Australia\u2019s role in Kyoto was controversial, with Hill aggressively pursuing a special deal for Australia at a meeting determined to reach consensus. The land-clearing clause meant that because clearing had declined between 1990 and 1997, emissions from burning fossil fuels could rise substantially while overall emissions could be kept to an 8% rise. The cabinet knew its Kyoto deal was internationally resented. Relations with the EU and Pacific nations were strained, the method for calculating emissions from land clearing had yet to be finalised, and \u201cthose who consider that Australia secured too good a deal at Kyoto may use this to try to increase our emission reduction task\u201d. The submission notes that in the lead-up to further climate meetings later that year, \u201csome EU member states have a vested interest in maintaining the EU\u2019s hardline green position because it makes good domestic politics\u201d. That strain continues, as do the repercussions of Australia\u2019s deal under the Kyoto protocol. At December\u2019s Madrid climate change conference, Australia was accused of \u201ccheating\u201d and was named by other countries and observers as one of a few nations that had thwarted the aims of the meeting. Australia planned to use carryover credits, an accounting measure linked to the Kyoto protocol, to meet targets it set at the Paris summit four years ago. Australia signed the Kyoto protocol in April 1998, and the cabinet discussed whether to ratify it, which would have made commitments binding. In the end, it deferred any decision, as ratification was \u201ca completely separate and longer-term question ... important issues remain unresolved\u201d. The Howard government never ratified the protocol, arguing it was not in Australia\u2019s interests. Kevin Rudd\u2019s Labor government, elected in 2007, made ratifying Kyoto one of its first priorities.",

      "body": "<p>With so many hairpin turns over the last 10 years, it makes sense that the greatest and most inventive works in comics would come from unexpected, contradictory corners: young adult and horror. As the YA comics market boomed, it attracted more and more brilliant cartoonists, with superstars such as <a href=\"https://goraina.com/\">Raina Telgemeier</a> finding a huge readership outside the world of superheroes. At the same time, new voices such as <a href=\"http://www.emcarroll.com/\">Emily Carroll</a> and old ones such as Al Columbia produced far darker, yet necessary, visions of the world</p> <p>Over this decade of upheaval, many fortunes have reversed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/dc-comics\">DC</a> relaunched its entire shared universe as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52\">The New 52</a> in 2011, then threw in the towel and returned to the status quo after five years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel\">Marvel</a> spent the decade integrating the corporate values of its new owner, Disney, into its editorial decision-making to become far slicker, if more divided between nostalgia plays for older readers and squeaky-clean comics for kids. Some reclusive creators produced new work, including Columbia\u2019s <a href=\"https://floatingworldcomics.com/shop/art-books/amnesia-the-lost-films-of-francis-d-longfellow-by-al-columbia\">Amnesia: The Lost Films of Francis D Longfellow</a>. Some industry stalwarts received long-due accolades, such as Lynda Barry\u2019s MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d grant. And the decade produced a pile of amazing, beautiful comics, many of them from voices that hadn\u2019t been heard before 2010. Here are my favourites.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e02d51c1b52de2f941ce2b06e074ca77f55555fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e02d51c1b52de2f941ce2b06e074ca77f55555fe/124_176_1719_2309/744.jpg\" alt=\"Queasy masterpiece \u2026 Prison Pit by Johnny Ryan\" width=\"744\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queasy masterpiece \u2026 Prison Pit</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.prisonpit.com/\">Prison Pit</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.prisonpit.com/\"> by Johnny Ryan</a> (2009-19)</h2> <p>A gleefully disgusting tour of a prison planet that is more or less hell, starring an alien murderer named Cannibal Fuckface, Ryan\u2019s six-book series has absolutely no redeeming moral qualities \u2013 and is a queasy masterpiece. Ryan\u2019s series is a fascinatingly extreme exercise in seeing just how far the artist can go \u2013 not just in terms of depravity, but also in terms of sheer size.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1577ceb3f0dc8d1d64c831ecfe0fde7868e82f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1577ceb3f0dc8d1d64c831ecfe0fde7868e82f1/0_0_1346_904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hark!

A Vagrant</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php\"> by Kate Beaton</a> (2012)</h2> <p>Beaton\u2019s beloved webcomic skips lightly among minutiae from Canadian history, English literature, 80s corporate culture, and superhero fandom, yet it\u2019s all of a piece, her subject matter as deceptively messy as her gleeful drawings. The resulting collection of curiosities is both unmistakably feminist and snortingly funny. Indeed, some of her lines are so pithy and memorable that, over the years, they\u2019ve been stolen from her to sell other people\u2019s merchandise. As far as posterity\u2019s concerned, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m sure Beaton has turned more than one person on to Wuthering Heights just so they could better laugh at her <a href=\"http://www.harkavagrant.com/index.php?id=202\">Dude Watchin\u2019 With the Bront\u00ebs</a> strip, or sent them frantically trawling Wikipedia for the backstory behind this or that eccentric Canadian politician.

The art is a vibrant fusion of graffiti-style neons and stylish sword-fight sequences, but Wimberly\u2019s text is perhaps the book\u2019s most significant accomplishment. Sampling Shakespeare\u2019s lines and embroidering them with 80s hip-hop slang and rhythm, bard-worthy puns and insult contests that somehow jibe perfectly with his retro milieu. A pure delight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"eaeaf05e2beb0f9f1d2bdadddf40c83fa2ff9d37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaeaf05e2beb0f9f1d2bdadddf40c83fa2ff9d37/0_0_1704_2560/666.jpg\" alt=\"Impossibly weird \u2026 The Sandman by Neil Gaiman, JH Williams III and Dave Stewart.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Impossibly weird \u2026 The Sandman.

Yet Overture is every bit as good as the best of the original series, and a nice reminder of how impossibly weird the Sandman series is: it\u2019s set, after all, in the DC Universe of Superman and Batman. Gaiman is a generous writer and Williams really goes for broke, drawing ramshackle buildings with a different panel in every room, a two-page image in which the panels are inscribed on teeth, and massive gatefold spreads that spill the book\u2019s profusion of odd characters and places on to extra-large leaves. A feast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d333e82250299c29cd0cd2df8fadeb83e1d5e56b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d333e82250299c29cd0cd2df8fadeb83e1d5e56b/0_0_706_1000/706.jpg\" alt=\"Supremely confident \u2026 This One Summer by Jillian Tamaki and Mariko Tamaki.\" width=\"706\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supremely confident \u2026 This One Summer.

Jillian\u2019s lush renderings, drawn entirely in shades of blue, serve as a perfect counterpoint to Mariko\u2019s economical script. Rose, our heroine, realises she wants to take part in the adult world around her, but soon learns the secrets and weaknesses of the older people around her. A supremely confident work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8d6769bd412c4ca5ece09b9688628c49b1063dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8d6769bd412c4ca5ece09b9688628c49b1063dd/163_87_1686_2585/652.jpg\" alt=\"Brimful of wit \u2026 Killing and Dying by Adrian Tomine\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brimful of wit \u2026 Killing and Dying</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/19/killing-and-dying-by-adrian-tomine-review\">Killing and Dying</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/19/killing-and-dying-by-adrian-tomine-review\"> by Adrian Tomine</a> (2015)</h2> <p>Each of the short stories in Tomine\u2019s masterly collection is drawn in a different style, but all are brimming with wit and pathos. Tomine\u2019s mania for process is well-known: every interior in his graphic novel Shortcomings was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/30/adrian-tomine-comics-killing-and-dying-the-new-yorker\">carefully modelled on a real location</a> \u2013 a huge expenditure of effort. In Killing and Dying, Tomine makes a dazzling feature of his capacity for taking pains, while also showing his gifts for rich characterisation and spare, cutting dialogue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5f1725fd71c8e3955d0a5be216c44d5804028803\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f1725fd71c8e3955d0a5be216c44d5804028803/0_0_1164_1800/647.jpg\" alt=\"Genuinely shocking \u2026 Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows.\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Genuinely shocking \u2026 Providence.

The book works as a complex meditation on identity and morality, but it\u2019s also a huge addition to the body of narrative gamesmanship surrounding HP Lovecraft, who lived and worked in the city that gives the story its name. Providence (the comic) at first appears to be a collection of oblique, linked short stories and then resolves into a gigantic vision of inevitable \u2013 providential \u2013 destruction, wrought by countless tiny, familiar failures. Burrows\u2019 magnificent, period-perfect art fills each panel with so much earthbound detail that the supernatural intrusions are not merely jarring but genuinely shocking, subverting the reader\u2019s senses of time and place in ways that only comics can manage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"acf4a570cc0eab31b4057f1021ff8c650249c789\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acf4a570cc0eab31b4057f1021ff8c650249c789/0_0_564_855/330.jpg\" alt=\"The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl by Marvel Comics #6 with artwork by Kamome Shirahama\" width=\"330\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hilariously deadpan \u2026 The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl.

It\u2019s a rare superhero book in which the outcome of a climactic battle is often that everyone wins. Their comic is a constant joy overflowing with sight gags, maths jokes and strange Marvel trivia.

      "bodyText": "With so many hairpin turns over the last 10 years, it makes sense that the greatest and most inventive works in comics would come from unexpected, contradictory corners: young adult and horror. As the YA comics market boomed, it attracted more and more brilliant cartoonists, with superstars such as Raina Telgemeier finding a huge readership outside the world of superheroes. At the same time, new voices such as Emily Carroll and old ones such as Al Columbia produced far darker, yet necessary, visions of the world Over this decade of upheaval, many fortunes have reversed. DC relaunched its entire shared universe as The New 52 in 2011, then threw in the towel and returned to the status quo after five years. Marvel spent the decade integrating the corporate values of its new owner, Disney, into its editorial decision-making to become far slicker, if more divided between nostalgia plays for older readers and squeaky-clean comics for kids. Some reclusive creators produced new work, including Columbia\u2019s Amnesia: The Lost Films of Francis D Longfellow. Some industry stalwarts received long-due accolades, such as Lynda Barry\u2019s MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d grant. And the decade produced a pile of amazing, beautiful comics, many of them from voices that hadn\u2019t been heard before 2010. Here are my favourites. Prison Pit by Johnny Ryan (2009-19) A gleefully disgusting tour of a prison planet that is more or less hell, starring an alien murderer named Cannibal Fuckface, Ryan\u2019s six-book series has absolutely no redeeming moral qualities \u2013 and is a queasy masterpiece. Ryan\u2019s series is a fascinatingly extreme exercise in seeing just how far the artist can go \u2013 not just in terms of depravity, but also in terms of sheer size. Hark! A Vagrant by Kate Beaton (2012) Beaton\u2019s beloved webcomic skips lightly among minutiae from Canadian history, English literature, 80s corporate culture, and superhero fandom, yet it\u2019s all of a piece, her subject matter as deceptively messy as her gleeful drawings. The resulting collection of curiosities is both unmistakably feminist and snortingly funny. Indeed, some of her lines are so pithy and memorable that, over the years, they\u2019ve been stolen from her to sell other people\u2019s merchandise. As far as posterity\u2019s concerned, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m sure Beaton has turned more than one person on to Wuthering Heights just so they could better laugh at her Dude Watchin\u2019 With the Bront\u00ebs strip, or sent them frantically trawling Wikipedia for the backstory behind this or that eccentric Canadian politician. It is a riot, yes \u2013 and, like all the best riots, it\u2019s also an education. Prince of Cats by Ronald Wimberly (2012; revised 2019) Taking its title from one of Shakespeare\u2019s insulting names for Tybalt, the Capulet cousin in Romeo and Juliet whose death sets the tragedy in motion, this marvellous graphic novel sees Wimberly cast Tybalt as his lead and set his story among katana-wielding gangs in 80s Brooklyn. The art is a vibrant fusion of graffiti-style neons and stylish sword-fight sequences, but Wimberly\u2019s text is perhaps the book\u2019s most significant accomplishment. Sampling Shakespeare\u2019s lines and embroidering them with 80s hip-hop slang and rhythm, bard-worthy puns and insult contests that somehow jibe perfectly with his retro milieu. A pure delight. The Sandman: Overture by Neil Gaiman, JH Williams III and Dave Stewart (2013-15) The return of Gaiman\u2019s acclaimed Sandman series was never going to be bad, but it could have been like dinner with an old friend after several years apart: pleasant but awkward in places. Yet Overture is every bit as good as the best of the original series, and a nice reminder of how impossibly weird the Sandman series is: it\u2019s set, after all, in the DC Universe of Superman and Batman. Gaiman is a generous writer and Williams really goes for broke, drawing ramshackle buildings with a different panel in every room, a two-page image in which the panels are inscribed on teeth, and massive gatefold spreads that spill the book\u2019s profusion of odd characters and places on to extra-large leaves. A feast. This One Summer by Jillian Tamaki and Mariko Tamaki (2014) The Tamaki sisters craft a delicate web of bonds between family and friends in their young-adult graphic novel centered on the tenuous friendship of two adolescent girls, Rose and Windy. Jillian\u2019s lush renderings, drawn entirely in shades of blue, serve as a perfect counterpoint to Mariko\u2019s economical script. Rose, our heroine, realises she wants to take part in the adult world around her, but soon learns the secrets and weaknesses of the older people around her. A supremely confident work. Killing and Dying by Adrian Tomine (2015) Each of the short stories in Tomine\u2019s masterly collection is drawn in a different style, but all are brimming with wit and pathos. Tomine\u2019s mania for process is well-known: every interior in his graphic novel Shortcomings was carefully modelled on a real location \u2013 a huge expenditure of effort. In Killing and Dying, Tomine makes a dazzling feature of his capacity for taking pains, while also showing his gifts for rich characterisation and spare, cutting dialogue. Providence by Alan Moore and Jacen Burrows (2015-17) The capstone to Moore\u2019s remarkable career in comics, Providence is a horror narrative of staggering depth and detail. The book works as a complex meditation on identity and morality, but it\u2019s also a huge addition to the body of narrative gamesmanship surrounding HP Lovecraft, who lived and worked in the city that gives the story its name. Providence (the comic) at first appears to be a collection of oblique, linked short stories and then resolves into a gigantic vision of inevitable \u2013 providential \u2013 destruction, wrought by countless tiny, familiar failures. Burrows\u2019 magnificent, period-perfect art fills each panel with so much earthbound detail that the supernatural intrusions are not merely jarring but genuinely shocking, subverting the reader\u2019s senses of time and place in ways that only comics can manage. The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl by Ryan North, Erica Henderson and Derek Charm (2015-19) North and Henderson brought a light heart and good intentions to the Marvel Universe in the form of Doreen Green, a cheerful college student who, as often as not, triumphs over her enemies through reasoned discourse and friendly persuasion. It\u2019s a rare superhero book in which the outcome of a climactic battle is often that everyone wins. Their comic is a constant joy overflowing with sight gags, maths jokes and strange Marvel trivia. Henderson\u2019s art in the first eight volumes has a hilarious deadpan quality, with Charm ably taking up her pen when she left off. The story\u2019s 58 issues (plus one terrific stand-alone graphic novel, The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe) are easily the best thing Marvel produced this decade. Patience by Daniel Clowes (2016) The melancholy comedian behind Ghost World, Ice Haven, and Wilson goes for the unexpected in his most beautiful graphic novel to date: a candy-coloured sci-fi story about a time machine and a dystopian future. Clowes\u2019 previous science fiction outing, The Death Ray, was as pretty but not as subtle; Patience\u2019s narrator, Jack, is a touch crazed and missing quite a few things that a careful reader will see. As Jack falls apart, the book blossoms into ever wilder, two-page spreads that recall the great Marvel Comics weirdos of the 60s. And the climax is unexpectedly touching. My Favorite Thing Is Monsters by Emil Ferris (2017) Every page in Ferris\u2019s enormous debut is a wonder. It is a murder mystery, a coming-of-age story, and a rumination on the iron grip of the past, nominally set in 1960s Chicago but frequently taking place within paintings at the Chicago Art Institute and the covers of notional horror comics. Drawn primarily with multicolored drugstore-quality ballpoints, this unconventional medium gives the art depth and breadth, as well as eye-popping colour deployed in beautiful, surprising ways. Berlin by Jason Lutes (2018) An astounding feat of craftsmanship and patience, Lutes\u2019s 22-years-in-the-making graphic novel about the last years of Weimar Berlin ought to feel ponderous but is more urgent than ever, as Lutes examines the way fascism divides families and ends friendships. This huge book is both profound and precise. Lutes renders a cast of Dickensian size in careful, consistent strokes, with his characters forced to choose between political loyalties; between combat, flight and assimilation; between one another. Poochytown by Jim Woodring (2018) Woodring\u2019s long-lived, mute hero, Frank, finally comes to rest in this fourth instalment. Every panel looks like a D\u00fcrer woodcut \u2013 never has an artist created a world so vivid without a single word spoken. Frank is one of the great works of art the US has produced, and Poochytown is its crown. Glenn Ganges in The River at Night by Kevin Huizenga (2019) A mercilessly recursive graphic novel about a man named Glenn, who spends his evenings exploring the depths of his own psyche as he fails to get to sleep. It is so visually inventive and so clever about the ways our brains fool themselves that it\u2019s impossible to put down.

The Hard Tomorrow by Eleanor Davis (2019) A couple in rural Kentucky live in a campground filled with a pickup truck, a trailer, a shed and a house that may never get built. As they work, meet idealistic activist friends and fall foul of a cruel legal system, they try in vain to have a child. There\u2019s so much pure life in Davis\u2019s slim graphic novel, with every page depicting an underexplored truth of hardscrabble American life. Davis\u2019s characters appear sometimes in quick, cartoonish lines as she describes their movement over many panels; sometimes in full, breathtaking portraiture. A book of rare beauty and plasticity. When I Arrived at the Castle by Emily Carroll (2019) Carroll\u2019s first full-length graphic novel is an ingeniously constructed deathtrap for the willing reader. Its Angela Carter-style setting threatens to turn into a fairytale we might recognise; instead, it goes full Borges, fragmenting into interlocking stories of others who have fallen foul of the witch at the book\u2019s centre.

      "body": "<p>\u2018When I read the script, I thought: \u2018This is crazy. How can I say this?\u2019\u201d says Ruben Rabasa. The 81-year-old actor appears in just one sketch in Netflix\u2019s surreal comedy<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/10/i-think-you-should-leave-netflix-tim-robinson\"> I Think You Should Leave</a>, written and co-created by Saturday Night Live alumnus Tim Robinson. But \u2013 as Focus Group Man \u2013 he provides one of the breakout performances of 2019. </p> <p>In the series, he plays a largely bald old man with a long, white mullet. Seemingly gripped by the fingers of the devil himself, he shouts out inappropriate comments in a focus group for a new car. Among his suggestions are \u201ca good steering wheel that doesn\u2019t fly off while you\u2019re driving\u201d and \u201cno space for mother-in-law\u201d. If these sound crackers, that is precisely the point; Focus Group Man is the star of a show that is a pure white light of fully committed silliness.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Focus Group Man has taken on a life of his own as a meme. The internet is now riddled with endless GIFs of Rabasa dabbing and shouting catchphrases such as \u201cteacher\u2019s pet\u201d and \u201cSTINKY\u201d. There is a <a href=\"http://www.mfrederickson.com/ithinkyoushouldleave/\">Ruben Rabasa soundboard</a> online. Tweets have inserted him into <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pattymo/status/1125430208985747457\">Game of Thrones</a>, and claimed that he is the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheAmitie/status/1124381887906975744\">boyfriend of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>. Rabasa remains modest. \u201cI guess I get very passionate about things. I don\u2019t prepare, it just comes right out.\u201d</p> <p>His performance has also seen a huge outpouring of praise for the actor, who has been working steadily since the late 70s. We speak the day after he makes a surprise appearance on a panel about the show for the US culture site Vulture. \u201cDid you see it?\u201d he asks. \u201cOh my God, right away everybody started laughing and taking pictures of me, pop pop pop. It was unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>Originally from Cuba, Rabasa moved to New York, then later to Miami, where he says he found more work, and LA. However, it was not without its downsides. \u201cIn Miami, every movie I get, they killed me. So I moved to LA. The first movie I get in LA, I play a ghost. I said: \u2018What the hell is happening?\u2019\u201d Luckily, I Think You Should Leave has finally pushed the jobbing actor over the top. With his increased profile, he is focusing on stage work and standup, and attempting to find a home for his sitcom, Americanos.</p> <p>I Think You Should Leave returns next year. Can we expect a repeat appearance from Rabasa? As it turns out, it is a question he was asked on the panel. \u201cThe interviewer said [to the show\u2019s creators]: \u2018I hope you are going to write for Ruben.\u2019 Before they could answer I said: \u2018You better!\u2019\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018When I read the script, I thought: \u2018This is crazy. How can I say this?\u2019\u201d says Ruben Rabasa. The 81-year-old actor appears in just one sketch in Netflix\u2019s surreal comedy I Think You Should Leave, written and co-created by Saturday Night Live alumnus Tim Robinson. But \u2013 as Focus Group Man \u2013 he provides one of the breakout performances of 2019. In the series, he plays a largely bald old man with a long, white mullet. Seemingly gripped by the fingers of the devil himself, he shouts out inappropriate comments in a focus group for a new car. Among his suggestions are \u201ca good steering wheel that doesn\u2019t fly off while you\u2019re driving\u201d and \u201cno space for mother-in-law\u201d. If these sound crackers, that is precisely the point; Focus Group Man is the star of a show that is a pure white light of fully committed silliness. Unsurprisingly, Focus Group Man has taken on a life of his own as a meme. The internet is now riddled with endless GIFs of Rabasa dabbing and shouting catchphrases such as \u201cteacher\u2019s pet\u201d and \u201cSTINKY\u201d. There is a Ruben Rabasa soundboard online. Tweets have inserted him into Game of Thrones, and claimed that he is the boyfriend of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Rabasa remains modest. \u201cI guess I get very passionate about things. I don\u2019t prepare, it just comes right out.\u201d His performance has also seen a huge outpouring of praise for the actor, who has been working steadily since the late 70s. We speak the day after he makes a surprise appearance on a panel about the show for the US culture site Vulture. \u201cDid you see it?\u201d he asks. \u201cOh my God, right away everybody started laughing and taking pictures of me, pop pop pop. It was unbelievable.\u201d Originally from Cuba, Rabasa moved to New York, then later to Miami, where he says he found more work, and LA. However, it was not without its downsides. \u201cIn Miami, every movie I get, they killed me. So I moved to LA. The first movie I get in LA, I play a ghost. I said: \u2018What the hell is happening?\u2019\u201d Luckily, I Think You Should Leave has finally pushed the jobbing actor over the top. With his increased profile, he is focusing on stage work and standup, and attempting to find a home for his sitcom, Americanos. I Think You Should Leave returns next year. Can we expect a repeat appearance from Rabasa? As it turns out, it is a question he was asked on the panel. \u201cThe interviewer said [to the show\u2019s creators]: \u2018I hope you are going to write for Ruben.\u2019 Before they could answer I said: \u2018You better!\u2019\u201d",

There will also be a one-year moratorium for owners of banned vehicles who can prove they earn less than \u20ac8,000 a year, and for delivery vehicles. All banned vehicles will be allowed to enter the city 10 times a year. \ufeff",

      "body": "<p>Among the social media tributes that followed Clive James\u2019s death last month, one broadcaster said that James had privately expressed regret at having spent so much time writing about TV. If true, this was something of a betrayal of the younger James who argued that, as an activity that preoccupies a lot of the nation a lot of the time, television demands serious consideration. In an era when TV critics win the Pulitzer prize and Oscar-winning film directors make Netflix miniseries, the idea that TV is unserious seems anachronistic. Yet, for those of us who cast a similar critical eye over video games, it\u2019s a relatable stance.</p> <p>You\u2019d think that, 40-odd years into the medium\u2019s existence, video games would be over this period of pained self-doubt. Yet many senior industry figures still insist that their games are essentially entertainment. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/mar/19/tom-clancys-the-division-2-game-review\">The Division 2</a></em>, for example, you play a government agent fighting paramilitary organisations following a shutdown of the US government. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not making any political statements,\u201d Terry Spier, the game\u2019s creative director, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/12/17451688/the-division-2-is-not-making-any-political-statements\" title=\"\">told a reporter from the website Polygon</a> before the game\u2019s release in March.</p> <p>Games often borrow politicised themes and aesthetics (October\u2019s <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, for example, allows players to deploy white phosphorus, a chemical weapon prohibited under international law) in order to benefit from the frisson of political relevance. But developers often seem not to consider or contextualise those decisions. But can we really blame companies for claiming that their games are nothing more than a benign pastime when the mere choice of which online store will have exclusive rights can result in thousands of abusive messages (as happened in the case of the husband-and-wife development team who announced that their project <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/26/chill-out-relaxing-video-games\">Ooblets</a></em> would be available through just one platform \u2013 Epic Store?)</p> <p>Of course, video games don\u2019t need be serious. Often they\u2019re at their best when, as in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/oct/06/untitled-goose-game-review-sayonara-wild-hearts\" title=\"\">Untitled Goose Game</a></em>, the surprise hit of 2019, they enable us to explore the absurd and wilfully silly. Arguably, in a medium that places primacy on the player\u2019s agency to move the story in directions of their own choosing, there\u2019s a case to be made that video games are a poor vehicle for a pointed narrative argument.</p> <p>Also, when a publisher is spending tens of millions of dollars trying to attract the broadest possible audience, dividing that audience along political lines is a risk. Still, it\u2019s a question of ambition, or imagination. And in a medium with such tremendous, unique qualities, why not give it a try \u2013 especially when politicians remain so eager to politicise the medium regardless, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/aug/05/trump-blames-shootings-on-glorification-of-violence-video\" title=\"\">Donald Trump did in August</a>, blaming video games (rather than guns) after the mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas?</p> <p>Then again, perhaps \u2019twas ever so. As James wrote in the introduction of <em>Glued to the Box</em>, a collection of his television reviews published in the<em> Observer</em> between 1979 and 1982: \u201cTelevision is simultaneously blamed, often by the same people, for worsening the world and for being powerless to change it.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change.</p> <h2>My top five video games of 2019</h2> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://goose.game/\" title=\"\">Untitled Goose Game</a></strong><br><strong> </strong><strong>(</strong>PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox One, Switch)<br>The tinkling and benign Debussy soundtrack belies the dark task at the heart of <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>: ruin what might otherwise be a perfectly pleasant day for the village in which you, a mean goose, reside. So you squawk, flap, peck and harass the villagers as you work your way down a series of to-do lists. Funny, well-crafted game-making.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://zaumstudio.com/\" title=\"\">Disco Elysium</a></strong><br>(PC)<br>While <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/04/disco-elysium-review-video-game-as-first-person-novel-hangover-detective-dice\">Disco Elysium</a></em> is at its core a computerised <em>Dungeons </em><em>&amp; Dragons</em> campaign, its story and setting (you play as an alcoholic cop charged with solving a union-related killing in a working-class port neighbourhood) is about as far from fantasy-based swordplay as one can travel. Bracingly written and filled with memorable moments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b26e17cf004e12f9aa6eb54449043a287f88883\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b26e17cf004e12f9aa6eb54449043a287f88883/74_0_1122_673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Mobius Digital\u2019s Outer Wilds.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from the \u2018mystical\u2019 Mobius Digital\u2019s Outer Wilds.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Outer Wilds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html\" title=\"\">Outer Wilds</a></strong><br>(PS4, Xbox One, PC)<br>You have 20 minutes to explore, via a lunar lander, a diminutive, clockwork solar system before the sun explodes. In an apocalyptic <em>Groundhog Day</em>, you resurrect after each ending armed with the knowledge gathered from your previous outing. In this way, you must unravel the game\u2019s secrets across several short lifetimes. Plaintive, mystical and memorable.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0x9OaHDjig\" title=\"\">Telling Lies</a></strong><br> (iOS, PC/ Mac)<br>In this follow-up to designer Sam Barlow\u2019s Bafta-winning <a href=\"http://www.herstorygame.com/\" title=\"\">Her Story</a>, you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/aug/22/telling-lies-review-endless-possibilities-in-brilliant-detective-story\">play as a former FBI agent</a> sifting hundreds of hours of footage saved on a hard drive stolen from the National Security Agency.

Once again, the game\u2019s challenge derives from matching a scarcity of resources to a surfeit of needs. A tasteful and exciting reimagining of a classic.</p> <h2><strong>Turkey</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://left-alive.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/\" title=\"\">Left Alive</a></strong><br>(PC, PS4)<br>With the legacy of Square Enix\u2019s well-regarded tactical war game series <em>Front Mission</em> behind it, and the art direction of <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>\u2019s Yoji Shinkawa fronting it, <em>Left Alive</em> showed promise that merely heightened the disappointment of the rickety, workmanlike results.</p>",

In The Division 2, for example, you play a government agent fighting paramilitary organisations following a shutdown of the US government. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not making any political statements,\u201d Terry Spier, the game\u2019s creative director, told a reporter from the website Polygon before the game\u2019s release in March. Games often borrow politicised themes and aesthetics (October\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, for example, allows players to deploy white phosphorus, a chemical weapon prohibited under international law) in order to benefit from the frisson of political relevance. But developers often seem not to consider or contextualise those decisions. But can we really blame companies for claiming that their games are nothing more than a benign pastime when the mere choice of which online store will have exclusive rights can result in thousands of abusive messages (as happened in the case of the husband-and-wife development team who announced that their project Ooblets would be available through just one platform \u2013 Epic Store?) Of course, video games don\u2019t need be serious. Often they\u2019re at their best when, as in Untitled Goose Game, the surprise hit of 2019, they enable us to explore the absurd and wilfully silly. Arguably, in a medium that places primacy on the player\u2019s agency to move the story in directions of their own choosing, there\u2019s a case to be made that video games are a poor vehicle for a pointed narrative argument. Also, when a publisher is spending tens of millions of dollars trying to attract the broadest possible audience, dividing that audience along political lines is a risk. Still, it\u2019s a question of ambition, or imagination. And in a medium with such tremendous, unique qualities, why not give it a try \u2013 especially when politicians remain so eager to politicise the medium regardless, as Donald Trump did in August, blaming video games (rather than guns) after the mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio and El Paso, Texas? Then again, perhaps \u2019twas ever so. As James wrote in the introduction of Glued to the Box, a collection of his television reviews published in the Observer between 1979 and 1982: \u201cTelevision is simultaneously blamed, often by the same people, for worsening the world and for being powerless to change it.\u201d Plus \u00e7a change. My top five video games of 2019 1. Untitled Goose Game (PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) The tinkling and benign Debussy soundtrack belies the dark task at the heart of Untitled Goose Game: ruin what might otherwise be a perfectly pleasant day for the village in which you, a mean goose, reside. So you squawk, flap, peck and harass the villagers as you work your way down a series of to-do lists. Funny, well-crafted game-making. 2. Disco Elysium (PC) While Disco Elysium is at its core a computerised Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign, its story and setting (you play as an alcoholic cop charged with solving a union-related killing in a working-class port neighbourhood) is about as far from fantasy-based swordplay as one can travel. Bracingly written and filled with memorable moments. 3. Outer Wilds (PS4, Xbox One, PC) You have 20 minutes to explore, via a lunar lander, a diminutive, clockwork solar system before the sun explodes. In an apocalyptic Groundhog Day, you resurrect after each ending armed with the knowledge gathered from your previous outing. In this way, you must unravel the game\u2019s secrets across several short lifetimes. Plaintive, mystical and memorable. 4. Telling Lies (iOS, PC/ Mac) In this follow-up to designer Sam Barlow\u2019s Bafta-winning Her Story, you play as a former FBI agent sifting hundreds of hours of footage saved on a hard drive stolen from the National Security Agency. The lives of four individuals at the centre of your investigation intertwine in ways you must fathom via deduction and careful use of precise search terms. 5. Resident Evil 2 (PS4, Xbox One, PC) As in the 1998 original, you arrive as a rookie cop in the midwestern American town of Raccoon City to find its residents shuffling, zombified and hungry for human flesh. Once again, the game\u2019s challenge derives from matching a scarcity of resources to a surfeit of needs. A tasteful and exciting reimagining of a classic. Turkey Left Alive (PC, PS4) With the legacy of Square Enix\u2019s well-regarded tactical war game series Front Mission behind it, and the art direction of Metal Gear Solid\u2019s Yoji Shinkawa fronting it, Left Alive showed promise that merely heightened the disappointment of the rickety, workmanlike results.",

      "bodyText": "A month of strikes on the South Western Railway franchise comes to an end on New Year\u2019s Day, with no sign of a peace deal and commuters complaining of chaotic journeys. The disruption will affect some New Year\u2019s Eve revellers as industrial action by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT ) union continues until 23:59 on New Year\u2019s Day. The strike, which began on 2 December, followed a long-running dispute between the RMT and SWR over the role of guards on trains on one of the UK\u2019s busiest commuter routes. Passengers may face further disruption in February, after the union started the process of balloting its members for new strikes. Alina Dewshi, 23, a part-time accountant and law student who has had to catch a lift with her manager each morning, described the journey to work on the 7.16am train from Motspur Park in south west London to Leatherhead in Surrey as a \u201cnightmare\u201d. \u201cI can barely breathe because it\u2019s so crowded, I nearly fainted on the first day of the strikes when I travelled into Waterloo for university,\u201d she said.

The 36-year-old was pushing her child in a pram in Downton Avenue, Streatham Hill, when she was stabbed three times from behind by a lone attacker. Police were called to the scene on Monday evening shortly before 5.30pm, and the victim was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening or life-changing injuries. Her child, whose age has not been released, was not hurt during the attack. The Metropolitan police confirmed on Tuesday morning they were seeking a male suspect in connection with the incident, but have not yet made any arrests. The \u201cextensive\u201d investigation was focusing on CCTV footage in the area and forensic work from the scene. The suspect, who did not speak to the victim during the incident, was described as being 6ft tall, black, and wearing dark clothing. He fled the scene immediately after the attack. The victim was not thought to have known the suspect, and motivations for the attack remained unclear. The Met said officers \u201cretain an open mind as to any motive\u201d, as inquiries continued. Anyone with information was asked to call 101 quoting reference CAD5169/20 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",

As I waited outside, I saw her through a classroom window between reflections of trees and late summer flowers. With those people in grief, her clasped hands, the furrow in her brow, her facial expression, show empathy, concern, sadness, but most of all, love. In a way it summed up the way New Zealand reached out to its Muslim community during a horrific time. Three weeks later, parliament voted in legislation to restrict semi-automatic firearms and magazines by 119 votes to one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"78d150b6dabc430069821bd0f21c8c45b75fa071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78d150b6dabc430069821bd0f21c8c45b75fa071/0_0_3500_2332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Climbers lining up to reach the summit of Mount Everest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Climbers queueing at the summit of Mount Everest</strong></p> <p>Nirmal Purja/Project Possible/AFP/Getty Images</p> <p><strong>22 May</strong> I was trying to break one of my world records, the fastest summit of Everest and Lhotse \u2013 the record was 10 hours and I was trying to do it in six. I ended up waiting there for hours, so I took this photo as evidence that the queue stopped me from breaking the record. There need to be better rules and regulations for safer mountaineering. Presently there are no guidelines about how much experience you need, so after this I advised the Nepal government that people should have to demonstrate they can master at least an 8,000m mountain before attempting to climb Everest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fcc6ddc140dda4eb6b9515664687997edd47cbed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcc6ddc140dda4eb6b9515664687997edd47cbed/0_0_4625_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Migrants arriving in Malaga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Migrants rescued off the Malaga coast</strong></p> <p>Jorge Guerrero/AFP via Getty Images</p> <p><strong>29 August</strong> I took this photo after an inflatable boat carrying 132 migrants was rescued by the Spanish coastguard in the Alboran Sea. They were waiting to disembark and were being cared for by members of the Red Cross. They came from the Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. Upon arrival they were transferred to the Spanish Refugee Aid Commission, then ended up going on to France. The reason they make the journey to Europe is complex, but it is often because of extreme poverty, exploitation and conflict in their countries of origin. You see in their faces, tiredness, despair and at the same time an expression of hope. Every time I photograph immigration, I feel sadness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fee460fc41d7a747cf5d44f4d5a116721be8708\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fee460fc41d7a747cf5d44f4d5a116721be8708/0_0_1427_951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump at Buckingham Palace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump at Buckingham Palace</strong></p> <p>Tim Rooke/Rex/Shutterstock</p> <p><strong>3 June</strong> I was waiting in the garden of Buckingham Palace for the arrival of President Trump for the state visit. They were landing Marine One and other helicopters in the garden, so we were a long way away from the palace, and there was heightened security because of the likelihood of protests. Jared and Ivanka were looking out the window so they had a view of the whole garden and could watch the president arrive and review the guard of honour with the Queen. There was a symmetry about the way they were standing; for some reason it reminds me of Grant Wood\u2019s 1930 painting American Gothic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"84f279f951cad44339f258b9008e65dd057ead57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84f279f951cad44339f258b9008e65dd057ead57/0_0_4822_3215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protestors in Chile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Rioters kiss in Santiago, Chile</strong></p> <p>Cherry Guzman</p> <p><strong>28 October</strong> I took this shot on the 10th day of the greatest social unrest Chile has seen, with people demanding dignity and equality when it comes to health, education, pay and free, safe and legal abortion, as well as many other issues. I had got into the habit of going down to the Plaza de la Dignidad in Santiago between 3pm and 4pm to see what was going on with the protesting. That day President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era had called for calm, saying everything would go back to normal. That just made people even more furious. There were fires all around the plaza, including one just behind the masked couple standing outside the entrance to the metro station. I decided to take a picture. I think chaos is the best word to describe the atmosphere: there was smoke everywhere and the wind was whipping pieces of burnt paper into mini-tornadoes. There were sirens, flares, and all the noise from the fire engines and ambulances passing by. People were euphoric, and were chanting against the president and against repression. They were toppling lampposts and traffic lights to stop water cannon getting through and sheltering from rubber bullets behind bus stops. There was real rage in the air. People had lost their fear of protesting and felt it was time to say what they were thinking.</p> <p><em>Interview by Sam Jones</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e4c1b3454b92a50ed6621c31e0a61b180f8bc18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e4c1b3454b92a50ed6621c31e0a61b180f8bc18/0_0_4880_3443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohingya boy in the rain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>A Rohingya boy shelters from the rain in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh</strong></p> <p>Allison Joyce/Getty Images</p> <p><strong>21 August</strong> A few days before the second anniversary of what is now termed Genocide Day, Bangladesh announced its plan to repatriate 3,000 Rohingya to Myanmar. The mood in the camps was one of fear and panic, and some families were in hiding. The vast majority of the refugees refused to go back without their rights, citizenship and safety guaranteed. I heard that representatives from UNHCR were going door to door in the camp, talking to refugees about the plan and answering their questions. I hiked for more than an hour to reach the camp, and as soon as I tracked them down, the skies opened up and a downpour started. A group who had been talking with the UNHCR team took cover under the roof of a nearby tent. For a few moments, this boy leaned out into the rain, enjoying a brief respite from the summer heat, seemingly lost in his own world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ffdaf90e6ad4a862e07779037c758eec666db8f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ffdaf90e6ad4a862e07779037c758eec666db8f/0_0_2048_1364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crab stuck inside a plastic cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Crab stuck inside a plastic cup</strong></p> <p>Noel Guevara/Greenpeace/EPA</p> <p><strong>7 March</strong> During a Greenpeace ship tour from Manila to Cebu, we did an underwater audit of plastic in the Verde Island Passage, the heart of global marine biodiversity. On the first dive day I was shooting near the surface when I found this crab stuck inside a cup. I felt mortified, but not as much as I should have. It\u2019s so common now it\u2019s no longer a surprise, which is telling of the gravity of the problem. For plastic waste, the Philippines is the third highest ocean polluter in the world. It sits in the centre of the Coral Triangle, meaning an abundance of marine life is in close and frequent contact with plastic debris \u2013 I often see diapers, plastic bags and plastic packaging underwater. I hope photos like this help people understand the extent of our impact on the natural world. It\u2019s not simply a case of ditching plastic, but of changing our throwaway mentality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52932a082185e067cd5b8e0a091b05fbbdae7e55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52932a082185e067cd5b8e0a091b05fbbdae7e55/0_0_4731_3379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy at Glastonbury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Stormzy headlines Glastonbury</strong></p> <p>David Jensen/Empics Entertainment/PA</p> <p><strong>28 June</strong> I had seen Stormzy perform before at smaller venues, so I knew how talented he was. But this \u2013 Friday night on the Pyramid stage in front of an 80,000-strong crowd, the first black solo British artist and the first grime artist to ever headline Glastonbury, and at such a young age (25) \u2013 was such a historic moment that I felt nervous for him. Once he came running out on to the stage, he gave off this energy. The place erupted. I was completely blown away. He has since said he cried after the performance. About 20 minutes into the set he had issues with his earpiece and couldn\u2019t hear himself, and he came off thinking he had completely blown it. But he was incredible. It was pretty special.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9569776bdedd9b01dec12919a648aeab057a3502\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9569776bdedd9b01dec12919a648aeab057a3502/0_0_5823_3874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Los Angeles Pride\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Los Angeles Pride</strong></p> <p>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images</p> <p><strong>9 June</strong> I was asked to cover street style at the LA Pride festival in West Hollywood, California, in a creative and fun way. Typically, street style is shot to just show off what the general fashion is, but I took a different approach and asked people for portraits so that I could get some emotion and personality to come out. I was very specific about who I asked for photos, but these two were an obvious choice. They completely embodied the spirit of this festival \u2013 it\u2019s a place to be entirely yourself, have fun, and spend time with the people you love. They were unapologetically themselves and that is exactly what I was hoping to capture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"000954df45de9b9bf7e4b96ff97fde512fcec611\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/000954df45de9b9bf7e4b96ff97fde512fcec611/0_0_10550_7200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women worship in the polluted Yamuna River, India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Women worship in the polluted Yamuna River, India</strong></p> <p>@bawara.mann/Instagram</p> <p><strong>2 November</strong> Walking along the bank of the Yamuna early one morning, I saw these women praying in the river. It was the Hindu festival of Chhath Puja \u2013 the women fast for three days, then dip themselves in the water and pray to the sun god. So many people look at this photo and think it\u2019s snow, but it\u2019s actually the pollution from the river. The chemical waste from industrial and household pollution makes the froth. It\u2019s a terrible irony that these women were praying while standing in water that could affect their health. There were even kids playing with the foam. That week, Delhi\u2019s air pollution peaked to a three-year high. In India, the rivers are very important in our culture and praying in water is common. Pictures like this show how rivers like the Yamuna are now so polluted, it comes in the path of your faith as well as your health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ac9938cebb265fee0d3406cf24699aa5ad4414d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ac9938cebb265fee0d3406cf24699aa5ad4414d/0_0_3000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The christening of Harry and Meghan's son\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The christening of Harry and Meghan\u2019s son</strong></p> <p>Chris Allerton for Sussex Royal via Getty Images</p> <p><strong>8 May</strong> I was honoured to take the official photographs at the christening of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, and to once again be part of such a special and joyous occasion for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9b42a18a262cbe49d81d5cbe162202cf009738b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b42a18a262cbe49d81d5cbe162202cf009738b7/0_0_4200_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Greta Thunberg addresses the Montreal climate strike\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Greta Thunberg addresses the Montreal climate strike</strong></p> <p>Eric Demers/Polaris/eyevine</p> <p><strong>27 September</strong> When Greta Thunberg announced that she was going to be in Montreal for the climate strike march, we all knew this was going to be huge. In fact, with 500,000 protesters, it was the biggest demonstration in Canadian history. To get a true sense of the magnitude of the event, I convinced them to let me go on stage to take this photo. She was like a rock star. It was striking, the difference between her shyness offstage and her level of comfort in front of a crowd; she climbed the stairs and went straight to the microphone, then turned towards the sun and cracked a little smile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2db303b8984ff8350043026d1b990f48ffe5956a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2db303b8984ff8350043026d1b990f48ffe5956a/0_0_4000_2670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"California wildfire wedding\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>California wildfire wedding</strong></p> <p>Karna Roa/kmrphotography.com</p> <p><strong>26 October</strong> Many of the wedding vendors in Sonoma county had actually evacuated their families before driving to the venue. The nearest fires were about 25 miles away and by the end of the ceremony the sky had turned an orange-brown; by sunset it was a brilliant red from the smoke. The happiest day of this couple\u2019s lives was affected by climate change; nobody is immune from it. So we decided to get a shot of them wearing the air-filter masks: I imagined them looking back at their wedding album in years to come. There was a lot of love in the air, but the fires were a huge part of their story and this photo is true to what it felt like to be there. After three years of wildfires, it made me stop and think: is this the new normal for California in the fall?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f7862beb3743665b9482e75ebc62a04da43f00df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7862beb3743665b9482e75ebc62a04da43f00df/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sled dogs in melted ice water, Greenland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Sled dogs in melted ice water, Greenland</strong></p> <p>Steffen M Olsen/Danish Meteorological Institute/AP</p> <p><strong>13 June</strong> I was in northwest Greenland to collect instruments that had been deployed on the sea ice in December, a trip I\u2019ve done annually for the last eight years. This year the Arctic summer had come a few weeks early and it was 15-17C \u2013 extremely warm for June. In the fjord, we found ourselves in more water than we had ever seen on the ice in early June, which reflects what we know \u2013 the season for sea ice is getting shorter. The early melting of the ice cover led to water that was 20-40cm deep. Even the dogs \u2013 who have a hard life \u2013 were struggling. The local hunters, who we rely on for their traditional knowledge, were uncertain and found it extreme. We reached our limits and had to turn around. After 48 hours, more cracks had developed and drained most of the surface water away, so we were able to complete the assignment. I think that, symbolically, the photo shows the impact of climate change and how societies are challenged to plan and adapt for the future; this way of life and culture may not exist in 50 years\u2019 time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"effa9849d7bcaf9f466d0219e93a116e23c2fd41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/effa9849d7bcaf9f466d0219e93a116e23c2fd41/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Phoebe Waller-Bridge after the Emmys\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge after the Emmys</strong></p> <p>Josh Cole</p> <p><strong>23 September</strong> At the afterparty at Chateau Marmont in LA, hours after Phoebe had won a hatful of Emmys for Fleabag, we were sitting round the pool, away from the main party, when I captured an impromptu moment. I produced her first show (Crashing, for Channel 4), so I\u2019ve seen first-hand how hard she has worked from the beginning. It has been a surreal joy watching Hollywood and the wider world discover her brilliance. She is an extraordinary soul and a multi-talented artist who deserves every accolade she has received. This was one of those nights you don\u2019t forget and I\u2019m thrilled that it resonated with so many.

There were reports of a small fire on the roof at Notre Dame. As I set off for the cathedral on my motorbike, I could see unusual yellow smoke from 2km away. It was soon clear it wasn\u2019t a small fire. People were crowded around taking pictures, covering their mouths from the smoke with scarves, crying, praying. When the spire collapsed, people around me gasped. I remember people kneeling, praying and singing hymns \u2013 Ave Maria. I suppose you could say it could have been a lot worse; we could have lost the towers and that would have been the end of Notre Dame. Later, we started to ask, why had this historic building not been properly protected? How could this happen in 2019?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"52f52becd74bc4e47e937b3985f4b68f255d1055\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52f52becd74bc4e47e937b3985f4b68f255d1055/0_0_2624_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hurricane Dorian, The Bahamas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Hurricane Dorian, The Bahamas</strong></p> <p>Ram\u00f3n Espinosa/AP</p> <p><strong>3 September</strong> I\u2019ve covered many hurricanes but none with Dorian\u2019s force. It was a monster that destroyed everything. It did not stop raining heavily and everything was flooded. When I arrived, there were volunteers with jet skis and small boats rescuing people. I asked if I could travel with them but the space was necessary for survivors. I decided to walk to the flooded area and that\u2019s when I found these people \u2013 some of the volunteers who put their lives at stake to rescue their neighbours.

Against the backdrop of suing for equal pay with the men\u2019s game, the US team had such a strong run throughout the World Cup that everyone expected them to win. There is a very different atmosphere at women\u2019s matches; more of a family event. The sport has a different feel too. It\u2019s more about the team and the sport itself than individual players. I took this photo of Megan Rapinoe after Team USA had won and been presented with the trophy. She struck this iconic pose for the cameras. I could hear fans cheering for equal pay from the stands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"530a584adb25bf99f8ee4c93cad689e91b798f5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/530a584adb25bf99f8ee4c93cad689e91b798f5b/0_0_3840_2560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Torrential rain at the Tour de Yorkshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Torrential rain at the Tour de Yorkshire</strong></p> <p>Alex Broadway/SWpix.com/Rex/Shutterstock</p> <p><strong>2 May</strong> I\u2019ve been photographing the Tour de Yorkshire since 2015 and this was the worst weather I had ever seen. It was the first stage and I was working off the back of a motorbike. After the breakaway came through, the other photographers left, but I waited for the peloton to come over the bridge. It just started absolutely chucking it down. I had never experienced rain like that in this country \u2013 I was completely soaked through and one of my lenses packed up. It was sheer luck that Nicholas Dlamini came out in front in white and they formed this perfect arrow shape. My screen was covered in rain, so I jumped back on the bike to get ahead of the peloton again, concentrating on keeping my cameras dry.

      "bodyText": "Jacinda Ardern after the Christchurch shooting Kirk Hargreaves/Christchurch city council 16 March The day after an Australian far-right extremist killed 51 people and injured another 49 during prayer at two mosques in Christchurch, prime minister Jacinda Ardern met Muslim community representatives at a primary school. As I waited outside, I saw her through a classroom window between reflections of trees and late summer flowers. With those people in grief, her clasped hands, the furrow in her brow, her facial expression, show empathy, concern, sadness, but most of all, love. In a way it summed up the way New Zealand reached out to its Muslim community during a horrific time. Three weeks later, parliament voted in legislation to restrict semi-automatic firearms and magazines by 119 votes to one. Climbers queueing at the summit of Mount Everest Nirmal Purja/Project Possible/AFP/Getty Images 22 May I was trying to break one of my world records, the fastest summit of Everest and Lhotse \u2013 the record was 10 hours and I was trying to do it in six. I ended up waiting there for hours, so I took this photo as evidence that the queue stopped me from breaking the record. There need to be better rules and regulations for safer mountaineering. Presently there are no guidelines about how much experience you need, so after this I advised the Nepal government that people should have to demonstrate they can master at least an 8,000m mountain before attempting to climb Everest. Migrants rescued off the Malaga coast Jorge Guerrero/AFP via Getty Images 29 August I took this photo after an inflatable boat carrying 132 migrants was rescued by the Spanish coastguard in the Alboran Sea. They were waiting to disembark and were being cared for by members of the Red Cross. They came from the Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. Upon arrival they were transferred to the Spanish Refugee Aid Commission, then ended up going on to France. The reason they make the journey to Europe is complex, but it is often because of extreme poverty, exploitation and conflict in their countries of origin. You see in their faces, tiredness, despair and at the same time an expression of hope. Every time I photograph immigration, I feel sadness. Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump at Buckingham Palace Tim Rooke/Rex/Shutterstock 3 June I was waiting in the garden of Buckingham Palace for the arrival of President Trump for the state visit. They were landing Marine One and other helicopters in the garden, so we were a long way away from the palace, and there was heightened security because of the likelihood of protests. Jared and Ivanka were looking out the window so they had a view of the whole garden and could watch the president arrive and review the guard of honour with the Queen. There was a symmetry about the way they were standing; for some reason it reminds me of Grant Wood\u2019s 1930 painting American Gothic. Rioters kiss in Santiago, Chile Cherry Guzman 28 October I took this shot on the 10th day of the greatest social unrest Chile has seen, with people demanding dignity and equality when it comes to health, education, pay and free, safe and legal abortion, as well as many other issues. I had got into the habit of going down to the Plaza de la Dignidad in Santiago between 3pm and 4pm to see what was going on with the protesting. That day President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era had called for calm, saying everything would go back to normal. That just made people even more furious. There were fires all around the plaza, including one just behind the masked couple standing outside the entrance to the metro station. I decided to take a picture. I think chaos is the best word to describe the atmosphere: there was smoke everywhere and the wind was whipping pieces of burnt paper into mini-tornadoes. There were sirens, flares, and all the noise from the fire engines and ambulances passing by. People were euphoric, and were chanting against the president and against repression. They were toppling lampposts and traffic lights to stop water cannon getting through and sheltering from rubber bullets behind bus stops. There was real rage in the air. People had lost their fear of protesting and felt it was time to say what they were thinking. Interview by Sam Jones A Rohingya boy shelters from the rain in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh Allison Joyce/Getty Images 21 August A few days before the second anniversary of what is now termed Genocide Day, Bangladesh announced its plan to repatriate 3,000 Rohingya to Myanmar. The mood in the camps was one of fear and panic, and some families were in hiding. The vast majority of the refugees refused to go back without their rights, citizenship and safety guaranteed. I heard that representatives from UNHCR were going door to door in the camp, talking to refugees about the plan and answering their questions. I hiked for more than an hour to reach the camp, and as soon as I tracked them down, the skies opened up and a downpour started. A group who had been talking with the UNHCR team took cover under the roof of a nearby tent. For a few moments, this boy leaned out into the rain, enjoying a brief respite from the summer heat, seemingly lost in his own world. Crab stuck inside a plastic cup Noel Guevara/Greenpeace/EPA 7 March During a Greenpeace ship tour from Manila to Cebu, we did an underwater audit of plastic in the Verde Island Passage, the heart of global marine biodiversity. On the first dive day I was shooting near the surface when I found this crab stuck inside a cup. I felt mortified, but not as much as I should have. It\u2019s so common now it\u2019s no longer a surprise, which is telling of the gravity of the problem. For plastic waste, the Philippines is the third highest ocean polluter in the world. It sits in the centre of the Coral Triangle, meaning an abundance of marine life is in close and frequent contact with plastic debris \u2013 I often see diapers, plastic bags and plastic packaging underwater. I hope photos like this help people understand the extent of our impact on the natural world. It\u2019s not simply a case of ditching plastic, but of changing our throwaway mentality. Stormzy headlines Glastonbury David Jensen/Empics Entertainment/PA 28 June I had seen Stormzy perform before at smaller venues, so I knew how talented he was. But this \u2013 Friday night on the Pyramid stage in front of an 80,000-strong crowd, the first black solo British artist and the first grime artist to ever headline Glastonbury, and at such a young age (25) \u2013 was such a historic moment that I felt nervous for him. Once he came running out on to the stage, he gave off this energy. The place erupted. I was completely blown away. He has since said he cried after the performance. About 20 minutes into the set he had issues with his earpiece and couldn\u2019t hear himself, and he came off thinking he had completely blown it. But he was incredible. It was pretty special. Los Angeles Pride Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images 9 June I was asked to cover street style at the LA Pride festival in West Hollywood, California, in a creative and fun way. Typically, street style is shot to just show off what the general fashion is, but I took a different approach and asked people for portraits so that I could get some emotion and personality to come out. I was very specific about who I asked for photos, but these two were an obvious choice. They completely embodied the spirit of this festival \u2013 it\u2019s a place to be entirely yourself, have fun, and spend time with the people you love. They were unapologetically themselves and that is exactly what I was hoping to capture. Women worship in the polluted Yamuna River, India @bawara.mann/Instagram 2 November Walking along the bank of the Yamuna early one morning, I saw these women praying in the river. It was the Hindu festival of Chhath Puja \u2013 the women fast for three days, then dip themselves in the water and pray to the sun god. So many people look at this photo and think it\u2019s snow, but it\u2019s actually the pollution from the river. The chemical waste from industrial and household pollution makes the froth. It\u2019s a terrible irony that these women were praying while standing in water that could affect their health. There were even kids playing with the foam. That week, Delhi\u2019s air pollution peaked to a three-year high. In India, the rivers are very important in our culture and praying in water is common. Pictures like this show how rivers like the Yamuna are now so polluted, it comes in the path of your faith as well as your health. The christening of Harry and Meghan\u2019s son Chris Allerton for Sussex Royal via Getty Images 8 May I was honoured to take the official photographs at the christening of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, and to once again be part of such a special and joyous occasion for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Greta Thunberg addresses the Montreal climate strike Eric Demers/Polaris/eyevine 27 September When Greta Thunberg announced that she was going to be in Montreal for the climate strike march, we all knew this was going to be huge. In fact, with 500,000 protesters, it was the biggest demonstration in Canadian history. To get a true sense of the magnitude of the event, I convinced them to let me go on stage to take this photo. She was like a rock star. It was striking, the difference between her shyness offstage and her level of comfort in front of a crowd; she climbed the stairs and went straight to the microphone, then turned towards the sun and cracked a little smile. California wildfire wedding Karna Roa/kmrphotography.com 26 October Many of the wedding vendors in Sonoma county had actually evacuated their families before driving to the venue. The nearest fires were about 25 miles away and by the end of the ceremony the sky had turned an orange-brown; by sunset it was a brilliant red from the smoke. The happiest day of this couple\u2019s lives was affected by climate change; nobody is immune from it. So we decided to get a shot of them wearing the air-filter masks: I imagined them looking back at their wedding album in years to come. There was a lot of love in the air, but the fires were a huge part of their story and this photo is true to what it felt like to be there. After three years of wildfires, it made me stop and think: is this the new normal for California in the fall? Sled dogs in melted ice water, Greenland Steffen M Olsen/Danish Meteorological Institute/AP 13 June I was in northwest Greenland to collect instruments that had been deployed on the sea ice in December, a trip I\u2019ve done annually for the last eight years. This year the Arctic summer had come a few weeks early and it was 15-17C \u2013 extremely warm for June. In the fjord, we found ourselves in more water than we had ever seen on the ice in early June, which reflects what we know \u2013 the season for sea ice is getting shorter. The early melting of the ice cover led to water that was 20-40cm deep. Even the dogs \u2013 who have a hard life \u2013 were struggling. The local hunters, who we rely on for their traditional knowledge, were uncertain and found it extreme. We reached our limits and had to turn around. After 48 hours, more cracks had developed and drained most of the surface water away, so we were able to complete the assignment. I think that, symbolically, the photo shows the impact of climate change and how societies are challenged to plan and adapt for the future; this way of life and culture may not exist in 50 years\u2019 time. Phoebe Waller-Bridge after the Emmys Josh Cole 23 September At the afterparty at Chateau Marmont in LA, hours after Phoebe had won a hatful of Emmys for Fleabag, we were sitting round the pool, away from the main party, when I captured an impromptu moment. I produced her first show (Crashing, for Channel 4), so I\u2019ve seen first-hand how hard she has worked from the beginning. It has been a surreal joy watching Hollywood and the wider world discover her brilliance. She is an extraordinary soul and a multi-talented artist who deserves every accolade she has received. This was one of those nights you don\u2019t forget and I\u2019m thrilled that it resonated with so many. It\u2019s not every day you take a candid picture of an old friend that the world embraces with such a fever. Notre Dame Cathedral fire Geoffroy van der Hasselt/AFP 15 April I was having a beer after work when my boss called. There were reports of a small fire on the roof at Notre Dame. As I set off for the cathedral on my motorbike, I could see unusual yellow smoke from 2km away. It was soon clear it wasn\u2019t a small fire. People were crowded around taking pictures, covering their mouths from the smoke with scarves, crying, praying. When the spire collapsed, people around me gasped. I remember people kneeling, praying and singing hymns \u2013 Ave Maria. I suppose you could say it could have been a lot worse; we could have lost the towers and that would have been the end of Notre Dame. Later, we started to ask, why had this historic building not been properly protected? How could this happen in 2019? Hurricane Dorian, The Bahamas Ram\u00f3n Espinosa/AP 3 September I\u2019ve covered many hurricanes but none with Dorian\u2019s force. It was a monster that destroyed everything. It did not stop raining heavily and everything was flooded. When I arrived, there were volunteers with jet skis and small boats rescuing people. I asked if I could travel with them but the space was necessary for survivors. I decided to walk to the flooded area and that\u2019s when I found these people \u2013 some of the volunteers who put their lives at stake to rescue their neighbours. They walked to a high area to get out of the water after working hard to get people out. Megan Rapinoe celebrates USA Women\u2019s World Cup victory Maja Hitij/Getty Images 7 July Women\u2019s football gained so much more attention this year and has become so popular, with record viewing figures and stadiums selling out. Against the backdrop of suing for equal pay with the men\u2019s game, the US team had such a strong run throughout the World Cup that everyone expected them to win. There is a very different atmosphere at women\u2019s matches; more of a family event. The sport has a different feel too. It\u2019s more about the team and the sport itself than individual players. I took this photo of Megan Rapinoe after Team USA had won and been presented with the trophy. She struck this iconic pose for the cameras. I could hear fans cheering for equal pay from the stands.

Protester confronts an armed policeman in Hong Kong Lam Yik Fei/New York Times/Redux/eyevine 25 August The protests were in their third month when I took this photo. Violence had broken out after a peaceful march and many protesters carried umbrellas, a symbol of the resistance movement. Hong Kong police officers drew pistols on protesters who were charging them with sticks. One officer fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell.

It has fun traditions. It has lots of candy. And you get presents. Christmas is perhaps the only holiday that lives up to the weeks-long anticipatory buildup forced upon us by capitalism. Situated, as it is, at the end of the year, Christmas is a convenient time for us to reflect on what we have done in the past year, and contemplate what we wish to do next. Sitting cozily by the fire with a cup of hot chocolate and a pile of gifts, we absorb good cheer, making it more likely that we will decide to be nice to people in the year to come. I understand that some of you hate your families and therefore despise Christmas \u2013 but that\u2019s a personal problem. You can\u2019t blame Santa for that. If you were seeking to design the perfect holiday from scratch, Christmas checks all the boxes.</p> <p>Then, mere days later, as we\u2019re still basking in the warm afterglow of generosity and peace, New Year\u2019s Eve bursts in like a party guest who arrives after everyone else has left and demands that you turn up the music again. Also, they are throwing up on your floor. After the incredible buildup, release and cool-down of holiday spirit that begins after Thanksgiving and proceeds unabated until the end of the year, the last thing that any of us need is another damn holiday \u2013 much less a loud, intoxicated holiday interrupted often by screaming. We have one good holiday in December. That\u2019s plenty. When it comes to holidays \u2013 and to proclamations like \u201cI\u2019m taking 20 shots for 2020, wooooo\u201d \u2013 more is not always better.</p> <p>I live in New York City. It\u2019s a lovely town, as long as you take care to avoid a few things: tourists, Times Square and large public gatherings, which are inevitably too crowded to be anything other than miserable. New Year\u2019s Eve manages to combine these three terrors into a single event, and to throw in Kathy Griffin, mounted police and a million drunken people with nowhere to pee for good measure. You almost have to respect this abominable cocktail of doom, in the same way you might respect a jar full of every kind of poison on Earth. From a distance. It is not the sort of thing that you would invite people to.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with marking the passage of a year with a quiet ceremony. Go out in the woods and say magic words as the clock strikes midnight, or stay in and whisper your new year\u2019s resolution to your dog. Fine. Yet from coast to coast, the options offered to the public on the last day of the year are mostly bars, clubs and restaurants where prices have tripled. (The tripling of prices in turns triples the determination of patrons to act like monsters, in order to get their money\u2019s worth.)</p> <p>Alternately, you can go to sleep early, insisting unconvincingly that you are not clinically depressed; you can go to a friend\u2019s party, which everyone will leave at 12:01 in order to go to another, more debauched party; or, if you are a parent, you can stay home arguing with your kids about bedtime until midnight, when they will throw a temper tantrum upon finding out that they do not get presents. This particular holiday has the uncanny ability to make everyone, everywhere, of every age, more of an asshole. And we love it!</p> <p>Mostly, New Year\u2019s Eve is about getting wasted. Because I do not drink, I find this a boring pretext for a national holiday. Some might say, \u201cOf course you don\u2019t like New Year\u2019s Eve; don\u2019t turn your personal wretchedness into a pathetic pretense of principle, in an attempt to try to bring the rest of the world down to your level of misery.\u201d Let\u2019s not get sidetracked by these arguments. The point is: I\u2019ll be celebrating at home, alone, with a nice glass of seltzer. You\u2019re welcome to stop by. Or not. Go out and have your fun. See if I care.</p> <p>Tomorrow morning, I will wake up refreshed. And while you are passed out with a hangover, I will steal the money from your pockets. Happy new year.

Warren, who has said more about trans rights than any other candidate, has made her credo clear, over and over: that everyone matters, and matters equally, and that the systems that shape our lives should value, defend and give everyone opportunity equally. She got a lot of attention for her comic answer to the question about what she\u2019d say to someone opposed to marriage equality, but after the laughter was over, she said something she\u2019s said in many forms in her campaign: \u201cTo me, that is the heart of it.

We believe in racial equity, we believe in gender equity, we believe in everybody gets a chance in this country.\u201d All this makes her, in my eyes, not just the best candidate to undo the damage of the Trump era but the best candidate to make this country live up to its promises, potential and ideals in ways it never has before.

Raffensperger said he was reactivating their voter registrations to give them more time. \u201cWe are proactively taking additional steps to prevent any confusion come the day of the election,\u201d he said in a statement. Some crucial protections against bad voter purging also remain in place. Federal law prohibits states from systematically cleaning their rolls within 90 days of a federal election and says the systems state develop to remove people from the rolls must be \u201cnon-discriminatory.\u201d It is clear that next year\u2019s election is already becoming an epic battle to try and preserve the voting rights of millions of voters. The lessons from the 2016 election should sound a cautionary tale. As Professor Carol Anderson, author of One Person, No Vote, a history of voting suppression in the US, writing in the Guardian, said: \u201cThe 21st century is littered with the bodies of black votes. In 2016, pummeled by voter suppression in more than 30 states, the black voter turnout plummeted by seven percentage points. For the GOP, that was an effective kill rate. For America, it was a lethal assault on democracy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Photojournalists and press freedom activists have called on authorities in Chile to investigate the murder of a young photographer amid speculation that her death may have been linked to pictures she took during violent clashes between riot police and anti-government demonstrators. The body of Albertina Mart\u00ednez was found in her apartment in the Chilean capital, Santiago on 21 November, two days after she had been seen heading to a protest nearby. She had been beaten, and a bag containing her camera, laptop and phone were missing. \u201cThe pictures she took that day have vanished,\u201d said her sister, Priscilla. Sources close to the investigation say the case is being treated as a robbery with homicide, but the timing of the murder has prompted speculation that Mart\u00ednez was targeted because she had been photographing the protests. \u201cChilean authorities should investigate the killing of Albertina Mart\u00ednez Burgos thoroughly to determine if it was linked to her reporting, and do everything possible to recover her equipment and materials,\u201d said Natalie Southwick from the Committee to Protect Journalists. In more than two months of mass demonstrations against social and economic inequality, thousands have been injured and at least 27 people have died. No arrests have yet been made over Mart\u00ednez\u2019s murder, and with the motive still unclear, friends and authorities have urged caution. Friends from her football team have said she was afraid to attend the protests, but pictures on Mart\u00ednez\u2019s private Instagram feed from the week before her death show masked protesters shrouded in billowing clouds of smoke. Mart\u00ednez moved to Santiago from southern Chile 10 years ago to pursue a career in photography, working at Chile\u2019s main daily, El Mercurio. She then moved on to work as a lighting assistant at a television studio. \u201cShe was clearly happier taking pictures than working at the studio, and she had a good eye for photography, but opportunities in the field can be difficult to come by,\u201d said Sergio L\u00f3pez, who worked alongside Mart\u00ednez at the newspaper. He had spoken to her the week before her death. \u201cShe said she enjoyed taking pictures at the protests, even though she was a little afraid,\u201d he said. Photojournalists group Frente Fotografic\u00f3 responded to Mart\u00ednez\u2019s death by sharing her pictures of the protests, along with the hashtag #JUSTICIAPARAALBERTINA. \u201cWe will not forget her face or her name,\u201d they wrote. The photojournalism collective Migrar Photo called on investigators for transparency and truth, and warned photographers to \u201clook after one another\u201d. The group said that police animosity towards photographers has intensified in recent weeks, as coverage of protests has provided evidence of human rights abuses by the security forces. Members of the group have received threats from the police, and have been shot with pellets, teargas and water cannons. Chile is considered a safe country for journalists, ranked 46th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders 2019 World Press Freedom Index. But since the unrest began 10 weeks ago, RSF has condemned a series of attacks on the press, including forced detention. Freelance photographer Giovanny Valenzuela was covering the same protest as Mart\u00ednez on 19 November, and described a heavy police presence and \u201cstrong repression\u201d. He said news of her death and shaken other photojournalists covering the protests. \u201cThe fact that we are in the middle of a social revolt, and a photographer was found dead without her equipment was very shocking. We feel threatened \u2013 and very sad.\u201d Other attacks on press include an incident in which a BBC team was apparently targeted with teargas rounds, the detention of two photojournalists, and a police assault on an Argentinian journalist who was hit in the face with a baton by officers who then destroyed her camera. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s sister Priscilla said she had still not been contacted by prosecutors. \u201cI can\u2019t rule out anything because I don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she said.",

Will England bear any scars from their defeat to South Africa in Yokohama? Will Wales \u2013 holders and grand-slam winners in 2019 \u2013 hit the ground running without Warren Gatland at the helm?

Having been thrashed by Australia in the final two years ago, Heather Knight\u2019s side will be out to turn the tables. Deontay Wilder vs Tyson Fury II, 22 February, Las Vegas The confirmation came in over Christmas that we are set for a mouthwatering rematch between two of the biggest personalities in boxing. Wilder and Fury\u2019s first fight, in Los Angeles a year ago, was an epic encounter that ended in a somewhat unsatisfying draw \u2013 the return in Las Vegas promises much and this time there may even be a result, with Fury sure he can take Wilder\u2019s WBC crown inside the distance.

Not a single animal lost.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat we did with the dangerous animals \u2013 lions, tigers, orangutans \u2013 is we encouraged them to the night den, kept them calm, like nothing was happening, and we were able to protect them at that site.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe only animals we saw any signs of stress are the giraffe and zebra at a couple of points.\u201d</p> \n  <p>And the conditions are also easing. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe were putting fires out on site, a couple of hours ago it felt like armageddon,\u201d said Staples. \u201cBut right now we feel like we have got a reprieve, the wind changed and we were able to get on top of it.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-31T04:13:23.217Z\">at 4.13am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e0ac69d8f087e8308e66573\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lenore-taylor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-31T04:00:40.896Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Former journalist Peter Logue and former diplomat Zena Armstrong were at home at Coolagolite outside Cobargo early this morning, \u201cdithering about what to do\u201d according to Logue.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThen we got a phone call from a local farmer, a long term resident, at about 4.30am and he just said \u2018Get out now\u2019, so we left, and as we went outside the red glow was right behind the house, that was the fire that came over the back of us and swept through into Cobargo.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Their children and a guest found a way to drive through to Canberra. Logue and Armstrong drove to the coast to Bermagui to help defend the home of Armstrong\u2019s mother and step father.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe RFS and the police were driving around the streets of Bermagui with a loud speaker saying \u2018evacuate now, evacuate now\u2019. It was dark like night time and raining burning embers and leaves. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe evacuated the oldies down to the beach, and then we went back to try to prepare the house...but then the weather changed, the fire started its own weather system, it went from hot wind to really cold, and it started raining..and in the end the fire front didn\u2019t eventuate.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p> Logue spoke to Guardian Australia from Bermagui beach where the RFS had just given a briefing at the surf life savers\u2019 club.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe whole south coast water treatment system is down so we have to boil water, Woolworths is packed with people buying water and emergency supplies, the cafes are all closed because they\u2019ve run out of food, and there\u2019s only one way out to Narooma, but you can\u2019t get any further than there.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Logue and Armstrong don\u2019t know if there home is still standing. The fire has destroyed much of Cobargo and two residents are missing, in what could be \u201cpotential fatalities\u201d according to RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons.</p> \n  <p>Both Logue and Armstrong are musicians, organisers of the Cobargo folk festival. They have saved their musical instruments, half a dozen bottles of Clonakilla and a bottle of good Irish whisky.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are staying here for now,\u201d Logue said. \u201cIt looks like a refugee camp down here at the beach, a yuppie refugee camp, with horse floats and people staying in their cars.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pjlogue/status/1211852041179426816\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Outside the evacuation centre at Bermagui.

We had been warned that today would be bad, but the overnight fire spread exceeded the worst estimations.</p> \n  <p>The otherwise sleepy town of Moruya was soon bustling with locals and holidaymakers, dazed and concerned as we saw the giant smoke front head in our direction. People were glued to their phones, constantly refreshing the live fire map, wondering if their house was burning while we were stranded in the car parks, green spaces and the public pool of Moruya, helpless. As the sky became darker the mood soured; at one point we could see flames speed down a ridge in the distance.</p> \n  <p>But amid the gloom, there were bright spots of humanity. The pool gave out ice creams, a local Thai restaurant cooked free meals. Strangers swapped anecdotes and the latest information.</p> \n  <p>For decades, Canberrans and locals have made happy summer memories on the south coast.

Sam McPaul was the best of us.</p> \n   <p>This is devastating news and I also extend my sincere condolences to his entire family, friends and fellow brigade members.</p> \n   <p>It is an unimaginable loss and one felt by the entire country.</p> \n   <p>A further three firefighters were injured in the same incident, one severely.</p> \n   <p>Our thoughts are with these brave firefighters and their families in this difficult time. We wish those in hospital a fast and full recovery. </p> \n   <p>The firefighters were working on the Green Valley, Talmalmo Fire, approximately 70km east of Albury when extreme winds flipped their truck and a second vehicle.</p> \n   <p>They were doing what thousands of other volunteer firefighters are doing around Australia, and have been doing for months \u2013 selflessly and bravely protecting their local communities. For that, the nation is incredibly grateful.</p> \n   <p>The devastating impact of these terrible bushfires is continuing. This week, [there are] fires in South Australia and Tasmania, brutal fires in Victoria and, of course, the fires rolling on in New South Wales, many at emergency levels.</p> \n   <p>As these fires continue to rage, the response continues to be run and well-led at a state level. We will continue to provide every support to those state firefighting agencies through the Commonwealth.</p> \n   <p>In particular, through the support of the Australian Defence Force. These are well-resourced, well-coordinated, well-responded to fires.</p> \n   <p>I thank all of those who are directly involved out there on the fire grounds and the teams supporting them behind the scenes.</p> \n   <p>This will continue to be a significant effort in the days and the weeks ahead and I fear, in the months to come.</p> \n   <p>We are expecting more difficult news out of New South Wales and Victoria today as the assessments are undertaken of the terrible fires from yesterday and last night.</p> \n   <p>I am closely monitoring the situation in all states and I am receiving regular daily briefing on all emerging issues. I am also in regular contact with the premiers and fire authorities.</p> \n   <p>I have seen the impact and devastation of these fires first hand, but I have also seen communities pulling together and caring for each other with a remarkable spirit. This is the Australian way.</p> \n   <p>We have stood up and responded to these terrible disasters before and we have come through the other side. We will rebuild and we will stay strong.</p> \n   <p>I urge all Australians to continue to listen to the warnings from the authorities and take care.</p> \n   <p>To those fighting these fires; please be safe, and continue to pull together in this difficult time. Your country is behind you every step of the way.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T23:26:19.647Z\">at 11.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e0a844a8f085eda5c10fd1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-30T23:12:31.881Z\">11.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And others are taking shelter on the beach on the NSW South Coast. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nat_Edwards/status/1211778553424969728\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Never seen anything like this.

      "bodyText": "We are going to wind up the blog for now. Catastrophic conditions saw a horrendous day in Victoria and NSW. You can read a full wrap of the day\u2019s events here. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner says it is the worst fire season on record in the state. Another two people are dead in NSW. A 63-year-old man and his 29-year-old son were found dead at their property near Cobargo. A woman told police her husband and son had stayed to fight the fires. Four people are missing in Victoria and a 72-year-old man is missing at Belowra in NSW. People on the south coast of NSW from Nowra to Moruya have been warned they will lose all telecommunications tonight, including landlines, mobiles and internet. This includes hospitals. The Australian Defence Force is sending military air and sea assets to Victoria to assist with evacuations. There are significant property losses across both states but the impact won\u2019t be known until assessors can access the fire grounds. Thousands of people were forced to shelter on a jetty, waterfront, in the water and on boats and sand bars in Mallacoota, as a firefront bore down on the East Gippsland town early this morning. Terrifying scenes saw glowing red skies and pitch darkness at mid-morning. Towns across the East Gippsland region remain cut off even after the fire danger has passed, with roads, electricity and other services cut. A southerly change swept up the NSW coast late on Tuesday, moderating some fires but bringing strong gusty winds and little to no rain. Scott Morrison has extended the payments for volunteer firefighters to Queensland, and says other states are welcome to join. Fires are continuing to create their own thunderstorms, bringing lightning that is sparking new fires. More details were released about the death of the 28-year-old firefighter, Samuel McPaul, with veteran firefighters saying \u201cfreakish\u201d conditions had to be seen to be believed, with a fire tornado picking up and flipping the eight-tonne truck. Several fires are under investigation by police in both Victoria and NSW. From the NSW police: The Public Information and Inquiry Centre (PIIC) has been opened to assist members of the public in relation to bushfire information for the south coast areas. The telephone number to call is 1800 227 228. Members of the public are reminded to delay all non-essential travel in fire-affected areas to assist emergency services. Information specifically relating to the bushfires can be obtained by contacting the Bush Fire Information Line on 1800 679 737. A very quick reversal on that Sydney Morning Herald story \u2013 David Elliott is coming home. Better late than never, hey. Fires in NSW are being downgraded. The Greystanes and Charmhaven fires are now at watch and act level. There are still five emergency-level fires burning in the south. The Charmhaven fire on the NSW Central Coast is reportedly being investigated by police. Police have also released a statement about the two deaths reported earlier today. They have not released the names of the two men. Police have confirmed two men have died and a third is still unaccounted for in bushfires impacting the state\u2019s south coast. A 63-year-old man and his 29-year-old son are believed to have died overnight (Monday 30 December 2019), on their property at Wandella, about 10km north-west of Cobargo. A woman has told police she\u2019d left the property the previous evening, but her husband and son stayed behind to defend the home and farm equipment. She returned this morning and discovered their bodies. A 72-year-old man is unaccounted for at Belowra, about 50km north-west of Cobargo. \u201cWhy do we even have an emergency services minister if he is not going to be here in an emergency?\u201d The Sydney Morning Herald is quoting a few anonymous members of the NSW government, reacting to news that the state\u2019s emergency services minister, David Elliott, is not cutting short his European holiday despite what the fire commissioner says is the worst season the state has ever seen, and despite saying he would come back if the situation demanded it. Elliott\u2019s decision to go on holidays was criticised in the wake of the nationwide criticism the prime minister faced for taking his family off to Hawaii (while his office told reporters he hadn\u2019t). Morrison apologised and came back early, but according to the SMH, Elliott has more to do in London. Elliott has said he\u2019s receiving regular briefings from the RFS, and the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said today the buck stops with her and she feels completely supported. There are horrifying photos coming out of Sarsfield, just north-east of Bairnsdale in Victoria. Up to 20 houses are lost in the community. Calla Wahlquist spoke to a number of evacuees today, taking shelter in Bairnsdale. From the hill behind the makeshift campground, evacuees could see the ridges surrounding Nicholson and Sarsfield burning. Power on the NSW south coast is likely to be out for 24 hours. Authorities earlier warned that all telecommunications (landlines, mobiles and internet) would be lost tonight. \u201cEnergy and utilities have advised that due to the bushfires all power has been lost from South Nowra to Moruya and potentially beyond,\u201d NSW police said. \u201cPower is unlikely to be restored for at least 24 hours. The power outage also affects communication lines and therefore some landlines are not operating which means internet is also affected. Additionally, communication towers have been affected impacting mobile services. \u201cEnergy companies are working with RFS to gain access to safely restore services although until it is safe for workers to enter affected areas this will be delayed as they are currently impacted by bushfires.\u201d From the federal minister for natural disaster and emergency management, David Littleproud: Payments of $1000 per adult and $400 per child are now available to those worst-hit by the bushfires in the local government areas of Kangaroo Island and Mount Barker. Assistance is being provided through the Australia Government Disaster Recovery Payment (AGDRP). \u201cThis is for people whose home has been severely damaged or destroyed, who\u2019ve been seriously injured or who\u2019ve lost a family member,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cThis will help to cover the immediate needs of those worst hit, and help them get through the coming days. \u201cWe will make further assistance available to these communities if it is needed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for life to return to normal and we\u2019ll be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these communities until they\u2019re back on their feet. \u201cPeople can call the Department of Human Services to check their eligibility.\u201d An emergency warning has been issued this afternoon for a fire in Tasmania. \u201cThere is a bushfire at North East of Tower Hill,\u201d the TFS says. \u201cThe fire will put North East of Tower Hill at very high risk. This fire will be uncontrollable. Burning embers, falling on North East of Tower Hill will threaten your home before the main fire.\u201d Louis Boyle-Bryant is at the community centre in Mallacoota, which went through a pretty devastating and traumatic experience overnight and today. Thousands of people evacuated to the waterfront, onto boats in the lake, and to the community centre as the large, out-of-control fire bore down on the town. While the fire has passed, the community is still isolated. A short time ago the people sheltered there received a briefing from emergency services, who said that the immediate threat was over. Boyle-Bryant said the authorities told them there was still a residual risk from burning trees and houses, and recommended against people going to check on their homes. \u201cBut some folks have gone to check anyway, if they can get past fire lines,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the campground only sustained minor damage so a lot of people from the wharf have gone back to their tents/caravans. \u201cI\u2019ll stay in the community centre again tonight. Bit shaken and don\u2019t want to set up tents again.\u201d Marine wind warnings for the rest of today: Gale warning for the following areas: Sydney closed waters, Hunter coast, Sydney coast and Illawarra coast Strong wind warning for the following areas: Byron coast, Coffs coast, Macquarie coast, Batemans coast and Eden coast Wind warnings for tomorrow: Strong wind warning for the following areas: Coffs coast, Macquarie coast, Hunter coast and Sydney coast In the last hour or so the strong southerly change has crossed the Currowan fireground on the NSW south coast. This emergency-level fire is burning between Nowra in the north, Braidwood in the west, and Batemans Bay in the south. There has been a significant increase in fire activity south of the Kings Highway to the west of Nelligen, the RFS says. The fire merged with the Tianjara fire in the Morton national park to the south-west of Nowra, and the Charleys Forest fire has grown along its western flank. Devastating scenes inside the fireground at Mogo where several buildings have burned down, including houses and the Aboriginal Land Council. All telecommunications \u2013 mobile and landline phones and internet \u2013 will be lost between Nowra and Moruya tonight, NSW police have just warned. This will also affect hospitals in the area. The federal government has agreed to supply military vessels to Victoria for evacuations in coastal communities where people are trapped. The ADF will send Black Hawks, Chinooks, fixed wing aircraft and navy vessels for firefighting support and evacuation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got fires burning from the Queensland border all the way down to the Victorian border, across the great dividing range,\u201d says Fitzsimmons. There have been multiple challenges, he says, noting that today conditions didn\u2019t allow for the flying of some aerial support craft. \u201cWe are expecting a return to more hot dangerous and difficult conditions \u2026 and we can expect some fairly widespread severe fire danger ratings.\u201d He notes the dry landscape, the \u201cmoisture depleted\u201d landscape, in a state which is \u201c100% drought-affected\u201d. There\u2019s been a significant number of pyroconvective activity and the tragic consequences of that. \u201cWe have seen now confirmed eight civilian fatalities, three firefighter fatalities, and we have grave concerns for another civilian down in the southeast of NSW,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have seen over 900 homes destroyed and over 3.6m hectares of country burnt so far this season. We have still months to go of summer. Absolutely, this is up to be one of the worst, if not the worst fire season we have experienced here in NSW.\u201d RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons is giving an update from its Sydney headquarters. Here are the main points: There are more than 100 fires burning in the state, more than half uncontained: 2,200 firefighters are in the field. The southerly change is currently at Nowra and is expected in the Sydney basin between 6pm and 7pm. Ahead of that, the WNW winds are up to about 70 km/h, but the southerly is also bringing damaging gusts up to 80km, although it will lose strength as it moves up the coast. That cold front is halving temperatures in some areas. Batemans Bay and other areas \u2013 particularly adjacent to the coast \u2013 are seeing some moderation once the change goes through, but the southern ranges are not benefiting from it. Along the coastal strip from Nowra towards Bega, \u201cthere\u2019s communities all the way along there that are exposed and vulnerable\u201d as well as inland, across the Snowy Mountains plains there are a number of problematic fires, and into the west and south at the cross-border Green Valley fire. The Green Valley fire is expected to move into the Kosciuszko national park. The Charmhaven fire is burning east-northeasterly, and is spreading towards more populated areas in the Woongarrah area. Fire crews are hoping to get it under control overnight. There are significant power challenges and disruptions to utilities in fire affected areas. There are dangerous trees and fires burning on both sides of multiple arterial roads. The RFS received about 68 applications for fire ban exemptions (including the Sydney NYE fireworks). They said yes to about 30. The Charmhaven fire on the NSW Central Coast is a new one today. It\u2019s an emergency level blaze and has destroyed at least 83 hectares already. Crews are on the scene working to protect property and people in Mona, Arizona and Allinga Hiawatha Road, were earlier told to take shelter because it is too late to leave. The Bureau of Meteorology says thunderstorms could make the NSW bushfire situation even worse, adding to soaring temperatures and gusty winds, AAP reports. Thunderstorms forecast to develop in NSW could make an already dangerous bushfire situation even worse, the bureau says. Bureau of Meteorology NSW state manager Jane Golding says the state is experiencing heatwave conditions on Tuesday with soaring temperatures, gusty winds and smoke pollution in many areas. Thunderstorms could exacerbate the situation later on if lightning strikes spark new fires, Golding told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cOver the course of today we are expecting general thunderstorms to develop \u2013 they are going to cause a few problems around the fire grounds,\u201d she said. Lightning strikes sparked more than a dozen blazes in Victoria\u2019s alpine region on Tuesday while thunderstorms have started spot fires in Tasmania. A southerly change sweeping up the NSW coast would drop temperatures in the evening, with bushfire conditions forecast to ease on Wednesday, according to the bureau. \u201cIn much of the state we are expecting markedly cooler conditions tomorrow,\u201d Golding said. \u201cBut up in the northwest we are still expecting really warm temperatures and increased fire dangers.\u201d In the Aboriginal community of Lake Tyers, about 35 people chose to stay on country when they came under threat from the East Gippsland fires, NITV reports. \u201cWe\u2019re a small community of 250 Aboriginal people, 46 houses out there. There\u2019s roughly 35 community [members] who have stayed,\u201d traditional owner Kerry Tregonning said. \u201cMost of them were born out here, they have no transport, some of them are hooked up to oxygen, there\u2019s a lot of little things.\u201d There is an endless stream of jaw-dropping photos and videos on social media today. An eerie darkness has settled over the New South Wales south coast town of Huskisson, as bushfires in the surrounding areas close in around the town. By 3pm the town was entirely covered by a thick haze that made it feel more like 8pm. Beaches that usually at this time of day would be crowded with tourists are abandoned, and at the main pub in town people watched nervously as ash fell from the sky and the last sunlight disappeared behind the smoky haze. Many people have already left, but at about lunchtime authorities closed the Princes Highway and the Rural Fire Service sent text messages warning visitors to seek shelter as the fire arrived. Suffice to say New Year\u2019s Eve plans have taken a hit. The fireworks had already been cancelled, but when we drove past the beach where the celebrations are usually held about 20 minutes ago it was completely empty. At the apartment where I\u2019m staying we\u2019re all gathered around the air purifier and watching the rolling updates on ABC 24. In NSW there are eight emergency level fires and nine watch and act level fires. Seven of the emergency fires are in the south of the state, and one is on the Central Coast at Charmhaven. In Victoria there are eight emergency warnings, all in the East Gippsland region except for one east of Albury (which has come from over the border in NSW where it is referred to by a different name) Throughout the afternoon and evening we\u2019ll do our best to bring you the latest on all of them. Journalist and author Melissa Pouliot is in Wallagoot, near Tathra, living through her third \u201ctoo close for comfort\u201d experience with bushfires in a decade. \u201cWe are packed, well prepared and informed,\u201d she tweeted. After the March 2018 fires in Tathra, she organised the Book Love for Tathra appeal to return books to the 70 local families who lost their homes and home libraries in that fire. She says she was \u201calso part of the black Saturday fires. I was living just out of Horsham, one kilometre from where that fire started, which destroyed Horsham golf club and surrounding houses\u201d. This is Helen Davidson taking over the blog for the rest of the day. The RACV says ongoing mobile coverage issues are affecting callouts for RACV emegency roadside assistance. This applies to Mallacoota, Bairnsdale, Orbost, Lakes Entrance, Bruthen and Corryong. Members needing emergency assistance should contact 000. The prime minister Scott Morrison has just announced the payments for volunteer firefighters will be extended to Queensland. It matches the payments offered to NSW last week. Morrison says it\u2019s available to any state that asks for it. In that press conference, Victorian emergency commissioner Andrew Crisp also went into more detail about what the defence force would do to help. One of their jobs will be to undertake \u201cinitial impact assessments\u201d throughout East Gippsland. That will help the CFA count the cost and damage of the fires. \u201cWe expect those additional Australian defence force people to be on the ground tomorrow working with our Metropolitan Fire Brigade,\u201d he said. Another role is still under discussion, but the ADF could help support isolated communities, with new airplanes and helicopters brought in. \u201cWe\u2019ve formalised two requests through Emergency Management Australia to the Australian defence force,\u201d Crisp said. \u201c\u201dWe\u2019ve also been working through what some first support from the ADF could look like. \u201cWe will continue to work through that with the ADF and they\u2019ve assured us they\u2019ll provide whatever support they can\u201d. It has been pointed out that the NSW emergency services minister, David Elliott, announced on Friday he would be going on holiday to Europe. He promised he would receive two briefings a day, and would return should the bushfire situation \u201cdemand it\u201d. At a press conference on Tuesday, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, deflected questions about the minister\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cAt the end of the day, the buck stops with me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the premier.\u201d Berejiklian noted the acting minister, the prisons minister Anthony Roberts, was with her. \u201cI feel completely supported,\u201d she said. Elliott announced his holiday shortly after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, apologised for flying out to Hawaii during the bushfire crisis. Morrison subsequently returned home early. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, returned from holiday yesterday as fires burned out of control in the state\u2019s east. Two people were confirmed dead at Cobargo \u2013 believed to be father and son \u2013 and grave fears are held for a third west of Narooma. On Tuesday, Berejilkian would not be drawn on Elliott\u2019s role. \u201cI ask everybody to focus on what\u2019s important \u2013 protecting life and property.\u201d Guardian Australia has contacted Elliott\u2019s office. CFA chief officer Steve Warrington has some \u201crelatively good news\u201d for Mallacoota. \u201cThe wind change has gone through and the major fire front has now bypassed that town,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand there was a public cheer down at the jetty when that was announced. So that is good news for us. \u201cBut having said that, there are still active fires in that area and they\u2019re still actively extinguishing houses that have burnt down on the outskirts of Mallacoota.\u201d He also adds that the town now remains isolated, which is a concern. It\u2019s a similar state in Corryong \u2013 the main fire front has passed but the town is still isolated and ringed by fire. Victoria\u2019s emergency commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is speaking now. He confirms that there are at least 43 buildings destroyed in East Gippsland. That\u2019s 19 structures at Sarsfield, and 24 structures at Buchan. That counting was done by helicopter, and there will be more confirmed destroyed properties to come. \u201cBecause this has been done by the air, it\u2019s difficult at times to determine whether it\u2019s actually a house or a large shed or an outbuilding,\u201d Crisp says. \u201cWe still have a dynamic and dangerous fire condition. We still have eight emergency warnings in the state. \u201cTo demonstrate how dynamic it still is, there\u2019s been a band of lightning come through the state in recent times. And we\u2019ve got about 12-15 new fires that have started in the Jamieson/Halcourt area.\u201d Berejiklian says she supports Sydney\u2019s fireworks going ahead tonight. She acknowledges the \u201cmixed feelings\u201d on the issue, but says \u201con balance I understand the decision to proceed, and on balance I support that decision\u201d. \u201cI think no matter where you are, up and down the coast, inland or in the larger cities, including Sydney, all our thoughts are with the people who are suffering.\u201d The fireworks \u201cdon\u2019t take away from our empathy for people who are doing it tough\u201d. On those earlier reports by Sky News that NSW transport minister Andrew Constance was missing, Berejiklian says it was a communication issue. The ABC later contacted Constance by phone and confirmed he was OK. \u201cUnfortunately, for many people in southern New South Wales, telecommunications is an issue at the moment there,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cThere are a number of phone towers damaged. There are a number of people who don\u2019t have phone reception. \u201cBecause of the damage to phone towers and also lack of reception in some of the remote communities, it is difficult to contact everybody at this time.\u201d RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons also spoke and said there will be a \u201cheavy toll\u201d in terms of property damage. \u201cWe need to brace ourselves for a considerable number of properties, a considerable number of homes that are likely to have been damaged and or destroyed right across these eight emergency warning fire areas, given the extraordinary nature of the fire behaviour and fire spread today.\u201d Police found the two men deceased in a house in the west of Cobargo, says NSW police deputy commissioner Gary Worboys. The two men were residents of the town, and were father and son. They are still trying to access a house west of Narooma, where a man is missing. \u201cUnfortunately we think the news in that house will not be good either,\u201d Worboys says. An elderly man was reported to police as living in that house. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now and has confirmed that two people have died in Cobargo. \u201cIt\u2019s been confirmed today that there are two deceased persons in Cobargo,\u201d she said. \u201cThe police have confirmed that. A third person is missing with grave concerns for their safety, west of Narooma. Our message is please follow instructions.\u201d Our photo editor, Jessica Hromas, has put together this composite showing the main street of Cobargo, before and after the fires. Earlier today, there were grave fears for the Mogo Zoo in NSW, only a few kilometres from the out-of-control fires that are currently destroying homes in Batemans Bay. None of the animals had time to be evacuated, and the zoo has Australia\u2019s largest collection of primates, as well as lions, tigers and zebras. Just now zoo director Chad Staples has said all the animals are safe. Those that were small enough \u2013 monkeys and red pandas \u2013 were scooped up and taken inside. \u201cRight now in my house there\u2019s animals of all description in all the different rooms,\u201d Staples told the ABC. \u201cDue to the amazing staff here, and a well executed plan, no one is hurt. Not a single animal lost.\u201d \u201cWhat we did with the dangerous animals \u2013 lions, tigers, orangutans \u2013 is we encouraged them to the night den, kept them calm, like nothing was happening, and we were able to protect them at that site. \u201cThe only animals we saw any signs of stress are the giraffe and zebra at a couple of points.\u201d And the conditions are also easing. \u201cWe were putting fires out on site, a couple of hours ago it felt like armageddon,\u201d said Staples. \u201cBut right now we feel like we have got a reprieve, the wind changed and we were able to get on top of it.\u201d Former journalist Peter Logue and former diplomat Zena Armstrong were at home at Coolagolite outside Cobargo early this morning, \u201cdithering about what to do\u201d according to Logue. \u201cThen we got a phone call from a local farmer, a long term resident, at about 4.30am and he just said \u2018Get out now\u2019, so we left, and as we went outside the red glow was right behind the house, that was the fire that came over the back of us and swept through into Cobargo.\u201d Their children and a guest found a way to drive through to Canberra. Logue and Armstrong drove to the coast to Bermagui to help defend the home of Armstrong\u2019s mother and step father. \u201cThe RFS and the police were driving around the streets of Bermagui with a loud speaker saying \u2018evacuate now, evacuate now\u2019. It was dark like night time and raining burning embers and leaves. \u201cWe evacuated the oldies down to the beach, and then we went back to try to prepare the house...but then the weather changed, the fire started its own weather system, it went from hot wind to really cold, and it started raining..and in the end the fire front didn\u2019t eventuate.\u201d Logue spoke to Guardian Australia from Bermagui beach where the RFS had just given a briefing at the surf life savers\u2019 club. \u201cThe whole south coast water treatment system is down so we have to boil water, Woolworths is packed with people buying water and emergency supplies, the cafes are all closed because they\u2019ve run out of food, and there\u2019s only one way out to Narooma, but you can\u2019t get any further than there.\u201d Logue and Armstrong don\u2019t know if there home is still standing. The fire has destroyed much of Cobargo and two residents are missing, in what could be \u201cpotential fatalities\u201d according to RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Both Logue and Armstrong are musicians, organisers of the Cobargo folk festival. They have saved their musical instruments, half a dozen bottles of Clonakilla and a bottle of good Irish whisky. \u201cWe are staying here for now,\u201d Logue said. \u201cIt looks like a refugee camp down here at the beach, a yuppie refugee camp, with horse floats and people staying in their cars.\u201d And quite shocking footage of a shopping centre filled with flames in Batemans Bay. Rapid escalation of the Currowan fire near Sussex Inlet in NSW. ABC reporter Selby Stewart said observers \u201chad to flee\u201d as a spot fire \u201cbecame an inferno in minutes\u201d. Albanese has also criticised the City of Sydney\u2019s fireworks scheduled tonight. \u201cI understand how important the fireworks are for their economy, but I just think at a time like this \u2013 I\u2019m not in a position to judge \u2013 but I think that it\u2019s really problematic that it\u2019s going ahead. That\u2019s a decision for others.\u201d When asked about Labor\u2019s support for coal, he says \u201cnow is not the time to answer questions like that\u201d. Asked when the time is, Albanese says \u201cI have been talking about climate change ... The truth is that simplistic slogans won\u2019t solve this ... we need to respond to climate change with serious policy, not with slogans.\u201d The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, is speaking now from the Woodford folk festival, where he is about to give a speech paying tribute to Bob Hawke. He has paid tribute to Samuel McPaul, the volunteer firefighter who died last night, and says the fire is a national crisis that \u201crequires a national response from the government\u201d. \u201cWe are seeing in the very least dozens, but perhaps hundreds of homes lost... This fire does not respect state boundaries. And I again say this is a national issue. This is a national emergency. And it requires a national response from the government.\u201d Albanese adds that people need to listen to the warnings of their local fire authority. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of how important the ABC is and the role that it plays in keeping Australians safe,\u201d he says. Reports of homes lost in Batemans Bay, NSW. Up north, closer to Nowra, residents near Sussex Inlet are evacuating towards the NSW coast, as fires are attacking the Princes Highway in both north and south directions. Meanwhile, back in Victoria: Photos coming in of houses now on fire in Mallacoota. Despite some speculation in the last few minutes, the NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, is not missing in the fires. Just 10 minutes ago, Sky News tweeted that Constance was \u201cunaccounted for\u201d in the NSW fires. But the ABC in Canberra then confirmed they had just spoken to the minister. Reporter Jordan Hayne said: \u201cI just spoke with Andrew Constance, he is not interested in speaking to the media, but confirmed he is ok for now at least.\u201d Here\u2019s the scene in Cobargo, NSW, where the main street has been ravaged by fire and two people are missing. On ABC Radio Gippsland we\u2019ve just heard from a local man, Graham. \u201cWe saw a big burst of very big flames in Shady Gully,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I speak to you I\u2019m looking across Coull\u2019s Inlet and there are big flames\u2026 and they would be impacting houses\u2026 Oh wow, that\u2019s not good at all.\u201d Graham was looking across the centre of town, and said the people on the jetty would be able to see what he\u2019s seeing. In Tasmania, there are fears that homes have been lost in fires that flared to emergency level yesterday and continue today. The temperature hit 40C in the state on Monday, and the Pelham fire, 50km north of Hobart, reached emergency. Today cooler conditions allowed firefighters to bring it under control. \u201cSeventy per cent of the fire ground has been assessed. We\u2019ve got some structural losses,\u201d the TFS chief officer, Chris Arnol, said. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if any homes have been lost. It could be sheds, it could be homes, we don\u2019t know. Access is difficult with that fire, with smoke conditions and some power infrastructure down.\u201d Arnol said a \u201csignificant\u201d number of structures in the area had been saved. Dry lightning sparked both fires, with the Bureau of Meteorology recording more than 400 ground strikes. Kate Bruton and her family experienced how unsafe it was at Swan Reach first-hand. They were staying with Bruton\u2019s mother at Cabbage Tree for Christmas but decided to evacuate yesterday when they saw the columns of smoke from the Barmouth Spur and W Tree fires. \u201cWe stopped at Orbost first and Orbost was full at the evacuation centre, and it was the same at Lakes Entrance,\u201d Bruton said. It looked like \u201carmageddon,\u201d she said. \u201cI have been in bushfires all my life... it was unimaginable.\u201d They were advised to drive on to Bairnsdale but got stuck when the Princes Highway closed both ahead and behind them at Swan Reach. The closure was not reported on the VicEmergency or VicTraffic app until after they were stuck. They parked the caravan near a river and watched embers fall around them, but luckily the road opened and they made it to Bairnsdale. Everyone at the park had been friendly and helping each other, Bruton said. \u201cAs horrible as this is, it is nice.\u201d Hundreds of people, both locals and tourists, evacuated from Lakes Entrance spent the night at Howitt Park. It is not an official evacuation point, but many locals told Guardian Australia they were not sure where the official evacuation centre was. Cars were parked bumper to bumper overnight but most had gone by midday, with people taking advantage of the brief window in which the Princes Highway was open to get back to their homes. Among those who remain are Kelly Lane and her 10-year-old son, Connor. They left their home in Swan Reach, which is just over halfway between Lakes Entrance and Bairnsdale, late yesterday when their fire advice went from a watch and act to an emergency alert. The call to leave came from a local man who was driving down the street in his tractor bellowing at residents to evacuate. Lane bought a tent this morning \u2013 they didn\u2019t have time last night and another evacuee said Kmart had sold out of tents \u2013 and plan to stay at Howitt Park again tonight. \u201cIt is still unsafe around my place,\u201d Lane said. This photo from Mallacoota is being widely shared on social media. Taken by a resident, it shows a family out on a boat escaping the fire, in the middle of the day. And read this fuller report on the situation in Mallacoota from Helen Davidson. People reported hearing gas bottles explode as the fire front reached the town, and the sound of sirens telling people to get in the water. The CFA incident controller Ben Rankin has just been on ABC Radio in East Gippsland. He says that fire is moving around to Orbost, and that in Mallacoota there \u201chave been quite a number of houses impacted\u201d. \u201cIt is not a day to relax at all,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cIt is a day to adhere to the warnings that are coming out.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, confirmed on Tuesday morning he had requested Australian Defence Force assistance as fires burned throughout the state\u2019s east, threatening homes and lives. He said he had spoken by text message with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to discuss additional support, such as the use of the navy to help provide food, water and power to isolated communities. \u201cWe\u2019ve made some requests to the (Australian Defence Force) for their support, both in terms of making damage assessments but also some of these isolated communities can be accessed by sea,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a range of plans in place ourselves but there may be ways the ADF can support us.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a prospect of whatever ADF support that can be provided we\u2019ll be happy to use it. And we\u2019re having detailed discussions with ADF to discuss how to best use their resources.\u201d Asked what form the additional military assistance might take and whether naval supply ships might be involved, Andrews said: \u201cThat type of thing. I wouldn\u2019t be specific to the point of ruling anything out. \u201cThere\u2019s some choppers for instance, they\u2019ve got some aircraft that are bigger. They\u2019ve got a range of things that they can support us with.\u201d Victoria has also asked for 70 firefighters from Canada and the United States, Andrews confirmed. Matt Manning is out on a boat, 3km from Mallacoota, waiting out the fires. He tells me there are about 30 boats out there with him, his partner, their two friends, and his dog. Most of them are locals. \u201cI packed the boat and prepared the boat yesterday morning. I left it tied up in the water ready to bail, and we sat it out \u2013 we were camping in the foreshore camp park. We sat it out hour by hour, and about one o\u2019clock decided to go down to the boat until we decided to bail out to the lake. \u201cThe glow in the sky was just unreal. We decided to pull the pin at about three o\u2019clock. We\u2019re pretty safe here, hopefully we don\u2019t get any hot embers. There\u2019s a lot of debris and ash but so far there\u2019s no hot embers. Winds about 30-40 knots coming from the south. \u201cI\u2019ve got two mates who stayed at the camp park, they didn\u2019t want to come with us. They said they\u2019re fine, they\u2019re country boys and have fought a few fires. I spoke to them about 10 minutes ago, and they\u2019re fine. A few tents have gone up.\u201d Barry Wear, who is camped in a caravan outside the Bairnsdale relief centre, has just heard some good news. He lives at Sarsfield, one of the communities that Daniel Andrews confirmed was hardest hit by the bushfires. About 20 houses have been lost, Wear says. But, as of this morning, his house is not one of them. \u201cI was sure last night that I had lost my house but this morning a neighbour knocked on my door and said my house was safe,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how. My house, which is cedar, and my shed with all my tools in it are still standing, but my garage \u2013 well it\u2019s really a machinery shed \u2013 which is metal, that melted.\u201d Wear lives on High Street in Sarsfield and said he had been told by those who remained that all the houses on their street were safe. Others were not so lucky. Heggars Road was heavily impacted, he says. Wear said he would not return home until it was safe. Fires are still burning around the town. \u201cI just brought the essentials with me,\u201d he says, which includes two dogs and three guitars. \u201cI have enough food in the fridge and two casks of wine. Well, one \u2013 I finished one last night.\u201d Along with thousands of other Canberrans, I am holidaying on the NSW south coast \u2013 as I have done ever year since I can remember. At 6am I was woken by a text to evacuate. We fled south to Moruya, with nearby Mogo \u2013 perhaps 5km from the sea \u2013 alight. We had been warned that today would be bad, but the overnight fire spread exceeded the worst estimations. The otherwise sleepy town of Moruya was soon bustling with locals and holidaymakers, dazed and concerned as we saw the giant smoke front head in our direction. People were glued to their phones, constantly refreshing the live fire map, wondering if their house was burning while we were stranded in the car parks, green spaces and the public pool of Moruya, helpless. As the sky became darker the mood soured; at one point we could see flames speed down a ridge in the distance. But amid the gloom, there were bright spots of humanity. The pool gave out ice creams, a local Thai restaurant cooked free meals. Strangers swapped anecdotes and the latest information. For decades, Canberrans and locals have made happy summer memories on the south coast. Now we are stuck in a nightmare. Apocalyptic scenes in Batemans Bay on the NSW south coast. Residents huddled on the beach similar to Mallacoota in Victoria. Fitzsimmons also says that fires are stretching all the way from Nowra to the Victorian border. And the southerly change coming will make things worse, spreading fires \u2013 previously heading east \u2013 in a northerly direction. This poses \u201can additional threat\u201d to populations, he says. The scope of these fires is huge. \u201cAnywhere from Nowra down to the Victorian border, right out to places like Tumut and Tumbarumba, across the ranges \u2013 we\u2019re seeing aggressive and dangerous fire behaviour,\u201d Fitzsimmons says. This is Naaman Zhou taking over the blog from Luke Henriques-Gomes, who has done some incredible work today. In that press conference, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, also confirmed there was \u201csignificant impact, damage and destruction\u201d on the NSW south coast, including schools hit by fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fire impacting onto communities, people\u2019s homes and other infrastructure,\u201d he said, in towns like Cobargo, Broulee, Mogo and Fishermans Paradise. \u201cWe\u2019ve had reports of schools impacted. We\u2019ve had reports of businesses and some of the small town centres being impacted by these fires.\u201d Shane Fitzsimmons is asked if this is the worst bushfire season on record for New South Wales. He replies: \u201cYes. Absolutely.\u201d Fitzsimmons says there are three people unaccounted for on the south coast. That is two people at Cobargo and one at Belowra. These are \u201cpotential fatalities\u201d and it is believed that these people were \u201cimpacted by the fire\u201d. It is not yet safe to access the scene and so authorities cannot provide more information. Fitzsimmons says NSW authorities have no plans for evacuations by water at this stage but they are watching the situation. Some updates from people on the ground in Mallacoota. And this was posted a little earlier \u2013 and it involves a lot of swearing. From the Victorian premier\u2019s press conference earlier. Fitzsimmons says there is a fire burning right across the Princes Highway towards Batemans Bay. We have been seeing some very concerning images coming out of that popular holiday spot. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, is addressing the media. There are eight fires burning at emergency level right now, he says. The most impacted areas, according to reports, are Cobargo, Broulee to Mogo and Fishermans Paradise. More from the Cobargo area. Meanwhile, in NSW, there are some concerning images from Bateman\u2019s Bay. Here is what we know so far. 16 fires are burning at emergency level across Australia, eight in Victoria and eight in NSW, with the entire East Gippsland region under an emergency alert. One firefighter has died overnight, and others injured, in a \u201cfreakish weather event\u201d near Albury, described as a \u201cfire tornado\u201d that overturned a 10-tonne truck on flat, stable ground. In Victoria, four people are missing, and premier Daniel Andrews said authorities \u201chave real fears for their safety\u201d. 4,000 residents have been evacuated from the town of Mallacoota and are sheltering on the foreshore, as the firefront hit properties this morning. Photos taken from 9am showed the sky pitch black. Victoria\u2019s emergency services commissioner, Andrew Crisp, confirmed \u201csignificant property losses across all of East Gippsland\u201d. 5,700 homes are without power in East Gippsland, and more than 200,000ha have been burned. 200 new fires started on Monday, and 60 new fires started from midnight until now. These conditions were worse than predicted, and the bureau of meteorology will be updating its forecast to be worse than originally thought. In NSW, residents of Cobargo were evacuated as the firefront reached the town and impacted homes. People in bushfire prone areas between Batemans Bay and Bega, and also the south coast town of Tathra, have also been told to evacuate. Robert Jackson, and his mother and sister, left his 15-acre farm at Bumberrah late Monday after repeated calls from friends and family telling him to get out. \u201cEventually I thought: fine! I\u2019m leaving! You can stop calling me. \u201cWith him he brought five chickens, two kittens, an adult cat, three Jack Russell terriers, and two cattle dogs. The whole group camped out together across two Land Rovers and a small tent outside the Bairnsdale relief centre. Hundreds of people spent the night inside. \u201cThe chickens seem to be happy, they are still laying eggs,\u201d he said.As of 11am, they have laid three legs.\u201d He has heard from neighbours that the fire, which significantly impacted Bumberrah, skipped over their place. He plans to return once the road is open. While the focus today has been on the emergencies in Victoria and NSW, there is also a fire threat in Tasmania, where firefighters worked through the night to protect about 20 properties. This video was posted on Facebook about 11am. Taken by a resident and sent to their neighbour who has posted it online. Crisp says there have been 200,000ha burnt or burning across East Gippsland. Separately, it\u2019s been reported there are about 20,000 homes without power in Victoria. Crisp says there wasn\u2019t an evacuation order for Mallacoota (while other towns were evacuated over Sunday and Monday). They couldn\u2019t move out of the town because of fires in the west, and to the north-east in NSW. Andrews says the Victorian government has requested assistance from 70 fire fighters from the US and Canada. Andrews says he has asked the prime minister for assistance from the defence force this morning. The two spoke via text message today. Warrington is asked what will happen to those who did not evacuate to the foreshore at Mallacoota. He says people in the town were briefed and knew that they were to move to the beach when sirens sounded. That occurred at 8am. Fire crews will not be sent to isolated communities, he says. Those that did not move to the beach were \u201ctaking their chances\u201d. There are homes being lost in and around Mallacoota \u201cas we speak\u201d. A number of homes have been lost in Mallacoota, but the town is still under attack, CFA chief officer Steve Warrington says. The town is \u201cpitch black\u201d but three strike teams are standing side by side to protect those who have evacuated to the beach front. \u201cIt is quite scary in that community. The community right now is under threat but we will hold our line and they will be safe and protected.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews says there are four people in the state who are unaccounted for. \u201cAnd of course we have fears for their safety,\u201d he says. Crisp says there has been \u201csignificant property\u201d losses across East Gippsland. He names towns including Sarsfield, Buchan and Gelantipy. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews says there are four people in the state who are unaccounted for. \u201cAnd of course we have fears for their safety,\u201d he says. He declines to say where but notes they were in active fire environments. Crisp turns to Mallacoota, which is he says is facing an ember attack right now. He confirms there are 4,000 people on the beach who are being protected by firefighters there. Crisp pays respect to NSW RFS volunteer Samuel McPaul, who died yesterday. He says in the north-east of Victoria, there have been property losses in at a town near Kooriyong. Kooriyong is being impacted by the fire which ran 30km last night. The Victorian emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, is addressing media. He says there were 200 new fires yesterday, and 60 new fires that started after midnight. More than 200 horses spent the night in Bairnsdale saleyards last night while their worried owners camped at the nearby evacuation centre or found other places to lay their swags in town. Melanie McCann and her 15-year-old daughter Gabrielle spent the night on the floor of her workplace in town while fire threatened their property at Nicholson. They moved three horses into the saleyards at 11.30am on Monday and helped a neighbour move theirs. They learned from that same neighbour this morning that their house had been spared. \u201cWe came into town ourselves about 4.30pm and my husband came in at 6pm ... no point putting anyone in danger if they don\u2019t need to be. The saleyards have been providing free board, and in some cases feed, for displaced stock for several days. Some horses have come from as far away as Omeo. There are cattle, goats, sheep, and even a watchful maremma in the yards. Johanna Toohey moved four of her horses off her property just north of Bairnsdale, in the path of the Barmouth Spur Fire, on Saturday. They came to the saleyards on Sunday. She spent the night on the floor of a rental property she owns in Bairnsdale, which just happened to be vacant. \u201cThere was no furniture, no power, but it was somewhere to be safe.\u201d An irate sheep, which she also brought into town along with her dog and cats, spent the night bellowing in the backyard. She returned to get them at 4.30pm, when the column of smoke was looming over the town, then turned the sprinklers on and left. She packed so quickly that she had to make a late-night trip to Kmart to buy underwear. \u201cMy home is safe,\u201d she said. \u201cI have got no water left because I used it all ... there is not a drop of water in the house. This photo was posted about an hour ago at Cobargo in the Bega Valley, NSW. There are now seven emergency warnings in place in NSW and eight in Victoria. Samuel McPaul\u2019s colleagues have paid tribute to a \u201cbeautiful young man\u201d who loved \u201cputting the community first\u201d. McPaul, who leaves behind a wife and child due in May, was a skilled mechanic and avid basketballer, who worked as a coach for local kids. \u201cHe did everything for the right reasons,\u201d an RFS spokesman said. \u201cHis mother Christine is a wonderful woman who raised him and raised a really good son there. \u201cHe gave a lot of his time to basketball in the area. He was a representative player for Wagga and was actually, at the time, undertaking a fair bit of training and coaching for the kids. Basically, he was putting the community first and what we saw yesterday was just a very unfortunate price to pay for putting the community first.\u201d \u201cHe had a degree in biology or zoology, and then decided to take his hand to being a mechanic,\u201d his RFS colleagues said. \u201cHe was a very good mechanic that worked for one of our service providers in Culcairn. And it\u2019s a sad day, when you think about it, Sam probably serviced one of those trucks that he was on and it would have been in good order. \u201cIt is a sad thing for the community, the community of Culcairn, Holbrook and even the greater community.\u201d Two emergency warnings issued in NSW over the past half hour. Firefighters in Albury have provided more details on the tragic loss of Samuel McPaul, the volunteer firefighter and soon-to-be father, who died last night. An RFS spokesman said the truck was hit by a \u201cfreakish weather event that had to be seen to be believed\u201d, best described as a \u201cfire tornado\u201d. McPaul and his crew were sent to a fire in the upper Murray, started by a lightning strike, that grew so large it created its own weather system, known as a pyrocumulonimbus. \u201cThat cloud became very unstable,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt had a height of around about 8,000 metres and unfortunately, it appears to have collapsed during yesterday\u2019s deteriorating weather, causing erratic fire behaviour and erratic winds at the foot of the fire in all directions. \u201cWe had a crew working in a paddock that were trying to muster up some cattle that were caught in the corner of the paddock. They were only 50 metres from a gate that they entered and they were on flat ground with very low fuel. \u201cThe crew decided to move away from that area and, quite unexpectedly, very suddenly, they experienced extreme winds, and what could only be described as a fire tornado, that lifted the back of the truck, fully inverted it and landed it on its roof, trapping three people, three crew that is, and unfortunately, one of them fatally.\u201d The conditions were so \u201cfreakish\u201d, that veteran firefighters couldn\u2019t believe what they had seen, the spokesman said. \u201cSam was a 28-year-old firefighter ... He was trained and doing everything right on the day when something went wrong and it\u2019s just incredibly unfortunate what happened. \u201cThe driver was a veteran captain of 35 years-plus experience and after speaking with him in hospital last night, he said the ground he was on was safe. \u201cHe thought he was in the right spot, and just this freakish weather event, that would have to be seen to be believed, and even then other veteran firefighters don\u2019t believe what they saw, engulfed that vehicle with flame, and strong winds and literally picked up an 8-tonne truck and flipped it over.\u201d Updates from Mallacoota. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has issued this statement on the death of 28-year-old volunteer firefighter Samuel McPaul. Last night we tragically lost another volunteer firefighter, in terrible circumstances in Jingellic, New South Wales. Sam McPaul was a brave firefighter and a member of the Morven Rural Fire Brigade. In one of the cruellest developments, Sam and his wife Megan are due to have their first baby next year. I cannot imagine the terrible sense of loss and grief that Sam\u2019s family are now feeling. I have spoken to Megan to extend my deepest sympathies and our love and support at this terrible time and express that same sentiment on behalf of the entire country. Sam McPaul was the best of us. This is devastating news and I also extend my sincere condolences to his entire family, friends and fellow brigade members. It is an unimaginable loss and one felt by the entire country. A further three firefighters were injured in the same incident, one severely. Our thoughts are with these brave firefighters and their families in this difficult time. We wish those in hospital a fast and full recovery. The firefighters were working on the Green Valley, Talmalmo Fire, approximately 70km east of Albury when extreme winds flipped their truck and a second vehicle. They were doing what thousands of other volunteer firefighters are doing around Australia, and have been doing for months \u2013 selflessly and bravely protecting their local communities. For that, the nation is incredibly grateful. The devastating impact of these terrible bushfires is continuing. This week, [there are] fires in South Australia and Tasmania, brutal fires in Victoria and, of course, the fires rolling on in New South Wales, many at emergency levels. As these fires continue to rage, the response continues to be run and well-led at a state level. We will continue to provide every support to those state firefighting agencies through the Commonwealth. In particular, through the support of the Australian Defence Force. These are well-resourced, well-coordinated, well-responded to fires. I thank all of those who are directly involved out there on the fire grounds and the teams supporting them behind the scenes. This will continue to be a significant effort in the days and the weeks ahead and I fear, in the months to come. We are expecting more difficult news out of New South Wales and Victoria today as the assessments are undertaken of the terrible fires from yesterday and last night. I am closely monitoring the situation in all states and I am receiving regular daily briefing on all emerging issues. I am also in regular contact with the premiers and fire authorities. I have seen the impact and devastation of these fires first hand, but I have also seen communities pulling together and caring for each other with a remarkable spirit. This is the Australian way. We have stood up and responded to these terrible disasters before and we have come through the other side. We will rebuild and we will stay strong. I urge all Australians to continue to listen to the warnings from the authorities and take care. To those fighting these fires; please be safe, and continue to pull together in this difficult time. Your country is behind you every step of the way. And others are taking shelter on the beach on the NSW South Coast. At 11am, the Victoria premier, Daniel Andrews, will address the media with emergency services officials. It was reported yesterday evening that Andrews returned from holiday due to the fires. Mark tells ABC Gippsland there is about 5,000 down at the main boat ramp and community centre. The town was pitch black but half the sky is now red. The line is crackling. There are ambulances and fire brigades patrolling the area. \u201cThe car park is just completely chockers with vehicles.\u201d Winterson says she knows that her house won\u2019t survive. \u201cI\u2019ve just accepted that.\u201d She earlier ABC Gippsland her home was right in the centre of the fire path. She now says there is now zero visibility and glowing embers. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to look like fireworks night.\u201d She says her brick building of the radio studio is fairly new. \u201cIt has a metal roof. The only wood is withinthe internal structure. We have double glazing on the studio windows. And we will be keeping all internal doors shut. We\u2019ve got as much chance, really, as anybody else at the moment and now the ember attack is really starting to... It\u2019s starting to look like fireworks night.\u201d Francesca Winterson, who is a presenter on a local radio station in Mallacoota, is speaking on ABC News now. \u201cWe\u2019ve been broadcasting for 48 hours without a break and we\u2019re all very tired,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we are here in the station and I\u2019m just watching my town burn.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m now seeing live ash burning down the main street and landing into the dry.\u201d She is asked if she needs to leave the call. \u201cI can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d I have been speaking with Kelly, who is on the beach at Mallacoota. She says there are about 20 boats around her. The family beside her has a nine-month-old baby. \u201cIt\u2019s dark and gloomy with burning embers seen out here in the past hour,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can see flashing lights towards Mallacoota but no visible flames as yet. It\u2019s strange how we got here at four yesterday afternoon and it was stinking hot and now it\u2019s bloody cold. \u201cThat has caught a lot of people out by not having the right clothing. We [came] out in our little boat with my wife and two boys and three dogs. Luckily for us we have a big swag so we are out of the weather slightly. There is a new emergency warning in place for Cabbage Tree Creek. This Emergency Warning is being issued for Cabbage Tree Creek and Brodribb River and surrounds, Bellbird Creek, Bete Bolong, Cape Conran, Corringle, Jarrahmond, Manorina, Marlo, Murrungowar, Newmerella, Nurran, Orbost, Simpsons Creek, Tabbara, Waygara. This bushfire is approximately 4km from Cabbage Tree Creek heading in a North Easterly direction, the fire front is halfway between Brodribb River and Cabbage Tree. The fire is about to cross the Princes Highway. This bushfire could impact Cabbage Tree any time within the next 30 minutes. Ash and embers are falling in nearby communities which can potentially start spot fires. The Princes Highway is closed between Bairnsdale and Genoa. The wind has shifted to a south-westerly direction. This fire is threatening homes and lives. The Orbost Cricket Club in Nicholson Street has been set up as an assembly area for those in nearby communities who wish to gather within the township if you do not have any safer options. Further to the caller to ABC Gippsland who confirmed homes lost in Sarsfield, there have been images coming out of that town. In Mallacoota, 4,000 residents have been evacuated to the foreshore as they wait for the fire to hit. Some locals have told ABC Radio that the town is already being impacted. Others are sheltering at the community centre. Those in the town have reported that it is pitch black, aside from flashing lights. They have reported sirens are blaring. Across East Gippsland, there are 5,700 homes without power. In the Blue Mountains. On ABC Radio Gippsland, Joe says he has driven through Sarsfield, north of Lakes Entrance, and near Bruthen. The power and phone lines are down in Bruthen. He says: \u201cI was just shocked with what I saw. There seems to be quite a few houses burned. There were still ... trees and hay sheds on fire. \u201cI was just feeling relieved for myself but in total shock for the people who\u2019ve suffered losses [of property]. If there have been no serious injuries or deaths that\u2019s just a miracle.\u201d Really frightening updates from Mallacoota. People in Mallacoota have been providing updates on Twitter. Authorities have updated the emergency warning for Mallacoota. It says: This Emergency Warning is being issued for Mallacoota, Gipsy Point, Karbeethong, Tamboon, Club Terrace, Combienbar and surrounds. There are currently two bushfires that are not yet under control. One fire is currently travelling from Wingan River in an easterly direction towards Karbeethong with spotting ahead of the fire. The fire front is predicted to impact the Mallacoota township within the next 30 minutes. The second fire is travelling from Goongerah in a south-easterly direction towards Chandlers Creek Ash and embers are falling ahead of the main fires, which may cause spot fires. Nationals MP Darren Chester, who represents Gippsland, says he just got off the phone with a friend in the fire-threatened town of Mallacoota. He tells the ABC: \u201cI was talking to a mate in Mallacoota, he says it\u2019s like midnight there, it\u2019s pitch black. They have a lot of smoke. They have embers falling. \u201cAt this stage he was saying to me that they are burnt leaves, not direct embers in terms of likely to start new fires, but they\u2019re in the firing line, so to speak, and along the south coast there\u2019s more issues.\u201d A few more points from Shane Fitzsimmons\u2019 press briefing. 100 fires are burning in NSW, including five at emergency level, concentrated in southern NSW. The fires were \u201cextraordinary\u201d overnight, exceeding predictions. BoM will update forecast to be worse than original prediction. The full quote from Shane Fitzsimmons earlier: Our hearts are breaking for Sam\u2019s family, for his colleagues in the region and the entire southern border team, but right across the firefighting and emergency services family. To lose one of our own in such extraordinary circumstances is tragic and tragic is an understatement. Fitzsimmons gives more details on the accident yesterday. He says crews at the scene described the winds that tipped McPaul\u2019s truck as a \u201cfire tornado\u201d, which resulted in \u201ccyclonic winds\u201d that moved across the fire ground and lifted up a 10 tonne fire truck and flipped it on the roof. Those inside were trapped, and McPaul was killed in the process. \u201cI have to pay my respects and admiration to Sam\u2019s fellow crew and those that stayed behind,\u201d Fitzsimmons said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t leaving Sam there until police and, of course, the local fire and rescue crew, who so professionally and with respect and dignity worked with police to ensure Sam got out of the vehicle wreckage and was transported away from that fire scene.\u201d Fitzsimmons says three other volunteers were injured. Two have been released from hospital, but a third is at the Prince Alfred Hospital in Melbourne with serious injuries, including burns. Shane Fitzsimmons, the NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, confirms the man killed at Albury yesterday is 28-year-old Samuel McPaul. Fitzsimmons says McPaul, of Holbrook, was \u201cwell respected and admired throughout the local community and in his local brigade\u201d. He leaves behind his wife, Megan, who is pregnant with their first child, due 4 May. The couple married 18 months ago. \u201cOur hearts are breaking for Sam\u2019s family,\u201d Fitzsimmons says. Turning her attention to the current fire threat, the premier says the South Coast and southern NSW is \u201cunder heavy threat\u201d today. She notes there are five fires at emergency level this early in the day. \u201cThere will be road closures in southern NewSouth Wales due to the fires,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need everybody to act as responsibly as possible, as cautiously as possible, and please don\u2019t think you\u2019re the expert. Take the experts\u2019 advice. We don\u2019t want anyone to get in harm\u2019s way. Your actions may unintentionally harm so many others. That\u2019s the last thing we want to see today.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now to the media. She extends her condolences to the NSW RFS volunteer who died in a truck accident at Albury-Wodonga yesterday. Three others were injured, she says. The premier says the RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons spent the night supporting the family of the volunteer who was killed. Also within the past hour, an alert was issued for Bendoc, Bonang, Cabanandra, Club Terrace, Combienbar, Deddick Valley, Delegate River, Dellicknora, Errinundra, Goongerah, Haydens Bog, Nurran, Roaring Camp, Tubbut, Yalmy. This relates to the bushfire west of Goongerah and south-west of Bonang, which is not yet under control. There are reports of active fire in multiple locations in the Goongerah Valley. Fire activity is erratic and unpredictable. This fire is threatening homes and lives. Reports of ember attack have been reported in the township of Goongerah. The south-westerly wind change is not expected until early Tuesday morning which will push the fire in a north-easterly direction. Let\u2019s drill down into some of those emergency warnings in Victoria that I mentioned earlier. At 7:14am, an emergency warning was issued for Bruthen and surrounds. There is a bushfire at Bruthen and surrounds that is out of control. The fire has created a large smoke column and is dropping embers and creating spot fires. The fire has been burning overnight burning in a southerly direction towards Swan Reach. This fire is threatening homes and lives. There is a south-westerly wind change has occurred and is likely to drive fires in a north-easterly direction. Bruthen, Bullumwall, Swan Reach and Fairhope are under a high level of threat. Metung is not threatened to the same level at this point. The incident controller of the Gippsland fires said he could not confirm whether lives or property had been lost in massive fires that burned through East Gippsland overnight, because it was so hot they had to ground their infra-red tracking plane. And he said the beachside town of Mallacoota, where 4,000 tourists and locals are on the foreshore being protected by firefighters, is expected to be hit by fire this morning. Chris Eagle, from the department of environment, land, water and planning, said the fires grew about 60% in size overnight. On Monday afternoon, the three largest fires \u2014 Barmouth Spur near Bruthen, W Tree, and the Cann River fire \u2014 were estimated to be 200,000ha in size. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fire, a lot of activity,\u201d Eagle told ABC radio in Gippsland on Tuesday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be impacts to residents just because of the sheer size.\u201d Asked if that meant he could not say whether there had been a loss of property or lives, Eagle said: \u201cNo, not as yet.\u201d He said he had reports the fire had directly impacted on the towns of Bruthen and Orbost. The Princes Highway was closed from Bairnsdale to Genoa, east of Mallacoota, on Monday night, but on Tuesday morning the stretch between Lakes Entrance and Bairnsdale was opened to allow tourists to leave. All of East Gippsland remains under an emergency alert this morning, except Bairnsdale which is under a watch and act. There are currently 13 emergency warnings in place across Victoria and New South Wales. These maps below will give you a sense of where those fires are burning. We\u2019re currently waiting for the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, to address media. That\u2019s coming up in the next few minutes. I mentioned the town of Mallacoota is bracing to be impacted by fire. There are terrifying photos coming out of the area. Meanwhile, residents in Albury-Wodonga are mourning the loss of a 28-year-old volunteer fire fighter who was killed when his fire truck rolled in strong winds yesterday evening. The Rural Fire Service Superintendent Pat Westwood will give more details at 10am today. Crisp said authorities are focused on a fire that is about to reach the coastal town of Mallacoota in East Gippsland. Residents were told the fire was likely to hit the township around daybreak. \u201cWe have three strike teams in Mallacoota looking after 4,000 people on the beach as the fire goes into that town,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are concerned about isolated communities and to get an appreciation about other losses we will put up helicopters, reconnaissance flight. A whole lot of planning has happened over night. We thought this was the scenario.\u201d Victoria\u2019s emergency services commissioner Andrew Crisp has just appeared on ABC News. Crisp said he could not give specific details about the number of homes lost in Victoria. But he confirms that in East Gippsland \u201cmultiple properties across a number of locations\u201d have been lost. He does not want to give more details until authorities are certain to avoid misleading people. Good morning. I\u2019m Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for joining our coverage of the ongoing bushfire threat across the country. We should learn this morning about the scale of the properties lost across Victoria, as fires bear down on communities in the state\u2019s east, and on the New South Wales south coast. We already know that a volunteer firefighter lost their life at Albury yesterday after their truck rolled. We\u2019ll be with you throughout the day.",

By dawn on Tuesday the orange bushfire glow had disappeared from the horizon, replaced by a black shadow of smoke and ash that made early morning in the Victorian seaside town seem like midnight.

By the time the fire arrived on Monday, it was too late for many of them to leave. Amid the darkness, there was chaos. A stampede towards the town\u2019s foreshore where thousands stood and huddled and watched the black sky turn red. As traffic banked up, people abandoned their cars and ran towards the water. Soon after, emergency sirens from firefighting tankers heralded a further warning. Get in the water. Those who could scrambled onto boats.

Grim news Mallacoota was only the first of what became a litany of towns devastated by the fires as the carnage spread up the New South Wales coast and to tiny inland villages. Further west, in the East Gippsland region where residents had been warned to evacuate on Sunday, ominous images showed towns such as Sarsfield had lost numerous properties. The far south coast of New South Wales was next to experience the full force of a shocking day, as clear skies turned to a frightening black within a couple of hours. Residents of Bermagui were also forced to flee to the beach. And a few kilometres inland, horror was unfolding in the tiny village of Cobargo, where by mid-morning images began to seep out revealing that a good part of the main street had been entirely destroyed. The news turned even grimmer when it transpired that two men \u2013 reportedly a father and son \u2013 had died trying to defend their property in the town in the early hours of the morning. A local resident, Brenda Whiffen, told the ABC the fire came through about 1am. \u201cWe came outside and you could see the red glow, but you could hear it roaring, that was the scary bit. You could hear it roaring like the ocean,\u201d she said. Next in the firing line was Batemans Bay, one of the larger towns on the NSW south coast, where fire encircled residents and holidaymakers, forcing them into evacuation centres and to the town\u2019s beaches. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, there\u2019s no power.

Eventually she and her family members were forced to flee, as the flames became overpowering and tore through several buildings and homes. \u201cIt felt like we were in a war zone,\u201d Granados said. \u201cOf what I\u2019m aware three people have already lost their homes ... we fought the flames, the flames were on top of us. When we left we were basically on fire, we had to leave. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t breathe. We couldn\u2019t see. The flames were just ferocious, they were furious, they were angry. There was nothing we could do, we had to pretty much save ourselves.\u201d Fresh crisis Suddenly, in mid-afternoon, a fresh crisis blew up much further north, when spot fires from the Currowan blaze cut the Pacific Highway near Sussex Inlet, sending smoke billowing over the small settlements around Jervis Bay. Like the far south coast communities before them, residents found themselves plunged into pitch darkness in the middle of a summer\u2019s day. As fierce winds whipped up the coast in the evening, the Bureau of Meteorology sent out a warning to the thousands of people lining Sydney harbour to watch the city\u2019s much-debated New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display, even as an emergency alert was issued for a fire in the western suburb of Greystanes. The NSW rural fire commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said late on Tuesday it was \u201cone of the worst, if not the worst fire season we have experienced\u201d. Back at Mallacoota, firefighters managed to beat the bushfire back at the town precipice. Shortly before 4pm a cheer went up at the foreshore, as word spread that the immediate threat was over; a wind change had pushed the blaze in another direction. But everyone in the town, along with others in East Gippsland and some on the New South Wales coast, remained hemmed in by the fire front, unable to leave. Late on Tuesday it was announced that all telecommunications would be cut for the whole of the NSW coast between Nowra and Moruya, for up to 24 hours. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, said helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels would be deployed to supply, and potentally evacuate, those trapped on the Victorian coast. As night fell, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, could not bring himself to wish his state a happy new year. Instead he offered the same greeting that thousands of other Australians had exchanged throughout a harrowing day: stay safe.",

Councillors spelled out the \u201cunashamedly ambitious\u201d goal that would follow the lead of Bristol, which is due to become the first UK city to ban diesel cars by 2021. The historic Yorkshire city, which attracts nearly 7 million visitors a year, is one of several UK cities with illegally high levels of air pollution. The ban would stop all non-essential private car journeys inside York\u2019s city walls by 2023, with an exemption for people who rely on cars such as disabled residents. Jonny Crawshaw, a Labour councillor in the city, said: \u201cPeople\u2019s first response might be to be a bit anxious about what we\u2019re proposing.

The City of York council is aiming to become carbon neutral by 2030, 20 years before the British government\u2019s net zero target. The UK government has been ordered by the courts to bring air pollution levels down to legal limits in the shortest possible time. A pollution map released by campaigners in February found levels of air pollution that exceed safety limits in almost 2,000 locations across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The worst place for nitrogen dioxide pollution in 2017 was Kensington and Chelsea, followed by Leeds and Doncaster. York, which attracts millions of tourists every year to its medieval walls, cobbled streets and 13th-century Gothic cathedral, does not escape the smog. According to the data, compiled by Friends of the Earth, 12 locations in the city centre exceeded national air quality standards of 40 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide per cubic metre (ug/m3). A bus stop on Rougier Street was the city\u2019s most polluted spot in 2018, the data shows, followed by a taxi rank outside the railway station (59.9 and 57.7 ug/m3 respectively). Crawshaw, who represents a city-centre ward on City of York council, said the proposal was not about stopping tourism or preventing those living in the city centre from having a car. He said: \u201cThis is about reducing and removing non-essential car journeys across the whole city, while improving the range and attractiveness of alternative travel options. \u201cFewer cars on York\u2019s roads would enable faster, more reliable public transport from the suburbs and villages into the city centre.

He chaired all three companies simultaneously and was also chief executive of Renault.</p> \n<p>In Japan, where foreign company bosses are rare, Ghosn achieved superstar status for revitalising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan\">Nissan</a> \u2013 his hero status was such that his life was serialised in a manga comic book.

After spending time in Beirut as a child, he studied at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris before joining Michelin. He spent the first 18 years of his career at the French tyre manufacturer. Ghosn was poached by Renault in 1996, where he was nicknamed \u201cLe Cost Killer\u201d for his brutal restructuring programme.</p> \n<p>He repeated that at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nissan\">Nissan</a> after Renault took a 43.4% stake in the company in 1999, cementing his status as one of the world\u2019s most successful business leaders.

      "bodyText": "The very public arrest of Carlos Ghosn moments after his private jet landed at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport in November 2018 sent shockwaves through the corporate world. It was a steep fall from grace for the titan of the global car industry, the man who revived the fortunes of Japan\u2019s Nissan and Renault of France, forging an alliance with Mitsubishi that created the world\u2019s second-largest car manufacturer. He chaired all three companies simultaneously and was also chief executive of Renault. In Japan, where foreign company bosses are rare, Ghosn achieved superstar status for revitalising Nissan \u2013 his hero status was such that his life was serialised in a manga comic book. His face has graced Japanese bento lunch boxes as well as Lebanese stamps. Born in Brazil to Lebanese immigrant parents, 65 year-old Ghosn (pronounced to rhyme with \u201cphone\u201d) also holds French and Lebanese passports. After spending time in Beirut as a child, he studied at the prestigious \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris before joining Michelin. He spent the first 18 years of his career at the French tyre manufacturer. Ghosn was poached by Renault in 1996, where he was nicknamed \u201cLe Cost Killer\u201d for his brutal restructuring programme. He repeated that at Nissan after Renault took a 43.4% stake in the company in 1999, cementing his status as one of the world\u2019s most successful business leaders. Former DaimlerChrysler chair J\u00fcrgen Schrempp gave Ghosn another moniker, the \u201cicebreaker\u201d, for his ability to cut through inflexible Japanese business practices and return Nissan to profitability within a year. Ghosn bound together Renault and Nissan in an alliance, later joined by Mitsubishi, another Japanese corporate touchstone, that allowed the companies to share costs and components. An unusual criss-cross of shareholdings tied the companies together without merging them, but Ghosn claimed that fears he was pushing for a full merger with Nissan as a junior partner were behind his eventual ousting. The alliance installed Ghosn as head of the world\u2019s second largest carmaker, giving him political power across the world, in Japan, France and wherever its factories were located. That included the UK, where Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory took centre stage in the Brexit debate after Ghosn warned that future investment remained dependent on the trade deal with the EU. Ghosn met then the prime minister, Theresa May, to discuss the plant, eventually securing \u00a361m in secret state aid. Ghosn faces four charges of financial misconduct if he ever returns to Japan, including understating his pay and misusing company assets. While awaiting trial, he spent more than 120 days in detention before being released on bail for a second time in late April. His treatment drew international criticism. The outstanding charges mean Ghosn will have to carefully judge the legal risks of leaving Lebanon. However, Japan only has extradition treaties with the US and South Korea. In the meantime, Ghosn will be able to enjoy relative freedom in the home country of his parents and his wife, Carole. While he will almost certainly forgo $9m (\u00a36.8m) in bail paid in Japan, Ghosn \u2013 who faced repeated criticism for pay packets perceived as excessive \u2013 will be able to fall back on an estimated net worth of $120m \u2013 including an expensive Beirut mansion and a stake in a Lebanese vineyard a few miles from the Mediterranean Sea.",

As the <a href=\"https://ipbes.net/\">IPBES report</a>\u2019s authors noted: \u201cIt is not too late to make a difference, but only if we start now at every level from local to global.\u201d</p> <p>We asked three questions:</p> <h2><strong>1. </strong>What habitat or species are you most concerned about?</h2> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>2. </strong>What is the biggest missed opportunity of the last 10 years?</h2> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>3. </strong>What conservation work are you most excited about in the coming decade?</h2> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"847ebbc76417203c4d3727d9a5e328de1fef42f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/847ebbc76417203c4d3727d9a5e328de1fef42f1/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Ana Mari\u0301a Herna\u0301ndez Salgar\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Ana Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez</h2> <p><strong>Chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)</strong></p> <p><strong>1. </strong>The species I am most directly worried about is our own! Humanity has reached a point that has enabled us to inflict large-scale and lasting damage on our natural world \u2013 destroying ecosystems, driving species extinctions and even changing our global weather patterns. Food security, energy, health and livelihoods all depend on nature\u2019s contribution to people. </p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Humanity never seems to miss the opportunity of missing an opportunity. My greatest regret of the last 10 years is how many chances we have collectively missed to make better choices and drive better policies. We have known enough about the risks of our damage to nature, yet the determination to act and to change seems to be constantly deferred to a later date. Before we know it, we will run out of time and the question will no longer be what we regret most, but rather how could we have been so foolish.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> The conservation work I am most excited by goes beyond traditional conceptions of conservation \u2013 acknowledging that the nature crisis must be understood as one that is also a social, ethical, economic, health and security crisis. This is the basis for the next work programme of the IPBES (until 2030). It has potential to finally tackle the root causes of the loss of nature \u2013 values and behaviours that drive the destruction of biodiversity and nature\u2019s contributions to people.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"57e26fef1749cbc01eeace124cf9cbf52d2a1381\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e26fef1749cbc01eeace124cf9cbf52d2a1381/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Mya-Rose Craig\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Mya-Rose \u2018Birdgirl\u2019 Craig</h2> <p><strong>17-year-old British Bangladeshi activist</strong></p> <p><strong>1. </strong>The species I am most worried about is the critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper (SBS), which breeds in the Arctic Russian tundra, migrates 8,000 km along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, with a significant percentage wintering on intertidal mudflats on Sonadia Island in southern Bangladesh. My mother\u2019s family are Bangladeshi and so I feel a huge connection to this tiny, captivating bird, with its minute spoon-shaped bill. In 2010 the population was down to 200 birds, the combined weight of which is less than a single mute swan. The SBS is still a long way from being out of danger, despite a captive breeding programme. With many current threats, from mudflat reclamation in China to a sea-level rise wiping out their wintering areas, the survival of this species is still on a knife-edge.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Ten years ago, we understood more than ever before about the habitats across the world, the life they support and their importance to our planet. This gave us a huge opportunity to conserve the rarest habitats by working with indigenous peoples who understand them best. However, these were opportunities either squandered or exploited by the large global conservation organisations, such as the WWF and Wildlife Conservation Society, who have instead continued to remove indigenous peoples from their land in Africa and Asia, leaving the land more vulnerable to commercial poaching. Poaching in Africa and Asia is now pandemic, with wildlife no longer being protected by indigenous peoples who would previously have been able to identify poachers before they killed, but are instead excluded from having an input in conserving their animals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"4f64550ae210562bb0d1ac3df7d042139be26307\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f64550ae210562bb0d1ac3df7d042139be26307/0_198_5904_3542/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Global Climate Strike in Kenya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Global climate strike in Kenya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3.</strong> I see a change coming in the way that international conservation organisations work with local and indigenous peoples around the world to save habitats, species and retain biodiversity. The decolonisation of conservation is happening, with a final realisation that indigenous peoples who have been successfully managing their land for thousands of years will be able to stop the mass commercial poaching and hunting taking place in national parks. I have seen examples of indigenous peoples in Africa, South America, and Asia using conservation to support their heroic efforts to save rainforests and species like orangutan in Borneo and yellow-headed picathartes in Ghana. I have recently become a global ambassador for Survival International, which fights for the human rights of indigenous peoples. I am very hopeful about seeing this new type of conservation work rise and dominate over the next decade. I hope that all of this will finally stop the assumption that white, \u2018educated\u2019 people understand and can look after lands, habitats, and wildlife better. I intend to be at the forefront of that campaign, which is the international side of the coin to my campaigning so far which has been making the sector ethnically diverse in the UK, rather than 99.4% white as it is now.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd5a17d66e6589c51e64d962fb00ef9b63e579a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd5a17d66e6589c51e64d962fb00ef9b63e579a8/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Chris Packham\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Chris Packham</h2> <p><strong>Naturalist and television presenter</strong><br><br><strong>1.</strong> I am worried about those species that are highly specialised in terms of their habitats. The more specialised you are as an animal, requiring unique resources, diet and habitat to survive, the greater effect any rapidly changing circumstances will have. It doesn\u2019t just have to be animals either, it also includes things like chalk streams and sandy lowland heath \u2013 in the UK we have more than anywhere else in the world and this habitat is rarer than tropical rainforests. Those things that are least resilient and least common need to be our focus.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Activism is growing now and we are seeing positive results with Extinction Rebellion and School Strikes for Climate having a big impact. But it has been dormant for some time and that\u2019s disappointing. Second, our NGOs aren\u2019t showing their muscle. Many are very broadly supported and have an enormous legacy of credibility: the RSPCA, the RSPB and Wildlife Trust for example have vast public support but they\u2019ve not been wielding that to best benefit and that\u2019s been disappointing. And lastly we have an enormous armoury of technologies, capabilities and tried-and-tested methods to implement practical conservation with almost immediate success but we haven\u2019t been doing enough of it.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> I\u2019m interested in new techniques and also divesting our trust into younger ecologists and conservationists who are brave and take risks and who know that there are enormous gains to be had if we get off the fence and start actually calling some shots. I\u2019m looking for a new attitude in conservation. In terms of the practicalities: rewilding. Through this there are opportunities for carbon capture and planting trees, landscape resilience in terms of preventing flooding, and biodiversity generating a more natural mosaic and ecosystems which would be good.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3e3c5bb1a458191a0ca11fffcfe057347b5a90a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e3c5bb1a458191a0ca11fffcfe057347b5a90a6/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Jane Goodall.\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Jane Goodall</h2> <p><strong>Primatologist and founder of the Jane Goodall Institute</strong></p> <p><strong>1. </strong>While governments delay or ignore their commitment to reducing emissions it is vitally important to protect and restore our forests. We are destroying these precious forests at a terrifying rate, thus releasing stored CO2 from the trees and the forest soils into the atmosphere. The forest habitat is home to many of the most endangered specieson the planet so protecting and restoring forests is an imperative for us all.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> We have missed so many opportunities \u2013 introducing environmental education into schools around the world, doing more to alleviate poverty (the really poor destroy the environment as they try to make a living, buy the cheapest food to survive). But perhaps the biggest opportunity missed is the lack of government subsidies for innovative technologies that will help us to live in better harmony with the natural world. Instead of subsidising clean green energy \u2013 solar, wind and tide \u2013 it is the big oil and gas companies, with their billions of dollars, that are receiving the support and tax breaks that enable them to continue to pollute and destroy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9b9b8ff4957459980ebc3d3bb84ff179d6233f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9b9b8ff4957459980ebc3d3bb84ff179d6233f2/0_0_4800_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A GPS collar is placed on a jaguar for research and monitoring in Marac\u00e1-Jipioca ecological station, Amapa, Brazil.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A GPS collar is placed on a jaguar for research and monitoring in Marac\u00e1-Jipioca ecological station, Amapa, Brazil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andr\u00e9 Dib/WWF-Brazil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3.</strong> I am really excited about some of the technology that is already making a huge difference, for example radio collars and microchips that enable scientists to accurately map animal movements.

Many, especially non-European, peoples hunt, herd or grow their own food and are, at least in part, self-sufficient. We can\u2019t all live like this, but we can learn from them. If the keys to real change lie anywhere, it lies with them.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> The greatest missed opportunity has been the complete failure of the billion-dollar conservation industry to do anything more than pay lip service to tribal, indigenous and local peoples, whilst at the same time continuing to steal their lands and destroy them, and failing to \u201cconserve\u201d nature as well as they had been! </p> <p><strong>3.</strong> My hope is for the exposure of the hypocrisy behind the conservation industry, which hopefully will force it to accept the rights of tribal, indigenous and local peoples to manage their own environments, as they have done for generations. This is a struggle between those who want to kick people off their land, and those who want and need to live sustainably on and from it. If the fundamentalist environmentalists win, it will lead to yet more pollution and destruction.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d205e2f5d7295326d33e833853ab11f353830fdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d205e2f5d7295326d33e833853ab11f353830fdc/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Carl Safina\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Carl Safina</h2> <p><strong>Ecologist and writer</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> It\u2019s hard to beat coral reefs for the prize of global catastrophic rapid decline of a habitat. But it\u2019s not a contest, and globally, all habitat types are in declining health. Our footprint continues to expand. It\u2019s been calculated that 70% of all birds on Earth are now poultry, about 60% of all non-human mammals are farmed cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. If you think of all those deteriorating wild habitats as proxy for all plants and animals living in them, you come to one uncomfortable conclusion: the human species is no longer compatible with the rest of life on Earth.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>We have proven ourselves quite capable of creating global problems but have not shown an ability to control or reverse those problems. As long as we must maintain a global human population growing at roughly the rate of a new Mexico annually (around 70 million), getting in front of problems of the environment and the extinction crisis is like running after a hot-air balloon. The biggest missed opportunity is our failure to have an intelligent and compassionate conversation about human population.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Because an expanding human population is the greatest driver of environmental degradation as well as a major driver of poverty and injustice, the greatest lever for conservation is women\u2019s empowerment. The only thing that has worked to ease population is women making their own voluntary choices. On a different front we must transition rapidly away from fossil fuels and the greatest lever there is financial, divesting from fossil fuels, divesting from banks that finance fossil fuels, and investing in clean energy technologies.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"77d9c667727e4e698e9affaadf0a00b7a1a6401b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77d9c667727e4e698e9affaadf0a00b7a1a6401b/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Tony Juniper\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Tony Juniper</h2> <p><strong>Natural England chair and author</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> I\u2019ve spent much of my career working for the conservation and restoration of the tropical rainforests and I have been utterly mortified to see what has recently been happening, especially in Brazil this year, where vast fires have wiped out thousands of square kilometres of habitat.

These <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/\">Aichi Targets</a> have been largely sidelined to the point where they will be missed. A meeting of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will take place in China in 2020, where the global compass on this agenda will be reset for the coming decade. Countries really need to up their ambition in advance of that meeting, otherwise the mass extinction of species that is now gathering pace will soon turn into a tragedy of truly colossal proportions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e77a3b464f175d95ecba80a2d1a2c6b834947398\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e77a3b464f175d95ecba80a2d1a2c6b834947398/0_0_5120_3248/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man holds a dead snake at an area affected by forest fires in Otuquis national park, in the Pantanal ecoregion of south-eastern Bolivia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"634\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man holds a dead snake at an area affected by forest fires in Otuquis national park, in the Pantanal ecoregion of south-eastern Bolivia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aizar Raldes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3.</strong> I am very excited about how in some countries the conservation agenda is beginning to shift, moving from the rather grim task of hanging on to the last remnants of wildlife-rich habitat and rare species, to increasingly being about large-scale nature recovery.

If we can begin to rebuild habitats and species here in our densely populated islands, then that will be a real beacon of hope, showing that it is possible to reverse historic trends, in the process setting a new path for the future.

Not a single region of the planet is escaping the onslaught. Globally, a million animal and plant species are facing extinction. The driving force behind this mass extinction is our current linear economy. This \u201ctake-make-waste\u201d system sees us remove ever more materials from the ground, make products from them that we mostly use for only a short period of time, and then throw them away as waste. Each element of this approach represents a direct threat to biodiversity.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>The past 10 years have seen huge conservation efforts, including ocean clean-ups and protected zones \u2013 but, while necessary and laudable, they are not enough. The most effective strategy is one that prevents damage in the first place. In short, protecting biodiversity requires a fundamental shift in the way our economy works. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e717c6910ab8f5c102a63464709ba45e4512d4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e717c6910ab8f5c102a63464709ba45e4512d4b/0_0_1000_667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A loggerhead turtle trapped in an abandoned net\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A loggerhead turtle (<em>Caretta caretta</em>) trapped in an abandoned net in the Mediterranean Sea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordi Chias/NPL/WWF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><br>3. </strong>This vision is becoming reality.

They are the most biologically diverse ecosystem on Earth, containing millions of species \u2013 many of them providing crucial benefits to us and playing essential roles in nature. Increased degradation of natural environments is not restricted to the Amazon: Madagascar lost some 366,000 hectares of forest in 2018, which is 4.3% of all its original rainforest. It is clear to see that this is insanely unsustainable.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> To stop and revert this trend, we need radical changes across all segments of society. We should all stop and review our consumer choices \u2013 it could be by avoiding buying furniture made of non-certified wood, or avoiding products that contribute to deforestation, like meat and dairy produce fed with Brazilian soybeans. The media attention on the climate crisis has unfortunately overshadowed another huge, and arguably even more significant crisis: the loss of biodiversity. The problem with biodiversity loss is that if we lose a species to extinction, it is gone forever \u2013 and right now, currently one in five plants are threatened with extinction.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> There are many great opportunities for tackling the climate and biodiversity crises at the same time, but we must get it right from the beginning. For instance, companies and governments have never been so keen to invest in carbon offsetting, in particular afforestation. But it is important we plant the right trees in the right place. If we do so, we can combine long-term carbon storage goals with habitat restoration, increasing opportunities for wildlife to re-establish and regain stable population sizes.The most important action, however, is to conserve what we already have whenever there\u2019s a choice. Not destroying a native habitat is immensely better than trying to restore it afterwards.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Aditya Mukarji</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"af8992bc344ca5ff08a79954652cac2d477c72a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8992bc344ca5ff08a79954652cac2d477c72a1/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Aditya Mukarji\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Indian activist, 15, who started a battle against plastic straws in 2018</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> The Aravalli biodiversity habitat is the only forest around Delhi and acts as its lungs.

They provide habitat for countless species, from enormous whale sharks to vanishingly small snails, crabs and worms. On coral reefs, a quarter of all shallow-water marine species are crammed into an area of only one tenth of one percent of the surface of the ocean. But all is not well. Corals are incredibly fussy about temperatures, liking it hot but not too hot. As global warming has gripped the planet, there have been repeated mass die-offs of coral spanning the globe. There are dire but scientifically credible predictions of the near complete loss of coral if we stay on the current path to more than 2C of warming by the end of this century.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Ten years ago I participated in a meeting at the Royal Society of London to consider the future of coral reefs. What we concluded was that they were in critical trouble. Reefs had become the first habitat on the planet for which anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, then at 383 parts per million, had already overshot their safe zone (350 ppm). Not only would we have to bring down emissions to save them, we would have to recapture some of the carbon already emitted. We fed the findings of our meeting into the Copenhagen climate conference a year later. To little avail. We are still scrambling to mount an adequate response.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> If we are to save reefs in any semblance of their present state we will have to give it everything we have. The world community is near achieving its goal of protecting 10% of the sea by 2020. But science tells us we need to protect at least 30% from extractive and damaging uses to safeguard wildlife and habitats. Coral rich countries around the world, like the UK and the Seychelles, have already committed to such protection. There is a good chance this target will soon be adopted across the planet, helping keep coral reefs on life support while fossil fuels are phased out.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0fded2ac89b419f10c3d54356034841181829cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fded2ac89b419f10c3d54356034841181829cbd/0_0_280_280/280.png\" alt=\"Ridhima Pandey\" width=\"280\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Ridhima Pandey, 11</h2> <p><strong>Sued the Indian government over climate crisis</strong><strong> inaction</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> The model development governments have taken up is out of balance.

As the IPBES report\u2019s authors noted: \u201cIt is not too late to make a difference, but only if we start now at every level from local to global.\u201d We asked three questions: 1. What habitat or species are you most concerned about? * * * 2. What is the biggest missed opportunity of the last 10 years? * * * 3. What conservation work are you most excited about in the coming decade? * * * Ana Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez Chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) 1. The species I am most directly worried about is our own! Humanity has reached a point that has enabled us to inflict large-scale and lasting damage on our natural world \u2013 destroying ecosystems, driving species extinctions and even changing our global weather patterns. Food security, energy, health and livelihoods all depend on nature\u2019s contribution to people. 2. Humanity never seems to miss the opportunity of missing an opportunity. My greatest regret of the last 10 years is how many chances we have collectively missed to make better choices and drive better policies. We have known enough about the risks of our damage to nature, yet the determination to act and to change seems to be constantly deferred to a later date. Before we know it, we will run out of time and the question will no longer be what we regret most, but rather how could we have been so foolish. 3. The conservation work I am most excited by goes beyond traditional conceptions of conservation \u2013 acknowledging that the nature crisis must be understood as one that is also a social, ethical, economic, health and security crisis. This is the basis for the next work programme of the IPBES (until 2030). It has potential to finally tackle the root causes of the loss of nature \u2013 values and behaviours that drive the destruction of biodiversity and nature\u2019s contributions to people. * * * Mya-Rose \u2018Birdgirl\u2019 Craig 17-year-old British Bangladeshi activist 1. The species I am most worried about is the critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper (SBS), which breeds in the Arctic Russian tundra, migrates 8,000 km along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, with a significant percentage wintering on intertidal mudflats on Sonadia Island in southern Bangladesh. My mother\u2019s family are Bangladeshi and so I feel a huge connection to this tiny, captivating bird, with its minute spoon-shaped bill. In 2010 the population was down to 200 birds, the combined weight of which is less than a single mute swan. The SBS is still a long way from being out of danger, despite a captive breeding programme. With many current threats, from mudflat reclamation in China to a sea-level rise wiping out their wintering areas, the survival of this species is still on a knife-edge. 2. Ten years ago, we understood more than ever before about the habitats across the world, the life they support and their importance to our planet. This gave us a huge opportunity to conserve the rarest habitats by working with indigenous peoples who understand them best. However, these were opportunities either squandered or exploited by the large global conservation organisations, such as the WWF and Wildlife Conservation Society, who have instead continued to remove indigenous peoples from their land in Africa and Asia, leaving the land more vulnerable to commercial poaching. Poaching in Africa and Asia is now pandemic, with wildlife no longer being protected by indigenous peoples who would previously have been able to identify poachers before they killed, but are instead excluded from having an input in conserving their animals. 3. I see a change coming in the way that international conservation organisations work with local and indigenous peoples around the world to save habitats, species and retain biodiversity. The decolonisation of conservation is happening, with a final realisation that indigenous peoples who have been successfully managing their land for thousands of years will be able to stop the mass commercial poaching and hunting taking place in national parks. I have seen examples of indigenous peoples in Africa, South America, and Asia using conservation to support their heroic efforts to save rainforests and species like orangutan in Borneo and yellow-headed picathartes in Ghana. I have recently become a global ambassador for Survival International, which fights for the human rights of indigenous peoples. I am very hopeful about seeing this new type of conservation work rise and dominate over the next decade. I hope that all of this will finally stop the assumption that white, \u2018educated\u2019 people understand and can look after lands, habitats, and wildlife better. I intend to be at the forefront of that campaign, which is the international side of the coin to my campaigning so far which has been making the sector ethnically diverse in the UK, rather than 99.4% white as it is now. * * * Chris Packham Naturalist and television presenter 1. I am worried about those species that are highly specialised in terms of their habitats. The more specialised you are as an animal, requiring unique resources, diet and habitat to survive, the greater effect any rapidly changing circumstances will have. It doesn\u2019t just have to be animals either, it also includes things like chalk streams and sandy lowland heath \u2013 in the UK we have more than anywhere else in the world and this habitat is rarer than tropical rainforests. Those things that are least resilient and least common need to be our focus. 2. Activism is growing now and we are seeing positive results with Extinction Rebellion and School Strikes for Climate having a big impact. But it has been dormant for some time and that\u2019s disappointing. Second, our NGOs aren\u2019t showing their muscle. Many are very broadly supported and have an enormous legacy of credibility: the RSPCA, the RSPB and Wildlife Trust for example have vast public support but they\u2019ve not been wielding that to best benefit and that\u2019s been disappointing. And lastly we have an enormous armoury of technologies, capabilities and tried-and-tested methods to implement practical conservation with almost immediate success but we haven\u2019t been doing enough of it. 3. I\u2019m interested in new techniques and also divesting our trust into younger ecologists and conservationists who are brave and take risks and who know that there are enormous gains to be had if we get off the fence and start actually calling some shots. I\u2019m looking for a new attitude in conservation. In terms of the practicalities: rewilding. Through this there are opportunities for carbon capture and planting trees, landscape resilience in terms of preventing flooding, and biodiversity generating a more natural mosaic and ecosystems which would be good. * * * Jane Goodall Primatologist and founder of the Jane Goodall Institute 1. While governments delay or ignore their commitment to reducing emissions it is vitally important to protect and restore our forests. We are destroying these precious forests at a terrifying rate, thus releasing stored CO2 from the trees and the forest soils into the atmosphere. The forest habitat is home to many of the most endangered specieson the planet so protecting and restoring forests is an imperative for us all. 2. We have missed so many opportunities \u2013 introducing environmental education into schools around the world, doing more to alleviate poverty (the really poor destroy the environment as they try to make a living, buy the cheapest food to survive). But perhaps the biggest opportunity missed is the lack of government subsidies for innovative technologies that will help us to live in better harmony with the natural world. Instead of subsidising clean green energy \u2013 solar, wind and tide \u2013 it is the big oil and gas companies, with their billions of dollars, that are receiving the support and tax breaks that enable them to continue to pollute and destroy. 3. I am really excited about some of the technology that is already making a huge difference, for example radio collars and microchips that enable scientists to accurately map animal movements. Also drones that can help to map habitats and plot out the range of individual animals, and a newly developing field of thermal cameras on drones that can detect wildlife under forest cover \u2026 helping rangers to better protect wildlife from poachers. * * * Stephen Corry Director of Survival International 1. I am most worried about human beings, and especially those who live most differently to \u201courselves\u201d. Many, especially non-European, peoples hunt, herd or grow their own food and are, at least in part, self-sufficient. We can\u2019t all live like this, but we can learn from them. If the keys to real change lie anywhere, it lies with them. 2. The greatest missed opportunity has been the complete failure of the billion-dollar conservation industry to do anything more than pay lip service to tribal, indigenous and local peoples, whilst at the same time continuing to steal their lands and destroy them, and failing to \u201cconserve\u201d nature as well as they had been! 3. My hope is for the exposure of the hypocrisy behind the conservation industry, which hopefully will force it to accept the rights of tribal, indigenous and local peoples to manage their own environments, as they have done for generations. This is a struggle between those who want to kick people off their land, and those who want and need to live sustainably on and from it. If the fundamentalist environmentalists win, it will lead to yet more pollution and destruction. * * * Carl Safina Ecologist and writer 1. It\u2019s hard to beat coral reefs for the prize of global catastrophic rapid decline of a habitat. But it\u2019s not a contest, and globally, all habitat types are in declining health. Our footprint continues to expand. It\u2019s been calculated that 70% of all birds on Earth are now poultry, about 60% of all non-human mammals are farmed cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. If you think of all those deteriorating wild habitats as proxy for all plants and animals living in them, you come to one uncomfortable conclusion: the human species is no longer compatible with the rest of life on Earth. 2. We have proven ourselves quite capable of creating global problems but have not shown an ability to control or reverse those problems. As long as we must maintain a global human population growing at roughly the rate of a new Mexico annually (around 70 million), getting in front of problems of the environment and the extinction crisis is like running after a hot-air balloon. The biggest missed opportunity is our failure to have an intelligent and compassionate conversation about human population. 3. Because an expanding human population is the greatest driver of environmental degradation as well as a major driver of poverty and injustice, the greatest lever for conservation is women\u2019s empowerment. The only thing that has worked to ease population is women making their own voluntary choices. On a different front we must transition rapidly away from fossil fuels and the greatest lever there is financial, divesting from fossil fuels, divesting from banks that finance fossil fuels, and investing in clean energy technologies. * * * Tony Juniper Natural England chair and author 1. I\u2019ve spent much of my career working for the conservation and restoration of the tropical rainforests and I have been utterly mortified to see what has recently been happening, especially in Brazil this year, where vast fires have wiped out thousands of square kilometres of habitat. These ecosystems are vital not only for wildlife and human cultural heritage, but also in the battle against climate change and for water security. 2. In 2010 countries agreed an ambitious set of 10-year goals to conserve the Earth\u2019s incredible wildlife riches. These Aichi Targets have been largely sidelined to the point where they will be missed. A meeting of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity will take place in China in 2020, where the global compass on this agenda will be reset for the coming decade. Countries really need to up their ambition in advance of that meeting, otherwise the mass extinction of species that is now gathering pace will soon turn into a tragedy of truly colossal proportions. 3. I am very excited about how in some countries the conservation agenda is beginning to shift, moving from the rather grim task of hanging on to the last remnants of wildlife-rich habitat and rare species, to increasingly being about large-scale nature recovery. This is happening here in England, and I hope and pray that during the coming few years we will be able to show the kind of leadership that is so desperately needed on the global stage, as we are doing on climate change. If we can begin to rebuild habitats and species here in our densely populated islands, then that will be a real beacon of hope, showing that it is possible to reverse historic trends, in the process setting a new path for the future. Now is the time to do this. * * * Dominique Bikaba Director of Strong Roots Congo 1. I am worried about all endemic species of animals and plants, but mostly about great apes; and especially the eastern lowland gorillas and mountain gorillas. Their numbers have dropped dramaticallyin the last two decades. 2. Separating human from nature has been the biggest missed opportunity! The contribution and role of local communities and indigenous peoples in sustainable conservation is well-documented worldwide. This was not taken into account when \u201cmodern conservation\u201d, imported by colonialism, was imposed on mostindigenous lands. Driven mostly by big organisations, this type of conservation has invested enormous amounts of money, energy and time into conservation and the result is a high rate of species extinction and deforestation globally. We missed considering local communities and indigenous peoples in our conservation efforts. We missed an opportunity to understand the spiritual and cultural values of nature. 3. I am most excited about models that consider the rights of natural resources governance and the management of indigenous people! This is the only way we can reverse the damages we brought into \u201cconservation\u201d for lucrative benefits. * * * Kaluki Paul Mutuku Environmental activist at Youth 4 Nature 1. I am honestly worried about all sorts of ecosystems, because man has driven them to the brink of collapse. But most definitely, I am most worried about forest habitats in the sub-Saharan Africa. We are losing our forests at a faster rate, through deforestation and land degradation. 2. The biggest missed opportunity of the last 10 years is not working with nature, indigenous frontline communities, and with youth. World leaders have wasted so many years talking and \u201cnegotiating\u201d for their stomachs and unsustainable economic powers while ignoring the role of nature and indigenous communities in addressing climate change. They seem to be waking up now, but time is running out. 3. I am most excited about on-the-ground implementation of nature-based solutions, and especially land restoration across Africa.There is no sidelining of young people anymore. They need us, and we have real experience, not the boring conference reports and speeches. There is no 1.5\u00b0C without nature, and there is no 1.5\u00b0C without youth. * * * Sir Robert Watson Former IPBES chair 1. Coral reefs are incredibly susceptible to small changes in ocean temperature, and exacerbated by land-based pollution and ocean acidification.Other highly sensitive ecosystems include cloud forests and those at high latitudes. The species most at risk are endemic species who occupy small climatic zones and are unable to migrate fast enough to survive. 2. I would highlight three missed opportunities \u2013 failure to address climate change, which will become the greatest threat to biodiversity in the coming decades; failure to remove perverse agricultural subsidies that lead to loss of biodiversity; and failure to transform unsustainable agricultural production systems into sustainable agricultural systems using agro-ecological processes, coupled with reduced food waste and healthier diets. 3. We need to rethink protected areas, and a redesign of corridors that allow for migration under a changing climate. This should be accompanied by large-scale restoration projects. * * * Ellen MacArthur Sailor and founder of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation 1. All across the world, in habitats of every region, biodiversity is being destroyed. Not a single region of the planet is escaping the onslaught. Globally, a million animal and plant species are facing extinction. The driving force behind this mass extinction is our current linear economy. This \u201ctake-make-waste\u201d system sees us remove ever more materials from the ground, make products from them that we mostly use for only a short period of time, and then throw them away as waste. Each element of this approach represents a direct threat to biodiversity. 2. The past 10 years have seen huge conservation efforts, including ocean clean-ups and protected zones \u2013 but, while necessary and laudable, they are not enough. The most effective strategy is one that prevents damage in the first place. In short, protecting biodiversity requires a fundamental shift in the way our economy works. 3. This vision is becoming reality. To secure long term economic development we need a system fit for the future, not one stuck in the past. What if our aim was not simply to do less harm, but to actively regenerate our natural world? We know what the solutions look like, and that the opportunities are out there. All we have to do is grasp them. * * * Professor Alexandre Antonelli Director of Science at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew 1. The overwhelming evidence makes me really, really concerned about the future of tropical rainforests. They are the most biologically diverse ecosystem on Earth, containing millions of species \u2013 many of them providing crucial benefits to us and playing essential roles in nature. Increased degradation of natural environments is not restricted to the Amazon: Madagascar lost some 366,000 hectares of forest in 2018, which is 4.3% of all its original rainforest. It is clear to see that this is insanely unsustainable. 2. To stop and revert this trend, we need radical changes across all segments of society. We should all stop and review our consumer choices \u2013 it could be by avoiding buying furniture made of non-certified wood, or avoiding products that contribute to deforestation, like meat and dairy produce fed with Brazilian soybeans. The media attention on the climate crisis has unfortunately overshadowed another huge, and arguably even more significant crisis: the loss of biodiversity. The problem with biodiversity loss is that if we lose a species to extinction, it is gone forever \u2013 and right now, currently one in five plants are threatened with extinction. 3. There are many great opportunities for tackling the climate and biodiversity crises at the same time, but we must get it right from the beginning. For instance, companies and governments have never been so keen to invest in carbon offsetting, in particular afforestation. But it is important we plant the right trees in the right place. If we do so, we can combine long-term carbon storage goals with habitat restoration, increasing opportunities for wildlife to re-establish and regain stable population sizes.The most important action, however, is to conserve what we already have whenever there\u2019s a choice. Not destroying a native habitat is immensely better than trying to restore it afterwards. * * * Aditya Mukarji Indian activist, 15, who started a battle against plastic straws in 2018 1. The Aravalli biodiversity habitat is the only forest around Delhi and acts as its lungs. It is a haven for more than 900 species of terrestrial plants, 208 species of birds and at least 113 species of butterflies. The Aravallis offer a mosaic of micro habitats for a variety of species \u2013 from big mammals to small birds and even microbes. I am worried about many species like the Indian Tiger, great Indian bustard, one-horn rhinoceros, Indian vulture. 2. In India, we have missed the opportunity to implement extended producer responsibility at the time of opening up the economy in the late 1990s. We missed imbibing the fact that development should not be at the cost of the environment. These two factors have been missed not just in India but in all developing nations. 3. The River Cauvery is a forest-fed perennial river which is fast becoming a seasonal stream as 87% of tree cover has been removed in 50 years. \u201cCauvery Calling\u201d is a campaign setting the standard for how India\u2019s rivers can be revitalised. It will initiate the revitalisation of the Cauvery river and transform the lives of 84 million people. The project aims at helping farmers plant over 2.4bn trees through agro-forestry programmes. * * * Prof Callum Roberts Marine conservationist at the University of York 1. Coral reefs are the richest, most vibrant and best loved of all ocean ecosystems. They provide habitat for countless species, from enormous whale sharks to vanishingly small snails, crabs and worms. On coral reefs, a quarter of all shallow-water marine species are crammed into an area of only one tenth of one percent of the surface of the ocean. But all is not well. Corals are incredibly fussy about temperatures, liking it hot but not too hot. As global warming has gripped the planet, there have been repeated mass die-offs of coral spanning the globe. There are dire but scientifically credible predictions of the near complete loss of coral if we stay on the current path to more than 2C of warming by the end of this century. 2. Ten years ago I participated in a meeting at the Royal Society of London to consider the future of coral reefs. What we concluded was that they were in critical trouble. Reefs had become the first habitat on the planet for which anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, then at 383 parts per million, had already overshot their safe zone (350 ppm). Not only would we have to bring down emissions to save them, we would have to recapture some of the carbon already emitted. We fed the findings of our meeting into the Copenhagen climate conference a year later. To little avail. We are still scrambling to mount an adequate response. 3. If we are to save reefs in any semblance of their present state we will have to give it everything we have. The world community is near achieving its goal of protecting 10% of the sea by 2020. But science tells us we need to protect at least 30% from extractive and damaging uses to safeguard wildlife and habitats. Coral rich countries around the world, like the UK and the Seychelles, have already committed to such protection. There is a good chance this target will soon be adopted across the planet, helping keep coral reefs on life support while fossil fuels are phased out. * * * Ridhima Pandey, 11 Sued the Indian government over climate crisis inaction 1. The model development governments have taken up is out of balance. Mass tree-felling is common to make way for dams, infrastructure and road projects, leading to a big fall in the species count throughout India due to habitat loss. 2. Kedarnath flash floods, Kerala floods, Bihar floods, Assam floods and many such disasters have taken hundreds of lives and continue to do so every year, but as a country we haven\u2019t learned from these disasters. The government itself is saying that the spring water channels are drying up, the rivers are getting contaminated every day, the piles of solid waste are growing like a mountain in every corner of the country, biodiversity and habitat are being lost and still there no plans to mitigatethe situation. 3. The ongoing efforts to clean and rejuvenate the Ganges River and its tributaries have excited me the most.",

The environment and the climate crisis</h2> <p>Just six months into his presidency, Trump announced America\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord \u2013 making the US, the world\u2019s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, one of the only countries on earth that does not participate.</p> <p>Trump has also gutted the Environmental Protection Agency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/whistleblowers-scientists-climate-crisis-trump-administration\">forced out or muzzled scientists</a> whose research contradicts the administration\u2019s political preferences, and appointed industry insiders to federal agencies. He has rolled back Obama-era emissions standards, massively expanded the federal land and water available for oil and gas drilling, and propped up the dying and environmentally ruinous coal industry.</p> <h2>2. The judiciary</h2> <p>In only three years, Trump has appointed 185 judges \u2013 a staggering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/25/trump-judiciary-judges-legal-america\">re-molding of the federal judiciary</a>. (By comparison, Obama appointed 55 appeals judges in eight years.) Even if Trump loses re-election in 2020, the judges he has appointed will remain in office for decades.</p> <h2>3. Abortion</h2> <p>Rightwing activist groups have seized the opportunity to push new restrictions on abortion rights, including state abortion bans unprecedented since Roe v Wade. Ohio legislators even attempted to pass a bill that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/29/ohio-extreme-abortion-bill-reimplant-ectopic-pregnancy\">force doctors to re-implant ectopic pregnancies</a>, a dangerous procedure with no medical justification. Many of these radically anti-abortion laws are explicitly designed to test Roe v Wade, and there is a strong chance Roe could come up for review in the US supreme court, where liberal justices are now a minority.</p> <h2>4. Healthcare</h2> <p>Healthcare policy has come under continual challenge, with the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/13/healthcare-donald-trump-obamacare-executive-orders\">attempting</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/26/trump-administration-pushes-to-completely-gut-obamacare-in-dramatic-escalation\">dismantle</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/us-health-insurance-trump-administration-policy\">roll back</a> many parts of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.</p> <h2>5. Immigration</h2> <p>Trump kicked off his presidency by banning immigration from several Muslim countries; he has also separated migrant children from their parents, escalated Ice deportations, and worked to sideline immigration courts. One of Trump\u2019s advisors, Stephen Miller, is suspected to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/stephen-miller-trump-administration-white-nationalism\">an outright white nationalist</a>.</p> <h2>6. Voting rights</h2> <p>Thanks in part to aggressive gerrymandering, the Republican party has consolidated control of state legislatures and governorships across the US. These lawmakers\u2019 ultra-conservative agendas are often wildly unrepresentative of their more moderate, and increasingly diverse, populations.</p> <p>The past several years have seen a dangerous rise in voter suppression, a trend the Guardian is documenting in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-fight-to-vote\">ongoing special series on voting rights</a>.

The justice system</h2> <p>Despite an increasing bipartisan consensus on the need to reform the criminal justice system, the Trump administration has often promoted ineffective, backwards, and punitive criminal justice policies. Under former attorney general Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice largely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/04/jeff-sessions-review-police-reforms-high-profile-shootings\">abandoned oversight</a> of troubled police departments operating under federal consent decrees.

It was the first time both mother and child had survived.</p> <p>Her mother was cured and discharged from a treatment centre in Beni while pregnant. Her baby\u2019s development was monitored and she gave birth to Sylvana on 6 January.</p> <p>The outbreak in the DRC is proving difficult to bring under control but 2019 saw major advances in the development of an effective vaccine. Most significant was the approval by both EU and US regulators of Merck\u2019s new drug developed at Canada\u2019s National Microbiology Laboratory.</p> <p>The single-dose vaccine, which provokes a quick immune response, had been used in DRC under the so called \u201ccompassionate use\u201d research protocol that allowed it to be actively tested under field conditions prior to wider licensing.</p> <h2>Poverty pioneers</h2> <p>The 2019 Nobel prize recognised the pioneering contribution of economists Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d13cb6dc4ca6d00444316d16e6e9e4c2ffc421f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d13cb6dc4ca6d00444316d16e6e9e4c2ffc421f/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Kremer, Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laureates Michael Kremer, Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tt News Agency/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their methods aim to ensure that policies on poverty are backed by scientific evidence and now dominate the field of development economics.

      "bodyText": "Beni\u2019s Ebola-free baby There was a glimmer of hope amid the rising death toll in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s largest Ebola outbreak when a baby called Sylvana tested negative for the virus. Sylvana was the second baby known to have survived after being born to a woman who had Ebola. It was the first time both mother and child had survived. Her mother was cured and discharged from a treatment centre in Beni while pregnant. Her baby\u2019s development was monitored and she gave birth to Sylvana on 6 January. The outbreak in the DRC is proving difficult to bring under control but 2019 saw major advances in the development of an effective vaccine. Most significant was the approval by both EU and US regulators of Merck\u2019s new drug developed at Canada\u2019s National Microbiology Laboratory. The single-dose vaccine, which provokes a quick immune response, had been used in DRC under the so called \u201ccompassionate use\u201d research protocol that allowed it to be actively tested under field conditions prior to wider licensing. Poverty pioneers The 2019 Nobel prize recognised the pioneering contribution of economists Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee and Michael Kremer for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty. Their methods aim to ensure that policies on poverty are backed by scientific evidence and now dominate the field of development economics. The academy praised their use of randomised controlled trials to measure the effect of policies on vaccines, education and agriculture, which have helped millions of people. In India, more than 5 million children have benefited from programmes of remedial tutoring in schools as a result of one of their studies. The Boston-based non-profit J-PAL, founded by Duflo and Banerjee, continues to oversee some of the most pioneering examples of their methods. Trees in Ethiopia An ambitious reforestation campaign spearheaded by Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, engaged millions of Ethiopians in planting trees in their native soil. Technology minister Getahun Mekuria claimed 353,633,660 seedlings had been planted on one July day alone with some government employees given the day off to get involved. Most of the trees were indigenous species with some avocado and other fruit trees. Some Ethiopians were sceptical at the final total claimed but the government says 23 million people out of a population of 105 million took part and the UN has praised the scheme. The Guinness Book of Records said it had not been asked to verify the numbers. The current record is held by India\u2019s state of Uttar Pradesh where 50 million trees were planted in one day by 800,000 people in 2016. Toilets in India A great toilet construction spree ended in 2019 with 110 million new latrines having been built under the ambitious five-year \u201cClean India\u201d mission. Backed by an authoritarian prime minister, Bollywood stars and high-profile stories of brides refusing to marry men who didn\u2019t have toilets in their houses, the \u00a315bn campaign was to honour Mahatma Gandhi who said \u201cSanitation is more important than independence\u201d and dreamt of total cleanliness for all. Hundreds of millions of Indians had been defecating in the open because half the population had no access to toilets. The practice was causing disease, polluting land and water, and putting women and girls at risk when they went out alone to relieve themselves. Rates had been declining slowly but the rightwing nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, and his Bharatiya Janata party-led government made Clean India a flagship campaign and in October claimed that 100% of Indians now have access to a toilet. However, other surveys suggest coverage is not yet universal and some issues do remain with open defecation in rural India, reportedly mostly down to a lack of proper maintenance of the new latrines and of old habits dying hard. The latrine bonanza is driving a market for toilet-related products and services that is predicted to double to $62bn by 2021. The hygiene drive has spurred an 81% jump in sales of building materials and 48% rise in sales of sanitation ware, according to Euromonitor International. Malaria Algeria and Argentina officially eliminated malaria this year, and the World Health Organization said that in the past eight years malaria infections in Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam dropped by 76%, and deaths fell by 95%. India also reported a huge reduction in malaria, with 2.6 million fewer cases in 2018 than in 2017. A pilot programme of the world\u2019s first malaria vaccine was launched in Malawi for children aged under two.The vaccine is the first to offer partial protection against the disease. Clinical trials have shown those who are immunised are likely to have less severe cases of the disease. Smaller trials also showed the vaccine prevented four in 10 cases of malaria overall in babies aged between five and 17 months. \u201cNobody is suggesting that this is a magic bullet,\u201d said Dr David Schellenberg, scientific adviser to the WHO\u2019s Global Malaria Programme. \u201cIt may not sound like much but we\u2019re talking about 40% reduction in severe malaria, which unfortunately still has high mortality even when you have access to good treatment.\u201d In 2017 there were 219 million cases of malaria in 87 nations, African countries had 92% of all cases. There are fears that the fightback against the disease has been stalling despite it being both preventable and curable. Closed Britain After her story was published in the Guardian, Nina Saleh, who was refused a visa to return to the UK after travelling to Pakistan to adopt a baby, was told by the Home Office she could come home. Saleh holds a Norwegian passport but has full UK residency rights after living in London for 20 years. She was refused a visa to return with her baby, despite going through a lengthy adoption process with the involvement of British authorities. School ban ruling A court ordered Sierra Leone to overturn a \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d policy that banned tens of thousands of pregnant girls from attending school. The decision was welcomed by many in a nation where an estimated third of all pregnancies are to teenagers. Women\u2019s rights group Equality Now filed the challenge to Sierra Leone\u2019s ban before the the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) court in Nigeria. Gabon, Kenya and Malawi are among 26 African countries that have \u201cre-entry\u201d policies to enable pregnant girls to continue their education after giving birth. Tanzania, Burundi and Equatorial Guinea still have laws expelling pregnant girls from school. South Africa\u2019s HIV pill In December South Africa began rolling out an antiretroviral drug in what has been called a \u201cgame-changing\u201d bid to drastically reduce HIV rates. HIV rates around the world have been in steady decline and Aids-related deaths have dropped from 1.4million in 2010 to 770,000 in 2018. But about 20% of global HIV infections are in South Africa where about 7.7 million people are living with HIV. When it is introduced nationwide in March, the three-in-one pill is likely to have a far-reaching impact on HIV incidence at home and worldwide, said Dr Michelle Moorhouse, of Ezintsha, Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute in Johannesburg. \u201c[This] could halve the number of new infections in South Africa between now and 2038, especially if we get people on treatment more quickly. And as HIV in South Africa accounts for about 20% of infections globally, this impacts the global infection rate.\u201d Protection at work Better legal protection against sexual harassment and violence at work was promised after the adoption of a \u201cmilestone\u201d treaty by a UN agency, the International Labour Organization. A global set of standards has been established for working women in countries that ratify the treaty to prevent, identify and provide redress in cases of gender-based violence and harassment. More than one in three countries currently lack protections for some 235 million women on sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. Free healthcare Senegal became the first African country to begin providing free treatment for women with breast or cervical cancer (the leading cause of cancer deaths), and Mali announced it would begin providing free healthcare for pregnant women and children under five in a \u201cbrave and bold\u201d move. In Mali the announcement was heralded as a \u201ctremendous\u201d moment for a country that has long struggled to contain preventable infectious diseases and where one in 10 children die before their fifth birthday. The Philippines passed a Universal Health Care Act, entitling all of its 107 million citizens to health insurance and medical treatment, and Malaysia started providing free healthcare insurance for the country\u2019s poorest 40%, providing coverage against 36 critical illnesses. Child marriage fatwa The year saw the first African summit on child marriage, in Senegal, which resulted in one of the world\u2019s most prestigious Islamic learning centres issuing a fatwa against the practice. The document was drawn up by the deputy grand imam of al-Azhar, considered by some Muslims to be the highest authority of Islamic jurisprudence. The fatwa states that marriage should be based on the consent of both parties and \u201cparticularly the young woman\u201d. Activists hope news of the fatwa will filter through to imams in countries with high rates of child marriage. About 12 million girls under the age of 18 are married each year.",

The Wolof language word embodies the complex idea of societal expectations that dictate a woman must have \u201cpatience\u201d and \u201csilently endure\u201d any harsh realities \u2013 even rape \u2013 for fear that speaking out will upset the social fabric of the family and community. \u201cWe hold onto everything,\u201d says Mina. \u201cThe woman must put up with everything. Marriage is like that. Even if you speak to your own parents, they will say that you have to endure it.\u201d Hip-hop allows the women to go against the grain. \u201cIt talks about everything,\u201d says Mina of their art. \u201cEverything society does not want you to talk about. Rap does not shut up, rap does not have mu\u00f1.\u201d",

But you don\u2019t have to be resigned to cyber-victimhood. Give yourself, and your devices, a security update for 2020 and start fighting back.</p> <h2>Random and unique passwords</h2> <p>A study carried out by the <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/authentication-report/\" title=\"\">Ponemon Institute</a> found that 51% of individuals in the UK reuse an average of five passwords across different sites and services. \u201cThis makes your accounts far easier to hack,\u201d says Nic Sarginson, senior solutions engineer at security firm Yubico. \u201cBy gaining access to one account an attacker could quite easily crack another.\u201d It\u2019s the cyber-equivalent of having one key that unlocks your front door, your office, your car and the bank for good measure, and then keeping a spare under the doormat. \u201cEvery year billions of credentials such as email addresses, passwords and personal information are shared and traded online by cybercriminals,\u201d says Dr Richard Gold, director of security engineering at Digital Shadows. You can see if any of yours have been compromised already by going to <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\" title=\"\">haveibeenpwned.com</a>. If you think coming up with a unique, long and random, complex password that you can remember for every account you use is impossible, you\u2019d be right. Unless you use a password-manager app, such as <a href=\"https://www.lastpass.com/\" title=\"\">LastPass</a> or <a href=\"https://1password.com/\" title=\"\">1Password</a>, which will not only generate the passwords for each site, but also store them securely and then automatically use the right ones when you need to log in. All you need to remember is the master password to unlock the app, and most will let you use your fingerprint on a smartphone instead of entering this every time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hackers don\u2019t like a liar \u2013 especially if the fibs are about the questions sites ask you as a\u00a0means of identification</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Smartphone self-destruct</h2> <p>Yes, seriously. Your smartphone is a treasure trove of data, and while your passwords are likely to be safe from prying eyes (your password manager will keep them encrypted), what about your email, social media apps, contacts etc? Criminals can use these to change passwords, take account control away from you, and commit fraud in your name or simply steal directly from you. \u201cMost people do not set any lock code on their devices,\u201d warns Fennel Aurora, security adviser at F-Secure. A long password is most secure. Even if you\u2019ve set up a fingerprint scan to unlock your phone, it will ask for your pin or password after a few unsuccessful attempts. A thief can try to guess your pin (and 0000 is still a common option) or obvious password. Smartphones can be configured to automatically perform a factory reset, wiping all your data, after a certain number of incorrect unlock attempts. For Android check Settings/Security &amp; Location/Screen lock, and on iPhones, Settings/Face ID &amp; passcode/Erase data.</p> <h2>Secure your dumb \u2018smart\u2019 speakers</h2> <p>While you may have read about smart speakers being at risk from hackers with maliciously crafted audio tracks or lasers (yes, seriously), in the real world there are more pressing security and privacy issues to consider. The account holder can see any requests that have been made of the device; worth remembering when using one at a friend\u2019s house. To prevent this, tell Alexa to \u201cdelete what I just said\u201d, and Google Assistant to \u201cdelete my last conversation\u201d. That\u2019s assuming they have enabled the \u201cdelete by voice\u201d option in the account settings, of course \u2013 which,. as a courtesy to your friends and family, I\u2019d recommend doing for your smart speakers. While in the account settings, you can also delete past recordings for good measure. Using the \u201cvoice match\u201d function for Google Assistant can prevent your personal results being available to anyone but you, and possibly Jon Culshaw. If you have enabled purchasing and have one-click payments \u201con\u201d for your Amazon account, you can set a spoken pin to stop others shopping on your behalf and at your cost.</p> <h2>Become a cyber-liar</h2> <p>If there\u2019s one thing hackers really don\u2019t like, it\u2019s a liar. Especially if the fibs relate to those security questions sites ask you to answer as an identification method should you need to reset a forgotten password. \u201cMost of the answers to security questions like these are easily acquired by hackers,\u201d Tom Lysemose Hansen, founder of mobile app security vendor Promon, explains, \u201cusing simple trial-and-error methods based on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and even Wikipedia data, which give away much of our personal and family details.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s incredible, and incredibly worrying, what a simple Google search can uncover. Instead of being honest about your mother\u2019s maiden name, your place of birth, where you went to school or what you called your first pet, lie like a politician at election time. Of course, remembering fibs is harder than remembering the truth, and as with passwords, it\u2019s best to avoid reusing the same ones for every site. Password manager apps can help, as they have a secure notes entry for every login.</p> <h2>Stop using SMS-based 2FA</h2> <p>Two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds something you have to the something you know (your username and password) during login, is a must-have. This builds a second wall for the cybercriminal to climb if they have nabbed your password from somewhere. Use either an authenticator app such as <a href=\"https://authy.com/\" title=\"\">Authy</a> or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\" title=\"\">Google Authenticator</a>, or a hardware token like a <a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/\" title=\"\">YubiKey</a>. Don\u2019t use 2FA that sends codes by text message, as this can provide a ladder to climb that second wall with. \u201cIf your phone is stolen, the thief can put your sim in another phone and request an SMS code for resetting the password to all your accounts,\u201d warns Cesar Cerrudo, chief technology officer at security research company IOActive. Setting a pin on your sim card is recommended, but that won\u2019t help if someone cons your network provider into transferring your number to their device, a scam known as sim-swapping. \u201cSMS-based 2FA is vulnerable to sim-swap attacks,\u201d says Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech.com, \u201cbut if it\u2019s the only option, it\u2019s better than no 2FA at all.\u201d</p> <h2>Stay secure when away from home</h2> <p>There has been much coverage of \u201cjuice jacking\u201d of late. This involves a cybercriminal using altered USB charging ports in airports, train stations and hotels to infect your device with malware. You can carry a USB charger that plugs into a power socket or invest in a power-only USB charging cable to prevent this. A more widespread problem is that of free wireless internet access. \u201cCriminals can exploit public wifi to steal your personal information, such as emails, photos, passwords, private documents and bank details,\u201d Oz Alashe, CEO of CybSafe, says. Using a virtual private network (VPN) is recommended to reduce the risk. A VPN app creates an encrypted \u201ctunnel\u201d between your device and a remote server, protecting your data from snooping hackers. If you\u2019re using your phone to check your bank balance or pay bills on the train or in the coffee shop, a VPN provides \u201ca safety blanket that will help keep your data out of the wrong hands\u201d, Matt Lock, technical director at Varonis, says. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis has claimed at least two more lives, authorities confirmed on Tuesday, as dozens of fires tore through several towns on the east coast and forced thousands of people to take shelter on beaches. Two people \u2013 a father and son \u2013 died when fire hit the New South Wales town of Cobargo on Tuesday, while emergency services officials held grave fears for a third person, near Narooma, on the state\u2019s south coast. In Victoria, where more than 200,000ha has burned in the state\u2019s east, at least four people were unaccounted for. The armed forces stand ready to evacuate those sheltering on the state\u2019s beaches if needed. Eleven people have been confirmed dead across all states in this year\u2019s bushfire season so far. The NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, said it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d the state\u2019s worst bushfire season on record as he warned the reality of the damage would become clear only once the fires were under control. \u201cWe need to brace ourselves for a considerable number of properties, a considerable number of homes that are likely to have been damaged and or destroyed right across these eight emergency warning fire areas, given the extraordinary nature of the fire behaviour and fire spread today,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen extraordinary fire behaviour,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat we really need is meaningful rain, and we haven\u2019t got anything in the forecast at the moment that says we\u2019re going to get drought-breaking or fire-quenching rainfall.\u201d In his new year message, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the fires were having a \u201cdevastating impact\u201d and warned that the weeks and months ahead would \u201ccontinue to be difficult\u201d. \u201cI wish we had better news on New Year\u2019s Eve but one news we can always take comfort in is the amazing spirit of Australians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have faced these disasters before and we have come through.\u201d The fire crisis swept up the coast during the day, beginning with dramatic scenes in Mallacoota, in the far south-eastern corner of Victoria, where about 4,000 people fled their homes and took refuge on the beach and in boats as multiple fires surrounded the town, turning the sky black by 9am, and then a hazy red. Late in the day, there was a rare flash of hope when changes in wind direction meant that the fires subsided in Mallacoota, but authorities said numerous homes had been lost.

As the day progressed, similar scenes unfolded all the way up the NSW south coast, including in large towns such as Batemans Bay and popular holiday destinations such as Bermagui in the south, all the way up to Jervis Bay, 250km further north. Cobargo, a village a few kilometres inland from Bermagui, lost much of its main street as the fires swept through. Further north the town of Mogo suffered similar devastation, although dozens of animals in its popular wildlife park were saved by staff. Late on Tuesday evening, NSW police announced that all telecommunications would be lost for a 150km stretch of the coast between Nowra and Moruya. More than 120 bushfires were still ablaze on Tuesday evening, including eight at emergency level, and crews were concerned some blazes in Victoria could jump the border into NSW fuelled by a southerly wind. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, announced that the Australian Defence Force would deploy helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels to assist in supplying and potentially evacuating people trapped by the Victorian fires, after a request from the state premier, Daniel Andrews. Victorian authorities are yet to quantify the damage across East Gippsland but said a \u201csignificant\u201d number of homes had been lost and at least one primary school destroyed, while many livestock are also expected to have died. Of the four people missing across East Gippsland, Andrews said: \u201cWe do have very real fears for their safety.

Pictures posted to social media from countless small communities up and down the coast and inland suggested a huge number of properties had been destroyed, adding to the 900 confirmed lost in New South Wales in this year\u2019s fire season until last week. On Tuesday evening, large fires were still burning out of control including the 31,000ha Clyde Mountain fire near Batemans Bay, the 26,000ha Green Valley fire east of Albury and the 64,000ha Countegany fire east of Cooma .

      "body": "<p>Half of the nation\u2019s farmland needs to be transformed into woodlands and natural habitat to fight the climate crisis and restore wildlife, according to a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government.</p> <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd said such a change could mean the amount of cattle and sheep would fall by 90%, with farmers instead being paid for storing carbon dioxide, helping prevent floods and providing beautiful landscapes where people could boost their health and wellbeing.</p> <p>Boyd said the public were subsidising the livestock industry to produce huge environmental damage. The professor spent seven years at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs before stepping down in August. Half of farmland, mostly uplands and pasture, produces just 20% of the UK\u2019s food and would be better for used other public goods, he said.</p> <p>Boyd, who became vegetarian during his time in Defra, said farmers were potentially \u201csitting on a goldmine\u201d in terms of the payments they could receive for growing trees and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. </p> <p>He said: \u201cWe need a large, radical transformation and we need to do it quickly, in the next decade. You can tick an immense number of boxes simultaneously.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers argue that uplands and pasture where livestock are reared cannot be used to grow crops. But Boyd said: \u201cIt would be much better to store carbon and water, grow trees and make the land available for people to improve their health and welfare.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/16/true-cost-of-cheap-food-is-health-and-climate-crises-says-commission\">True cost of cheap food is health and climate crises, says commission</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the 20% of food production lost by converting half of farmland could be made up by the development of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/06/vertical-farming-explained-erik-murchie\">vertical farms</a>, where food is produced indoors in controlled and more efficient conditions. Boyd said:<strong> </strong>\u201cI know there are big companies looking at how to really scale this up.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown\">studies</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/beef-eating-must-fall-drastically-as-world-population-grows-report\">have concluded</a> that people in rich nations need to eat much less meat to tackle the climate emergency and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/28/healthy-diet-means-a-healthy-planet-study-shows\">improve their health</a>. \u201cMost of the livestock production in the UK is unprofitable without public subsidy,\u201d said Boyd. \u201cThe public are subsidising the production of livestock to produce huge environmental damages, all the way from greenhouse gas emissions to water pollution. Why should we continue to do that? It\u2019s not sensible.</p> <p>\u201cIf anybody asked me: \u2018If there is one thing I can do to help save the planet, what would it be?\u2019 I would say just eat a lot less meat. It\u2019s the easiest thing to do. I\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p> <p>People could reduce the meat they eat by 90% and have a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/new-plant-focused-diet-would-transform-planets-future-say-scientists\">perfectly balanced diet</a>, Boyd said: \u201cFreeing up 50% of the land would probably result in a reduction in the amount of livestock by about that amount, because it would be mostly livestock land we would be taking out of production.\u201d</p> <p>Farmers should be paid for changing the way land is used, he said. Current subsidies are largely based on the amount of land owned, but the government has <a href=\"https://www.endsreport.com/article/1669299/queens-speech-government-pledges-return-environment-bill\">pledged it will \u201cmove to a system based on public money for public goods\u201d</a> after the UK leaves the EU\u2019s subsidy regime.</p> <p>Farmland covers 70% of the UK, meaning that converting half to woodlands and parks would create new landscapes across a third of the country. In May, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/21/rewild-quarter-uk-fight-climate-crisis-campaigners-urge\">report from Rewilding Britain</a> called for a quarter of the nation to be returned to natural habitat.</p> <p>The National Farmers Union recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/10/no-need-to-cut-beef-to-tackle-climate-crisis-say-farmers\">published its plan</a> to end the climate-heating emissions from agriculture by 2040. It said this could be done without cutting beef production or converting large areas of farmland into forest. Instead, the NFU said 75% of the UK\u2019s agricultural emissions could be offset by growing plant fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Responding to Boyd\u2019s proposal, Guy Smith, the NFU\u2019s deputy president, said: \u201cUrgent action is needed to tackle the climate emergency. British farmers are already some of the most sustainable in the world. For example, the beef produced in Britain is already 2.5 times more efficient than the global average. And they are committed to doing even more.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, we will not halt climate change by curbing sustainable, British production and exporting it to countries which may not have the same climate ambition as we do here.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd said: \u201cThis proposal is not about being negative about farmers. It\u2019s about being positive about their futures and helping them to adapt and continue providing support for society, but in a different way from in the past.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Half of the nation\u2019s farmland needs to be transformed into woodlands and natural habitat to fight the climate crisis and restore wildlife, according to a former chief scientific adviser to the UK government. Prof Sir Ian Boyd said such a change could mean the amount of cattle and sheep would fall by 90%, with farmers instead being paid for storing carbon dioxide, helping prevent floods and providing beautiful landscapes where people could boost their health and wellbeing. Boyd said the public were subsidising the livestock industry to produce huge environmental damage. The professor spent seven years at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs before stepping down in August. Half of farmland, mostly uplands and pasture, produces just 20% of the UK\u2019s food and would be better for used other public goods, he said. Boyd, who became vegetarian during his time in Defra, said farmers were potentially \u201csitting on a goldmine\u201d in terms of the payments they could receive for growing trees and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. He said: \u201cWe need a large, radical transformation and we need to do it quickly, in the next decade. You can tick an immense number of boxes simultaneously.\u201d Farmers argue that uplands and pasture where livestock are reared cannot be used to grow crops. But Boyd said: \u201cIt would be much better to store carbon and water, grow trees and make the land available for people to improve their health and welfare.\u201d He said the 20% of food production lost by converting half of farmland could be made up by the development of vertical farms, where food is produced indoors in controlled and more efficient conditions. Boyd said: \u201cI know there are big companies looking at how to really scale this up.\u201d A series of studies have concluded that people in rich nations need to eat much less meat to tackle the climate emergency and improve their health. \u201cMost of the livestock production in the UK is unprofitable without public subsidy,\u201d said Boyd. \u201cThe public are subsidising the production of livestock to produce huge environmental damages, all the way from greenhouse gas emissions to water pollution. Why should we continue to do that? It\u2019s not sensible. \u201cIf anybody asked me: \u2018If there is one thing I can do to help save the planet, what would it be?\u2019 I would say just eat a lot less meat. It\u2019s the easiest thing to do. I\u2019ve done it.\u201d People could reduce the meat they eat by 90% and have a perfectly balanced diet, Boyd said: \u201cFreeing up 50% of the land would probably result in a reduction in the amount of livestock by about that amount, because it would be mostly livestock land we would be taking out of production.\u201d Farmers should be paid for changing the way land is used, he said. Current subsidies are largely based on the amount of land owned, but the government has pledged it will \u201cmove to a system based on public money for public goods\u201d after the UK leaves the EU\u2019s subsidy regime. Farmland covers 70% of the UK, meaning that converting half to woodlands and parks would create new landscapes across a third of the country. In May, a report from Rewilding Britain called for a quarter of the nation to be returned to natural habitat. The National Farmers Union recently published its plan to end the climate-heating emissions from agriculture by 2040. It said this could be done without cutting beef production or converting large areas of farmland into forest. Instead, the NFU said 75% of the UK\u2019s agricultural emissions could be offset by growing plant fuel for power stations and then capturing and burying the carbon dioxide. Responding to Boyd\u2019s proposal, Guy Smith, the NFU\u2019s deputy president, said: \u201cUrgent action is needed to tackle the climate emergency. British farmers are already some of the most sustainable in the world. For example, the beef produced in Britain is already 2.5 times more efficient than the global average. And they are committed to doing even more. \u201cHowever, we will not halt climate change by curbing sustainable, British production and exporting it to countries which may not have the same climate ambition as we do here.\u201d Boyd said: \u201cThis proposal is not about being negative about farmers. It\u2019s about being positive about their futures and helping them to adapt and continue providing support for society, but in a different way from in the past.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>New Year\u2019s Eve should be the perfect occasion for photographs \u2013 friends get together, everyone dresses up. But often by the end of the night you\u2019re left with a stack of blurry, grainy or generally mortifying pictures. Tiah Eckhardt, a model and blogger who\u2019s turned posing into a fine art, and Sonny Vandevelde, a fashion photographer known best for his joyous backstage shots, chime in on how even amateurs can walk away from the night with happy snaps they\u2019re actually happy with. </p> <h2><strong>Look into the light</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThe first thing I always think about is light ... where\u2019s the light source coming from?\u201d Eckhardt advises. \u201cIs it an on-camera flash? Is it coming from the side? Above, below? I will reflexively change my position for the light ... There\u2019s certain things that look flattering in photos and that people universally find attractive.\u201d She suggests posing to emphasise your cheekbones, and ensure light is hitting your eyes \u2013 even if it feels uncomfortable in the moment \u2013 so they\u2019ll look brighter in the picture. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a light above you and you tilt your head up to the light, it\u2019ll cast a shadow down your cheek bones and makes your mouth look like a nice shape, it\u2019ll get the light into your eyeballs. Where as if you tilt your head down, under an overhead light, you\u2019ll look like a skull. You literally look like a decaying corpse.\u201d If the light is coming from below \u201ctilt your head down because that\u2019ll get the same result \u2013 light bright eyes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tiah Eckhardt posing in a rickshaw, with her head tilted up to catch the light.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

It\u2019s not getting those candid shots.\u201d</p> <p>Eckhardt too notes that camera phone flashes can be \u201cbrutally unforgiving\u201d. If you\u2019re shooting in low light, and your smartphone\u2019s flash is the only option, she suggests \u201cyou\u2019re going to want to look directly at [the camera]. Don\u2019t tilt up, don\u2019t look down and maybe lift your neck towards the flash. Tilt your body back, lean forward on a slight angle, and that\u2019s going to be the most flattering way of coping with the hell that is a cellphone camera flash.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Consider going analogue</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look bad in a Polaroid,\u201d notes Eckhardt. In terms of posing for Polaroids, she suggests using a similar technique to posing for other flash photographs. \u201cA Polaroid camera is much the same thing because it\u2019s an on-camera flash, but it\u2019s more flattering.\u201d</p> <p>Vandevelde agrees: \u201cI love Polaroids.\u201d However, he warns \u201cthe problem is over time they will fade. So I always tell people if you\u2019ve gone out at night and taken a whole bunch of Polaroids and have great shots, do yourself a massive favour and get them on a flatbed scanner and scan them at 300DPI so you\u2019ve got a good digital copy as well. In 10 years time the UV will have faded the Polaroid, but you\u2019ll have a backup.\u201d</p> <p>He also suggests that the wedding-party trick of handing out disposable cameras can work for other social occasions too. \u201cBut make sure you save a couple for later on in the evening!\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t forget your settings</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only worth working with a camera if you have experience with the camera and know how to change the settings,\u201d says Vandevelde. This is true whether you\u2019re using the inbuilt app on your smartphone, a smartphone app with more manual settings, or a DSLR.</p> <p>For instance, when shooting at night, \u201cif you use a flash and just have a camera on auto-settings, the background might become too dark. You\u2019ll have a really nice exposure on the subject in the foreground but then you\u2019re not capturing the ambience in the background.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"A flash photograph, taken at night, from Sonny Vandevelde's Instagram page\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

In those shots, if you\u2019re not letting enough light into the photograph, the fireworks will \u201ccompletely disappear\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Plan before you pose</strong></h2> <p>If you know you\u2019re going to be posing for photographs, Eckhardt suggests taking a quick snap of yourself before you leave the house. She has won jobs with this trick before. \u201cI would get ready for a casting and I would take Polaroids or a digital photo of myself after I\u2019d done my hair and makeup, and if I didn\u2019t look right, I would keep tweaking it until it looked good for the photo, not good to the eye ... I knew once I left they\u2019d look through 30 photos of me... So I didn\u2019t do my makeup to look good for the person I was talking to, I did it to look good for the photos when they went back over them.\u201d</p> <p>Just before the camera goes off, she suggests thinking about something that will make your face light up. Posing is \u201clike any kind of acting ... with a camera you\u2019ve got a second to do it. So you\u2019ve got to think of something and then your eyes are alive.\u201d</p> <p>Vandevelde suggests moving around a bit as you\u2019re being photographed, \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about night-time and party and event photography, I prefer to capture movement, even if it\u2019s just walking \u2026 a flick of a dress \u2026 When people are talking with each other and they\u2019re smiling, capturing that reaction is a moment in time, and it\u2019s real.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>More is more</strong></h2> <p>Vandevelde suggests that you should not take your camera out at the beginning of a party. \u201cI think the main key is wait till people have had a couple of drinks ... people will get looser, they\u2019ll start having more fun.\u201d From there \u201cthe more photos you take the merrier. Snap away!\u201d</p> <p>Eckhardt loves candid shots, but she notes that often \u201cit\u2019s just luck. A candid photo is either brilliant or awful. And it\u2019s brilliant because it\u2019s capturing something genuine, or it\u2019s awful because you\u2019re doing something stupid. I think with a candid photo, four out of five will be awful and the other one will be great. Because you can\u2019t fake whatever it is that you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "New Year\u2019s Eve should be the perfect occasion for photographs \u2013 friends get together, everyone dresses up. But often by the end of the night you\u2019re left with a stack of blurry, grainy or generally mortifying pictures. Tiah Eckhardt, a model and blogger who\u2019s turned posing into a fine art, and Sonny Vandevelde, a fashion photographer known best for his joyous backstage shots, chime in on how even amateurs can walk away from the night with happy snaps they\u2019re actually happy with. Look into the light \u201cThe first thing I always think about is light ... where\u2019s the light source coming from?\u201d Eckhardt advises. \u201cIs it an on-camera flash? Is it coming from the side? Above, below? I will reflexively change my position for the light ... There\u2019s certain things that look flattering in photos and that people universally find attractive.\u201d She suggests posing to emphasise your cheekbones, and ensure light is hitting your eyes \u2013 even if it feels uncomfortable in the moment \u2013 so they\u2019ll look brighter in the picture. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a light above you and you tilt your head up to the light, it\u2019ll cast a shadow down your cheek bones and makes your mouth look like a nice shape, it\u2019ll get the light into your eyeballs. Where as if you tilt your head down, under an overhead light, you\u2019ll look like a skull. You literally look like a decaying corpse.\u201d If the light is coming from below \u201ctilt your head down because that\u2019ll get the same result \u2013 light bright eyes.\u201d Use flash wisely While it might work alright for a posed, group photograph, Vandevelde suggests: \u201cWhen you take a photo on the iPhone with flash, it takes so long, and that moment\u2019s gone.\u201d He says in the seconds between taking the photo and the flash going off, your subject might be halfway across the room. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting those in the moment shots. It\u2019s not getting those candid shots.\u201d Eckhardt too notes that camera phone flashes can be \u201cbrutally unforgiving\u201d. If you\u2019re shooting in low light, and your smartphone\u2019s flash is the only option, she suggests \u201cyou\u2019re going to want to look directly at [the camera]. Don\u2019t tilt up, don\u2019t look down and maybe lift your neck towards the flash. Tilt your body back, lean forward on a slight angle, and that\u2019s going to be the most flattering way of coping with the hell that is a cellphone camera flash.\u201d Consider going analogue \u201cIt\u2019s hard to look bad in a Polaroid,\u201d notes Eckhardt. In terms of posing for Polaroids, she suggests using a similar technique to posing for other flash photographs. \u201cA Polaroid camera is much the same thing because it\u2019s an on-camera flash, but it\u2019s more flattering.\u201d Vandevelde agrees: \u201cI love Polaroids.\u201d However, he warns \u201cthe problem is over time they will fade. So I always tell people if you\u2019ve gone out at night and taken a whole bunch of Polaroids and have great shots, do yourself a massive favour and get them on a flatbed scanner and scan them at 300DPI so you\u2019ve got a good digital copy as well. In 10 years time the UV will have faded the Polaroid, but you\u2019ll have a backup.\u201d He also suggests that the wedding-party trick of handing out disposable cameras can work for other social occasions too. \u201cBut make sure you save a couple for later on in the evening!\u201d Don\u2019t forget your settings \u201cIt\u2019s only worth working with a camera if you have experience with the camera and know how to change the settings,\u201d says Vandevelde. This is true whether you\u2019re using the inbuilt app on your smartphone, a smartphone app with more manual settings, or a DSLR. For instance, when shooting at night, \u201cif you use a flash and just have a camera on auto-settings, the background might become too dark. You\u2019ll have a really nice exposure on the subject in the foreground but then you\u2019re not capturing the ambience in the background.\u201d This is especially important for taking photographs with fireworks in the background. In those shots, if you\u2019re not letting enough light into the photograph, the fireworks will \u201ccompletely disappear\u201d. Plan before you pose If you know you\u2019re going to be posing for photographs, Eckhardt suggests taking a quick snap of yourself before you leave the house. She has won jobs with this trick before. \u201cI would get ready for a casting and I would take Polaroids or a digital photo of myself after I\u2019d done my hair and makeup, and if I didn\u2019t look right, I would keep tweaking it until it looked good for the photo, not good to the eye ...

So I didn\u2019t do my makeup to look good for the person I was talking to, I did it to look good for the photos when they went back over them.\u201d Just before the camera goes off, she suggests thinking about something that will make your face light up. Posing is \u201clike any kind of acting ... with a camera you\u2019ve got a second to do it. So you\u2019ve got to think of something and then your eyes are alive.\u201d Vandevelde suggests moving around a bit as you\u2019re being photographed, \u201cIf we\u2019re talking about night-time and party and event photography, I prefer to capture movement, even if it\u2019s just walking \u2026 a flick of a dress \u2026 When people are talking with each other and they\u2019re smiling, capturing that reaction is a moment in time, and it\u2019s real.\u201d More is more Vandevelde suggests that you should not take your camera out at the beginning of a party. \u201cI think the main key is wait till people have had a couple of drinks ... people will get looser, they\u2019ll start having more fun.\u201d From there \u201cthe more photos you take the merrier. Snap away!\u201d Eckhardt loves candid shots, but she notes that often \u201cit\u2019s just luck. A candid photo is either brilliant or awful. And it\u2019s brilliant because it\u2019s capturing something genuine, or it\u2019s awful because you\u2019re doing something stupid. I think with a candid photo, four out of five will be awful and the other one will be great. Because you can\u2019t fake whatever it is that you\u2019re doing.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The UK government is to raise concerns with the authorities in Cyprus over the fairness of a trial in which a British teenager was found guilty of lying about being gang-raped.</p> <p>A judge ruled on Monday that the 19-year-old wilfully indulged in public mischief in claiming she was raped by a group of Israeli males aged between 15 and 22 while she was on holiday in Ayia Napa in July.</p> <p>The ruling by Michalis Papathanasiou at Famagusta\u2019s district court in Paralimni was immediately and strongly condemned by the defence team and rights groups. They claimed the trial was full of legal irregularities that called the verdict into question and suggested a desire to protect relations with Israel may have influenced the process.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cThe UK is seriously concerned about the fair trial guarantees in this deeply distressing case and we will be raising the issue with the Cypriot authorities.\u201d</p> <p>The case against the student hinged on a statement retracting her original accusation, signed after hours of questioning by detectives in a police station that was neither recorded nor attended by a lawyer. She said in court that the police had forced her to change her story, telling the judge she was \u201cscared for my life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe there have been many violations of procedure and the rights of a fair trial,\u201d her defence lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou, said. Moments earlier, the defendant and her mother had emerged from the courthouse wearing masks with images of sewn-up lips on them, brought by protesters from the Network Against Violence Against Women (NAVAW), who filled the court and demonstrated outside.</p> <p>Charalambidou said: \u201cWe are planning to appeal the decision before the supreme court, and if justice fails \u2026 take our case to the European court of human rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe judge has been very strict,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cHe has rejected all the witnesses of defence and our repeated requests to expedite the case.\u201d</p> <p>The legal aid group Justice Abroad said the trial had been far from fair because Papathanasiou had refused to consider whether the defendant had actually been assaulted.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not surprised by the result given the frequent refusal during the trial of the judge to consider evidence which supported the fact that the teenager had been raped,\u201d said Michael Polak, a barrister with the group.</p> <p>\u201cShutting down questioning from our Cypriot advocates and the production of evidence into the trial on a handful of occasions, the judge stridently stated, \u2018This is not a rape case, I will not consider whether she was raped or not.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The way court proceedings had been conducted violated Cypriot, European community and European human rights law, he claimed.</p> <p>Among those called to testify was Dr Marios Matsakis, a prominent forensic pathologist who told the court he was entirely convinced \u201cviolence was exercised\u201d during the alleged incident. Scratch marks and bruising on the teenager\u2019s body were \u201cconsistent with rape having taken place\u201d, he said.</p> <p>But Papathanasiou insisted the young woman had fabricated an imaginary offence. \u201cThe guilt of the accused is proven. She has confessed,\u201d he pronounced.</p> <p>The Briton looked visibly stunned, as the judge announced that sentencing would be deferred until 7 January. Her mother burst into tears.</p> <p>The teenager, who has already spent a month in prison, could be jailed for up to a year and fined in excess of \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3850). Although released on bail from Nicosia general prison, she has been forced to relinquish her passport, moving from safe house to safe house ever since.</p> <p>Describing the verdict as \u201cabsolutely astonishing\u201d, her mother told ITV News: \u201cIt would be an absolute injustice if they decide to imprison her for any more days than the four and a half weeks she\u2019s already spent in prison.</p> <p>\u201cShe is resolute to see justice, she\u2019s absolutely resolute that she\u2019ll fight it, she wants to appeal and I will fully support her 100%, as will her lawyers. So we\u2019ll continue on with appeal and go down that route. If we end up in the European court of human rights, that\u2019s great.\u201d</p> <p>The case has made headlines in Cyprus, Israel and the UK ever since the young woman, who was in the country on a working holiday, reported the alleged gang rape. She told police how she had been having consensual sex with one of the Israelis when the others came in, and she was pinned down and attacked.</p> <p>The men, most of whom were about to enter the army as conscripts, were rounded up and remanded in custody. The woman revoked the criminal complaint weeks later, issuing a statement that changed her status from victim to suspect overnight. The alleged assailants were allowed to return home the next day, flying into Ben Gurion airport where they were greeted as heroes.</p> <p>The defence team later described the confession, extracted after eight hours of police questioning, as the product of coercion. They argued its poor English and grammar made clear that the \u201chighly educated\u201d teenager had not written it. </p> <p>Ritsa Pekri, defending, asked the judge on Monday to mitigate the sentence, saying the young woman suffered from psychological problems and was taking antidepressants.</p> <p>Rights groups have described the trial \u2013 which was beset with frequent adjournments and unexpected twists \u2013 as a travesty of justice. Senior officials in Cyprus\u2019s criminal justice system have also voiced objections, saying privately that the island\u2019s attorney general should have dismissed court proceedings.</p> <p>Local protesters gathered at the court in a display of solidarity with the defendant for the first time on Monday. Holding banners aloft in the rain, the women, young and old, accused the Cypriot authorities of submitting to a deeply conservative society, one in which reports of rape are all too often ignored.</p> <p>They said court officials and police were neither trained nor sensitised in matters of gender, and alleged that national interests had influenced the verdict. </p> <p>\u201cWe are here to defend a 19-year-old girl who has been horribly punished because of political interests,\u201d said Andri Gioakatzi, who works in one of the sovereign UK base areas in the former British colony. \u201cShe has had to pay the price of Cyprus\u2019s desire to have good relations with Israel. That is why she has been through this and they let all the Israeli boys go.\u201d</p> <p>Filing into the packed courtroom for the morning hearing, the protesters angered assembled police and the judge by donning masks with the image of sewn-up lips. The masks symbolised the enforced silence women were often subjected to when they encountered violence, activists said. Papathanasiou ordered them to uncover their faces or face arrest for contempt of court.</p> <p>\u201cIt is extraordinary that the court felt threatened by this piece of cloth and should demand that we remove it,\u201d said Zelia Gregoriou, who teaches gender studies at the University of Cyprus and is a member of the newly created NAVAW.</p> <p>\u201cThis is certainly not the first case of rape in Cyprus and certainly not the first time that a rape complaint is ignored, but it also takes place at a very significant time when Cyprus is trying to reinvent its relationship with Israel both economically and as a partner in defence.\u201d</p> <p>As the race to tap gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean has intensified in recent years, the partitioned island\u2019s internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government has worked hard to forge ever better ties with Israel.</p> <p>The protesters said Monday\u2019s verdict also spoke of the desire of authorities to \u201clook good\u201d at a time when Cyprus\u2019s police force is facing unprecedented scrutiny for a string of perceived failures, including in detecting a serial killer who has since admitted killing seven foreign women and girls on the island.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that this young British woman is a victim of the need to seal that political friendship,\u201d said Gregoriou. \u201cShe was an essential sacrifice. We have come to help her belatedly, but help her we will.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

She said in court that the police had forced her to change her story, telling the judge she was \u201cscared for my life\u201d. \u201cWe believe there have been many violations of procedure and the rights of a fair trial,\u201d her defence lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou, said. Moments earlier, the defendant and her mother had emerged from the courthouse wearing masks with images of sewn-up lips on them, brought by protesters from the Network Against Violence Against Women (NAVAW), who filled the court and demonstrated outside. Charalambidou said: \u201cWe are planning to appeal the decision before the supreme court, and if justice fails \u2026 take our case to the European court of human rights.\u201d \u201cThe judge has been very strict,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cHe has rejected all the witnesses of defence and our repeated requests to expedite the case.\u201d The legal aid group Justice Abroad said the trial had been far from fair because Papathanasiou had refused to consider whether the defendant had actually been assaulted. \u201cWe are not surprised by the result given the frequent refusal during the trial of the judge to consider evidence which supported the fact that the teenager had been raped,\u201d said Michael Polak, a barrister with the group. \u201cShutting down questioning from our Cypriot advocates and the production of evidence into the trial on a handful of occasions, the judge stridently stated, \u2018This is not a rape case, I will not consider whether she was raped or not.\u2019\u201d The way court proceedings had been conducted violated Cypriot, European community and European human rights law, he claimed. Among those called to testify was Dr Marios Matsakis, a prominent forensic pathologist who told the court he was entirely convinced \u201cviolence was exercised\u201d during the alleged incident. Scratch marks and bruising on the teenager\u2019s body were \u201cconsistent with rape having taken place\u201d, he said. But Papathanasiou insisted the young woman had fabricated an imaginary offence. \u201cThe guilt of the accused is proven. She has confessed,\u201d he pronounced. The Briton looked visibly stunned, as the judge announced that sentencing would be deferred until 7 January. Her mother burst into tears. The teenager, who has already spent a month in prison, could be jailed for up to a year and fined in excess of \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3850). Although released on bail from Nicosia general prison, she has been forced to relinquish her passport, moving from safe house to safe house ever since. Describing the verdict as \u201cabsolutely astonishing\u201d, her mother told ITV News: \u201cIt would be an absolute injustice if they decide to imprison her for any more days than the four and a half weeks she\u2019s already spent in prison. \u201cShe is resolute to see justice, she\u2019s absolutely resolute that she\u2019ll fight it, she wants to appeal and I will fully support her 100%, as will her lawyers. So we\u2019ll continue on with appeal and go down that route. If we end up in the European court of human rights, that\u2019s great.\u201d The case has made headlines in Cyprus, Israel and the UK ever since the young woman, who was in the country on a working holiday, reported the alleged gang rape. She told police how she had been having consensual sex with one of the Israelis when the others came in, and she was pinned down and attacked. The men, most of whom were about to enter the army as conscripts, were rounded up and remanded in custody. The woman revoked the criminal complaint weeks later, issuing a statement that changed her status from victim to suspect overnight. The alleged assailants were allowed to return home the next day, flying into Ben Gurion airport where they were greeted as heroes. The defence team later described the confession, extracted after eight hours of police questioning, as the product of coercion. They argued its poor English and grammar made clear that the \u201chighly educated\u201d teenager had not written it. Ritsa Pekri, defending, asked the judge on Monday to mitigate the sentence, saying the young woman suffered from psychological problems and was taking antidepressants. Rights groups have described the trial \u2013 which was beset with frequent adjournments and unexpected twists \u2013 as a travesty of justice. Senior officials in Cyprus\u2019s criminal justice system have also voiced objections, saying privately that the island\u2019s attorney general should have dismissed court proceedings. Local protesters gathered at the court in a display of solidarity with the defendant for the first time on Monday. Holding banners aloft in the rain, the women, young and old, accused the Cypriot authorities of submitting to a deeply conservative society, one in which reports of rape are all too often ignored. They said court officials and police were neither trained nor sensitised in matters of gender, and alleged that national interests had influenced the verdict. \u201cWe are here to defend a 19-year-old girl who has been horribly punished because of political interests,\u201d said Andri Gioakatzi, who works in one of the sovereign UK base areas in the former British colony. \u201cShe has had to pay the price of Cyprus\u2019s desire to have good relations with Israel. That is why she has been through this and they let all the Israeli boys go.\u201d Filing into the packed courtroom for the morning hearing, the protesters angered assembled police and the judge by donning masks with the image of sewn-up lips. The masks symbolised the enforced silence women were often subjected to when they encountered violence, activists said. Papathanasiou ordered them to uncover their faces or face arrest for contempt of court. \u201cIt is extraordinary that the court felt threatened by this piece of cloth and should demand that we remove it,\u201d said Zelia Gregoriou, who teaches gender studies at the University of Cyprus and is a member of the newly created NAVAW. \u201cThis is certainly not the first case of rape in Cyprus and certainly not the first time that a rape complaint is ignored, but it also takes place at a very significant time when Cyprus is trying to reinvent its relationship with Israel both economically and as a partner in defence.\u201d As the race to tap gas deposits in the eastern Mediterranean has intensified in recent years, the partitioned island\u2019s internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government has worked hard to forge ever better ties with Israel. The protesters said Monday\u2019s verdict also spoke of the desire of authorities to \u201clook good\u201d at a time when Cyprus\u2019s police force is facing unprecedented scrutiny for a string of perceived failures, including in detecting a serial killer who has since admitted killing seven foreign women and girls on the island. \u201cThere is no doubt that this young British woman is a victim of the need to seal that political friendship,\u201d said Gregoriou. \u201cShe was an essential sacrifice. We have come to help her belatedly, but help her we will.\u201d",

Hundreds of young African football players like him arrive in Turkey every year to seek their fortune. In many cases, intermediaries bring them with the promise of a trial at one of the big clubs in Istanbul. The players pay up to $5,000 (\u00a33,800) for a \u201cfull package\u201d, including visa, accommodation and contacts with talent scouts.</p> <p>But many are left deeply disappointed. Shortly after Kibendo arrived in Turkey he found himself with an expired visa and none of the opportunities he had been promised.</p> <p> Communities often invest all their money in these young people, hoping they will become rich and lift those at home out of misery. But in most cases these young men find themselves stranded soon after they arrive.</p> <p>Sometimes there is no one waiting for them. In other cases, the trials are nothing but a show, with no real link to a football club. The young hopefuls find themselves alone, in a country they don\u2019t know, whose language they don\u2019t speak. None of them want to go back, having invested and risked so much just to get here.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Even when the \u201ctrial\u201d does take place it is often a sham. The footballers are brought to small pitches on the outskirts of town to show their abilities. But actually there are no scouts to watch. After a few hours, it is all over. They are simply told they have missed their opportunity, even though no opportunity actually existed.</p> <p>When their visa expires they are stranded and turn to Istanbul\u2019s African communities for help. They are ready to do any kind of job just to survive. Many start working illegally in factories \u2013 mostly producing shoes and T-shirts \u2013 or selling fake watches and perfumes to tourists. They are vulnerable and often blackmailed by criminal gangs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"673453628f4191ff02e55bbfdeab4cd1afc2251f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/673453628f4191ff02e55bbfdeab4cd1afc2251f/0_0_1276_850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julius Kugor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julius Kugor, a leading figure in Turkey\u2019s African community, at the stadium of Bes\u0327iktas\u0327, one of the biggest clubs in Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Italo Rondinella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Julius Kugor, a leading figure in Turkey\u2019s African community</p></li> </ul> <p>Julius Kugor has been fighting these scams for years.

The boys keep coming,\u201d says Kugor.</p> <p>To give these players an opportunity, a special \u201cAfrican Cup\u201d was created 15 years ago by the African community in Istanbul. In 2005, only six countries took part. Now the tournament includes teams from 16 nations. The purpose is to raise the profile of the players. On the terraces of Istanbul\u2019s small Ferik\u00f6y stadium, agents and scouts from all over Turkey are joined by colleagues from Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Cyprus and Bulgaria. They\u2019re on the lookout for low-cost, talented players.

      "bodyText": "For months, Yves Kibendo woke up every morning at 6am. He would leave his house in an ancient area of Istanbul, returning late in the evening, after working for 12 hours in a textile factory. He was paid under the table, or sometimes not at all. But Kibendo didn\u2019t come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to work long shifts in a factory, he came to play football. Fast and talented, Kibendo plays on the right wing. Hundreds of young African football players like him arrive in Turkey every year to seek their fortune. In many cases, intermediaries bring them with the promise of a trial at one of the big clubs in Istanbul. The players pay up to $5,000 (\u00a33,800) for a \u201cfull package\u201d, including visa, accommodation and contacts with talent scouts. But many are left deeply disappointed. Shortly after Kibendo arrived in Turkey he found himself with an expired visa and none of the opportunities he had been promised. Communities often invest all their money in these young people, hoping they will become rich and lift those at home out of misery. But in most cases these young men find themselves stranded soon after they arrive. Sometimes there is no one waiting for them. In other cases, the trials are nothing but a show, with no real link to a football club. The young hopefuls find themselves alone, in a country they don\u2019t know, whose language they don\u2019t speak. None of them want to go back, having invested and risked so much just to get here. Even when the \u201ctrial\u201d does take place it is often a sham. The footballers are brought to small pitches on the outskirts of town to show their abilities. But actually there are no scouts to watch. After a few hours, it is all over. They are simply told they have missed their opportunity, even though no opportunity actually existed. When their visa expires they are stranded and turn to Istanbul\u2019s African communities for help. They are ready to do any kind of job just to survive. Many start working illegally in factories \u2013 mostly producing shoes and T-shirts \u2013 or selling fake watches and perfumes to tourists. They are vulnerable and often blackmailed by criminal gangs. Julius Kugor, a leading figure in Turkey\u2019s African community Julius Kugor has been fighting these scams for years. A former footballer, he is now a leading figure in the African community in Turkey and campaigns to stop the trafficking. \u201cWe have written many times to the Turkish embassies in African countries, but nothing has changed. The boys keep coming,\u201d says Kugor. To give these players an opportunity, a special \u201cAfrican Cup\u201d was created 15 years ago by the African community in Istanbul. In 2005, only six countries took part. Now the tournament includes teams from 16 nations. The purpose is to raise the profile of the players. On the terraces of Istanbul\u2019s small Ferik\u00f6y stadium, agents and scouts from all over Turkey are joined by colleagues from Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Cyprus and Bulgaria. They\u2019re on the lookout for low-cost, talented players. At the end of the tournament, perhaps a dozen will find clubs. The African Cup tournament in Istanbul Sani Gideon got his big chance this way. A 29-year-old Nigerian, who plays on the left wing, he is one of the few who who has made it. Starting from this pitch in the suburbs, he ended up playing for Akhisarspor in the S\u00fcper Lig, Turkey\u2019s first division. But at the beginning it was difficult for him. He spent months doing cleaning jobs that paid only a few pounds a day. But today his story is an inspiration for many younger players. Whenever he can Gideon comes back to where it started and helps as a trainer for the Nigerian team. Sani Gideon, who now plays professionally. In recent years Turkey has become one of the major arrival points for migrants and refugees from the Middle East and central Asia. As well as the 3.6 million Syrians now living there with temporary protection status, hundreds of thousands of Afghans, Pakistanis and Iraqis have entered Turkey without legal documents.

I never thought that three years on little would have changed. In fact, the situation in Greece seems more bleak than ever. Looking back, I realise I was naive. We have not only failed, we have broken promises. Britain pledged to take 3,000 unaccompanied minors. We have taken just over 200. The conditions in the camps are squalid and chaotic. Interviewing people in their temporary homes, I started to imagine sharing a tiny tent, a space not big enough to stand up in, with my five family members. Even the thought is unfathomable. The first person I interviewed was a 24-year-old Afghan woman who had lost her sister on the journey from Afghanistan to Greece. As I watched tears stream down her face, I had to hold back my own. I hate asking the same reductive questions to each person I meet - \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d - knowing that what they say will never do justice to the pain and hardship of their journey. What I really wanted to ask everyone I met was \u201cHow do you survive here?\u201d, but the words wouldn\u2019t leave my lips for fear I would alienate them. Masouma Ibrahimi, 42, Afghanistan with Ali Aghbar, seven, and Ali Akbar, two. I weaved through muddy tracks in the tiny spaces between cramped tents, with a crisscross of cables above providing enough energy for a small light in each tent. Everywhere I looked, kids played in filth. I counted just two sets of portable cabin toilets for almost 13,000 people. Next to them, a pile of rubbish as tall as me. I was heartbroken to hear from countless women that they were unable go to the toilet alone at night for fear of being raped. Fatima Hosseini, 25 I met a 25-year-old Afghan woman called Fatima Hosseini. I will never forget her words. Practically speechless, I said softly: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She replied: \u201cEveryone comes here and says sorry.

      "body": "<p>The general election was not just a crushing defeat for Corbynism. It was a resounding verdict on the entire history of \u201cLabourism\u201d.</p> <p>Labourism is the name of a specific political ideology \u2013 a habit of political thought and action \u2013 that is almost unique to the British left. According to this belief, there is only one true vehicle for progressive politics, the Labour party. Trade unions have their place \u2013 to represent their members at an \u201cindustrial\u201d level, in workplaces and on shop floors \u2013 but actual political campaigning must be delegated to the party, and the primary focus of the party must be winning elections. No other party can ever represent the working class, and any political movement that is not subservient to either unions or party is to be treated with the greatest suspicion.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>According to Labourism, any political movement that is not subservient to either unions or party is to be treated with the greatest suspicion</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The naive belief in the unique political virtue of the Labour party consistently prevents it from developing creative political strategies. Decade after decade, Labour has pursued no other course than that of doggedly trying to win electoral majorities, under circumstances that are obviously unfavourable to that objective.</p> <p>Just consider this. Labour has never come from opposition to win a convincing parliamentary majority and then gone on to implement a radical programme. In 1945, when it won its first majority, Labour had the advantage of having been part of the wartime national government, in which capacity it was able to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20431729\" title=\"\">commission</a> and publicise the Beveridge report, which formed the basis for its 1945 manifesto. In 1997, the only time a Labour opposition won a large majority, it did so on the basis of a manifesto that had the full approval of Rupert Murdoch and the City of London. It\u2019s little wonder that the implementation of that programme saw the beginning of Labour\u2019s long decline in the northern heartlands.</p> <p>Under these circumstances, any sane person might conclude that the obvious thing to do would be for Labour to form alliances with other parties against their common enemies: the Conservative party, their media allies and an electoral system that is always biased in favour of swing voters in \u201cmiddle England\u201d \u2013 giving far more weight to the views of ageing provincial homeowners than any other social group. How many times must we see a Conservative party with an extreme rightwing programme win immense legislative power, even though more than half of voters chose parties with a completely different agenda?</p> <p>All of the European social democracies that Labour members have long dreamed of emulating use proportional representations to elect their parliaments. Almost all of the progressive policies that those countries have pursued have been enacted by parliamentary coalitions, often including smaller liberal parties like our own Liberal Democrats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0a1eb7d4df7e33d3850d20c40f6ca15068a53b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a1eb7d4df7e33d3850d20c40f6ca15068a53b4/0_0_4986_3324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn leaves his home in north London on 13 December 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Corbynism, for all of its \u201csocial movement\u201d rhetoric, never went beyond the limits of the Labourist ideology, although Corbyn and John McDonnell would have liked it to.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, most Labour MPs and all Labour leaders have been so resistant to this realisation that even the great radical Jeremy Corbyn threw away the chance to form a government in 2017. At that time, commentators and sympathisers like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB0bG2vP4OA\" title=\"\">Paul Mason</a> (and <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/publications/the-progressive-alliance-why-labour-needs-it/\" title=\"\">myself</a>) pleaded with the Labour leadership to do some kind of deal with the Greens and Lib Dems, standing down for each other in a few seats where each party had small but significant vote shares, in order to secure a Labour-led radical government. Had they done so, they could have formed a government, with the Greens, SNP and Lib Dems all very much junior partners in a broad coalition of the left and centre. I have it on good authority that the idea was discussed among senior party figures. But it was rejected out of hand. Once that opportunity was lost, Labour found itself caught in the cleft stick of Brexit, forced to campaign either for leave or a second-referendum, alienating a large section of its base either way. By 2019, the Corbyn project was doomed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/14/labour-meltdown-decades-govern-votes\">This Labour meltdown has been building for decades | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Another criticism of Labourism has always been that it is inherently uncomfortable with the dynamics of movements \u2013 the type which has flourished over the decade, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/occupy-london\" title=\"\">Occupy</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>.

      "bodyText": "The general election was not just a crushing defeat for Corbynism. It was a resounding verdict on the entire history of \u201cLabourism\u201d. Labourism is the name of a specific political ideology \u2013 a habit of political thought and action \u2013 that is almost unique to the British left. According to this belief, there is only one true vehicle for progressive politics, the Labour party. Trade unions have their place \u2013 to represent their members at an \u201cindustrial\u201d level, in workplaces and on shop floors \u2013 but actual political campaigning must be delegated to the party, and the primary focus of the party must be winning elections. No other party can ever represent the working class, and any political movement that is not subservient to either unions or party is to be treated with the greatest suspicion. The naive belief in the unique political virtue of the Labour party consistently prevents it from developing creative political strategies. Decade after decade, Labour has pursued no other course than that of doggedly trying to win electoral majorities, under circumstances that are obviously unfavourable to that objective. Just consider this. Labour has never come from opposition to win a convincing parliamentary majority and then gone on to implement a radical programme. In 1945, when it won its first majority, Labour had the advantage of having been part of the wartime national government, in which capacity it was able to commission and publicise the Beveridge report, which formed the basis for its 1945 manifesto. In 1997, the only time a Labour opposition won a large majority, it did so on the basis of a manifesto that had the full approval of Rupert Murdoch and the City of London. It\u2019s little wonder that the implementation of that programme saw the beginning of Labour\u2019s long decline in the northern heartlands. Under these circumstances, any sane person might conclude that the obvious thing to do would be for Labour to form alliances with other parties against their common enemies: the Conservative party, their media allies and an electoral system that is always biased in favour of swing voters in \u201cmiddle England\u201d \u2013 giving far more weight to the views of ageing provincial homeowners than any other social group. How many times must we see a Conservative party with an extreme rightwing programme win immense legislative power, even though more than half of voters chose parties with a completely different agenda? All of the European social democracies that Labour members have long dreamed of emulating use proportional representations to elect their parliaments. Almost all of the progressive policies that those countries have pursued have been enacted by parliamentary coalitions, often including smaller liberal parties like our own Liberal Democrats. And yet, most Labour MPs and all Labour leaders have been so resistant to this realisation that even the great radical Jeremy Corbyn threw away the chance to form a government in 2017. At that time, commentators and sympathisers like Paul Mason (and myself) pleaded with the Labour leadership to do some kind of deal with the Greens and Lib Dems, standing down for each other in a few seats where each party had small but significant vote shares, in order to secure a Labour-led radical government. Had they done so, they could have formed a government, with the Greens, SNP and Lib Dems all very much junior partners in a broad coalition of the left and centre. I have it on good authority that the idea was discussed among senior party figures. But it was rejected out of hand. Once that opportunity was lost, Labour found itself caught in the cleft stick of Brexit, forced to campaign either for leave or a second-referendum, alienating a large section of its base either way. By 2019, the Corbyn project was doomed. Another criticism of Labourism has always been that it is inherently uncomfortable with the dynamics of movements \u2013 the type which has flourished over the decade, from Occupy to Extinction Rebellion. The Labourist ideal is for party members and supporters to campaign enthusiastically, but obediently, as directed by the party at appropriate points in the electoral cycle. Any form of mobilisation beyond this always risks bringing into being cohorts of political actors who are difficult to discipline, risking the emergence of a movement that is outside the control of the party machine. Corbynism, for all of its \u201csocial movement\u201d rhetoric, never went beyond the limits of this Labourist ideology, although Corbyn and John McDonnell would have liked it to. Despite welcome innovations such as the creation of the community organising unit, what Corbyn\u2019s Labour never developed was the capacity to campaign, year round, in communities and on the streets, with a clear sense of what it was campaigning for (other than just a Labour government), and who it was campaigning against (other than just the Conservative party).

Exhibit A: casually stepping out in a cashmere cardigan worn so louchely that the matching cashmere bra underneath, available from Khaite for $520, sold out in minutes \u2013 no small feat for a bra that costs more than the average monthly food shop for a family of four.

There was Balenciaga\u2019s \u00a3600 water bottle bag, <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/medea-lipstick-case-beauty-bag\">bags made to fit lipsticks</a> and others perfectly tailored to fit phones.

      "bodyText": "The Celine Dion award for unexpected fashion icon: Katie Holmes For many, Holmes, now 40, will remain the awkward but erudite teen she played on Dawson\u2019s Creek 20 years ago. For others, she is the woman once married to that famous Scientologist who declared his love for her by jumping up and down on Oprah\u2019s sofa. But for followers of fashion, Holmes has become 2019\u2019s answer to Celine Dion \u2013 with Monica from Friends a close second. But while Dion whooped and clapped her way to style icon status from the front row of couture shows in 2017, wearing flashy Balenciaga and Off-White outfits, Holmes\u2019s ascent has been all together more low-key. Exhibit A: casually stepping out in a cashmere cardigan worn so louchely that the matching cashmere bra underneath, available from Khaite for $520, sold out in minutes \u2013 no small feat for a bra that costs more than the average monthly food shop for a family of four. Exhibit B: a chunky knit cardigan over a denim shirt with black leather trousers worn to a New York fashion show; a high-fashion version of what her Dawson\u2019s Creek character might have worn for a date with Pacey. The \u2018most fashion\u2019 flower: lavender Gypsophila might have had an autumn/winter moment, but it was the floral setting of the 10th anniversary show of French designer Jacquemus \u2013 labelled the kind of show \u201cthat Instagram was made for\u201d \u2013 that had the hearts of the botanically inclined beating the fastest. Hosted in a field in Provence, the soporific fleur de choix was the perfect backdrop for the designer\u2019s oversized blazers, bucket hats and bumbags. Most impractical accessory: the nano bag At Paris fashion week in March, the year\u2019s least useful accessory was carried between thumb and forefinger down the Jacquemus catwalk, bright red yet barely visible. The Mini Le Chiquito, as it is known, became the patron saint of the nano bags trend \u2013 utterly useless, they couldn\u2019t even fit your keys, and yet they became highly desirable, representing the ultimate power move. Who needs a massive tote when you have an assistant or car waiting? Nano bags are the younger sibling of this year\u2019s trend for extremely specific bags. There was Balenciaga\u2019s \u00a3600 water bottle bag, bags made to fit lipsticks and others perfectly tailored to fit phones. And the most stylish was part of Paco Rabanne\u2019s retro chainmail collection. The nano bag\u2019s place in 2019 fashion history was recently cemented when Lizzo pincered a Valentino version on the red carpet at the AMAs. As she put it on Instagram: \u201cbag big enough for my fucks to give\u201d. Most potent accessory: Lady Hale\u2019s spider brooch When the judge wore this arachnid accessory to announce that Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament was unlawful, people were quick to try to decode what message she might have been hoping to send. Was it that she had caught the democracy-dodging prime minister in a judicial web? Whatever was intended, the spider brooch, described by Vogue as \u201cmaximalist perfection\u201d, became a breakout star. But Lady Hale wasn\u2019t alone in sparking chatter with her brooch. The speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi wore a pin representing the Mace of the United States House of Representatives as she opened the debate about Trump\u2019s impeachment. It was quickly dubbed her \u201cpower pin\u201d. An honourable mention must also go to headbands. They might have less political heft than the brooch, but have almost as much historical weight as a Mantel novel, and made Anne Boleyn one of the year\u2019s unlikely style inspirations. Men\u2019s style inspiration: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet A sequinned Louis Vuitton hoodie on the carpet one day, an elephant-grey ensemble by Colombian-French designer Haider Ackermann the next; the Call Me By Your Name actor is unafraid of the bold, conceptual and sartorially tricky. But that adventurousness has not put people off. His style has won him the moniker \u201cthe most influential man in fashion\u201d, according to Lyst\u2019s 2019 report, which analyses the behaviour of more than 104 million shoppers. He was pipped to the post of the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Powerful Dresser\u201d only by HRH the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle herself. Proof that the unorthodox can be enviable in the sometimes identikit world of men\u2019s fashion. He even managed to make the world\u2019s trickiest hairstyle, the bowl cut, an unlikely hit. Most ubiquitous item: the spotty Zara dress It cost \u00a340, was hailed as being as comfortable as a nightie and was as ubiquitous on the UK\u2019s streets throughout the summer as chewing gum or pigeons. One article in the New York Times even claimed that the Zara dress had \u201cconquered Britain\u201d, so widespread was it. Plus, like the green Urban Outfitters puffer jacket and R\u00e9alisation Par leopard-print skirt before it, it had that most modern of popularity yardsticks: its own Instagram account complete with more than 20,000 followers. Best red carpet look: Billy Porter at the Oscars Porter\u2019s own take on the Christian Siriano gown he wore to the Oscars in February rang true: \u201cThat dress changed the world,\u201d he said. It was a two fingers up to the rigid gender diktats controlling red-carpet outfits \u2013 as Porter told Vogue at the time: \u201cWhen you\u2019re black and you\u2019re gay, one\u2019s masculinity is in question. I dealt with a lot of homophobia in relation to my clothing choices.\u201d This dress, he said, made him feel free. \u201cPeople are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown \u2013 but it\u2019s not anybody\u2019s business but mine.\u201d Hair trend: lilac This year, palma violets, hydrangeas and Googel the Muppet have been added to hairdresser moodboards across the land. In March, searches on Pinterest for \u201clilac hair\u201d rocketed by 1077%. And then, in May, when Kylie Jenner stepped on to the Met Gala red carpet with hair the colour of Syringa vulgaris, she cemented a trend that would see Instagram awash with lilac tresses long into the summer months. For autumn/winter, the trend evolved into more season-appropriate chocolate lilac hair. Best heels wearer: Harry Styles In a year in which Asos sold more than 12,000 pairs of Cuban-heel boots for men, the man with the David Bowie legs takes the crown as most accomplished wearer of such heels, after he wore them with aplomb \u2013 and a pearl earring \u2013 to the Met Gala in May. Honourable mention must also go to Lil Nas X who wore a chunky fluoro heel to match his fluoro suit, the work of this year\u2019s CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Award winner, Christopher John-Rogers, to the American Music Awards last month. Throwback hit: the Fendi baguette bag According to the 2019 Lyst report, there was a 164% rise in searches year on year for this 90s classic. For those who can afford it, it is the perfect accompaniment for all the spaghetti straps, slip dresses and balayage tresses that have made up this year\u2019s retro resurgence. Available for new thanks to Fendi relaunching it, or via the more sustainable secondhand route thanks to resale sites such as Vestiaire Collective, 2019 was the year to channel Carrie Bradshaw via your handbag. The saddest goodbye: Karl Lagerfeld His legacy in the wider world might be \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 mixed, but the fashion industry this year has been hit hard by the loss of the Chanel designer, who died in February. Known for catwalk spectaculars, it is fascinating to speculate what he would have made of the now-infamous YouTube comedian who crashed the catwalk at the first ready-to-wear collection produced entirely by his successor Virginie Viard. His memory lived on throughout the year, via The White Shirt project, a stadium-sized Parisian memorial and a new coffee table book of pictures of his cat Choupette. The happiest goodbye: the Victoria\u2019s Secret show It was the year in which unrealistic, prescriptive body standards, as championed by the Victoria\u2019s Secret brand, were pitted against the inclusivity of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty brand, which had its made-for-Amazon debut at New York fashion week in September. And, true to the unstoppability of the Barbadian star in the year in which she became luxury conglomerate LVMH\u2019s first black female designer, Rihanna came out on top. Last month it was announced that the Victoria\u2019s Secret show would be cancelled after months of speculation. The most improved garment: the cardigan When Kurt Cobain\u2019s stained, moth-eaten green cardigan reached \u00a3260,388 at auction in October it was symbolic of the value increasingly bestowed on this once overlooked garment. Where once cardigan wearers might fear being labelled \u201cdowdy\u201d, now they can stand proud thanks to the ascent of cardigans to catwalks from Alexander Wang and Chanel to Ashley Williams and Christopher Kane. Fashion\u2019s favourite author: Willa Cather Women from catwalks to pavements this year have been wearing frocks that wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place on the prairie. It was the look that wouldn\u2019t give up the Laura Ashley ghost, having kicked off in 2018 with Brooklyn designer Batsheva Hay as its poster girl. In 2019 it went mass, and wearing a dress with a jaw-high neckline, tibia-long hemline and plentiful valance-style dust-ruffle-frills was a quick way to look as if you knew your way around the pages of Vogue \u2013 and Willa Cather\u2019s novel O Pioneers! Most unlikely site of fashion buzz: the North Circular Road Not usually mentioned in the same breath as fashion industry buzz but the outer London home of traffic jams and self-storage depots became a hotspot this year when a collection by Louis Vuitton menswear designer and Kanye West protoge Virgil Abloh landed at the Wembley branch of Ikea. People queued through the night and the spot gained instant fashion credibility. As one queuer put it: \u201cWe are buying Louis Vuitton stuff for the price of Ikea.\u201d Most literal literal dresser: Melania Trump When Melania Trump headed to the UK in June, she did so in an outfit that, in a cod Cockney accent, said: \u201cLondon, baby\u201d. The Gucci dress was decorated with images of Tower Bridge, Big Ben and a double-decker bus. For the year\u2019s best example of \u201cliteral dressing\u201d look no further than Rihanna at the cricket in Durham \u2013 all in white but not a V-neck knit in sight.",

      "body": "<p>In 2019, \u201cI\u2019m making a podcast\u201d overtook \u201cI\u2019m writing a film script\u201d as the standard media dilettante response to that ever-tricky question: \u201cWhat do you do, exactly?\u201d Every week brought a new slew of podcasts. Sue Perkins launched one. David Dimbleby, too. Dawn O\u2019Porter, Stacey Solomon, Gemma Collins, even Robbie Williams... <br>The BBC, in particular, seemed to go podcast bananas, desperately flinging out new shows like they were old clothes. Some were great: <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07rn8fc\" title=\"\">Tom Neenan Is Not All Men</a></em> was hilarious; <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07mdbhg/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">You\u2019re Dead To Me</a></em> hilarious and informative.</p> <p>There were a couple of brilliant new BBC thriller docs: <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009jkb\" title=\"\">Intrigue: Tunnel 29</a></em>, about a group of people who tunnelled under the Berlin Wall and <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">The Missing Cryptoqueen</a></em>, about a bitcoin con-woman. <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04x5pd7/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">Fortunately\u2026 with Fi and Jane</a></em> continued to be one of the funniest and most popular shows out there. Plus the Beeb\u2019s chatty, inclusive sports podcasts are still second to none, with <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">That Peter Crouch Podcast</a></em> (football) and <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pcb4w/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">Tailenders</a></em> (cricket) continuing to bantz their way into thousands of hearts (not mine, but I\u2019m a grump). But despite all this podcastery hoo-ha, there are still many people who prefer radio and the transfer of BBC iPlayer\u2019s radio content to BBC Sounds in September caused much listener heartache and disgruntlement.</p> <p>Corporations such as Spotify and Audible also made great strides with their podcast offerings. Bigger media networks snapped up podcast rights to turn them into TV series or films: Universal is adapting Wondery\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/dr-death/\" title=\"\">Dr Death</a></em> for TV, following the success of true crime podcast <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/\" title=\"\">Dirty John</a></em> (also adapted by Universal) and drama <em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/limetownstories/\" title=\"\">Limetown</a></em> (adapted by Facebook Watch) this year. And shows about shows flowered too: there were podcasts about <em>Strictly</em>, <em>Peaky</em>, <em>The Crown</em>, <em>Love Island</em>, <em>His Dark Materials</em>, <em>Succession</em>. Audio does well when it appeals to a niche audience, a small crew of devotees, which is why, of course, celebrities love podcasts so much.</p> <p>Radio saw a lot of presenter upheaval, partly due to regulation change. Commercial broadcaster Global moved to national breakfast shows, with Amanda Holden joining Jamie Theakston on <em>Heart Breakfast</em>, very successfully. Chris Evans moved to Virgin, again, to much success. Simon Mayo went to Scala, John Humphrys left <em>Today</em> and depped for Tim Lihoreau on Classic FM for a week. This went so well that Humphrys has landed a new weekend show on the station, starting early next year. He joins Moira Stuart, who left Radio 2 to present her own show on Classic too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c93ba71c6e476343778a3e1f8d46b0a17360ad43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c93ba71c6e476343778a3e1f8d46b0a17360ad43/0_271_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC / Roscoe &amp; Rutter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This trend of big names \u2013 BBC or otherwise \u2013 being attracted to commercial radio stations looks set to continue, as does the creation of ever more niche stations. Bauer launched Scala plus Country Hits, Magic at the Musicals, Absolute Radio 00s as well as online stations Kiss Dance, Kiss Ibiza and Kiss Garage, among others; LBC launched <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/lbc-news-24-hour-national-rolling-news-station/\" title=\"\">LBC News</a>. On the BBC, things settled down at Radio 2 and 6 Music, with Sara Cox on 2 and Lauren Laverne on 6 managing their new slots particularly well. Emma Barnett and Nihal on 5 live were as good as they ever have been, which is extremely good indeed.</p> <p>Outside the mainstream, where all the interesting stuff occurs, George the Poet\u2019s podcast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/18/the-british-podcast-awards-review-george-the-poet\" title=\"\">rightly stormed the British Podcast awards</a> and led to his second series being broadcast on Radio 4.

Sue Perkins launched one. David Dimbleby, too. Dawn O\u2019Porter, Stacey Solomon, Gemma Collins, even Robbie Williams... The BBC, in particular, seemed to go podcast bananas, desperately flinging out new shows like they were old clothes. Some were great: Tom Neenan Is Not All Men was hilarious; You\u2019re Dead To Me hilarious and informative. There were a couple of brilliant new BBC thriller docs: Intrigue: Tunnel 29, about a group of people who tunnelled under the Berlin Wall and The Missing Cryptoqueen, about a bitcoin con-woman. Fortunately\u2026 with Fi and Jane continued to be one of the funniest and most popular shows out there. Plus the Beeb\u2019s chatty, inclusive sports podcasts are still second to none, with That Peter Crouch Podcast (football) and Tailenders (cricket) continuing to bantz their way into thousands of hearts (not mine, but I\u2019m a grump). But despite all this podcastery hoo-ha, there are still many people who prefer radio and the transfer of BBC iPlayer\u2019s radio content to BBC Sounds in September caused much listener heartache and disgruntlement. Corporations such as Spotify and Audible also made great strides with their podcast offerings. Bigger media networks snapped up podcast rights to turn them into TV series or films: Universal is adapting Wondery\u2019s Dr Death for TV, following the success of true crime podcast Dirty John (also adapted by Universal) and drama Limetown (adapted by Facebook Watch) this year. And shows about shows flowered too: there were podcasts about Strictly, Peaky, The Crown, Love Island, His Dark Materials, Succession. Audio does well when it appeals to a niche audience, a small crew of devotees, which is why, of course, celebrities love podcasts so much. Radio saw a lot of presenter upheaval, partly due to regulation change. Commercial broadcaster Global moved to national breakfast shows, with Amanda Holden joining Jamie Theakston on Heart Breakfast, very successfully. Chris Evans moved to Virgin, again, to much success. Simon Mayo went to Scala, John Humphrys left Today and depped for Tim Lihoreau on Classic FM for a week. This went so well that Humphrys has landed a new weekend show on the station, starting early next year. He joins Moira Stuart, who left Radio 2 to present her own show on Classic too. This trend of big names \u2013 BBC or otherwise \u2013 being attracted to commercial radio stations looks set to continue, as does the creation of ever more niche stations. Bauer launched Scala plus Country Hits, Magic at the Musicals, Absolute Radio 00s as well as online stations Kiss Dance, Kiss Ibiza and Kiss Garage, among others; LBC launched LBC News. On the BBC, things settled down at Radio 2 and 6 Music, with Sara Cox on 2 and Lauren Laverne on 6 managing their new slots particularly well. Emma Barnett and Nihal on 5 live were as good as they ever have been, which is extremely good indeed. Outside the mainstream, where all the interesting stuff occurs, George the Poet\u2019s podcast rightly stormed the British Podcast awards and led to his second series being broadcast on Radio 4. Indie producer Eleanor McDowall, of Falling Tree Productions, won several international awards for A Sense of Quietness, her beautiful documentary about women coming from Ireland to the UK to get abortions. And writer-director Julian Simpson followed up last year\u2019s The Case of Charles Dexter Ward with another spooky drama, The Whisperer in Darkness. All personal, all imaginative, all ambitious, all wonderful. Audio works best when it allows talented people to get on and do their thing. There is room for everyone now. The top 10 podcasts and radio shows of 2019 1. Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast? George the Poet\u2019s second series outshines all other podcasts for inventiveness, honesty and beauty. 2. Lights Out: A Sense of Quietness BBC Radio 4 Eleanor McDowall\u2019s adocumentary about Irish women seeking abortions in the UK won gold in the best radio documentary category at the Prix Europa, among many other awards. 3. The Emma Barnett Show BBC Radio 5 Live The indomitable Barnett has stormed through the year, taking no political prisoners. 4. LBC Global\u2019s flagship station goes from strength to strength. Let\u2019s hope they kick Farage off the airwaves. 5. Intrigue: Tunnel 29 BBC Radio 4/BBC Sounds Helena Merriman\u2019s brilliantly constructed, utterly gripping doc about an escape from East to West Germany. 6. Brexitcast BBC Sounds Inescapable, formidable, funny, informative. What will they do after Brexit? 7.

      "body": "<p>In 2004, when the year 2020 sounded futuristic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/25/2020.madeleinebunting\" title=\"\">the Guardian predicted it would by now be \u201cvery hard\u201d to talk about a \u201ctypical family\u201d.</a> Domestic units would be formed in myriad ways and \u201cchildren living with both their biological parents in the same household\u201d would be in the minority.</p> <p>This hasn\u2019t quite panned out. In the UK today, 84% of babies are born to parents who are married, in a civil partnership or co-habiting, although the statistics don\u2019t reveal all the real-life complexities (many of the parents will be starting second families, for instance). In 2019, 61% of families with dependent children have married or civil-partnered parents (the children may not be biologically related to both). In the US, fewer than half of children are living with two biological parents who are in their first marriage.</p> <p>We correctly predicted that, in heterosexual couples, an increasing number of women would be the breadwinner, but don\u2019t imagine these are all high-earning women easily carrying the financial burden; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/20/working-mothers-britain-breadwinner-statistics-income\" title=\"\">most are low-earners</a>, and the figures include single mothers. And we said that financial pressures on young adults would lead to people staying at home for longer. There has been a 46.3% increase in the number of young adults living with their parents in the two decades to 2019.</p> <p>But we overstated the attention we would be giving to the issue of how to care for an ageing population. \u201cBy 2020,\u201d we predicted, \u201cwe will be in the middle of the debate on the care deficit.\u201d The crisis is still there, and growing, but it is one of those issues that has been overshadowed, and exacerbated, by Brexit (there are 104,000 EU citizens working as carers in the UK). And we understated the extent to which we would invite technology into our family lives. \u201cWebcams might by 2020 be playing the role the telephone did in the 20th century, a vital communication link for families who might live hundreds of miles apart,\u201d we predicted in 2004. This wasn\u2019t wrong, but the quaint idea of \u201cwebcams\u201d \u2013 this was three years before Apple launched its iPhone, and everyone started uploading photographs of their children to a new site called Facebook \u2013 doesn\u2019t quite describe the proliferation of tech in everyday life.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly true that the family has changed immensely over the past few decades, and those trends are continuing. The number of people living alone is increasing, as is the number of women choosing not to have children, and we are having fewer children than before, too. \u201cA key change in family structure since the 1980s has been the rise of childbearing within cohabitation,\u201d says Ann Berrington, professor of demography and social statistics at the University of Southampton. \u201cThe proportion of births that take place in England and Wales outside marriage has doubled from around a quarter in 1988 to just under half today. Cohabiting families \u2013 with and without children \u2013 are the fastest-growing type of family in England and Wales. Evidence from qualitative research that we have undertaken suggests that while marriage is being rejected by a minority as an outdated, patriarchal institution, most people still view it in a positive light and as an ultimate goal.\u201d The number of same-sex couples has also risen, she says: \u201cAn increase of 53%, from 152,000 in 2015 to 232,000 in 2018. It seems likely that this diversity in family life will continue to increase in the coming decade, along with complex families \u2013 for example, stepfamilies resulting from repartnering.\u201d</p> <p>There have been developments in reproductive technology alongside changing social attitudes. \u201cCertainly, since the turn of this century, the two have come together to create family types that just wouldn\u2019t have been possible before,\u201d says Susan Golombok, the director of the Centre for Family Research at Cambridge University, and author of the forthcoming book We Are Family. But, she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell whether they are going to explode into something or not. One thing that we are studying is a small but growing number of people who are meeting each other over the internet in order to have children together, without a romantic relationship. We don\u2019t know how that works out for them or for the children yet, but it\u2019s certainly happening.</p> <p>\u201cOver the past couple of decades, we\u2019ve seen quite a rise in the number of single mothers by choice \u2013 the single women who decide to go it alone and have children, through donor insemination \u2013 but we\u2019re now beginning to see single fathers by choice. It\u2019s a very small group, but they do exist. Some of them are gay men, so that, in a way, is more obvious, but there are also single heterosexual men having children through surrogacy and egg donation. That\u2019s something that may grow.\u201d</p> <p>There is also a rise in the number of transgender parents. \u201cUntil very recently, transgender parents had children and then transitioned afterwards, but because of developments in assisted reproduction and people being able to preserve eggs and sperm, more transgender people are having children after their transition.\u201d She says this is likely to increase in the coming decades.</p> <p>Advances in technology will create ever-bigger ethical debates. So-called \u201cdesigner babies\u201d are already a reality, with parents able to select embryos to screen out inherited diseases and conditions. But by 2050, prospective parents could pay to select not only for good health but for traits such as intelligence, attractiveness or athleticism \u2013 the babies of rich parents could be genetically superior to those born to lower-income families.</p> <p>\u201cArtificial eggs and sperm are on the horizon,\u201d says Golombok, \u201cwhich will not just be helpful for infertile heterosexual couples but will allow same-sex couples to both be the biological parents of their children, because that will mean men can produce eggs and sperm, and so can women. For single people who want to have children, it would even be possible for them to produce eggs and sperm.\u201d</p> <p>Genetic testing will become more popular, and it will be harder for parents to keep secret from their children that they were conceived using donated eggs or sperm (although disclosure is widely considered to be a good thing). Ancestry websites will be used to discover genetic half-siblings. But genetics are not all-important to the concept of family. \u201cFamily is no longer necessarily about biological relatedness \u2013 that is something that has changed a lot,\u201d says Golombok.</p> <p>We are already seeing uterus transplants, but by 2050, we may be relying on artificial wombs to grow our babies. \u201cThey are being developed at the moment initially to help with very premature babies to replicate, as far as possible, the human uterus. But eventually it\u2019s possible that artificial wombs will be used instead of pregnancy.\u201d That could free up women for whom pregnancy \u2013 and its related physical and psychological toll, as well as the financial hit they take when taking time out from their careers \u2013 is something to be endured, rather than enjoyed. \u201cI think first it will probably be used for women who don\u2019t have their own wombs \u2013 the women who might, at the moment, turn to surrogacy,\u201d says Golombok. \u201cBut actually, anybody could do this, so it could be quite liberating in some ways for women. Some women wouldn\u2019t like the idea at all. Also, I can see ways in which it could be used in a rather worrying way, almost like \u2018baby farms\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A growing number of women are freezing their eggs, and the age at which women have their first child is also rising. In 2050, will it be more normal for women in their 50s, or even 60s and beyond, to become mothers? \u201cIt is technically possible,\u201d says Golombok. \u201cWhether many women would actually want to do that seems unlikely to me. But, generally, there will certainly be more women having babies in their 40s, unless there is a huge change in mindset.\u201d Experts have already called for children to be educated about natural fertility decline, which could mean future generations decide to have children earlier. But society isn\u2019t set up to support that, Golombok points out \u2013 from the price of education to the lack of state support, and the cost of housing. \u201cThe age at which women are having children is going up and up, and I can\u2019t really see an end to that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Will we have men travelling abroad for work? What will happen to their skills as dads?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brexit \u2013 with prolonged trade negotiations and predicted economic decline \u2013 will affect families in the coming decades. \u201cEconomic insecurity is associated with an increased preference for cohabitation as opposed to marriage,\u201d says Berrington. \u201cFurthermore, economic hardship is related to increased risks of family breakdown.\u201d</p> <p>Berrington points out that families have become more transnational, \u201cespecially since women have made up an increasingly large proportion of migrants. In previous decades, migrants to the UK from South Asia often migrated for the purpose of family formation or reunification. Today, migration to the UK is more often for purposes of education and work. So the future link between international migration and family formation is unclear.\u201d This is particularly so as policies around migration are tightened up.</p> <p>If the economy suffers post-Brexit, as numerous economists warn, increasing numbers of British people may seek work abroad \u2013 and this could disproportionately mean men. Fathers have become more engaged with their children in recent years, with the number of stay-at-home dads rising (although in 93% of heterosexual couples, <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2019/jul/less-7-couples-share-housework-equally\" title=\"\">the bulk of the housework, including caring responsibilities, still falls to women).</a> \u201cWill we have men travelling to the Commonwealth, Europe and the like to work? And if they do, what will happen to their skills as dads?\u201d asks Charlie Lewis, a professor of psychology at Lancaster University who researches fatherhood.</p> <p>\u201cThirty years ago when I started working on fathers, all the trends were for women to enter the professions,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s no good evidence that there will be this [female] takeover of the workplace.\u201d Work is still a largely hostile environment for family life. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be much more volatile in future years.\u201d Policies such as a four-day week would allow \u201cthe family to balance better\u201d.</p> <p>Women will continue to make strides in the workforce, but this will put pressure on childcare, which still disproportionally falls to mothers. In the UK, we don\u2019t have the \u201cextensive childcare to match what happens in Germany and northern Europe\u201d, says Lewis. \u201cWe don\u2019t think carefully about protecting the next generation.\u201d</p> <p>Stay-at-home dads are still a minority, but Lewis says he remains surprised by the still-small number of fathers who are the resident parent after family breakdown, even if they have been the main carer prior to that. Will that change by 2050? Not if the past few decades are anything to go by. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed much since the early 70s. We think that 40 or 50 years ago was a time when the children always went to the mother, but a government report in 1974 documented that 10% of children lived with their dads, and it\u2019s not much more than 10% now.\u201d</p> <p>Inherited advantage will entrench the privilege of some families at the expense of everyone else. \u201cThe inequality that we currently see between families will only continue to grow,\u201d says Jessica Calarco, associate professor of sociology at Indiana University. \u201cWe know that affluent white families hoard opportunities and often demand new opportunities to give them access to even more resources. That cycle perpetuates itself over time and inequalities grow.\u201d It starts with early education, but quickly escalates, as children from well-off families are funnelled into the \u201cright\u201d universities and jobs. \u201cWithout some policy interventions, we will see affluent white families continuing to have power over schools and workspaces,\u201d says Calarco, \u201ceven as the demographics of society change in terms of white people becoming a smaller share of the population.\u201d</p> <p>We are an ageing population. By 2035, <a href=\"https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/sites/default/files/2019-03/The-state-of-ageing.pdf\" title=\"\">there will be 44% more people over the age of 65</a> than there were in 2017. Age UK estimates \u201caround 650,000 extra care jobs will be needed\u201d. In October, the government announced a \u00a334m investment programme to try to teach robot carers to be more empathetic to their humans, making it more likely that by 2050, robots will \u2013 as has long been predicted \u2013 be one answer to the growing social care crisis. Will they also provide childcare? This has long been more controversial than elder care, but nurseries in Japan have already trialled the use of robots to help out.</p> <p>The birth of social media has provided a new view of what \u201cperfect\u201d parenting is supposed to look like. We are encouraged to compare ourselves with others, and we are also, says Thomas Curran, a social psychologist at the London School of Economics, becoming more perfectionist. \u201cParenting has changed in recent years. Parents are more expectant, and are becoming more critical. That is because they are passing down pressures that they feel from society. Things have become tough, the job market has become more precarious, educational achievement has become very important for \u2013 I hate to put it in these terms \u2013 their children\u2019s \u2018future market price\u2019. There\u2019s a lot of pressure on parents now to ensure they raise successful children.\u201d</p> <p>This will become more acute, he believes, at least in the shorter term. By 2050, it could have reversed. \u201cThis current generation of young people, as they become parents themselves, my sense is that they will do things differently. They are pushing back against societal pressures.\u201d In terms of social media, they may not share endless photographs of their children, or do the kind of performative parenting that now often plays out online. \u201cI think they will be much better at educating and building awareness in their own children about [how manufactured] social media is.\u201d</p> <p>The family in 2050 will be subject to external pressures nobody I speak to wants to confidently predict; the only certain thing is how diverse families will be in the coming decades. The moral panic about the rapid decline of the nuclear (heterosexual) family hasn\u2019t proved justified. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that family structure is actually less important for children than the quality of relationships within families,\u201d says Golombok. \u201cAnd also the social acceptance of their family in the wider world. Families are changing and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing for children or parents.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s a very small group, but they do exist. Some of them are gay men, so that, in a way, is more obvious, but there are also single heterosexual men having children through surrogacy and egg donation. That\u2019s something that may grow.\u201d There is also a rise in the number of transgender parents. \u201cUntil very recently, transgender parents had children and then transitioned afterwards, but because of developments in assisted reproduction and people being able to preserve eggs and sperm, more transgender people are having children after their transition.\u201d She says this is likely to increase in the coming decades. Advances in technology will create ever-bigger ethical debates. So-called \u201cdesigner babies\u201d are already a reality, with parents able to select embryos to screen out inherited diseases and conditions. But by 2050, prospective parents could pay to select not only for good health but for traits such as intelligence, attractiveness or athleticism \u2013 the babies of rich parents could be genetically superior to those born to lower-income families. \u201cArtificial eggs and sperm are on the horizon,\u201d says Golombok, \u201cwhich will not just be helpful for infertile heterosexual couples but will allow same-sex couples to both be the biological parents of their children, because that will mean men can produce eggs and sperm, and so can women. For single people who want to have children, it would even be possible for them to produce eggs and sperm.\u201d Genetic testing will become more popular, and it will be harder for parents to keep secret from their children that they were conceived using donated eggs or sperm (although disclosure is widely considered to be a good thing). Ancestry websites will be used to discover genetic half-siblings. But genetics are not all-important to the concept of family. \u201cFamily is no longer necessarily about biological relatedness \u2013 that is something that has changed a lot,\u201d says Golombok. We are already seeing uterus transplants, but by 2050, we may be relying on artificial wombs to grow our babies. \u201cThey are being developed at the moment initially to help with very premature babies to replicate, as far as possible, the human uterus. But eventually it\u2019s possible that artificial wombs will be used instead of pregnancy.\u201d That could free up women for whom pregnancy \u2013 and its related physical and psychological toll, as well as the financial hit they take when taking time out from their careers \u2013 is something to be endured, rather than enjoyed. \u201cI think first it will probably be used for women who don\u2019t have their own wombs \u2013 the women who might, at the moment, turn to surrogacy,\u201d says Golombok. \u201cBut actually, anybody could do this, so it could be quite liberating in some ways for women. Some women wouldn\u2019t like the idea at all. Also, I can see ways in which it could be used in a rather worrying way, almost like \u2018baby farms\u2019.\u201d A growing number of women are freezing their eggs, and the age at which women have their first child is also rising. In 2050, will it be more normal for women in their 50s, or even 60s and beyond, to become mothers? \u201cIt is technically possible,\u201d says Golombok. \u201cWhether many women would actually want to do that seems unlikely to me. But, generally, there will certainly be more women having babies in their 40s, unless there is a huge change in mindset.\u201d Experts have already called for children to be educated about natural fertility decline, which could mean future generations decide to have children earlier. But society isn\u2019t set up to support that, Golombok points out \u2013 from the price of education to the lack of state support, and the cost of housing. \u201cThe age at which women are having children is going up and up, and I can\u2019t really see an end to that.\u201d Brexit \u2013 with prolonged trade negotiations and predicted economic decline \u2013 will affect families in the coming decades. \u201cEconomic insecurity is associated with an increased preference for cohabitation as opposed to marriage,\u201d says Berrington. \u201cFurthermore, economic hardship is related to increased risks of family breakdown.\u201d Berrington points out that families have become more transnational, \u201cespecially since women have made up an increasingly large proportion of migrants. In previous decades, migrants to the UK from South Asia often migrated for the purpose of family formation or reunification. Today, migration to the UK is more often for purposes of education and work. So the future link between international migration and family formation is unclear.\u201d This is particularly so as policies around migration are tightened up. If the economy suffers post-Brexit, as numerous economists warn, increasing numbers of British people may seek work abroad \u2013 and this could disproportionately mean men. Fathers have become more engaged with their children in recent years, with the number of stay-at-home dads rising (although in 93% of heterosexual couples, the bulk of the housework, including caring responsibilities, still falls to women). \u201cWill we have men travelling to the Commonwealth, Europe and the like to work? And if they do, what will happen to their skills as dads?\u201d asks Charlie Lewis, a professor of psychology at Lancaster University who researches fatherhood. \u201cThirty years ago when I started working on fathers, all the trends were for women to enter the professions,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there\u2019s no good evidence that there will be this [female] takeover of the workplace.\u201d Work is still a largely hostile environment for family life. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be much more volatile in future years.\u201d Policies such as a four-day week would allow \u201cthe family to balance better\u201d. Women will continue to make strides in the workforce, but this will put pressure on childcare, which still disproportionally falls to mothers. In the UK, we don\u2019t have the \u201cextensive childcare to match what happens in Germany and northern Europe\u201d, says Lewis. \u201cWe don\u2019t think carefully about protecting the next generation.\u201d Stay-at-home dads are still a minority, but Lewis says he remains surprised by the still-small number of fathers who are the resident parent after family breakdown, even if they have been the main carer prior to that. Will that change by 2050? Not if the past few decades are anything to go by. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed much since the early 70s. We think that 40 or 50 years ago was a time when the children always went to the mother, but a government report in 1974 documented that 10% of children lived with their dads, and it\u2019s not much more than 10% now.\u201d Inherited advantage will entrench the privilege of some families at the expense of everyone else. \u201cThe inequality that we currently see between families will only continue to grow,\u201d says Jessica Calarco, associate professor of sociology at Indiana University. \u201cWe know that affluent white families hoard opportunities and often demand new opportunities to give them access to even more resources. That cycle perpetuates itself over time and inequalities grow.\u201d It starts with early education, but quickly escalates, as children from well-off families are funnelled into the \u201cright\u201d universities and jobs. \u201cWithout some policy interventions, we will see affluent white families continuing to have power over schools and workspaces,\u201d says Calarco, \u201ceven as the demographics of society change in terms of white people becoming a smaller share of the population.\u201d We are an ageing population. By 2035, there will be 44% more people over the age of 65 than there were in 2017. Age UK estimates \u201caround 650,000 extra care jobs will be needed\u201d. In October, the government announced a \u00a334m investment programme to try to teach robot carers to be more empathetic to their humans, making it more likely that by 2050, robots will \u2013 as has long been predicted \u2013 be one answer to the growing social care crisis. Will they also provide childcare? This has long been more controversial than elder care, but nurseries in Japan have already trialled the use of robots to help out. The birth of social media has provided a new view of what \u201cperfect\u201d parenting is supposed to look like. We are encouraged to compare ourselves with others, and we are also, says Thomas Curran, a social psychologist at the London School of Economics, becoming more perfectionist. \u201cParenting has changed in recent years. Parents are more expectant, and are becoming more critical. That is because they are passing down pressures that they feel from society. Things have become tough, the job market has become more precarious, educational achievement has become very important for \u2013 I hate to put it in these terms \u2013 their children\u2019s \u2018future market price\u2019. There\u2019s a lot of pressure on parents now to ensure they raise successful children.\u201d This will become more acute, he believes, at least in the shorter term. By 2050, it could have reversed. \u201cThis current generation of young people, as they become parents themselves, my sense is that they will do things differently. They are pushing back against societal pressures.\u201d In terms of social media, they may not share endless photographs of their children, or do the kind of performative parenting that now often plays out online. \u201cI think they will be much better at educating and building awareness in their own children about [how manufactured] social media is.\u201d The family in 2050 will be subject to external pressures nobody I speak to wants to confidently predict; the only certain thing is how diverse families will be in the coming decades. The moral panic about the rapid decline of the nuclear (heterosexual) family hasn\u2019t proved justified. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that family structure is actually less important for children than the quality of relationships within families,\u201d says Golombok. \u201cAnd also the social acceptance of their family in the wider world. Families are changing and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing for children or parents.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>For business and finance, 2019 was a year of big-name corporate collapses, investigations into alleged scandals and the inevitable arguments about Brexit. Bankers and tycoons tried to get on with things by attempting huge flotations, large mergers and sizeable refinancings \u2013 with mixed results. Here is a review of the year in business.</p> <h2><strong>Floats</strong></h2> <p>Saudi Aramco secured its position as the most valuable listed company in history after investor appetite for the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel producer pushed its market value to just under $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) after its long-awaited listing. Shares in the Saudi state-backed oil company defied Aramco\u2019s critics by climbing nearly 11% above the $1.7tn valuation set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/05/saudi-aramco-to-be-worlds-most-valuable-firm-after-ipo-next-week\">before its market debut</a> on Riyadh\u2019s stock exchange.</p> <p>However, despite those numbers, it was still difficult to class the float as an unmitigated success. The word\u2019s most profitable company was supposed to be worth $2tn when it listed (the number coveted by Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman) while a secondary goal was to insert Aramco shares into the portfolios of international investors. But the Aramco offer morphed into a smaller affair in which the main contributors were locals and other Gulf investors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"41a1e34bc81e48b9ca722ac2567522672be8cd2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a1e34bc81e48b9ca722ac2567522672be8cd2e/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Investors monitor the Saudi stock exchange during Saudi Aramco\u2019s IPO on the Riyadh stock market, in December.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Investors monitor the Saudi stock exchange during Saudi Aramco\u2019s IPO on the Riyadh stock market, in December.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Comparatively, however, Aramco was a triumph, when judged next to the planned float of WeWork. The office-space provider, whose only unique selling point seemed to be its comically self-regarding co-founder Adam Neumann, went from publication of grand flotation prospectus to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/22/wework-board-weighs-up-10bn-rescue-plan-from-softbank\">emergency rescue by its key shareholder Softbank</a>, the Japanese investment firm, two months later in October.</p> <p>WeWork had reported a net loss of $1.6bn in 2018 on revenues of $1.8bn but, in the last private-funding round, Softbank had injected the last portion of its investment at a valuation of $47bn. By October WeWork was valued at $8bn and Softbank had to throw in another $6.5bn in equity and debt to gain control.</p> <p>Neumann, who has expressed a desire to live forever, discovered that in terms of his WeWork career his ambition to be a corporate immortal proved a bit of a stretch. As part of the rescue deal Neumann agreed to sell his shares \u2013 albeit with a healthy profit for this acceptance of mortality. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/22/wework-board-weighs-up-10bn-rescue-plan-from-softbank\" title=\"\">walked away with roughly $1.7bn</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Collapses</strong></h2> <p>Thomas Cook ceased trading in late September after talks failed to produce a funding lifeline for the travel company, triggering a huge repatriation effort to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers overseas.</p> <p>John and Irene Hays, a husband-and-wife team who built the Sunderland-based Hays Travel, pledged to save the jobs of all 2,500 former Thomas Cook staff who worked on UK high streets after buying the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/22/thomas-cook-in-last-ditch-talks-to-avoid-collapse\">collapsed tour operator</a>\u2019s 555 shops for an undisclosed fee.</p> <p>Other big names to call on the insolvency practitioners included the retailer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/debenhams\">Debenhams</a>, which was taken over by its lenders after the department store group fell into administration.

      "bodyText": "For business and finance, 2019 was a year of big-name corporate collapses, investigations into alleged scandals and the inevitable arguments about Brexit. Bankers and tycoons tried to get on with things by attempting huge flotations, large mergers and sizeable refinancings \u2013 with mixed results. Here is a review of the year in business. Floats Saudi Aramco secured its position as the most valuable listed company in history after investor appetite for the world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel producer pushed its market value to just under $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) after its long-awaited listing. Shares in the Saudi state-backed oil company defied Aramco\u2019s critics by climbing nearly 11% above the $1.7tn valuation set before its market debut on Riyadh\u2019s stock exchange. However, despite those numbers, it was still difficult to class the float as an unmitigated success. The word\u2019s most profitable company was supposed to be worth $2tn when it listed (the number coveted by Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman) while a secondary goal was to insert Aramco shares into the portfolios of international investors. But the Aramco offer morphed into a smaller affair in which the main contributors were locals and other Gulf investors. Comparatively, however, Aramco was a triumph, when judged next to the planned float of WeWork. The office-space provider, whose only unique selling point seemed to be its comically self-regarding co-founder Adam Neumann, went from publication of grand flotation prospectus to an emergency rescue by its key shareholder Softbank, the Japanese investment firm, two months later in October. WeWork had reported a net loss of $1.6bn in 2018 on revenues of $1.8bn but, in the last private-funding round, Softbank had injected the last portion of its investment at a valuation of $47bn. By October WeWork was valued at $8bn and Softbank had to throw in another $6.5bn in equity and debt to gain control. Neumann, who has expressed a desire to live forever, discovered that in terms of his WeWork career his ambition to be a corporate immortal proved a bit of a stretch. As part of the rescue deal Neumann agreed to sell his shares \u2013 albeit with a healthy profit for this acceptance of mortality. He walked away with roughly $1.7bn. Collapses Thomas Cook ceased trading in late September after talks failed to produce a funding lifeline for the travel company, triggering a huge repatriation effort to bring home 150,000 UK holidaymakers overseas. John and Irene Hays, a husband-and-wife team who built the Sunderland-based Hays Travel, pledged to save the jobs of all 2,500 former Thomas Cook staff who worked on UK high streets after buying the collapsed tour operator\u2019s 555 shops for an undisclosed fee. Other big names to call on the insolvency practitioners included the retailer Debenhams, which was taken over by its lenders after the department store group fell into administration. The move wiped out shareholders, including Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, but 165 UK outlets continued to trade under the pre-pack administration deal that affected its listed holding company only. The celebrity chef Jamie Oliver closed all but three of his 25 UK restaurants in May, with the loss of 1,000 jobs, after the business called in administrators. Mothercare was another huge name to suffer, announcing in November that it would close all of its 79 UK stores and its online business, with the potential loss of 2,800 jobs. The administration did not include Mothercare\u2019s profitable overseas operations, which have more than 1,000 stores in more than 40 countries \u2013 all run via franchise agreements. Only 50 UK head office staff will remain to deal with running the international business. The rescue of British Steel, which collapsed into liquidation in May, also looked in the balance as the year drew to a close. Jingye, a Chinese firm poised to buy the British firm that was founded by a former Communist party official, has yet to complete the deal after agreeing to acquire the business in November, when an earlier round of talks with the pension fund of the Turkish military broke down. Investigations Sir Philip Green could not avoid controversy again in 2019, as he was charged with four counts of misdemeanour assault in the US after a pilates instructor alleged he repeatedly touched her inappropriately. He denies the allegations. A trial is scheduled for next year. The UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office announced in December that it had launched an investigation into suspicions of bribery at the mining and commodity trading group Glencore. The company, which is listed on the London stock exchange but has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, said it would cooperate with the investigation. In March the SFO also arrested and later released four individuals in Kent and Sussex as it confirmed it was investigating London Capital &amp; Finance, whose 11,000-plus investors poured \u00a3236m into its bonds \u2013 only for the company to collapse earlier this year. About \u00a358m was taken as commission by the Brighton-based marketing company, Surge Financial, that promoted the bonds. Much of the rest went into highly speculative property developments, some in the Dominican Republic, oil exploration off the Faroe Isles and even a helicopter bought for a company controlled by LC&amp;F. Brexit Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU dominated much of the year, inevitably, and while business does not appear to have voted 52-48 in favour, there was a split of views. In January, Airbus, the European aerospace group that employs more than 14,000 people in the UK, called the UK government\u2019s handling of Brexit a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and warned it could pull out of the UK if the country crashes out of the EU without a deal. In April, J\u00fcrgen Maier, the British-Austrian chief executive of the UK arm of the German manufacturing group Siemens, said Brexit was making Britain an international \u201claughing stock\u201d and urged MPs to pursue a softer withdrawal from the EU. However, other big names weighed in on the other side including (inevitably) Tim Martin, the entertaining founder-chairman of JD Wetherspoon. He ended up in a bar room brawl with the City, lashing out at the investor advisory group Pirc, which had publicly rebuked him for spending \u00a395,000 of company money on pro-Brexit literature without first seeking approval from shareholders. Martin also dismissed UK corporate governance rules as \u201cup the spout\u201d and criticised two major institutions that own a chunk of the company he built. Meanwhile Sir James Dyson, the British billionaire inventor and outspoken Brexiter who called on the government to walk away from the EU without a deal, said in January that he would move the headquarters of his vacuum cleaner and hair dryer technology company to Singapore. The company said the move had \u201cnothing to do with Brexit\u201d. Gender It was not a vintage year for women at the top of business in the UK. In terms of FTSE 100 chief executives, it was announced in 2019 that V\u00e9ronique Laury, chief executive of DIY retail chain Kingfisher, was off, while Alison Cooper is to stand down as chief executive of tobacco giant Imperial Brands after nine years (although she remains in post). The number of female chief executives running FTSE 100 firms had a boost in November when Alison Rose started as boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland, meaning the current count is effectively treading water at six (and half of them are called Alison). Still, further afield there appeared to be signs of creeping diversity in terms of candidates to be central bankers. London School of Economics director Minouche Shafik and Santander UK chairwoman Shriti Vadera were both widely touted as the next governor as the Bank of England before Andrew Bailey was given the job, while Christine Lagarde became head of the European Central Bank. Pressing business Business and finance was being pressed into making itself look more caring in 2019, with the climate crisis prompting some high-profile interventions. In April Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and his Banque de France opposite number Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, wrote an open letter to the Guardian arguing that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must take urgent steps to reform. They argued that financial regulators, banks and insurers around the world had to \u201craise the bar\u201d to avoid catastrophe. Sometimes steps did appear to be being taken. In November, during the general election campaign, the government halted fracking in England with immediate effect and warned shale gas companies it would not support future fracking projects. Meanwhile, in August the bosses of 181 of the US\u2019s biggest companies changed the official definition of \u201cthe purpose of a corporation\u201d from making the most money possible for shareholders to \u201cimproving our society\u201d by also looking out for employees, caring for the environment and dealing ethically. Big business bosses signing up to the change implemented by the influential Business Roundtable (BRT) lobby group included Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, the Apple boss, Tim Cook, and Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of Wall Street bank JPMorgan. The move came after decades of corporate America following Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman\u2019s 1970 philosophy that \u201cthe social responsibility of business is to increase its profits\u201d. On the more micro side, some businesses also responded to calls to be more compassionate to employees. In May Julian Richer, the founder of Richer Sounds, said he would hand control of the hi-fi and TV retail chain to staff, in a move that would also give employees large cash bonuses. High street There was more upheaval on the UK high street, from shop closures to boardroom upheaval. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct was labelled \u201can embarrassment to UK corporate governance\u201d by the shareholder advisory firm Pirc, after a chaotic July announcement of its annual results, which included multiple delays and the shock revelation of a \u20ac674m (\u00a3614m) tax bill. The other controversial big beast of UK shopping, Sir Philip Green, also had his business challenges. The tycoon\u2019s Topshop and Topman chains slumped to a \u00a3505m loss last year, it was announced in September, as sales fell and the retail tycoon wrote down the value of two of his flagship brands. At that time Green\u2019s holding company, Taveta Investments, admitted there was \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d about its ability to continue trading without new funds, after suffering a \u00a3177.3m loss last year. However, in December Green secured a last-ditch \u00a3310m mortgage deal for his flagship Topshop store on Oxford Street in London with the US private equity company Apollo Management International. There were other big retailing names who also struggled to have everything their own way in 2019. In April, an attempt by Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda to create Britain\u2019s largest supermarket group was crushed by competition authorities saying it would be bad news for consumer. In a scathing judgment, the Competitions and Markets Authority ruled that combining the two firms would have led to higher prices, lower quality, a worse range on the shelves and a poorer overall shopping experience. Meanwhile, bookmakers warned there would be more empty outlets on the UK high street as they would be forced to shut shops after stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) were reduced from \u00a3100 to \u00a32 in April. Less rich list Sir Philip Green is no longer a billionaire, it emerged in 2019, after a difficult few years. The tycoon\u2019s fortune halved over the past year, according to the Sunday Times rich list published in May, which calculated that Green and his wife, Tina, had fallen from 66th to 156th in the annual rankings after their fortune dropped by just over \u00a31bn to \u00a3950m. The couple, who live in the tax haven of Monaco, had wealth valued at as much as \u00a34.9bn in 2007. Ray Kelvin, the founder of the fashion group Ted Baker, also had an eye watering 2019. Shares in the group, of which Kelvin still owns around 35%, fell by about 73% during the year and the company is now valued at just under \u00a3200m. Kelvin resigned in March following allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards staff. He has denied all allegations of misconduct. While the percentage drops were less dramatic, the sheer size of the overall numbers meant that Ivan Glasenberg\u2019s personal losses were even more heroic. He lost close to half a billion pounds as shares in commodity trader and miner Glencore \u2013 of which he owns around 9% \u2013 fell by 16% in 2019. The firm is currently valued at just over \u00a330bn. Still, Glasenberg can probably absorb such losses, which might not be how punters in property schemes such as those run by the TV property guru Kevin McCloud and the entrepreneur Gavin Woodhouse view matters. Small investors in McCloud\u2019s eco-friendly housing ventures, who put \u00a32.4m into one of his bonds, were told in August they could face losing up to 97% of their money. McCloud said he stood \u201cshoulder to shoulder with those who have lost money\u201d and would do everything in his power to improve the situation. Meanwhile Woodhouse\u2019s empire collapsed during the summer following an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News. The entrepreneur, who has raised more than \u00a380m from private investors but whose firms have a multimillion-pound \u201cblack hole\u201d, was ruled by a high court judge as running a business model that appeared to be \u201cthoroughly dishonest\u201d. Woodhouse has previously denied any wrongdoing.",

Recorded incidents of water-related violence have more than doubled in the past 10 years compared with previous decades, the statistics maintained by the California-based Pacific Institute thinktank show. The trend illustrates the tension resulting from dwindling supplies of fresh water in many parts of the world as a result of population growth, poor management of resources and extreme weather events linked to the climate crisis. \u201cAs water becomes more scarce, because it\u2019s such a critical resource, people will do whatever they can do meet their basic needs,\u201d said Peter Gleick, the founding president of the Pacific Institute and a leading authority on water issues.

TSB chairman Richard Meddings apologised for the disruption but said he did not agree with all of the report\u2019s findings. He said technical issues were at the heart of the failure.",

      "bodyText": "Greece has seen an alarming rise in police violence, amid reports of unprovoked attacks by officers that have seen protesters beaten with batons and people strip-searched in broad daylight. Human rights groups, commentators and the country\u2019s leftist opposition have deplored what is increasingly being viewed as the deployment of excessive force by the authorities. Despite a widespread ban in Europe, the use of plastic bullets has also raised alarm. Amnesty International\u2019s Greek branch described the increase in alleged abuses as \u201cextremely worrying\u201d. Eirini Gaitanou, the group\u2019s campaign coordinator, said: \u201cThere has been a sharp rise in such incidents in recent months and it is clear they are not isolated but reflect systemic problems in the Greek police with regards to violence and endemic impunity.\u201d The group has urged authorities to investigate the reports \u201cin a thorough, independent and impartial manner\u201d. Incidents of police brutality, captured on video and uploaded on social media, have increased markedly since the centre-right New Democracy party led by Kyriakos Mitsotakis ousted Alexis Tsipras\u2019s leftist Syriza in July. Elected on a tough law-and-order platform with promises to take on radical leftwing and refugee-occupied squats in anarchist enclaves such as Exarchia in central Athens, Mitsotakis\u2019s government appears to have given free reign to security forces. Clashes between students and riot police have increased since August when the governing conservative party launched the crackdown by repealing a law that had banned police from entering university grounds, and that had been regarded as sacrosanct in a country that has experienced military-led dictatorship. For generations of leftwing students campus asylum had been a hard-won right instituted after the collapse in 1974 of years of brutal dictatorship that was precipitated by the Athens Polytechnic uprising that ended in bloodshed. But Mitsotakis has accused Syriza of cultivating a climate of lawlessness and has argued that immunity to police had been abused with campuses invariably turned into drug dens and bomb-making factories. Extensive damage to banks and private properties was, he claimed, often the price of such a liberal environment. But the Greek prime minister\u2019s uncompromising stance has also resulted in a series of human rights violations, say critics. This month, without prior notice or a warrant, special forces stormed into a private home in Koukaki \u2013 an Athens neighbourhood within walking distance of the Acropolis \u2013 on the premise it was adjacent to a squat they intended to evict. Dimitris Indares, a renowned Greek film director and the property\u2019s owner, was arrested, tied up and injured. The incident triggered outrage with a public prosecutor ordering an investigation. The ruling New Democracy party hit back - alleging police had acted with a warrant. But later that same day a woman was reportedly wounded by a plastic bullet when police raided another squat. She was hospitalised with serious chest injuries, according to doctors. As anarchists burned down a Christmas tree in Exarchia in protest, opposition media carried reports of riot police being caught on camera cradling MR-35 punch guns. The impact from the weapon, which fires 35mm rubber balls, is said to be \u201cnon-lethal\u201d but tantamount to a punch by former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. In an act of solidarity with squatters, anarchists in Berlin occupied the diplomatic mission housing the Greek consulate in Berlin. The public outcry shows no signs of abating. With Syriza MPs vowing to step up criticism of the current government\u2019s public order minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, once parliament reconvenes, the leftists have criticised New Democracy for pandering increasingly to its conservative base. Despite heading the party\u2019s liberal faction, Mitsotakis has also taken a tough stance on migration, bolstering border controls and announcing the creation of \u201cclosed\u201d pre-deportation camps that refugee and human rights groups fear could easily become prisons. Tsipras, who had previously kept a low-key line in opposition, has ratcheted up the pressure in accusing authorities of acting as if they were in \u201can occupied country\u201d. \u201cThe display of police violence is aimed at supporting barbaric politics and at repressing the reactions that it generates,\u201d he tweeted. Syriza groups describe the heavy-handed tactics as not only \u201cunforgivable\u201d but counter-productive in a society that even today bears the scars of a bloody civil war that raged between 1946-49, pitting the left against the right. Reports have also surfaced of students being strip-searched at the behest of police. In a now notorious incident, a first-year student, picked up by police as he waited at a bus stop in Athens, was taunted for hours by officers after being ordered to strip down to his underwear and socks. A 19-year-old female student recounted how, unprovoked, she, too, had been set upon by police after attending a march to commemorate the 17 November student uprising at the Athens Polytechnic in 1973 that led to the junta\u2019s collapse almost a year later. The teenager, who has suffered serious arm injuries, described how she and dozens of others were taken to an underground car park on Bouboulinas, the street where leftists were routinely tortured during the military junta, and handcuffed on bended knee. The girl, one of 32 rounded up and arrested, told Greek media: \u201cI thought I was going to die.\u201d The following day when the arraigned protesters were hauled before the courts, journalists described scenes of mayhem after a unit of riot police began beating assembled friends and relatives indiscriminately. Yiota Tessi, a journalist with Efimerida ton Syntakton, one of the few opposition papers that has reported the abuses, said club-wielding police \u2013 for no apparent reason \u2013 suddenly began beating the crowd, including press gathered at the scene. \u201cIn all my years of court reporting I haven\u2019t seen anything like it. One policeman said \u2018if someone spits at me, I won\u2019t spit at him, I will hit him wherever I can, maybe even on the head,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhat we are seeing is very disturbing because violence begets violence ... and if it goes on like this it will evoke our dark past and nobody knows what that will bring.\u201d In response to the claims the government has taken the unprecedented step of setting up a commission headed by a professor of constitutional law, Nikos Alivizatos, who is widely respected on the left.

      "bodyText": "Islanders on Arran are protesting against plans to install one of the UK\u2019s largest fish farms close to one of the island\u2019s most treasured holiday destinations. The Scottish Salmon Company (SSC) wants to build a fish farm near Lochranza on the northern tip of Arran, which will be more than twice the size of most other salmon farms. The SSC has asked North Ayrshire council for permission to install 20 cages capable of producing 5,000 tonnes of salmon a year, in a 97-hectare (240-acre) site 200 metres off the coastline. Its opponents argue that the farm will dump faecal waste in the sea equivalent to a town of up to 66,000 people, use acoustic deterrents to ward off seals that will scare porpoises and dolphins, and damage the area\u2019s widely admired landscape. Residents on Arran staged a human-chain demonstration in the autumn at the site at Millstone Point close to Lochranza, a picturesque coastal village, and are installing six three-metre-long protest banners around the island over the Christmas holidays. The industry hopes to double its output after the Scottish government announced earlier in 2019 it would allow much larger super-sized farms to be built, but in deeper waters, to remove pressure on sensitive sites close to shore. Sites of this size are very rare. Only 26 of the 217 fish farms dotted around Scotland\u2019s coastline are licensed to produce 2,500 tonnes of salmon, with a handful where two 2,500 tonnes sites are close together. SSC says its new site at Millstone Point will be split into two licences of 10 cages each, although both groups of cages will be moored together.

The council has received 243 objections, including a formal objection from Scottish Natural Heritage, the government conservation agency. SNH said the site threatens wild Atlantic salmon spawning in the River Endrick nearby, which is legally protected by a special area of conservation, because it will attract parasitical sea lice. The council needs to carry out a habitats regulations appraisal before voting on the application, SNH added. Concerns have also been raised by Marine Scotland Science, a government agency, that the site is too close to \u201cdisease management area\u201d zones needed for other new fish farm sites nearby, breaching national marine planning rules. It has told the council it is sceptical that automated equipment SSC wants to use to remove dead fish has been proven to work; the technology has never been used at that scale or in Scottish waters, it said. SSC, which was recently bought by an aquaculture company from the Faroe Islands, Bakkafrost, from a Ukrainian-financed investment company, argues that the farm will support 10 full-time jobs, buy from local suppliers and put \u00a31m into the local economy. The company did not allow a director to be interviewed, but said many of the environmental concerns had been answered in its application. \u201cThe environment and health of our fish are fundamental and site location is important.

      "bodyText": "The number of parents and carers taking councils to tribunal for refusing support to children with disabilities has almost tripled in the past five years. Since 2014, legal battles over decisions \u2013 which include not assessing children\u2019s particular needs or providing them adequate help at home or school \u2013 have increased by 176%. The figures from 2014-15 and 2018-19, which the Guardian acquired through Freedom of Information Act requests, are from 71 local authorities in England and Wales. Educational support is offered to all children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) at schools and colleges. However, councils can create education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for those with more complex needs. EHCPs are legal documents that describe a child or young person\u2019s needs and set out the extra help that will be provided by the local authority to meet them. Dedicated teaching assistants, access to speech therapists and placements at schools that have the provisions to look after children with Send \u2013 such as smaller class sizes and specialist facilities \u2013 are among the resources that can be written into a plan. Sarah White, head of policy at Sense, a charity for people with complex disabilities, criticised the knock-on effects that inadequate educational support could have on children with Send further down the line. \u201cIf children aren\u2019t getting the support that they need, they\u2019re potentially not able to attend school. Or, if they\u2019re attending school, they might not be getting the level of support they need so that can have an impact on educational progress and potentially their ability to make friends and engage and take part in activities,\u201d said White. In 2018-2019, local authorities were taken to tribunal 3,274 times, in comparison with 1,186 times over 2014-15. Birmingham city council, the largest local authority in Europe by population, was taken to Send tribunals 985 times between 2014 and 2019, which was more than any other local authority. Cases against the council increased by 273% over the period. A spokesperson for the council said: \u201cWhile the vast majority of appeals are resolved without the need for a hearing, we recognise that there are long-standing issues, particularly with regard to communication with families and waiting times for assessments, which we are working to address.\u201d Kent county council, which participated in 859 tribunal hearings, and Essex county council, which was taken to tribunal 829 times \u2013 a 219% increase in five years \u2013 also had among the largest number of proceedings. A spokesperson from Essex council said the increase corresponded with rising numbers of children with Send. Although many appeals against council decisions are resolved before the hearing date, the process can be lengthy and expensive for parents. Of the hundreds of parents and guardians who responded to a Guardian callout on Send tribunals, many said they had spent tens of thousands of pounds on legal representation to bolster their chances of winning, despite the fact it is not common practice to have a lawyer at hearings. A mother from Derby said her family had spent over \u00a3200,000 taking the city council to three tribunals andthe high court to ensure suitable educational provision for her autistic daughter. Others described the significant mental strain that had been placed on both them and their children while they waited to receive support. A father from the Isle of Wight said his 13-year-old son had tried to end his life on a number of occasions after years of being bullied and feeling isolated at a mainstream school without assistance. Earlier this year, three families brought action against the government at the high court, claiming its budget decisions had left councils unable to fulfil their obligation to provide an education to children with Send. But they lost after Mr Justice Lewis ruled there had been \u201cno unlawful discrimination\u201d. Data from the Department for Education showed the number of children and young people with Send statements or EHC plans has increased by 34,200 (11%) since 2018. However, an analysis by the National Education Union published in April found that special needs provision in England had lost out on \u00a31.2bn because of shortfalls in funding increases from the government since 2015. Reforms introduced in 2014 to improve the experiences of Send pupils were criticised by a cross-party committee of MPs earlier this year for being poorly implemented.",

Any exporting of coal will result in higher global emissions because it increases the availability and lowers the price of coal, and encourages the use of coal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is not clear that the availability of Australian LNG decreases emissions internationally.</p> <footer> <cite>Frank Jotzo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While Taylor admits that LNG processing in Australia has pushed domestic emissions higher, he claims that \u201cour LNG exports are dramatically reducing emissions in customer countries such as Japan, South Korea and China \u2014 the equivalent of up to 30 per cent of our emissions each year\u201d.</p> <p>But Jotzo says this claim depends heavily on what the LNG displaces.</p> <p>He says the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of the exports will actually replace gas from other sources, rather than displacing coal generation. There is also a risk, he says, that increasing LNG exports also encourages countries to build more gas infrastructure, making it harder to move away from the fossil fuel.</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIt is not clear that the availability of Australian LNG decreases emissions internationally.\u201d</p> <h2>Easy target</h2> <p>\u201cAustralia meets and beats its emission-reductions targets, every time,\u201d writes Taylor. \u201cWe beat our first Kyoto targets by 128 million tonnes. We \u00adexpect to beat our 2020 targets by 411 million tonnes.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The key reason why Australia has easily beaten its targets, is that they were very low to begin with.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The key reason why Australia has easily beaten its targets, is that they were very low to begin with.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s first Kyoto target allowed it to increase emissions by 8% between 1990 and 2010. The second target period required a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020.</p> <p>Much of Australia\u2019s cuts to emissions in recent decades, says Jotzo, has been achieved through drops in land clearing, rather than reductions in other parts of the economy the government could have influence over.</p> <p>Australia wants to use some 411 million tonnes of CO2 \u201ccredits\u201d amassed over the Kyoto periods against future targets under the separate Paris agreement, even though it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/22/australia-is-the-only-country-using-carryover-climate-credits-officials-admit\">admits it is probably the only country looking to use these</a> \u201ccarryover credits\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/31/nsw-premier-gladys-berejiklian-has-mixed-feelings-about-sydneys-new-years-eve-fireworks\">Sydney lord mayor says climate change is the issue, not New Year's Eve fireworks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using carryover credits would cut the amount of emissions reductions Australia would need to find to meet its Paris target by about a half.</p> <p>At the latest UN climate talks in Madrid, Australia came under harsh criticism from more than 100 countries for its desire to use the credits, which some analysts say is a proposal with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/australias-use-of-accounting-loophole-to-meet-paris-deal-found-to-have-no-legal-basis\">no legal basis</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/16/un-climate-talks-australia-accused-of-cheating-and-thwarting-global-deal\">Australia was accused of \u201ccheating\u201d at the talks</a>, but refused to back down on the carryover issue, leaving it unresolved.</p> <h2>Better than Canada and New Zealand</h2> <p>In his article, Taylor says \u201cwhen you compare Australia\u2019s emission-reduction track record with nations such as Canada and New Zealand\u201d, Australia comes out on top.</p> <p>While Australia\u2019s emissions have dropped 12.9% since 2005, writes Taylor, New Zealand\u2019s have risen by 4% and Canada\u2019s have dropped only 2%.</p> <p>Jotzo says the 12.9% figure Taylor is using includes changes to land use, such as land clearing, which are not major issues for other developed countries.</p> <p>As an example, Australia\u2019s reporting to the UN shows that in 2005, emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (known as LULUCF) were +88mt. In 2017, LULUCF emissions were -19mt. That\u2019s a net drop of 107mt.</p> <p>Using the same periods for New Zealand, the difference is a net increase of 4.8mt.</p> <p>A fairer global comparison, says Jotzo, is to use figures that remove these LULUCF emissions.</p> <p>This, he says, turns Australia\u2019s 12.9% drop between 2005 and 2018 into a 6% rise.</p> <h2>Clean hydrogen</h2> <p>In his article, Taylor repeats a point that he made during his official speech to the Madrid climate talks that technological innovation would be a key to fighting climate change.</p> <p>In the article, Taylor points to the new national hydrogen strategy as an example of innovations with \u201cenormous potential\u201d for cutting future emissions.</p> <p>Jotzo says there is potential for an Australian hydrogen export industry to have a positive impact on global emissions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/30/these-bushfires-are-a-historic-event-here-is-what-we-should-learn-from-them\">These bushfires are a historic event. Here is what we should learn from them | Cormac Farrell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, he says this comes with large caveats. Hydrogen can be produced using renewable energy, but also by using fossil fuels.</p> <p>If Australia was to use coal or gas, it would need to be able to capture most of the waste CO2 to claim the fuel as green.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/for-hydrogen-to-be-truly-clean-it-must-be-made-with-renewables-not-coal-128053\">analysis by Jotzo and colleagues</a> shows that while rates of up to 95% carbon capture might be \u201ctechnically possible\u201d they have not yet been achieved.</p> <p>Only two plants \u2013 in Canada and the UK \u2013 currently capture CO2 when producing hydrogen from fossil fuels. The best capture rate is 80%.</p> <p>If the carbon capture rates were at 60%, then Jotzo says the net greenhouse gas footprint of hydrogen would be the same as just burning gas.</p> <h2>Proud and quiet Aussies?</h2> <p>According to Taylor, \u201cAustralia has strong targets, clear plans, an enviable track record\u201d on climate change, and Australians should be proud of it.</p> <p>But when overseas groups look at Australia\u2019s record compared to the rest of the world, the assessments come out differently.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most recent analysis ranked Australia as the sixth worst country on climate change overall.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>An analysis by Climate Action Tracker says Australia\u2019s Paris targets are \u201c<a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/australia/\">insufficient</a>\u201d and inconsistent with the Paris goal of keeping global warming well below 2C.</p> <p>Australia has been placed consistently towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/08/australia-named-worst-performing-industrial-country-on-climate-change\">the bottom</a> in the annual Climate Change Policy Index analysis of the world\u2019s top 57 emitting nations.</p> <p>The most recent analysis <a href=\"https://www.climate-change-performance-index.org/country/australia\">ranked Australia</a> as the sixth worst country on climate change overall.</p> <p>Jotzo, who attended the Madrid climate talks as an observer, said: \u201cAustralia was highly regarded at the talks for its technical competence, and it always has. But Australia is not highly regarded at all for its policies or for its efforts to water down effective ambition of the Paris agreement.\u201d</p> <p>He said speaking with observers from other countries, Australia\u2019s position was seen \u201cwith quite some bewilderment\u201d especially with the backdrop of the current devastating fire season.</p> <p>Jotzo adds: \u201cThey are flabbergasted that Australia is digging in to its stance of getting an easier deal when it would so obviously be in its national interest to encourage strong global action.\u201d</p>",

Prof Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate and Energy Policy at the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy, told Guardian Australia: \u201cI would characterise [Taylor\u2019s article] as a selective use of statistics that make Australia\u2019s emissions trajectory look good, when in reality it does not look good at all.\u201d Tiny footprint? Taylor writes that Australia is \u201cresponsible for only 1.3 per cent of global emissions, so we can\u2019t single-handedly have a meaningful impact without the co-operation of the largest emitters such as China and the US.\u201d In the context of global emissions, there is much that Australia can, and does, do that has a meaningful impact. The 1.3% figure does not account for Australia\u2019s contribution to global emissions from the fossil fuels we dig up and export. If this exported coal and gas was accounted for, one analysis suggests Australia would be responsible for almost 5% of the global carbon footprint from fossil fuel burning. When countries report their emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, they only report emissions occurring inside their borders, so it could be argued that using this larger number is unfair. But the problem is that elsewhere in Taylor\u2019s article, he says Australia\u2019s exporting of LNG is helping countries cut emissions. Jotzo says: \u201cIf we are going to talk about impacts on global emissions of Australia\u2019s energy exports, then we need to consider all fuels, including coal. Any exporting of coal will result in higher global emissions because it increases the availability and lowers the price of coal, and encourages the use of coal.\u201d While Taylor admits that LNG processing in Australia has pushed domestic emissions higher, he claims that \u201cour LNG exports are dramatically reducing emissions in customer countries such as Japan, South Korea and China \u2014 the equivalent of up to 30 per cent of our emissions each year\u201d. But Jotzo says this claim depends heavily on what the LNG displaces. He says the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of the exports will actually replace gas from other sources, rather than displacing coal generation. There is also a risk, he says, that increasing LNG exports also encourages countries to build more gas infrastructure, making it harder to move away from the fossil fuel. He adds: \u201cIt is not clear that the availability of Australian LNG decreases emissions internationally.\u201d Easy target \u201cAustralia meets and beats its emission-reductions targets, every time,\u201d writes Taylor. \u201cWe beat our first Kyoto targets by 128 million tonnes. We expect to beat our 2020 targets by 411 million tonnes.\u201d The key reason why Australia has easily beaten its targets, is that they were very low to begin with. Australia\u2019s first Kyoto target allowed it to increase emissions by 8% between 1990 and 2010. The second target period required a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020. Much of Australia\u2019s cuts to emissions in recent decades, says Jotzo, has been achieved through drops in land clearing, rather than reductions in other parts of the economy the government could have influence over. Australia wants to use some 411 million tonnes of CO2 \u201ccredits\u201d amassed over the Kyoto periods against future targets under the separate Paris agreement, even though it admits it is probably the only country looking to use these \u201ccarryover credits\u201d. Using carryover credits would cut the amount of emissions reductions Australia would need to find to meet its Paris target by about a half. At the latest UN climate talks in Madrid, Australia came under harsh criticism from more than 100 countries for its desire to use the credits, which some analysts say is a proposal with no legal basis. Australia was accused of \u201ccheating\u201d at the talks, but refused to back down on the carryover issue, leaving it unresolved. Better than Canada and New Zealand In his article, Taylor says \u201cwhen you compare Australia\u2019s emission-reduction track record with nations such as Canada and New Zealand\u201d, Australia comes out on top. While Australia\u2019s emissions have dropped 12.9% since 2005, writes Taylor, New Zealand\u2019s have risen by 4% and Canada\u2019s have dropped only 2%. Jotzo says the 12.9% figure Taylor is using includes changes to land use, such as land clearing, which are not major issues for other developed countries. As an example, Australia\u2019s reporting to the UN shows that in 2005, emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (known as LULUCF) were +88mt. In 2017, LULUCF emissions were -19mt. That\u2019s a net drop of 107mt. Using the same periods for New Zealand, the difference is a net increase of 4.8mt. A fairer global comparison, says Jotzo, is to use figures that remove these LULUCF emissions. This, he says, turns Australia\u2019s 12.9% drop between 2005 and 2018 into a 6% rise. Clean hydrogen In his article, Taylor repeats a point that he made during his official speech to the Madrid climate talks that technological innovation would be a key to fighting climate change. In the article, Taylor points to the new national hydrogen strategy as an example of innovations with \u201cenormous potential\u201d for cutting future emissions. Jotzo says there is potential for an Australian hydrogen export industry to have a positive impact on global emissions. However, he says this comes with large caveats. Hydrogen can be produced using renewable energy, but also by using fossil fuels. If Australia was to use coal or gas, it would need to be able to capture most of the waste CO2 to claim the fuel as green. But analysis by Jotzo and colleagues shows that while rates of up to 95% carbon capture might be \u201ctechnically possible\u201d they have not yet been achieved. Only two plants \u2013 in Canada and the UK \u2013 currently capture CO2 when producing hydrogen from fossil fuels. The best capture rate is 80%. If the carbon capture rates were at 60%, then Jotzo says the net greenhouse gas footprint of hydrogen would be the same as just burning gas. Proud and quiet Aussies? According to Taylor, \u201cAustralia has strong targets, clear plans, an enviable track record\u201d on climate change, and Australians should be proud of it. But when overseas groups look at Australia\u2019s record compared to the rest of the world, the assessments come out differently. An analysis by Climate Action Tracker says Australia\u2019s Paris targets are \u201cinsufficient\u201d and inconsistent with the Paris goal of keeping global warming well below 2C. Australia has been placed consistently towards the bottom in the annual Climate Change Policy Index analysis of the world\u2019s top 57 emitting nations. The most recent analysis ranked Australia as the sixth worst country on climate change overall. Jotzo, who attended the Madrid climate talks as an observer, said: \u201cAustralia was highly regarded at the talks for its technical competence, and it always has. But Australia is not highly regarded at all for its policies or for its efforts to water down effective ambition of the Paris agreement.\u201d He said speaking with observers from other countries, Australia\u2019s position was seen \u201cwith quite some bewilderment\u201d especially with the backdrop of the current devastating fire season. Jotzo adds: \u201cThey are flabbergasted that Australia is digging in to its stance of getting an easier deal when it would so obviously be in its national interest to encourage strong global action.\u201d",

The wind is just swirling. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really numb at the moment. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to eat tonight, where we\u2019re going to sleep tonight. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. \u201cWe can\u2019t get to the evacuation centres because we\u2019re blocked out. We\u2019re blocked off, we can\u2019t go north or south, right now we have nowhere to go. \u201cJust put the word out there, we\u2019ve lost our really beautiful town.\u201d Mogo is a small goldrush town with a population of about 300, which has in recent years attracted tourists for its arts and crafts stories and heritage buildings. It is unclear how many homes and other buildings have been damaged, but early accounts suggest there could be dozens. The town is also the site of the Mogo Zoo, which has Australia\u2019s largest collection of primates, as well as lions, tigers and zebras. Staff at the zoo stayed behind and were able to save its animals. Zoo director Chad Staples told the ABC small animals were taken inside before the fire front came through. \u201cRight now in my house there\u2019s animals of all description in all the different rooms,\u201d Staples said. \u201cDue to the amazing staff here, and a well executed plan, no one is hurt. Not a single animal lost.\u201d \u201cWhat we did with the dangerous animals \u2013 lions, tigers, orangutans \u2013 is we encouraged them to the night den, kept them calm, like nothing was happening, and we were able to protect them at that site. \u201cThe only animals we saw any signs of stress are the giraffe and zebra at a couple of points. \u201cA couple of hours ago it felt like armageddon here. It was as black as midnight with tinges of red. It was like we were fighting fires in the darkness. \u201cRight now, we feel that we\u2019ve got a reprieve. Thankfully prayers were answered and the wind changed. Then we were able to get on top of it. Now we\u2019re just very much in a state of readiness, I guess. We\u2019re making sure that nothing flares up, or nothing comes from a different direction now that the wind\u2019s changed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sword at his side, banner in hand and left foot resting on the head of a vanquished Aztec deity, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s looks out over his hometown, as resolute in death and bronze as he must have been in life and steel. Beneath the statue\u2019s lion-studded plinth is the square that bears his name and the stone that marks the site of the house where he was born in 1485. On the wall outside the mayor\u2019s office hangs a tapestry commemorating the 450th anniversary of the conquistador\u2019s death. Medell\u00edn, a picturesque town in southwest Spain, has never forgotten Cort\u00e9s. But nor has Mexico. Five hundred years after the young Extremaduran began his conquest, his legacy remains deeply divisive. At a press conference in November, Mexico\u2019s populist president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, responded to a question on his predecessors\u2019 economic policies by invoking the country\u2019s top historical villain. \u201cHern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s had barely disembarked in Veracruz and without any legal basis \u2026 he named himself mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the first fraud.\u201d His comments on Cort\u00e9s sparked a strong response \u2013 and exposed the faultlines of class and race that run under Mexican society. The president, a keen student of history, often uses the country\u2019s turbulent past to promote his political purposes. He has promised to put poor and indigenous people first and to strip the often overwhelmingly white Mexican elite of its privileges. Opponents accused Amlo \u2013 as L\u00f3pez Obrador is known \u2013 of not having his facts straight, arguing that no fraud could have been committed as Mexico did not exist as a country at the time. Supporters, meanwhile, rallied around the president. One lawmaker from Amlo\u2019s Morena party demanded that Cort\u00e9s remains be removed from their resting place in central Mexico City, calling them \u201ca point of infection that has only done damage to us\u201d. It was far from the first time that Amlo had pointed the finger at Cort\u00e9s. In March, he marked the anniversary of the 1519 Battle of Centla \u2013 between Cort\u00e9s\u2019 men and the Mayan-Chontal people \u2013 by asking the Spanish crown and the Vatican to apologise for the conquest. \u201cThey built their churches on top of the [indigenous] temples,\u201d Amlo said. \u201cThe time has come to reconcile. But let us ask forgiveness first.\u201d The Madrid government rejected the call to apologise, insisting that the Spanish conquest of Mexico could not \u201cbe judged in the light of contemporary considerations\u201d. Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party was rather less diplomatic in the face of an affront to one of its heroes: \u201cSomeone needs to tell this puffed-up mediocrity that Mexico\u2019s been independent for 200 years and that he should stop picking fights with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, who\u2019s been dead for more than 400 years.\u201d Amlo\u2019s opponents also refused to say sorry. By failing to do so, said Federico Est\u00e9vez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, they were wrongfooted into defending Spain rather than Mexico. \u201cHe\u2019s running a turkey shoot when it comes to these symbolic battles,\u201d added Est\u00e9vez. \u201cAnd he\u2019s winning every time.\u201d Amlo\u2019s targeting of a historical villain came even as he appeared willing to do deals with a man seen by many as Mexico\u2019s present-day antagonist. The president has deployed troops to stop Central American migrants and allowed the US to dump asylum seekers in Mexico in an apparent effort to appease Donald Trump. \u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador will try to recover a little from this by associating himself with the national traditions and show that he\u2019s defending the nation,\u201d said Il\u00e1n Semo, historian at the Iberoamerican University. \u201cThe conquest is fundamental in Mexican nationalism,\u201d Semo said. \u201cIt\u2019s the backbone of Mexican nationalism \u2013 which is based in a total attack on Cort\u00e9s, on the Spanish world and in being anti-Hispanic.\u201d Cort\u00e9s has traditionally been portrayed in Mexican murals as a monster, while the name of his indigenous lover and translator, La Malinche, has yielded the word malinchista, disdainfully applied to those who prefer all things foreign ahead of the domestic. But the anniversary has triggered a strong interest to revisit the conquest. A TV series titled Hern\u00e1n debuted amid enormous fanfare in November in Mexico and abroad via streaming services.

Pozo is adamant that the statue is going nowhere but admits to mixed feelings when he peers out of his office window. \u201cWhen I look at the statue, I feel proud \u2013 but I also recognise that things were done that shouldn\u2019t have been done.\u201d Tom\u00e1s Garc\u00eda, Medell\u00edn\u2019s official historian, has little time for Amlo\u2019s calls for an apology from Spain. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking all of today\u2019s Greeks to apologise for what Alexander the Great did or asking all today\u2019s French people to apologise to the rest of Europe for Napoleon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s known as presentism: it\u2019s judging the events of five centuries ago by the standards of the 21st century.\u201d People would do better, said Garc\u00eda, to recognise their own biases and accept that Cort\u00e9s was simply the product of a very different age. \u201cCort\u00e9s has been used for political ends throughout history,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the 19th century he was a hero and a saint.

But some may not be any more progressive or less predatory than the former ruler.</p> <p>One is Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a 43-year-old warlord accused of systematic human rights abuses, who has emerged as perhaps the most powerful man in the country. He is now deputy chairman of the sovereign council that still holds supreme power.</p> <p>Elsewhere some young leaders who have challenged entrenched interests have stumbled. In South Africa, Mmusi Maimane, a 39-year-old <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2016/08/how-mmusi-maimane-became-obama-soweto\">once breathlessly hailed as the Obama of Soweto,</a> resigned as leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance following disappointing election results.</p> <p>Julius Malema, the 38-year-old leader of the populist, radical leftwing Economic Freedom Fighters, also failed to make any breakthrough in the polls in South Africa and senior party members have been hit by corruption charges, which they deny.</p> <p>In Uganda, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/30/bobi-wine-sent-to-maximum-security-prison-uganda-over-street-rally\">Bobi Wine, an opposition MP and popular music star, has generated international attention</a> but is yet to build the kind of political machine that would challenge the country\u2019s veteran leader, Yoweri Museveni, while in Zimbabwe, Nelson Chamisa, a 41-year-old former pastor who has led the Movement for Democratic Change since 2018, has struggled to mobilise sufficient numbers to destabilise the ruling Zanu-PF government under 78-year-old Emmerson Mnangagwa.</p> <p>\u201cThey have inherited, or are opposing, deep-seated neo-patrimonial systems. You can destabilise them, you can even bring down a leader, but the transitional politics are very, very difficult and sometimes they just don\u2019t work out,\u201d said Vines. The situation was highlighted in Algeria, where disputed presidential election results <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/13/algeria-braced-for-protests-as-former-pm-wins-presidential-election\">handed victory to Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a 74-year-old former prime minister and Bouteflika loyalist</a>.</p> <p>The young rulers and challengers remain a minority. The average age of African leaders is more than 60, which means that the continent with the youngest citizens has the oldest rulers.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen some younger leaders but there are still a lot of very old ones too,\u201d Cheeseman said.</p>",

Two \u201cdinosaurs\u201d who were forced out of politics in 2019 \u2013 Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the 82-year-old president of Algeria, who had ruled since 1999, and Omar al-Bashir, 75, in power in Sudan since 1989 \u2013 fell victim to mass movements spearheaded by young protesters, though in each case the once-powerful rulers were left vulnerable when armed forces withdrew their support. The huge numbers of young people reaching adulthood across Africa have fuelled a powerful desire for change and has pushed forward a new wave of younger political figures who could dramatically influence the continent\u2019s future. One of the most striking recent appointments was in Angola, where its president, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, appointed Vera Daves de Sousa, a 34-year-old former researcher and analyst, to be the new finance minister. The political system in the former Portuguese colony has long been dominated by elderly men, especially senior soldiers who fought in the decades-long civil war. Alex Vines, director of the Africa programme at London\u2019s Chatham House, said Louren\u00e7o\u2019s appointment of a swath of younger people, including many women, to senior positions within the government was a gamble. \u201cHe has leapfrogged a generation to appoint more technocratic, able people, including many women, to key posts. He sees them as change agents \u2026 Next year will be the litmus test for the reform process,\u201d Vines said. Perhaps the most high-profile of the young leaders is Abiy Ahmed, the 43-year-old prime minister of Ethiopia and winner of 2019\u2019s Nobel peace prize. Since coming to power in 2018, Abiy has ended a nearly 20-year military stalemate with Eritrea, and pushed through reforms at home, dramatically changing the atmosphere in what was regarded as a repressive state. But he faces upcoming elections amid political infighting and rising ethnic tensions, which have led some analysts to fear that \u201cthe state could crumble\u201d. Nick Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham and an expert in African politics, said Abiy was facing a hard choice between a shift towards authoritarianism, or the difficult task of generating confidence and belief in his reforms. \u201cWhat happens in Ethiopia has massive implications for the countries around it,\u201d Cheeseman said. In Sudan, the protest movement that swept away Bashir has opened the way to younger political figures. But some may not be any more progressive or less predatory than the former ruler. One is Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a 43-year-old warlord accused of systematic human rights abuses, who has emerged as perhaps the most powerful man in the country. He is now deputy chairman of the sovereign council that still holds supreme power. Elsewhere some young leaders who have challenged entrenched interests have stumbled. In South Africa, Mmusi Maimane, a 39-year-old once breathlessly hailed as the Obama of Soweto, resigned as leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance following disappointing election results. Julius Malema, the 38-year-old leader of the populist, radical leftwing Economic Freedom Fighters, also failed to make any breakthrough in the polls in South Africa and senior party members have been hit by corruption charges, which they deny. In Uganda, Bobi Wine, an opposition MP and popular music star, has generated international attention but is yet to build the kind of political machine that would challenge the country\u2019s veteran leader, Yoweri Museveni, while in Zimbabwe, Nelson Chamisa, a 41-year-old former pastor who has led the Movement for Democratic Change since 2018, has struggled to mobilise sufficient numbers to destabilise the ruling Zanu-PF government under 78-year-old Emmerson Mnangagwa. \u201cThey have inherited, or are opposing, deep-seated neo-patrimonial systems. You can destabilise them, you can even bring down a leader, but the transitional politics are very, very difficult and sometimes they just don\u2019t work out,\u201d said Vines. The situation was highlighted in Algeria, where disputed presidential election results handed victory to Abdelmadjid Tebboune, a 74-year-old former prime minister and Bouteflika loyalist. The young rulers and challengers remain a minority. The average age of African leaders is more than 60, which means that the continent with the youngest citizens has the oldest rulers. \u201cWe have seen some younger leaders but there are still a lot of very old ones too,\u201d Cheeseman said.",

Are they all coincidences?\u201d she said. \u201cIs that about journalists putting themselves in danger? It\u2019s not me or a single journalist\u2019s lack of training. It\u2019s about police targeting journalists.\u201d Today, Indah is unsure whether she will ever be able to go back to the frontline. Relying only on her left eye has badly affected her depth perception. While she is able to talk about what happened, she cannot bear walking on the footbridge where she was injured. One thing she is certain about is pushing ahead with her case. In the days after she was shot, friends and family advised her to focus on recovering. One friend cautioned her: \u201cYou better keep quiet. This is big. You might not be able to handle it.\u201d Lying in her hospital bed, Indah thought about other people who have been injured at the protests but were afraid to speak out and risk being prosecuted for illegal assembly or other charges. \u201cThis is not only about me, not only about journalists, but about Hong Kong people. Because what happened to me will happen again if there are no consequences for the police, if there is no reform of the system,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I decided to continue because God knows it would be easier for me if I gave up.\u201d",

It hinges on a delightful, occasionally gruesome tastelessness usually associated with camp icons like John Waters. Inaccessible indie-rap operas are framed as free-associative conversations with a therapist; pop tracks double as murder ballads; a staunch and widely criticised obsession with slurs culminate not in any kind of apology, but in a gorgeous and gob-smacking coming-out record, 2017\u2019s Scum Fuck Flower Boy.</p> <p>Igor, 2019\u2019s dizzyingly produced and emotionally wounded breakup record, drove home the scope and ingenuity of Tyler\u2019s art, the album\u2019s unlikely blend of horror score sonics and top 40 songwriting a fitting next step in the musician\u2019s journey. On Monday, on the second night of Beyond the Valley festival in the Gippsland town of Lardner, Tyler stepped onstage for his first Victorian show in six years, delivering an inspiring and thrilling career-spanning set that capitalised on Igor\u2019s gaudy, theatrical heart.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/16/best-albums-2019-no-5-tyler-the-creator-igor\">The 50 best albums of 2019, No 5: Tyler, the Creator \u2013\u00a0Igor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tyler\u2019s journey back to Australia has been a messy one.

(Tyler\u2019s response was to call out one of the protestors by name on stage.) When, two years later, a follow-up tour was announced, Collective Shout swiftly launched a petition to immigration minister Peter Dutton to have the rapper banned from entry to the country.

      "bodyText": "Since Tyler, the Creator\u2019s solo career began at the tail end of the 2000s, the 28-year-old rapper and producer has been perfecting an outr\u00e9 and utterly compelling performance style. It hinges on a delightful, occasionally gruesome tastelessness usually associated with camp icons like John Waters. Inaccessible indie-rap operas are framed as free-associative conversations with a therapist; pop tracks double as murder ballads; a staunch and widely criticised obsession with slurs culminate not in any kind of apology, but in a gorgeous and gob-smacking coming-out record, 2017\u2019s Scum Fuck Flower Boy. Igor, 2019\u2019s dizzyingly produced and emotionally wounded breakup record, drove home the scope and ingenuity of Tyler\u2019s art, the album\u2019s unlikely blend of horror score sonics and top 40 songwriting a fitting next step in the musician\u2019s journey. On Monday, on the second night of Beyond the Valley festival in the Gippsland town of Lardner, Tyler stepped onstage for his first Victorian show in six years, delivering an inspiring and thrilling career-spanning set that capitalised on Igor\u2019s gaudy, theatrical heart. Tyler\u2019s journey back to Australia has been a messy one. His 2013 tour, in support of that year\u2019s album, Wolf, was vehemently protested by the activist group Collective Shout due to perceived misogyny in his lyrics.

When, two years later, a follow-up tour was announced, Collective Shout swiftly launched a petition to immigration minister Peter Dutton to have the rapper banned from entry to the country. The tour was subsequently cancelled. When Tyler takes the stage in Lardner, though, all memory of Collective Shout \u2013 who dialled back their protests this time around \u2013 seems to have melted away.

Samuel McPaul died on Monday just before 6pm when the truck he was travelling in crashed at Jingellic, about 110km east of Albury in NSW. An emotional Rural Fire Service commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons, on Tuesday said the 10-tonne truck was hit by winds so extreme at the 26,000-hectare Green Valley fire that it flipped on its roof. The 28-year-old died at the scene. McPaul was expecting his first child in May with his wife, Megan, whom he married last year. An RFS spokesman said the truck was hit by a \u201cfreakish weather event that had to be seen to be believed\u201d, best described as a \u201cfire tornado\u201d.

He shocked the scientific community when he announced at a conference in Hong Kong that he had created genetically modified twin sisters, dubbed Lulu and Nana, and that a third child was on the way. The court in Shenzhen found He guilty of \u201cillegal medical practices\u201d and in addition to the prison sentence fined him 3m yuan (\u00a3327,360), according to the state news agency, Xinhua. Two others on He\u2019s research team received lesser fines and sentences. \u201cThe three accused did not have the proper certification to practise medicine, and in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment,\u201d the court said, according to Xinhua. \u201cThey\u2019ve crossed the bottom line of ethics in scientific research and medical ethics.\u201d He said he used a gene-editing procedure known as Crispr-Cas9 to rewrite the DNA in the girls\u2019 embryos. The scientist claimed the modifications would make the children immune to HIV by turning a gene called CCR5 into a mutant form that prevents the virus from invading cells. But the court found He had forged documents from an ethics review panel that were used to recruit couples for the research. The couples that enrolled had a man with HIV and a woman without and were offered IVF in return for taking part. Zhang Renli, who worked with He, was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1m yuan. Colleague Qin Jinzhou received an 18-month sentence, but with a two-year reprieve, and a 500,000 yuan fine. He\u2019s experiments, which were carried out on seven embryos in late 2018, sent shockwaves through the medical and scientific world. The work was swiftly condemned for deceiving vulnerable patients and using a risky, untested procedure with no medical justification. Earlier this month, MIT Technology Review released excerpts from an early manuscript of He\u2019s work. It casts serious doubts on his claims to have made the children immune to HIV.

This claim, detailed in a secret Foreign Office note to the prime minister, is among documents available to read at the National Archives in Kew fromTuesday that expose the depth of Anglo-French distrust during the Balkans conflict. The papers reveal the newly elected French president, Jaques Chirac, was accused by British officials of \u201clunacy\u201d, \u201cgrandstanding\u201d and inconsistency over what should be done to protect vulnerable Muslim enclaves. More than 8,000 men and boys were murdered in Srebrenica in early July 1995 after Bosnian Serb forces overran the town, which was designated as a safe area and protected by Dutch soldiers. The international criminal court for the former Yugoslavia later ruled the crimes amounted to genocide. Key files and passages have been withheld from the release of government files under section 3 (4) the Public Records Act, but a picture nonetheless emerges of tension between Nato allies as they scrambled to respond to a succession of crises.

One of his aides took a glass of champagne from him when the aide felt enough was enough and he was alcoholically cheerful at his press conference with Clinton.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a94ac25727ed6e3adbf412908b387ca38b33a99f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a94ac25727ed6e3adbf412908b387ca38b33a99f/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Malcolm Rifkind with the Palace of Westminster in the background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Malcolm Rifkind: \u2018I was trying to find a way to say could we support close cooperation with Russia.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Foreign Office drafted a note headed: \u201cContingency Planning for Yeltsin\u2019s Death\u201d. It stated: \u201cYeltsin is six years older than the average life expectancy of the Russian male (58) and has now had two heart attacks in three and a half months.</p> <p>\u201cHis approved intention to curb his drinking after his first heart attack did not endure; there is little reason to be confident that he will do better this time. He is a bad insurance risk.\u201d A message of condolence from the prime minister was prepared in case of sudden death.</p> <p>The idea of soothing Russia\u2019s anxieties emerged in preparatory notes for the foreign policy seminar at Chequers.</p> <p>In a 10-page submission, Rifkind argued that: \u201cA possible solution would be to create a new category of associate member of Nato. Such a status could not involve article V guarantees [which declares an attack on one state is an attack on all members], membership of the IMS [Nato\u2019s International Military Staff ] or Russian vetoes and would not therefore change the essence of Nato.</p> <p>\u201cIt would, however, give Russia a formal status within Nato, allow it to attend, as of right, ministerial and other meetings and encourage a gradual convergence and harmonisation of policy, doctrine and practice.\u201d</p> <p>The problem, he said, was that post-communist Russia \u201chas entered a difficult and doubtful phase with Yeltsin visibly weakened and Russian democrats and westernisers on the defensive\u201d. Even reformers, Rifkind added, \u201care antagonistic to Nato enlargement\u201d.</p> <p>Associate membership could be the solution. \u201cIt would most importantly provide an acceptable framework that would allow enlargement to go ahead without rancour and retaliation \u2026</p> <p>\u201cThe status of associate member would also provide the basis of a credible strategy for Nato\u2019s relations with certain other new independent east European states, in particular Ukraine. Countries such as Ukraine, the Baltic states, Belarus and Moldova need their international status strengthened if they are not to be reabsorbed into Moscow\u2019s embrace.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office was cautious. A treaty between Russia and Nato to develop a new relationship might well be needed but the \u201crelationship must not be based on false Russian expectations that she will, one day, become a member of the [Nato] alliance.</p> <p>\u201cWe must not repeat, in the Nato context, the position the EU has got itself into in relation to Turkey \u2013 of promising the prospect of entry which it has not intention of honouring. This could be profoundly destabilising.\u201d</p> <p>Official notes drafted for the prime minister before the seminar expressed similar doubts. \u201cWhat sort of relationship with Nato can we offer Russia as a price for Nato enlargement? Is the notion of associate membership, as suggested by the defence secretary, realistic? (NB important that we keep confidential the fact that we are considering the idea) \u2026</p> <p>\u201cIf Russian representatives were present at all Nato meetings, what effect would this have on Nato\u2019s own decision-making? How much do we care about Ukraine\u2019s or Belarus\u2019 independence?\u201d</p> <p>Among those attending were the prime minister, John Major, Rifkind, the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, and the chancellor, Ken Clarke.</p> <p>Minutes of the meeting show that Rifkind told colleagues current policy was not \u201csufficiently imaginative\u201d. Britain \u201cneeded to decide whether we would maintain a rigid distinction between Nato and Russia \u2026 We should make Russia a more normal member of the western family. We needed to help Yeltsin make Russia a more normal European country.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke was dismissive, describing the idea of including Russia in Nato as \u201cfarcical\u201d. The proposal did not attract support at the seminar.</p> <p>Asked about his initiative this week, Rifkind said: \u201cThat was pre-Putin. We had Gorbachev and Yeltsin who were very cooperative and they were genuinely wanting to become closer to the west. Russia supported action against Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf war.</p> <p>\u201cThey were unhappy about the enlargement of Nato, but didn\u2019t make as much of a fuss about it as you\u2019d expect \u2026 So I was trying to find a way to say could we support close cooperation with Russia, hence my suggestion of it becoming an associate member.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough that idea didn\u2019t happen, it led to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/may/15/russia.iantraynor2\">Nato\u2013Russia Council.</a> This promoted understanding, discussion and consultation [between Nato and Russia]. Russia used to attend some Nato meetings. Sadly, this came to an end after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty\">Putin annexed Crimea</a>.\u201d</p>",

But poor health and heavy drinking jeopardised his authority. The previous year he had notoriously failed to disembark from a plane during a stopover in Ireland amid rumours of alcoholism and a heart attack. In July 1995, the Moscow embassy cabled about Yeltsin going into hospital due to his \u201clongstanding heart condition\u201d. At Hyde Park, the Roosevelt home in New York, according to US diplomats, Yeltsin subsequently appeared \u201crolling, puffy and red\u201d. He consumed \u201cwine and beer greedily \u2026 and regretted the absence of cognac. One of his aides took a glass of champagne from him when the aide felt enough was enough and he was alcoholically cheerful at his press conference with Clinton.\u201d The Foreign Office drafted a note headed: \u201cContingency Planning for Yeltsin\u2019s Death\u201d. It stated: \u201cYeltsin is six years older than the average life expectancy of the Russian male (58) and has now had two heart attacks in three and a half months. \u201cHis approved intention to curb his drinking after his first heart attack did not endure; there is little reason to be confident that he will do better this time. He is a bad insurance risk.\u201d A message of condolence from the prime minister was prepared in case of sudden death. The idea of soothing Russia\u2019s anxieties emerged in preparatory notes for the foreign policy seminar at Chequers. In a 10-page submission, Rifkind argued that: \u201cA possible solution would be to create a new category of associate member of Nato. Such a status could not involve article V guarantees [which declares an attack on one state is an attack on all members], membership of the IMS [Nato\u2019s International Military Staff ] or Russian vetoes and would not therefore change the essence of Nato. \u201cIt would, however, give Russia a formal status within Nato, allow it to attend, as of right, ministerial and other meetings and encourage a gradual convergence and harmonisation of policy, doctrine and practice.\u201d The problem, he said, was that post-communist Russia \u201chas entered a difficult and doubtful phase with Yeltsin visibly weakened and Russian democrats and westernisers on the defensive\u201d. Even reformers, Rifkind added, \u201care antagonistic to Nato enlargement\u201d. Associate membership could be the solution. \u201cIt would most importantly provide an acceptable framework that would allow enlargement to go ahead without rancour and retaliation \u2026 \u201cThe status of associate member would also provide the basis of a credible strategy for Nato\u2019s relations with certain other new independent east European states, in particular Ukraine. Countries such as Ukraine, the Baltic states, Belarus and Moldova need their international status strengthened if they are not to be reabsorbed into Moscow\u2019s embrace.\u201d The Foreign Office was cautious. A treaty between Russia and Nato to develop a new relationship might well be needed but the \u201crelationship must not be based on false Russian expectations that she will, one day, become a member of the [Nato] alliance. \u201cWe must not repeat, in the Nato context, the position the EU has got itself into in relation to Turkey \u2013 of promising the prospect of entry which it has not intention of honouring. This could be profoundly destabilising.\u201d Official notes drafted for the prime minister before the seminar expressed similar doubts. \u201cWhat sort of relationship with Nato can we offer Russia as a price for Nato enlargement? Is the notion of associate membership, as suggested by the defence secretary, realistic? (NB important that we keep confidential the fact that we are considering the idea) \u2026 \u201cIf Russian representatives were present at all Nato meetings, what effect would this have on Nato\u2019s own decision-making? How much do we care about Ukraine\u2019s or Belarus\u2019 independence?\u201d Among those attending were the prime minister, John Major, Rifkind, the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, and the chancellor, Ken Clarke. Minutes of the meeting show that Rifkind told colleagues current policy was not \u201csufficiently imaginative\u201d. Britain \u201cneeded to decide whether we would maintain a rigid distinction between Nato and Russia \u2026 We should make Russia a more normal member of the western family. We needed to help Yeltsin make Russia a more normal European country.\u201d Clarke was dismissive, describing the idea of including Russia in Nato as \u201cfarcical\u201d. The proposal did not attract support at the seminar. Asked about his initiative this week, Rifkind said: \u201cThat was pre-Putin. We had Gorbachev and Yeltsin who were very cooperative and they were genuinely wanting to become closer to the west. Russia supported action against Saddam Hussein in the first Gulf war. \u201cThey were unhappy about the enlargement of Nato, but didn\u2019t make as much of a fuss about it as you\u2019d expect \u2026 So I was trying to find a way to say could we support close cooperation with Russia, hence my suggestion of it becoming an associate member. \u201cAlthough that idea didn\u2019t happen, it led to the Nato\u2013Russia Council. This promoted understanding, discussion and consultation [between Nato and Russia]. Russia used to attend some Nato meetings. Sadly, this came to an end after Putin annexed Crimea.\u201d",

The prime minister was intrigued by the idea after a Mayfair businessman, inspired by reading the bestselling novel Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin, lobbied him. In a letter to Major in 1996, Harvey Spack wrote that he had just finished the novel, set during the second world war on a Greek island where the people kept \u201clooking to the heavens to pray for salvation by Winston Churchill\u201d. Spack, whose first-name terms with the prime minister suggest he was an acquaintance, acknowledged the idea was a \u201chobby horse\u201d of his. \u201cNew York has Kennedy airport, Paris has De Gaulle and we have the stupid name of Heathrow! It should be renamed with the name of the greatest man of the century, who has no truly great memorial in our country, the Winston Churchill airport, or Churchill airport,\u201d Spack wrote. \u201cI can only see this as a tremendous boost to the \u2018feel good factor\u2019 for all of us.\u201d Major thanked him for his \u201cintriguing idea about renaming Heathrow airport after Sir Winston Churchill. I am looking into this, and I am grateful for you raising it.\u201d Major\u2019s principal private secretary, Alex Allan, then wrote to the Department of Transport: \u201cThe prime minister would be grateful for your secretary of state\u2019s initial and personal views on the idea \u2013 both on the merits and practicalities, and also on how this might be floated if it seemed worth pursuing.\u201d Clearly the idea was not adopted, but the files do not reveal why. One reason may be that there was already a Churchill airport, in Manitoba, Canada, opened during the second world war.",

The overwhelming majority of jockeys dream of a single Grade One winner in their career, never mind six in nine months.</p> \n<p>And yet, even now, her achievements are too often defined by comparison with other female jockeys, rather than the weighing room as a whole. As De Bromhead says, \u201cmale or female, it doesn\u2019t really matter\u201d, and so here is a hope and a wish. Perhaps, somewhere down the line in 2020 or beyond, Blackmore will ride a Grade One winner and the fact she is female will seem relevant to no one at all.

He represents the new and promising trainer D J Jeffreys and improved for the fitting of a tongue tie last time, though he will certainly have to improve some more.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m surprised to see 12-1 about<strong> Poniente (3.30) </strong>in the bumper, as Venetia Williams\u2019s stable is in much better form than when she flopped on reappearance. The hood and jockey change may also help.</p> \n<p>The nap is Another Touch at Lingfield but I\u2019m worried about him and will skip the race, as he\u2019s drifted to 5-1, a price he should not be on the evidence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1fa723f5-c27c-469c-8a4d-f6b0bd6e01ad\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Lingfield</b>&nbsp;<br><b>12.00</b> Man Of The Sea<b> 12.35</b> St Just <b>1.05</b> Another Touch (nap) <b>1.40</b> Entangling&nbsp;<b>2.10</b> Buy Me Back <b>2.45</b> Jackstar <b>3.20</b> Kath's Lustre<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Uttoxeter</b>&nbsp;<br><b>12.15 </b>Dubai Outlaw <b>12.45</b> Accordingtogino <b>1.20</b> Seaston Spirit <b>1.50</b> No&nbsp;Rematch <b>2.25</b> Storm Wizard <b>3.00</b> Mr Washington <b>3.30 </b>Poniente&nbsp;<br><br><b>Warwick</b>&nbsp;<br><b>12.25</b> Dadsinluck <b>12.55</b> Emmas Joy <b>1.30 </b>Very Live <b>2.00 </b>High Counsel <b>2.35</b> His&nbsp;Dream (nb) <b>3.10</b> Top Decision <b>3.40</b> Wireless Operator&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

By then, she may also have her first Grade One of 2020 in the bag, but wherever it comes, it will be astonishing if she does not add more big-race wins to her record. It\u2019s what the elite jockeys do and Blackmore is most certainly in that bracket. The overwhelming majority of jockeys dream of a single Grade One winner in their career, never mind six in nine months. And yet, even now, her achievements are too often defined by comparison with other female jockeys, rather than the weighing room as a whole. As De Bromhead says, \u201cmale or female, it doesn\u2019t really matter\u201d, and so here is a hope and a wish. Perhaps, somewhere down the line in 2020 or beyond, Blackmore will ride a Grade One winner and the fact she is female will seem relevant to no one at all. It could well be the most groundbreaking achievement of all. Tuesday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook At 8-1 from 14s, His Dream (2.35) is my main interest at Warwick. Jonjo O\u2019Neill\u2019s runner has been in the doldrums but Jonjo Jr is back aboard and the pair won this race from a similar mark a year ago, when he was owned by the firm that sponsors the card. Dubai Outlaw (12.15) is an interesting market mover for Uttoxeter\u2019s opener, down to 8-1 from the opening 14s. He represents the new and promising trainer D J Jeffreys and improved for the fitting of a tongue tie last time, though he will certainly have to improve some more. I\u2019m surprised to see 12-1 about Poniente (3.30) in the bumper, as Venetia Williams\u2019s stable is in much better form than when she flopped on reappearance. The hood and jockey change may also help. The nap is Another Touch at Lingfield but I\u2019m worried about him and will skip the race, as he\u2019s drifted to 5-1, a price he should not be on the evidence.",

      "body": "<p>Growing numbers of people with cancer are seeking advice from Macmillan Cancer Support because overstretched NHS staff are too busy to answer their questions, the charity says.</p> <p>Patients are having to call its helpline for information and guidance instead of asking doctors and nurses in cancer services, who are often too \u201crushed off their feet\u201d to have the time needed.</p> <p>Some people are already \u201cat breaking point\u201d by the time they call because they are suffering from anxiety, fear and depression over their diagnosis and what their future holds.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day people call our support line because their world has been turned upside down by a cancer diagnosis. Whatever the concern \u2013 fear about impending test results, anxiety about how they will tell their children or what their scan outcome means \u2013 they just need someone to listen and help them make sense of it all,\u201d said Ellen Lang, a service manager on Macmillan\u2019s support line.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you only have 10 minutes with your doctor and your nurses are visibly rushed off their feet it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll leave without all the answers you need. This is something we\u2019re hearing from people more often now.</p> <p>\u201cWe are able to offer that listening ear and support to those who need it \u2013 something we know NHS staff would like to do much more of but just don\u2019t always have the time any more.\u201d</p> <p>By 19 December the charity\u2019s helpline had already helped 65,912 people who between them made 241,234 inquiries. That is up on the 61,701 people it helped in the same period last year and the 58,055 and 55,622 it helped in 2017 and 2016 respectively.</p> <p>The number of people needing emotional support \u2013 with anxiety, depression and fear \u2013 has risen by 20% in the last year alone, to 8,011.

      "bodyText": "Growing numbers of people with cancer are seeking advice from Macmillan Cancer Support because overstretched NHS staff are too busy to answer their questions, the charity says. Patients are having to call its helpline for information and guidance instead of asking doctors and nurses in cancer services, who are often too \u201crushed off their feet\u201d to have the time needed. Some people are already \u201cat breaking point\u201d by the time they call because they are suffering from anxiety, fear and depression over their diagnosis and what their future holds. \u201cEvery day people call our support line because their world has been turned upside down by a cancer diagnosis. Whatever the concern \u2013 fear about impending test results, anxiety about how they will tell their children or what their scan outcome means \u2013 they just need someone to listen and help them make sense of it all,\u201d said Ellen Lang, a service manager on Macmillan\u2019s support line. \u201cWhen you only have 10 minutes with your doctor and your nurses are visibly rushed off their feet it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll leave without all the answers you need. This is something we\u2019re hearing from people more often now. \u201cWe are able to offer that listening ear and support to those who need it \u2013 something we know NHS staff would like to do much more of but just don\u2019t always have the time any more.\u201d By 19 December the charity\u2019s helpline had already helped 65,912 people who between them made 241,234 inquiries. That is up on the 61,701 people it helped in the same period last year and the 58,055 and 55,622 it helped in 2017 and 2016 respectively. The number of people needing emotional support \u2013 with anxiety, depression and fear \u2013 has risen by 20% in the last year alone, to 8,011. That is the commonest reason for calling and more than those seeking help with issues related to the side-effects of treatment (2,254), pain (882) and tests (1,297). Demand for its advice has prompted Macmillan to expand its helpline service, which usually operates from 8am to 8pm. It is staffed by cancer information nurses and advisers, financial guides, welfare-rights advisers, a work-support team and energy-advice specialists. Staff say that many people who call do so in distress at not having had the time to process information about their condition and prognosis when talking to doctors and nurses. The charity said the growing number of people both being referred for investigation of suspected cancer and diagnosed with the disease is adding to the pressures on NHS cancer staff. Lynda Thomas, the charity\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s heartrending that so many people call at breaking point, having struggled to find the support they need from their healthcare team who we know are run ragged and doing the best they can. \u201cNHS staff do an extraordinary job faced with huge pressures. But as increased demand for our services shows there simply aren\u2019t enough of them to meet the needs of the growing number of people living with cancer.\u201d NHS England did not respond directly to Macmillan\u2019s findings and instead stressed that cancer patients\u2019 experience was improving in other ways, as is how long they live after diagnosis. In a statement, an NHS spokesperson said: \u201cMost importantly cancer survival is at a record high, and so too patients\u2019 satisfaction with their care, with nine out of 10 patients happy with the support they\u2019ve received, all of which is testament to the hard work and compassion of NHS staff. \u201cThis progress has come despite more people than ever getting checked for cancer, with 2.2 million getting tested last year. Our NHS Long Term Plan will ensure that by 2021 every person diagnosed with cancer will have access to personalised care plans, including a needs assessment and health and wellbeing support.\u201d",
