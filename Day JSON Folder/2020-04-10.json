The Baltimore institution says at least 1,681,964 people have been infected, while 374,509 have recovered. Nearly 1,000 more confirmed dead in France The French death toll passed 13,000, the health ministry director J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon said. A further 554 deaths were confirmed in French hospitals and 433 in care and retirement homes. Italy extends lockdown Restrictions will remain in place in Italy for another three weeks, the country\u2019s prime minister has said, although a few types of shop will be allowed to reopen from next Tuesday. Giuseppe Conte said: \u201cThis is a difficult but necessary decision for which I take all political responsibility.\u201d Trump promises to listen to expert advice on reopening economy The US president said he is creating a second taskforce that will include a council tasked with deciding when to ease restrictions. But Donald Trump, who has repeatedly pushed the idea, insists he is not determined to reopen the economy if he is advised that to do so would endanger public health. Turkey imposes lockdown Turkey has put in place a two-day lockdown in 31 provinces, including Istanbul, Ankara and other major cities, its interior ministry said, adding that the curbs will begin at midnight and end at the same time on Sunday. The country\u2019s known death toll stands at 1,006 people. Liverpool legend tests positive Kenny Dalglish tested positive for the virus while in hospital for treatment on a separate infection, his family announced. The 69-year-old former player and manager was admitted to hospital on Wednesday for a course of intravenous antibiotics and, in line with current procedures, underwent a test for Covid-19 despite displaying no symptoms of the illness. UK urged to investigate death rate disparities The government must urgently look into if and why black, Asian and minority ethnic people are more vulnerable to Covid-19, the head of the British Medical Association said, after it emerged that the first 10 doctors in the UK named as having died from the virus were all BAME. UK\u2019s death rate worsens The country recorded 980 deaths in a day, the worst such toll since the outbreak began, taking the cumulative total of those who have died in hospitals to 8,958.

In the post-Bourdain television landscape, Netflix is home to his most likely successor. The food travelogue space is crowded, but David Chang\u2019s <strong>Ugly Delicious</strong> is required viewing, a mix of the Momofuku magnate\u2019s bluntness and a line-up of modern culinary greats. His spin off, <strong>Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner</strong> is proof (perhaps) that Hollywood has a renewed appetite for our food programming. A stoner\u2019s delight, the first episode sees actor, writer and producer Seth Rogen guide Chang around his native Vancouver. A whole different kind of bake-off ensues.</p> <p>Movie polymath Jon Favreau teams up with LA chef and food truck legend Roy Choi for <strong>The Chef Show </strong>(Netflix), jumping from Goop HQ with Gwyneth Paltrow (Favreau\u2019s Marvel franchise co-star), to a tribute episode to the late-great LA Times critic, Jonathan Gold, and Austin-based BBQ savant Aaron Franklin. You suspect Favreau \u2013 who has worked across the biggest cinematic franchises, including Marvel, Star Wars and Disney live-action remakes \u2013 is in it for the kick of cooking with Choi, who helped him train for his role in Chef (the 2014 film he also wrote, directed and produced).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19a27d3a400cee6879e0669b75beabc851b839e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19a27d3a400cee6879e0669b75beabc851b839e9/0_0_3116_1870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roy Choi at his Restaurant Pots, located at the Line Hotel, Korea Town, Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roy Choi at his Restaurant Pots, located at the Line Hotel, Korea Town, Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barry J Holmes/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Broken Bread</strong> (Amazon Prime) sees Choi take top billing.

Broken Bread sees Choi explore the food politics afflicting his native Los Angeles, meeting gang members turned bakers, mayor Eric Garcetti, and those taking aim at the \u201cfood desert\u201d of the inner city. \u201cFood doesn\u2019t just nourish us when we\u2019re hungry, it can be a catalyst for change,\u201d says Choi.

Meanwhile, the journey of former food critic Matthew Evans to Tassie farmer and restaurateur, <strong>Gourmet Farmer </strong>(SBS On Demand), is a salve for the soul in these times.

For some this may hold true: with a busy life and access to convenience food, watching other people make food is preferable to standing over the stove yourself. But perhaps now that we all seem to have nothing but time at home, there\u2019s more scope to get into the kitchen \u2013 or just binge on your favourite comfort-cooking shows. If ever there was a cook for our present predicament it\u2019s Nigella Lawson. \u201cI need to be alone with my sandwich now,\u201d she says in the intro to At My Table (ABC iView). \u201cLife can be complicated, cooking doesn\u2019t have to be\u201d is a throw away line that seems prescient. More than just a TV cook, with her looks to camera down pat, Lawson is foremost a food writer, and one of the best. It\u2019s this wealth of knowledge, and knack for knowing what we want to eat beyond the fickle fashions of the restaurant world, that comes through in a show you can cook from without intimidation. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking schnitzel time\u201d: Matty Matheson sounds intimidating on It\u2019s Suppertime (SBS On Demand), but he drops as many practical hints as he does f-bombs. These 21-minute episodes are packed with how-tos on much needed comfort foods, from meatloaf, to ramen and banh mi, a 10-day-brined corned beef (we have the time) and yes, that \u201cfucking schnitzel\u201d. For those that love to eat, travel, and travel to eat, we are in constrained times. In the post-Bourdain television landscape, Netflix is home to his most likely successor. The food travelogue space is crowded, but David Chang\u2019s Ugly Delicious is required viewing, a mix of the Momofuku magnate\u2019s bluntness and a line-up of modern culinary greats. His spin off, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner is proof (perhaps) that Hollywood has a renewed appetite for our food programming. A stoner\u2019s delight, the first episode sees actor, writer and producer Seth Rogen guide Chang around his native Vancouver. A whole different kind of bake-off ensues. Movie polymath Jon Favreau teams up with LA chef and food truck legend Roy Choi for The Chef Show (Netflix), jumping from Goop HQ with Gwyneth Paltrow (Favreau\u2019s Marvel franchise co-star), to a tribute episode to the late-great LA Times critic, Jonathan Gold, and Austin-based BBQ savant Aaron Franklin. You suspect Favreau \u2013 who has worked across the biggest cinematic franchises, including Marvel, Star Wars and Disney live-action remakes \u2013 is in it for the kick of cooking with Choi, who helped him train for his role in Chef (the 2014 film he also wrote, directed and produced). Broken Bread (Amazon Prime) sees Choi take top billing. While he\u2019s known for his roots in the food truck scene \u2013 his Kogi truck serving up his famed Korean Short Rib Taco \u2013 he\u2019s gone on to build a small empire. Locol, his now shuttered fast food concept, looked to tackle food inequalities, first in Watts and then America wide. Broken Bread sees Choi explore the food politics afflicting his native Los Angeles, meeting gang members turned bakers, mayor Eric Garcetti, and those taking aim at the \u201cfood desert\u201d of the inner city. \u201cFood doesn\u2019t just nourish us when we\u2019re hungry, it can be a catalyst for change,\u201d says Choi. It\u2019s a show that\u2019s full of redemption, and most importantly at the moment, hope. Then there are the homegrown offerings. With a genuine zeal and curiosity, Adam Liaw has secured his spot as one of the most watchable hosts of the food travelogue genre that SBS has mined over the years. All seasons of Destination Flavour (SBS On Demand) are now streaming; a return to his Japanese odyssey should be on anyone\u2019s viewing roster. Meanwhile, the journey of former food critic Matthew Evans to Tassie farmer and restaurateur, Gourmet Farmer (SBS On Demand), is a salve for the soul in these times. The thought of retreating to the Apple Isle for a bucolic tree change is surely on the minds of many right now \u2013 if border restrictions weren\u2019t so tight. When I last wrote on the Netflix revolution in food programming, some commenters felt I\u2019d misjudged our homegrown talent as I\u2019d labelled them predictable and lacking in creativity. I admit now that there are exceptions, but also that the predictable and familiar can offer needed comfort in uncertain times.",

It will affect a lot of people in a lot of different ways.\u201d Henman is particularly concerned the disruption will hit low-ranked players hardest. \u201cFurther down the pecking order this will have huge implications where people are not going to have an income.\u201d He also added his voice to those of the outgoing All England Club chief executive, Richard Lewis, and the relatively new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, who fear there is a possibility the 2020 calendar may be wiped out entirely. \u201cYou have got to be positive and optimistic that [the US Open in August] can be played but, if it weren\u2019t, I don\u2019t think anyone would be greatly surprised,\u201d Henman said. The game\u2019s next big event may be the second ATP Cup, where Henman made a confident debut as the Great Britain coach at the start of the year, leading them to the quarter-finals. \u201cIf I were asked to do it again, schedule permitting, I would definitely do it because it was a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had said a month ago the next event was going to be the ATP Cup in Australia in January, I think people would have looked at you a bit strangely. But the world is a very, very different place right now.\u201d",

Keep to night-time rituals like brushing teeth and reading bedtime stories whenever possible. Find regular times for children to focus on schoolwork.

A Parent\u2019s Guide to Playful Learning for Children Ages 2 to 5, Truglio writes about turning everyday tasks into learning moments. Enlisting kids to create a shopping list can be a way to use the alphabet and build vocabulary. Building towers with blocks can mean talking about shapes, width and height. <a href=\"https://medium.com/sesame-street-caring-for-each-other/sesame-streets-tips-for-families-at-home-drawing-cooking-and-moving-together-55a76369e48e\">Cooking dinner or doing laundry</a> is a chance to practice math and measurements.</p> <p>A key, said Truglio, is to make learning playful. \u201cLean in and follow your child\u2019s interest,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not good is to do flashcards and rote learning. It\u2019s not very interesting. When children are playing, they\u2019re activated, they\u2019re invested in the learning. When they are trying to solve a problem, they learn through trial and error. They learn not to give up.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Coping with the \u2018for-now normal\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The pandemic is presenting a new kind of trauma, explained Akimi Gibson, vice-president and education publisher at Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. \u201cThis trauma is universal.

      "bodyText": "Since 1969, the puppets of Sesame Street have raised generations of children, preparing them for school and helping them talk to adults about how they feel. When crisis has struck, Sesame Street has responded, helping children process big emotions about the 9/11 attacks, parents who struggle with addiction or incarceration \u2013 and now, the coronavirus pandemic. Sesame Street is one of the most researched children\u2019s television programs in history, with evidence attesting to the learning gains made by children, particularly young children of color and those living in poverty. About 60 people \u2013 including in-house experts, researchers and production team members \u2013 collaborate to bring a single episode to air. As coronavirus closes at least 124,000 schools across the countryand millions of parents are thrust into the position of full-time caregivers, here is Sesame Street\u2019s advice for parents, teachers and children. \u2018Flexibility is the keyword\u2019 Children thrive on structure and sticking to routine brings them a sense of security, according to Rosemarie Truglio, vice-president of curriculum and content for Sesame Street. Unfortunately, a spiraling health crisis that has overwhelmed hospitals and required families to shelter in place has made it all but impossible to say what\u2019s coming next. So how do parents create routine in an unpredictable moment? \u201cFlexibility is the key word,\u201d said Truglio. \u201cAll children do best with structure, but we also need to be flexible if plans go awry.\u201d The trick for parents, said Truglio, is to stick to the routines that are within control. Keep to night-time rituals like brushing teeth and reading bedtime stories whenever possible. Find regular times for children to focus on schoolwork. Days may feel frantic, but small moments of structure can help create a sense of normalcy. If plans don\u2019t work out, pivot. If it rains, move a picnic to the living room. If you miss a morning reading activity, do it in the afternoon. And just as importantly, let children see that you\u2019re capable of adapting when plans come apart. Handling frustration and disappointment is a crucial piece of child development. \u201cBuilding resilience is key,\u201d Truglio said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long this is going to last. We all have to be resilient.\u201d Embracing everyday moments The good news for parents is that children learn best through everyday moments. In her book Sesame Street: Ready for School! A Parent\u2019s Guide to Playful Learning for Children Ages 2 to 5, Truglio writes about turning everyday tasks into learning moments. Enlisting kids to create a shopping list can be a way to use the alphabet and build vocabulary. Building towers with blocks can mean talking about shapes, width and height. Cooking dinner or doing laundry is a chance to practice math and measurements. A key, said Truglio, is to make learning playful. \u201cLean in and follow your child\u2019s interest,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s not good is to do flashcards and rote learning. It\u2019s not very interesting. When children are playing, they\u2019re activated, they\u2019re invested in the learning. When they are trying to solve a problem, they learn through trial and error. They learn not to give up.\u201d Coping with the \u2018for-now normal\u2019 The pandemic is presenting a new kind of trauma, explained Akimi Gibson, vice-president and education publisher at Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Sesame Street. \u201cThis trauma is universal. It has no cultural or economic bias. And it caught us all equally by surprise,\u201d Gibson said. . Research attests to the negative impact trauma has on child development \u2013 whether it stems from poverty, a parent addicted to drugs, or a global outbreak. That\u2019s why Sesame Street is leaning into the \u201cfor-now normal\u201d, as the program creators are referring to the moment, by providing tips and resources for talking and listening to children in its recently launched \u201cCaring for Each Other\u201d initiative. \u201cWe have to realize this is a new way to look at trauma\u201d, said Jeanette Betancourt, senior vice-president of Sesame Workshop\u2019s US social impact. \u201cBut most importantly, we need to ask how we can best support children in the most traumatic times, when their voices are often lost.\u201d If you listen closely, children will say what\u2019s on their mind as they narrate their play, Truglio noted. Crucial for caregivers is to listen and help children understand it\u2019s OK to be scared or uncertain. Thankfully, the support children will need to adapt looks a lot like what they have always needed. \u201cVery important to young children are routines, but even more important is knowing that grown ups are there for me. We know what young children need: routine, stability and love. A pandemic doesn\u2019t change that,\u201d Betancourt said. In it together Sesame Street is built around children, but its creators understand that adults need help, too. For them, Sesame Street\u2019s message is simple: understand that you\u2019re human and take a breath. \u201cParents can\u2019t help children if they\u2019re not taking care of themselves. It\u2019s like oxygen on a plane. We want to make sure there\u2019s resources there, but also to be kind to themselves,\u201d Truglio said. For Sesame Street, that has meant providing educators with reliable learning resources at a time when they\u2019re facing a glut of untested tip sheets and guides. For parents and caregivers, it has meant helping them understand they don\u2019t have to become the teacher. \u201cA parent has to be a caregiver, first and foremost,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cAnd the educator wants to maintain a status as teacher. The two are in it together for the interest of the child.\u201d At no point do the makers of Sesame Street say any of this will be easy. But neither did they suggest the future has to be grim. \u201cI hope [people can see] a picture of joy within this moment,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThe act of rallying together toward a common goal is not a sad occasion.\u201d",

Witness K, acting on instructions from Asis head David Irvine, helped to plant remote-switch listening devices in the Timor Leste cabinet room.</p> <p>Collaery had straddled positions both as a lawyer for Witness K in an employment dispute with Asis and for the Timor Leste government \u2013 working for the bugger and the buggee. The aim of the eavesdropping was to maximise Australia\u2019s position at the negotiations over boundaries in the Timor Sea and who got the lion\u2019s share of the loot from the oil and gas resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/10/witness-k-and-the-outrageous-spy-scandal-that-failed-to-shame-australia\">Witness K and the 'outrageous' spy scandal that failed to shame Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In June 2018, Collaery and Witness K were summonsed to appear on charges alleging breaches variously of the criminal code and the Intelligence Services Act \u2013 conspiracy to communicate Asis information \u2013 and, in Collaery\u2019s case, also communicating Asis information to journalists at the ABC.</p> <p> The brief of evidence from the Commonwealth DPP had been sitting on the desk of former attorney general George Brandis for over two years. The AG\u2019s consent to the prosecution is required under the legislation.

      "bodyText": "It must have been six years ago or so that an anxious barrister knocked on the door of my cave-like office in Sydney\u2019s CBD with news about Asio\u2019s raids on a former intelligence agent known as Witness K, and Canberra lawyer Bernard Collaery. No sooner had he started to pick through the entrails, involving confiscated computers, files, documents, a USB stick and a passport, than he stopped mid-sentence. \u201cBugger, I shouldn\u2019t have brought my mobile phone with me.\u201d He dashed outside and left his phone on a ledge in the corridor \u2013 convinced the spooks were monitoring his whereabouts and his conversations about Collaery and Witness K. It was my first inkling of the furtiveness and paranoia surrounding Collaery, his work for Timor Leste and the bugging in 2004 of its ministerial offices by operatives of the Australian Security Intelligence Service. Witness K, acting on instructions from Asis head David Irvine, helped to plant remote-switch listening devices in the Timor Leste cabinet room. Collaery had straddled positions both as a lawyer for Witness K in an employment dispute with Asis and for the Timor Leste government \u2013 working for the bugger and the buggee. The aim of the eavesdropping was to maximise Australia\u2019s position at the negotiations over boundaries in the Timor Sea and who got the lion\u2019s share of the loot from the oil and gas resources. In June 2018, Collaery and Witness K were summonsed to appear on charges alleging breaches variously of the criminal code and the Intelligence Services Act \u2013 conspiracy to communicate Asis information \u2013 and, in Collaery\u2019s case, also communicating Asis information to journalists at the ABC. The brief of evidence from the Commonwealth DPP had been sitting on the desk of former attorney general George Brandis for over two years. The AG\u2019s consent to the prosecution is required under the legislation. It was not until Christian Porter, red in tooth and claw, got his feet under the AG\u2019s desk that, with an amount of dispatch, the consent was signed. When he announced the prosecution on 28 June 2018, Porter said, hopefully: \u201cI would also encourage any member with an interest in this case to be conscious of the fact that the priority must be to allow the judicial process to be conducted without commentary which would impact on the fairness and regularity of those proceedings.\u201d You might wonder what planet Porter was orbiting when he signed off on that. Ever since, there have been protests outside the court in Canberra while countless preliminary skirmishes took place. There has been mounting public condemnation of the Commonwealth\u2019s insistence that these prosecutions are of such great importance to national security that the court should be closed and the hearing conducted in secret. And here we were thinking that it is the Howard-era government that is the real wrongdoer, defying international law to spy on a friendly and impoverished neighbour for commercial advantage. Deceitful doesn\u2019t even come close. Witness K has already pleaded guilty to agreed facts relating to his preparation of an affidavit for an in-camera hearing at the Hague. He faces further hearings in the ACT magistrates\u2019 court in April. Collaery has more hearing dates in April which are no longer listed on the ACT courts website. In all, there have been 30 or so scheduled hearings since the charges were laid, most of them conducted in secret. Political teeth marks are all over these prosecutions, with Porter issuing a certificate that proceedings be held in closed court in the interests of national security. Yet the extent to which the court is closed is up to the presiding judge, David Mossop, of the ACT supreme court. No doubt he will weigh the principle of open justice and the danger to the rule of law if justice is shrouded, where reasons for findings of guilt or otherwise cannot be published, and as we\u2019ve seen in the case of Witness J, citizens can be secretly jailed, Stalin-style. The case against closing Collaery\u2019s court hearings was put in an amicus curiae submission to the judge by Ernst Willheim, a former senior officer of the Attorney General\u2019s Department and now a visiting fellow in the college of law at the the Australian National University. He also prepared a similar submission for the Witness K case. Willheim submitted that the parties to the proceedings were unlikely to press arguments about open justice. Indeed, in the Collaery case it\u2019s understood there have been consent orders relating to secrecy, but not for the trial itself. He pressed the point that there needs to a non-party helping the court on the \u201cfundamental importance of openness in judicial proceedings\u201d. Should Collaery be convicted in a closed court, where the defendant\u2019s lawyers and the jury could not see all the evidence, then public confidence in the administration of justice would take a damaging turn for the worse. As it is, confidence is already a delicate flower. Judges and courts only have authority and community acceptance if justice is seen to be done, if reasons are explained openly and if fairness is the guiding principle. The Soviets were good at obtaining guilty verdicts in secret, which then were conveniently used for propaganda purposes because no one knew what really went on. Needless to say, Willheim\u2019s amicus submissions in both the Collaery and K cases were rejected by the courts \u2013 partly on the ground that the commonwealth is a \u201cmodel litigant\u201d. This is not a good omen, for if Covid-19 doesn\u2019t derail the proceedings in the short to medium term, Porter\u2019s submissions on the sanctity of national security could well hold sway with the same outcome in the long term. There is another powerful reason for openness. Collaery could call former prime minister John Howard and former foreign minister Alexander Downer to give evidence and it would be a calamity if the public couldn\u2019t hear their explanations for the bugging. None of which is to say that the accused are entirely without protections. There\u2019s section 80 of the Constitution, which requires trials for offences against any law of the Commonwealth to be tried by jury. A jury trial could be a worthwhile safeguard \u2013 then we could know whether representatives of the community gauge these proceedings as an overreach of prosecutorial and executive power. The former NSW DPP Nicholas Cowdery QC is of the view that in bugging the Timor Leste ministers, Asis was acting beyond its statutory power. There is also the contention that a law that prohibits the disclosure of an illegal act by a public authority may infringe the freedom of political communication. The defence had filed affidavits from former minister for foreign affairs and trade Gareth Evans, former chief of the defence force Admiral Chris Barrie and former senior diplomat John McCarthy. Two other defence affidavits were from former presidents of Timor Leste, Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta. The affidavits themselves are not yet public but justice Mossop told the court those affidavits were intended to directly challenge assertions by the attorney general that there would be a risk of prejudice to Australia\u2019s national security if certain information was disclosed publicly during the substantive criminal proceedings.

Shortly before he was expected to travel overseas for this purpose, his home was raised by Asio and his passport confiscated, and it remains confiscated. In normal court proceedings, it would be a contempt of court or a prejudice to the administration of justice if a witness is prevented from giving evidence. Likewise, when Bernard Collaery\u2019s office was raided in December 2013, the security services took his brief relating to Timor Leste\u2019s arbitration proceedings. Undertakings were made by Brandis that, of course, Australia wouldn\u2019t stoop so low as to access the contents of this seized material \u2013 an undertaking that did not persuade the international court of justice. The court, instead, preferred to make binding orders to ensure that Australia did not use the material to disadvantage Timor Leste. There were 16 judges on the ICJ panel and with the exception of one of them, they agreed with the findings and orders. The dissenting voice was the former Australian jurist Ian Callinan, a Howard-era \u201cCapital C\u201d conservative appointed to the High Court in 1989. In his amicus curiae submission, Ernst Willheim said those undertakings to the ICJ left open the prospect that the ACT supreme court also might not be satisfied by assurances made by the attorney general about national security. Here is a case where we find national security is being played as a card to bully citizens, cast them in the role of \u201cterrorists\u201d and cover-up the wrongdoing of a previous Coalition government, of which the current attorney general is in a direct line of succession. In June 2018, Porter was anxious to emphasise that what he called \u201cthe judicial process\u201d should, in the interests of \u201cfairness\u201d, be conducted without commentary. Can a secret trial, where evidence is suppressed, be a fair trial? It could be that the moment justice Mossop rules that slabs of the proceedings be closed, then the accused would be off to the High Court seeking a ruling that secrecy is an abnegation of fairness. The attorney general wanted speed and silence; instead, he will get a case that has the potential to run on and on, accompanied by mounting public disgust.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re starting to find a strange new rhythm. For those of us still working, it might be a day at the desk, a walk and a family meal. There are children to supervise or entertain, calls to check on loved ones, some virtual socialising, streaming, reading and an occasional trip to the supermarket with a carefully drawn list, after calculating how best to avoid crowds. The one thing we can\u2019t do is plan. Work diaries, usually blocked out with colour-coded meetings and commitments, are bare. There\u2019s no need to consult the family calendars pinned to the fridge either, because no one is going to those birthday parties or school dates or weekends away. Having spent years downloading mindfulness apps as an antidote to our busyness, we\u2019re all trying to live in the present because the future feels even scarier than this strange closed-in life. The possibility that it could last six months or more doesn\u2019t bear too much consideration. There\u2019s plenty to worry about, of course, but without detailed, personal calculations about tomorrow, next week or next school holidays running through our heads, it really is easier to pay full attention to sunlit leaves or birdsong or cooking smells. It\u2019s unsettling, to be drifting like this, untethered from the future, but for many of us it\u2019s bearable, for now. But as \u201cthe curve\u201d flattens and fears of replicating the horror scenarios that are playing out internationally subside, we are realising that our future plans are contingent on the Big Plan, a national \u201cexit strategy\u201d that will require diabolical decisions trading off public health, social cohesion and economic disaster. And we all do need to think about that. Restrictions will continue to be necessary until a vaccine is found, but they might be dialled up or down depending on infection rates, according to a study in the Lancet, based on the experience of China. Considering this option is not accepting the stupidly brutal advocacy of an immediate end to lockdowns in the service of free market ideology, nor the horrifying social Darwinist argument that a rapid lifting of restrictions would still see the fittest survive. It\u2019s based on an assessment that we might not be able to live like this, or be able to afford to live like this, for the year to 18 months, or even longer, that it might take for a vaccine to be developed. Governments have started to talk about the trade-offs involved in various exit plan options. Understandably, they are approaching the topic tentatively, because most of us will stay housebound for months, and because of the serious potential consequences of even a small relaxation of the rules. The national cabinet has asked health experts for advice, and Australia-specific modelling. But these are not judgments that can be made solely on the basis of economic calculations or epidemiological forecasting. They are moral and ethical questions that require not just our heads but also our hearts. As Ben Doherty wrote for Guardian Australia this week there\u2019s no room for complacency in these calculations, as overseas experience shows, lifting restrictions carries a real risk of another infection wave. \u201cSingapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison \u2026 has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections \u2013 a 60% jump in new daily infections \u2013 and has announced a further tightening of restrictions \u2026 Japan, similarly, having kept infections low for two months, has now declared a month-long state of emergency in response to a jump in new cases,\u201d he wrote. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has started flagging the idea of trials: some states cautiously easing restrictions earlier than others, standing vigilant to reapply them if the virus spread gets out of hand. \u201cYou will have some jurisdictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move when others are not, then we will learn from the experience of those states that may have trialled things,\u201d he said this week The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, promised her state\u2019s restrictions would be reviewed regularly, but she was clearer about the trade-off; \u201cevery time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die\u201d. All around the world attention is turning to these exit plan options, and the fraught questions they raise. Exactly how do we calibrate the inevitable increase in infection rate with health system capacity and how do we avoid a devastating second and third wave of disease? What preparations need to be made so we have the capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts? How many test kits and ICU beds do we need? What levels of surveillance, and what sacrifices of privacy could be involved in test-and-trace? These are high-stakes decisions for us all, and as epidemiologist Tony Blakely argued this week they need to be made with public understanding and consent. \u201cI am strongly advocating that Australia uses the next few weeks to deliberate on what we do next. That means pulling back from the (necessary till now) unchecked executive authority of government, and re-instituting parliamentary oversight \u2026 We need to also hear from a wide range of experts to help us deliberate. Philosophers, ethicists, economists, public health experts and epidemiologists \u2013 to name just a few,\u201d he wrote in the Nine newspapers. \u201cAt the end of this deliberation process, it will necessarily return to the politicians to \u2018make the call\u2019. But they need some sense of societal consent.\u201d It\u2019s too late for parliamentary oversight. Parliament stands adjourned until August, apart from the committee scrutinising the new coronavirus laws. But it is not too late for the national conversation, with all the relevant modelling and information made publicly available. Getting this plan right is a path to one day resuming our individual plans, to reclaiming a future. But it has consequences that demand compassion and deep consideration.",

      "bodyText": "Not-for-profit aged care providers say corporate suppliers of personal protective equipment are gouging them on prices, in one case doubling the cost of masks and gowns. The aged care sector, like many healthcare services, has struggled to access PPE due to global shortages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The federal government has made it a clear priority to get government-held PPE reserves to residential aged care facilities where confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been recorded, given the vulnerability of older Australians. Other providers, where an outbreak has not yet been recorded, are being warned of significant delays in accessing the government stockpile. Now, aged care providers are also reporting price-gouging by their normal commercial suppliers. Aged and Community Services Australia (ACSA), the peak body for not-for-profit aged care providers, says it is aware of corporate suppliers making significant \u201cprice hikes\u201d on PPE. In one case, a supplier had more than doubled the cost of a box of masks from $9.60 to $22.50, and hiked the price of a box of gowns from $90 to $175, ACSA said. \u201cAt a time when we need to ensure the safety and wellness of the vulnerable older people we care for, and the staff who are caring for them, we find price-gouging for essential products unacceptable,\u201d ACSA chief executive Patricia Sparrow said. The federal government has been attempting to boost stocks of PPE in Australia by procuring more from abroad, ramping up domestic production at existing supplier Med-Con, and releasing additional supplies from the national medical stockpile. A wide range of businesses are also pivoting into PPE production, including 3D printers, distilleries, and food packaging companies. Health minister Greg Hunt this week announced 11m new masks would be allocated to health workers, including 1.7m for aged care workers. Masks were particularly urgent for parts of the aged care sector that had experienced an outbreak, Hunt said. Initial difficulties in PPE access for the sector were addressed by giving providers a direct line to the federal health department to request supplies from the national medical stockpile. Within two weeks of that direct line opening, 80 aged care providers that either had confirmed Covid-19 cases or were facing \u201csevere risk\u201d to their ability to function asked for access to supplies from the emergency stockpile. The Council on the Ageing (Cota) has reported that those receiving home care have been turning away support workers due to Covid-19-related fears. Cota Australia chief executive Ian Yates said carers were being turned away even in circumstances where they didn\u2019t need to be wearing PPE. Yates said the consequences of not receiving care were serious in many cases. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t over-exaggerate it, but it\u2019s not uncommon, because there\u2019s so much fear,\u201d he told the Guardian last week. The federal government has since issued guidelines on when home care workers need to wear PPE.",

Immunity certificates could create a two-tiered society of those with antibodies and a measure of immunity who are allowed out, and those without who must remain isolated.</p> <p>They could also create a perverse incentive to catch the virus, particularly among demographics for whom the illness is likely \u2013 though not certain \u2013 to be mild.

      "bodyText": "It is a fundamental problem in fighting a war against an invisible enemy, one that hides among us. When is the battle over? We know that we are not there yet. That end is months, not weeks away. We know we have not yet reached the \u201cpeak\u201d but that it is coming. Like an invisible wave, we won\u2019t see it when it arrives, we will see only its effects. We have watched it wash over other countries: the grimly climbing toll reported daily, even hourly; the overwhelmed intensive care wards; the shuttered businesses and closed school gates; the empty streets and full mortuaries. \u201cThis health crisis and economic crisis is a battle on two fronts,\u201d the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has warned, \u201cand it is going to be waged in an unimaginable and unprecedented way over the next at least six months and potentially beyond that.\u201d But it is a balancing act for governments. Weighing lives against livelihoods, the financial imperative to restart shattered economies against the medical necessity to stay home and save lives. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has promised her state\u2019s restrictions on work, gathering and movement would be assessed regularly, and flagged they could start to be eased as soon as next month. But it came with this blunt caveat: \u201cEvery time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die.\u201d All over the world there is far to go, but restrictions are easing in China, where this Covid-19 outbreak began, and elsewhere planning is under way for a world beyond the pandemic. There will be \u2013 and have been already \u2013 massive economic, societal, environmental and ideological changes wrought by the virus. But right now, the medical questions remain fundamental: when do we know Covid-19 is sufficiently suppressed, how should the restrictions and the lockdowns be eased, and what does a post-Covid world look like? The risk of relaxing too early There is danger in complacency. Singapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison, the exemplar of how best to suppress the Covid-19 pandemic, has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections \u2013 a 60% jump in new daily infections \u2013 and has announced a further tightening of restrictions. It will now close all schools and most workplaces \u2013 only essential services such as supermarkets and banks will stay open \u2013 for a full month. It has instituted jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, and banned visitors and transits through the country. Comparisons between countries are always flawed, too great are the differences in size, development, governance and demographics. Singapore, an island city-state ruled by a single party since independence, with a high-quality public health system and a population broadly adherent to government diktat, was always inherently advantaged. Japan, similarly, having kept infections low for two months, has now declared a month-long state of emergency in response to a jump in new cases. But the risk of lifting restrictions too early and unleashing a devastating \u201csecond wave\u201d applies to countries all over the world, and the international community itself. \u201cIf Australia comes out of our isolation too early, we risk an even bigger peak,\u201d Associate Prof Ian Mackay from the University of Queensland told the Guardian this week. \u201cThis could take six months or more. We cannot lose focus. It\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s very tough for a lot of people, there is real pain and economic hardship in the community. But we have to stick it out, because if we relax too soon, and allow the virus to re-emerge and spread widely, all the pain we have suffered will have been for nothing.\u201d There is historical precedent in Australia too. In the immediate aftermath of world war one, Australia was spared the very worst of the Spanish flu outbreak, aided by geography and the delay the steam-ship age afforded a distant continent to implement a strict quarantine regime. But when the flu did break in Australia, it killed an estimated 17,000 people, and it did so in three waves, the first in February, the second in April. The third wave, in July, was by far the most deadly. \u2018What\u2019, not \u2018when\u2019 There is an argument that asking \u201cwhen\u201d the restrictions will be lifted is the wrong question. The question that needs to be asked is \u201cwhat?\u201d. What needs to be in place, what needs to have been achieved, before restrictions can be lifted? Scott Gottlieb, a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, co-authored a paper with the American Enterprise Institute, proposing a four-phase \u201croad map to re-opening\u201d. The first phase \u2013 in which Australia firmly remains \u2013 is to suppress the spread of the virus as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, to stop the \u201ccurve\u201d from rising to an unmanageable peak that overwhelms public health systems. If there are more critically ill people than there are hospital beds, people who could have been saved will die. This suppression involves physical distancing measures, banning gatherings, closing public spaces and potentially schools, having people work from home, and limiting all travel. In the second phase, individual states, or even cities, would be able to gradually ease certain restrictions, but only when they have built up their capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts. The third phase would allow for remaining restrictions to be lifted when a vaccine is developed, an effective therapy is widely available, or when testing data shows widespread immunity. But there is a fourth stage too. When this pandemic is over \u2013 and it will end \u2013 governments must learn its lessons, and invest heavily in medical research and public health systems. They must prepare for the next one. A phased recovery Dr Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales\u2019s Kirby Institute, has argued for Australia to impose a \u201cshort, sharp lockdown \u2026 followed by a phased lifting of restrictions\u201d. \u201cA short, sharp lockdown of four to eight weeks will improve control of the epidemic in Australia, reduce case numbers more rapidly and bring us to a more manageable baseline from which phased lifting of restrictions and economic recovery can occur. If we fail to do this, we face continued epidemic growth, potential failure of the health system, and a far longer road to recovery.\u201d Michael J Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies program, told policymakers each country needs to determine an individual \u201ccalibrated, step-wise approach\u201d to easing restrictions on movement, travel and work. He said countries need to have come off the \u201cpeak\u201d of infections and have capacity in their healthcare systems \u2013 spare beds in hospitals \u2013 as well as good data on infections, and a low positivity rate, which is the proportion of all samples tested that return positive. \u201cYou\u2019ll see in somewhere like [South] Korea, they\u2019re testing, and 2% to 6% of their samples are positive. Last week in New York 37% of tested samples were positive. So you need to carefully look at what proportion of people that are tested are positive.\u201d But Ryan stressed that \u201cthere are no absolutes here, there are no answers\u201d. A phased lifting of restrictions appears to be Australia\u2019s likely strategy \u2013 \u201csteps and stages that we can test and reverse\u201d, the health minister, Greg Hunt, says. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, led by the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, is working on an \u2018exit strategy\u2019 to be presented to government. But Morrison has already forecast a staggered recovery \u2013 a gradual easing of particular restrictions, in certain places, always with the caveat that they may need to be re-imposed if infections again start to rise. \u201cYou will have some jurisdictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move when others are not, then we will learn from the experience of those states that may have trialled things.\u201d Tasmania, with fewer cases, and the geographic advantage of being a small island with firmly established biosecurity laws, may be able to move sooner than other states. Those areas hardest hit by Covid-19 cases \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and south-east Queensland \u2013 are likely to be the last to be able to move. South Australia, with a relatively low number of infections, few hospitalisations, and the highest per capita testing rate in the country, could also be an early mover. Prof Lyn Gilbert, the chair of the Infection Prevention and Control Expert Advisory Group that reports to the nation\u2019s chief health officers, has warned restrictions could wax and wane with the rate of infections. \u201cEveryone wants to know when it will end, and I know the politicians are desperate to be able to say when it will end, but I think we\u2019ve got to be cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the only way to do it properly is to watch what\u2019s happening and calibrate the response according to what\u2019s happening. And if restrictions were lifted, at least partly, and the numbers started to go up again, they\u2019d probably have to be reimposed.\u201d Governments across the country are bracing their populations for a \u201cmarathon not a sprint\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when this is going to end,\u201d the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said this week. \u201cIt is not going to be over in weeks, it is going to be months and months.\u201d There is shrewd political positioning that overlays the medical advice informing this position: better to tell a population to prepare for six months of pain and proscription, and be able to lift it early, than to promise a rapid solution and find yourself apologising, and explaining why it must be extended again. And Morrison has repeatedly stressed there is no plan yet to ease restrictions anywhere. \u201cThere is no map for this. We are in uncharted territory.\u201d The Chinese experience Wuhan, the original centre of the virus, has begun to lift the restrictions on movement after 76 days of near-total lockdown. Movement is now allowed out of the city to the wider Hubei province and beyond. At its peak, Wuhan\u2019s lockdown was extreme: images of doors being welded shut to lock people in their homes shocked the world. Authoritarian regimes are less concerned about curtailing their citizens\u2019 civil liberties and human rights. Liberal democracies find such measures harder to implement: their populations will not tolerate such extreme impositions. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go and cut and paste measures from other places, which have completely different societies. I mean, in China they were welding people\u2019s doors shut,\u201d Morrison told reporters bluntly. \u201cThat might be OK with them, but \u2026 we have different ways of doing things in Australia.\u201d China has been condemned, queried and praised for its response to Covid-19: lauded for its swift and effective lockdown measures; questioned over the veracity of its infection reporting and suppression of information; and excoriated for its failure to adequately warn the world in the initial stages of outbreak and silencing doctors who tried to raise the alarm. But, even as restrictions ease across the world\u2019s most populous nation, freedom there post-Covid is scarcely unrestrained. China\u2019s Health Code app has been downloaded by 700 million people. It is mandatory in some Covid-19-affected areas, such as Wuhan, for even the most fundamental freedoms \u2013 to enter a supermarket, catch a taxi, ride the subway or see a doctor. Users must first fill in their personal details, including their national ID number, where they live and whether they have been in contact with confirmed cases of the virus. The app then gives them a colour-coded rating: green means they are free to travel; yellow mandates seven days quarantine, and red requires 14 days. The app also quietly collects \u2013 and shares with police \u2013 a user\u2019s location and travel data. The \u201cfreedom\u201d provided by this technological development has not been universally welcomed. \u201cI thought the days when humans are ruled by machines and algorithms won\u2019t happen for at least another 50 years, one blogger on Zhihu wrote. \u201cThis coronavirus epidemic has suddenly brought it on early.\u201d Human Rights Watch described the Health Code app as \u201cautomated tyranny\u201d. Digital contact tracing Singapore has also used technology to surveil its citizens, pulling together a database of personal details to allow health authorities to track potential Covid-19 carriers. The TraceTogether app sends bluetooth signals to other users, and sends messages to phones warning that a person may have come into contact with a known or suspected case. South Korea\u2019s mass testing regime and radical transparency have suppressed Covid-19 infections, but at the price of civil liberties. Granular details of new infections and their whereabouts are routinely made public, leading to doxxing of suspected cases \u2013 even speculation of alleged illicit affairs \u2013 and leading the country\u2019s National Human Rights Commission to warn that people infected by the coronavirus face a potential second trauma of harassment, ridicule and social stigma. Israel, Taiwan and Iran have also used mobile phone data to trace potential Covid-19 contacts and monitor its citizens\u2019 movements. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has called for a pan-European mobile app to track the spread of Covid-19 instead of the current miscellany of apps used across the EU that risk breaching people\u2019s privacy. Immunity certificates In Britain, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the UK would consider \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d for its population \u2013 medical recognition that a person has had Covid-19 and recovered, and can\u2019t catch it again or spread it. Determined through a serology test for coronavirus antibodies in an individual\u2019s blood, an immunity certificate would authorise a person to return to work and re-enter the community. \u201cWe are looking at an immunity certificate,\u201d Hancock said, \u201chow people who have had the disease, have got the antibodies and therefore have immunity can ... get back as much as possible to normal life.\u201d In Germany too, one of the first countries in Europe to begin to ease restrictions, researchers are preparing a large-scale study into immunity to Covid-19, with a hope it could allow authorities to issue passes to exempt workers from restrictive lockdown measures. Such a certificate could be particularly effective in getting healthcare workers \u2013 disproportionately affected by the virus \u2013 back to work more quickly when they are no longer sick, and no longer at risk of spreading the virus. Denmark has also flagged lifting some of its restrictions, forecasting \u201ca gradual and controlled opening of society starting mid-April\u201d. Part of Denmark\u2019s plan is to offer widespread testing, not only for the virus, but also for antibodies \u2013 to determine who has immunity, and how widespread immunity is across the community. There are questions, however, over the reliability of serology testing, and whether the presence of antibodies provides long-term immunity. And there are potential risks. Immunity certificates could create a two-tiered society of those with antibodies and a measure of immunity who are allowed out, and those without who must remain isolated. They could also create a perverse incentive to catch the virus, particularly among demographics for whom the illness is likely \u2013 though not certain \u2013 to be mild. The certificates, too, have the potential to act as a reward to people who have not adhered to physical distancing and who have developed immunity but at the risk to others\u2019 health. We are not alone In the chaos of the coronavirus, the nation-state has reasserted its dominance in the global order. Country is king. The virus has spread quickly because of the modern world\u2019s breath-taking interconnectivity. But the reaction to this rapid global spread has been its antithesis: national governments and their people have turned inwards, closed borders, told foreign nationals to leave, and relied on national leaders and institutions for guidance through the crisis. Countries have formulated and run their responses on strictly national lines. Each country\u2019s \u201ccurve\u201d is compared with others as to whose measures are best (despite the inherent flaws in such comparisons). The national fight is all that most people have the energy for, the looming global calamity is almost beyond contemplation. But the international pandemic must be Australia\u2019s, must be every country\u2019s, concern. Covid-19 is no respecter of national borders. Its virulent spread across the world is evidence that the problem is a global one, and so its solutions must be too. It can only be defeated collectively. \u201cFortress Australia\u201d might work temporarily \u2013 and Australia has the inherent advantage of being a large island nation-state with borders it can lock down \u2013 but it is not sustainable for a country so dependent upon exports and imports, and a people who travel. Other countries, many in Australia\u2019s region, face a far more challenging battle than Australia does. The virus carries the potential of immense suffering. Many nations in the Asia-Pacific are densely populated, with developing economies and healthcare systems ill-prepared for the Covid-19 wave to wash over them. The physical distancing enforced by countries around the world, in reality, is a privilege of the rich. Developing nations face the far grimmer choices in choosing to lock its populations down to keep them alive or allowing them to work in order to survive. Hundreds of millions of daily wage labourers in India \u2013 a country under total lockdown \u2013 don\u2019t eat if they don\u2019t work. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has warned his country cannot enact the distancing measures it needs to without people starving. There are other challenges too. Indonesia, late to the fight against Covid-19, now finds itself battling the virus blind, because it doesn\u2019t have adequate testing. And Pacific nations are braced for the potential devastation of a virus sweeping through small close-knit communities, isolated from tertiary health care. Vanuatu, already on high alert for a Covid-19 outbreak, bore the brunt of yet another category 5 cyclone this week, a reminder that climate-influenced catastrophes remain ever-present in Australia\u2019s region. Humanity\u2019s other grave challenges have not been eradicated, only momentarily obscured, by the Covid-19 crisis. Even if Australia succeeds in bending its Covid-19 infection curve to its will \u2013 which is at this point unusual for an Anglophone country \u2013 there will be more to do internationally before restrictions such as travel bans can be lifted. Australia\u2019s success in defeating Covid-19 will depend on its willingness to help other countries less able to defeat it too. You can never be safe from a virus if you are surrounded by it.",

Leave those ones right alone. There are<a href=\"https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/animals/worms/australian-earthworms/\"> 6,000 known species of earthworms</a> categorised in 20 families and not all of them are keen to eat your kitchen scraps. The most efficient worms available in Australia for composting are red worms, tiger worms and blue worms. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>You don\u2019t need a fancy worm bin.</strong> A bucket with a spout that allows a bit of air flow is absolutely fine if you are composting indoors. Use any receptacle that you can drain, that doesn\u2019t conduct too much heat. There are so many vermicomposting systems available, but I have found worm farming success is less about the container and more about the balance of contents you put into it. On our farm, old bath tubs propped up on some bricks are ideal as they come already complete with a drain hole. Whatever you choose make sure you can cover it up with a lid, wood plank or fine netted material. This helps by keeping out the fruit flies and undesirable pests and rodents. Another great system I use in our home garden is cutting out the bottom of a garbage bin and burying that straight into the ground with the lid intact. You can then fill the bottom with some bought worms, or wait for the earthworms already in your garden to come hither and then start composting straight away.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Don\u2019t overfeed your worms! </strong>When you\u2019re first starting out, it\u2019s easy to overwhelm your worms with too much food. Don\u2019t get excited and start overfeeding them just to see what they can handle. You will likely be starting with 1,000 worms, which sounds like a lot but is actually only a large handful. They will multiply over time, but that doesn\u2019t happen immediately, and you\u2019ll end up with a smelly bin. Worms while efficient don\u2019t work that fast, and you can help them by chopping up the food contents into smaller pieces.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Break down your scraps by using a bokashi composting system first </strong>and then add the \u201ccured\u2019 scraps to your worm bin. This will help the worms break the compost down even more efficiently so you can add the vermicompost to your garden faster. Also, the bokashi will have somewhat neutralised the odour.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>No large bones and no citrus directly into the worm bin. </strong>Break down the citrus first in your bokashi or avoid putting it in altogether.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Acidity is the enemy of a healthy worm composting system. </strong>If you find that you have an uncontrollable amount of fruit fly larvae in your bin, add a sprinkling of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatomaceous_earth\">diatomaceous earth</a>, not lime. In my experience the wrong kind of lime will kill invertebrates and upset the PH balance of the environment. So make sure you have a good balance of carbon to nitrogen. I find a little more carbon than nitrogen is the key. You can tell if you\u2019ve got the right mix by eyeballing your bin contents \u2013 there should be a good ratio of carbon such as newspaper, empty loo rolls, egg cartons and leaf litter to nitrogen rich organic food matter, egg shells and dog poo.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>If you find that the bin starts to smell, add shredded newspaper and even torn-up egg cartons</strong>. Do that too if you are going away and cannot feed the worms for an extended period.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Water your worms.</strong> They need a moist environment. A layer of wet newspaper over the contents also helps regulate the moisture. Use the dripping from your watering in your garden. Do not throw it out! <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>You know when vermicompost is ready when it looks like soil and is neutral in odour. </strong>It should be a lovely dark colour and not soggy. It will hold a ball shape when you throw it into the air and be friable (easily crumbled). This is an indication that it contains water soluble nutrients and microbes. If you\u2019ve got a large bin or bathtub, move the vermicompost to one side, then start another pile of food on the opposite end of the container. The worms will naturally migrate there. In a bin, once you have a rich vermicompost and the food looks completely digested, stop adding more food for a couple of days. You can sieve the worms out to separate them from the vermicompost and then start another lot. If you have too many worms, split the lot into another bin or gift them to someone \u2013 like a sourdough starter!<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Vermicast is an incredibly rich fertiliser.</strong> Besides the set-up cost of buying some worms, if you care for it a worm farm is essentially free continuous fertiliser, and a way to transform your garbage into food.</p></li> </ul> <p>I admire <a href=\"https://www.hungrybin.co.nz/customers/councils/\">Auckland council</a> and City of Melbourne council for implementing a New Zealand invention \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hungrybin.co.nz/\">Hungry Bins</a>\u201d in their city centres and around public buildings like the<a href=\"https://qvm.com.au/sustainability/recycling-program/\"> Queen Victoria market</a>, embracing worm composting on a public scale.</p> <p>My wish is that more city councils around the world replicate this as a way to deal with our organic waste. In doing so it might help city children, like my little ignorant past self, come to see worms not as disgusting but as magical creatures that play a tremendous role in our environment.</p>",

If you find that the bin starts to smell, add shredded newspaper and even torn-up egg cartons. Do that too if you are going away and cannot feed the worms for an extended period. Water your worms. They need a moist environment. A layer of wet newspaper over the contents also helps regulate the moisture. Use the dripping from your watering in your garden. Do not throw it out! You know when vermicompost is ready when it looks like soil and is neutral in odour. It should be a lovely dark colour and not soggy. It will hold a ball shape when you throw it into the air and be friable (easily crumbled). This is an indication that it contains water soluble nutrients and microbes. If you\u2019ve got a large bin or bathtub, move the vermicompost to one side, then start another pile of food on the opposite end of the container. The worms will naturally migrate there. In a bin, once you have a rich vermicompost and the food looks completely digested, stop adding more food for a couple of days. You can sieve the worms out to separate them from the vermicompost and then start another lot. If you have too many worms, split the lot into another bin or gift them to someone \u2013 like a sourdough starter! Vermicast is an incredibly rich fertiliser. Besides the set-up cost of buying some worms, if you care for it a worm farm is essentially free continuous fertiliser, and a way to transform your garbage into food. I admire Auckland council and City of Melbourne council for implementing a New Zealand invention \u201cHungry Bins\u201d in their city centres and around public buildings like the Queen Victoria market, embracing worm composting on a public scale. My wish is that more city councils around the world replicate this as a way to deal with our organic waste. In doing so it might help city children, like my little ignorant past self, come to see worms not as disgusting but as magical creatures that play a tremendous role in our environment.",

      "bodyText": "When Erienne Lette wrote to her real estate agents asking for her rent to be reduced, she wasn\u2019t expecting what came back. After her income was reduced by 35% until at least 30 June, Lette hoped she might be able to pay less than $360 a week for her studio apartment in Camperdown, in Sydney\u2019s inner west. Instead, she was warned that only a deferral of the rent, not a reduction would be considered at all. And she was also asked to fill out a form asking, among other things, whether she planned to dip into her superannuation. Lette provided proof of her reduced income and reiterated that she needed the rent reduced to make ends meet. She received a one line response from the agent: \u201cBut very much able to meet the weekly rent.\u201d \u201cThe power that they have, and the lack of power that we have, is really apparent right now,\u201d Lette tells the Guardian. Lette, 27, is among millions of renters in Australia who have seen their incomes decimated by the coronavirus pandemic. Like all of us, they are stuck in their homes \u2013 but even that is no longer set in stone. Despite the prime minister\u2019s declaration on 29 March that national cabinet had agreed to a six-month moratorium on evictions, only Tasmania has passed legislation to enact these protections. It means that tenants in the private market who are unable to afford their rent are, according to tenants groups at least, at the mercy of individual landlords. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has urged landlords \u2013 and by implication the property managers who represent them \u2013 to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. Yet not all appear to be doing so. Asic last week warned agents they face up to five years jail if they ask tenants to withdraw super in order to pay the rent. Tenants Victoria\u2019s advice line, now an email service during the Covid-19 crisis, is receiving dozens of messages a day from renters worried about losing their home. Among the record of complaints, seen by the Guardian, is correspondence from a single mother who said she was threatened with eviction after losing her job. \u201cInitially they demanded full rent regardless and threatened eviction,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the eviction moratorium in place they are now offering a $10 per week rent reduction for six months. This is not sustainable especially given how difficult it is to access Centrelink at this time. I have no savings, no family, no support.\u201d A separate letter to a tenant from an agent in Melbourne\u2019s north states: \u201cDo not ask for a rent reduction or a rent freeze as we will not put these requests forward. Saving for that rainy day? You may need to dip into any savings you have.\u201d Another, to a tenant who is in rental arrears, provided some unsolicited budgeting advice: \u201cI hope that you are also doing your part in cancelling unnecessary subscriptions such as Spotify, Foxtel or Netflix or any other service that is not considered necessary at this time.\u201d The industry has condemned unusual and heavy-handed tactics, including the references to superannuation that drew Asic\u2019s attention, and has broadly warned against tarring all property managers with the same brush. But it is clear the lack of legislative certainty is having an impact. In a letter to landlords, obtained by Guardian Australia, one real estate agent, Andrew Pennisi, said they should give struggling tenants \u201ca rent rebate or food shopping voucher\u201d instead of a rent discount or forgiving rent payments. Pennisi said that \u201cgiving a discount or forgiving rent payments will void your landlord insurance\u201d. Insurance sources say this is incorrect. Pennisi told Guardian Australia agents are \u201crunning without any real guidance from government, except keep tenants in place\u201d. \u201cWe are looking forward to some guidance,\u201d he says. If the real estate industry and tenants groups agree on one thing, it is that the lack of action at national cabinet on residential tenancies has been damaging. Last month, Morrison had insisted \u201cthere is a lot of work being done together to try and get a consistent approach when it comes to residential tenancies\u201d. The states and territories had worked towards a plan of incentivising landlords to offer rent reductions by offering them cuts or waivers of land tax. But progress stalled, as states differed on the extent to which landlords should wear the losses from rent reductions, the duration of land tax reductions and practical difficulties for states where land tax is levied predominantly by local councils. The announcement of the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy program helped take the heat out of demands for support. This week, the national cabinet agreed to a mandatory code of conduct to negotiate commercial rent reductions but gave up on achieving national consistency on residential rents. Morrison declared residential tenancies were now a matter for each state and territory, and there would be no baseline beyond the moratorium on evictions. Only the ACT has announced its own scheme to offer rent reductions of up to $200 a week, funded through land tax reductions for landlords. States now say announcements will be made in due course \u2013 leaving open the prospect renters in some parts of the country will get shorter three-month rent reductions. The Real Estate Institute of NSW says the absence of clear advice from governments, aside from the need to \u201cwork it out between themselves\u201d, has led tenants to believe they do not need to pay their rent. Leanne Pilkington, the REINSW\u2019s president, acknowledges that there are tenants \u201cfor whom rent relief will be necessary, should they lose their jobs or have their work scaled back\u201d. \u201cEqually, there are landlords, typically mum-and-dad investors, who depend on the rental income to repay loans or fund their living expenses in retirement,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe plan of transferring the financial burden being experienced by the tenant to the landlord is utterly unjust.\u201d Dr Heather Holst, Victoria\u2019s residential tenancies commissioner, says the states need to implement a retrospective evictions moratorium as soon a possible. \u201cThere is a bit of a wait and see attitude, which is very hard for tenants who know that they are spending every last cent of their savings and just wondering if they are going to be able to stay or not,\u201d she told the Guardian. Holst notes, too, that the boosted welfare payments and the jobkeeper wage subsidy do not begin until late April and May respectively. \u201cThe financial clock is ticking,\u201d Holst says. \u201cSomething needs to be done very quickly.\u201d Holst acknowledges that the lack of policy certainty has also created confusion for landlords, who are also facing the prospect of a battle with their insurer. Landlords would like to claim unpaid rent under their insurance, but cannot because the insurance policies require landlords to issue an eviction notice before they can be compensated for lost rent. Nor are landlords covered for any reduction in rent they agree with tenants. \u201cObviously that\u2019s just not going to work in the current circumstances,\u201d Holst says. The real estate and insurance industries are at war over who will bear the cost of unpaid rent, which industry sources estimate could top $10bn. Insurance companies fear the states and territories might change the law to allow landlords to claim without issuing an eviction notice. \u201cThe state governments are designing the schemes and are really surprised insurers won\u2019t come to the party,\u201d an industry source says. \u201cWhy should insurers bend over?\u201d One large Victorian real estate agency, Nelson Alexander, has asked tenants to lobby their local MP to change the law to allow claims for unpaid rent without issuing an eviction notice. As the stoush escalated on Thursday, EBM Rentcover, which insures about 160,000 properties, announced it would not be taking on any new business, including from existing customers, after next Tuesday and blamed \u201ca lack information and guidance from the federal government\u201d. Some insurers are considering quitting the Australian market entirely, an industry source says. An Insurance Council of Australia spokesman says the industry supports measures to assist landlords and tenants \u201cnegotiate outcomes that help them through Covid-19\u201d. People like Lette are caught in the crossfire. Back at her studio apartment in Camperdown, she considers herself lucky to still have a job at all. Lette is also realistic. She says that if her rent is not reduced, she will be forced to consider her options. Holst, the tenancies commissioner, argues that governments should ensure that a tenant\u2019s debt from rent deferrals does not exceed their bond. \u201cOtherwise all we\u2019re doing there is deferring eviction,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople will know if they\u2019re racking up debts that there\u2019s got to be a day of reckoning too.\u201d When she spoke to the Guardian, Lette was yet to hear back from her agent. But she\u2019s cognisant of the reckoning. \u201cIn terms of wage loss, we\u2019re not going to be back paid for that,\u201d she says. \u201cHow are we expected to back pay rent that we couldn\u2019t afford then? It\u2019s only going to become rent we can\u2019t afford in the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Could the November election be delayed due to coronavirus?</h2> <p>The presidential vote is due to take place on 3 November. The date is set by federal law and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded recently.</p> <h2>Is Joe Biden the Democratic presidential nominee?</h2> <p>This week, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">suspended his campaign for president</a>, saying he couldn\u2019t see a path to the nomination. Sanders, who reshaped American politics with his youth-led movement for sweeping social change, was Biden\u2019s last rival in the field, which leaves the former vice-president, under Barack Obama, as the de facto Democratic candidate to challenge Trump.</p> <h2>Will Democratic primary elections still take place?</h2> <p>Despite the pandemic and the fact that the Democrats already have a de facto nominee, many states have not had their chance to cast their ballots. This week, despite widespread criticism and some late efforts by the governor to stop it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">Wisconsin still held in-person voting</a> in its primary, but most other states yet to vote have delayed theirs until June.</p> <h2>Why is Sanders staying on the Democratic primary ballot?</h2> <p>When Sanders suspended his campaign this week, he made it clear that <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9540304/joe-biden-wins-bernie-sanders-women-voters\">he viewed Biden</a> as the party\u2019s de facto nominee. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Biden is automatically the official Democratic candidate \u2013 he still <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/democratic-primary-dnc-superdelegates.html\">has to receive the party\u2019s nomination</a>, which happens at the Democratic national convention (now delayed from July to August). If Biden secures 1,991 pledged delegates at the DNC, which now seems likely, he will be the official nominee. Sanders has said he will stay on the ballot in states that are yet to hold their primaries, to continue to exert the influence of his leftist movement on the 2020 Democratic policy platform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">Trump's poll numbers dip over handling of coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How will the conventions work?</h2> <p>The Democratic national convention, where Biden, 77, is expected to be officially nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, was due to be held in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which, like most other US cities, is grappling with coronavirus. It has been delayed to August, a week before the Republican national convention, when Trump, then 74 years old, will be officially named his party\u2019s nominee after facing no serious challengers.</p> <h2>Will campaigning continue?</h2> <p>Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/01/coronavirus-latest-news/\">death toll from the virus expected to</a> be in the tens of thousands. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/politics/1918-flu-pandemic-elections.html\">midterm elections in 1918</a> even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, the president controversially uses the daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings to push his own political agenda, and Biden has been campaigning from home in Delaware, hoping to use a new digital strategy that includes a podcast to reach voters.</p> <h2>Could the election be carried out by vote-by-mail?</h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott</a>, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, recently told the Guardian. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable.

      "bodyText": "Could the November election be delayed due to coronavirus? The presidential vote is due to take place on 3 November. The date is set by federal law and Donald Trump has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded recently. Is Joe Biden the Democratic presidential nominee? This week, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders suspended his campaign for president, saying he couldn\u2019t see a path to the nomination. Sanders, who reshaped American politics with his youth-led movement for sweeping social change, was Biden\u2019s last rival in the field, which leaves the former vice-president, under Barack Obama, as the de facto Democratic candidate to challenge Trump. Will Democratic primary elections still take place? Despite the pandemic and the fact that the Democrats already have a de facto nominee, many states have not had their chance to cast their ballots. This week, despite widespread criticism and some late efforts by the governor to stop it, Wisconsin still held in-person voting in its primary, but most other states yet to vote have delayed theirs until June. Why is Sanders staying on the Democratic primary ballot? When Sanders suspended his campaign this week, he made it clear that he viewed Biden as the party\u2019s de facto nominee. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Biden is automatically the official Democratic candidate \u2013 he still has to receive the party\u2019s nomination, which happens at the Democratic national convention (now delayed from July to August). If Biden secures 1,991 pledged delegates at the DNC, which now seems likely, he will be the official nominee. Sanders has said he will stay on the ballot in states that are yet to hold their primaries, to continue to exert the influence of his leftist movement on the 2020 Democratic policy platform. How will the conventions work? The Democratic national convention, where Biden, 77, is expected to be officially nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, was due to be held in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which, like most other US cities, is grappling with coronavirus. It has been delayed to August, a week before the Republican national convention, when Trump, then 74 years old, will be officially named his party\u2019s nominee after facing no serious challengers. Will campaigning continue? Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US death toll from the virus expected to be in the tens of thousands. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held midterm elections in 1918 even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, the president controversially uses the daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings to push his own political agenda, and Biden has been campaigning from home in Delaware, hoping to use a new digital strategy that includes a podcast to reach voters. Could the election be carried out by vote-by-mail? \u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Monika McDermott, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, recently told the Guardian. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable. We don\u2019t even know if the election is going to happen as scheduled. There\u2019s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in-only election.\u201d If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. But 17 states require some kind of excuse for requesting an absentee ballot. Many would need to change their rules at huge cost to run a mail-only election. What happens if a candidate becomes incapacitated? If the president\u2019s cabinet and Congress agree the president is incapacitated, the 25th amendment to the US constitution states that the vice-president becomes acting president. No presidential candidate has ever died or become incapacitated between their nomination and the election. The procedures to replace a candidate are guided by federal and state laws and party regulations, but the situation would be unprecedented.",

Similarly the results of the entire sub-pyramid of the amateur game \u2013 hundreds of leagues, thousands of clubs \u2013 were not declared null and void and scrubbed from the record. In the wider world hundreds of thousands of coaches, teachers and volunteers did not stop working away at grassroots sport and the shared health of the nation. A combined two million people from the age of four upwards didn\u2019t fail to participate in cancelled parkruns. And beyond this an unquantifiable mass did not fail to take their first step into sport or to come back to some kind of a more active life. This, then, is the counterfactual history of sport March-April 2020, a month of urgent unhappenings and eventful nonevents. There will be quite a bit more of this to come from here. The important part, when it all starts up again, will be to remember which of those absences seemed to matter the most.",

The fines cost \u00a360 or \u00a330 if paid within 28 days.</p> \n  <p> \u201cWith the continued support and cooperation of our fellow citizens, Police Scotland will explain the legal instructions, encourage compliance and when necessary, enforce the law,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p> Policing of this would be \u201cfair, reasonable and proportionate,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cDo not make personal exemptions bespoke to your own circumstances.\u201d</p> \n  <p> Asked by the BBC if she was worried people were growing fatigued by the lockdown, Sturgeon said: \u201cOf course I worry about people tiring of this.

The Guardian established that the housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/robert-jenricks-messages-to-the-public-we-need-to-stay-at-home\">urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties</a> even if tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1248361222388494338\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THE GUARDIAN: Hundreds dying of virus in care homes not counted in official data <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomorrowsPapersToday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TomorrowsPapersToday</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DqOd2Gzl4x\">pic.twitter.com/DqOd2Gzl4x</a></p>\u2014 Neil Henderson (@hendopolis) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1248361222388494338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Jenrick <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertJenrick/status/1248341191738998787\">defended himself on Twitter</a> after a source close to him had earlier admitted that he had made the journey during lockdown conditions, but said he dropped off food and medication, and did not enter the house.

      "bodyText": "The UK experienced its deadliest day of the pandemic yet with a record 980 more deaths \u2013 exceeding that of Italy at its peak of 969 deaths on 27 March \u2013 and bringing the total number of deaths in hospital of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 to 8,958. The public has been told the country remains \u201cin a dangerous phase\u201d of the outbreak and has not yet reached its peak \u2013 so physical distancing this Easter bank holiday weekend remains crucial and people must stay at home. Boris Johnson is now \u201cable to do short walks\u201d as his condition during his coronavirus recovery \u201ccontinues to improve\u201d. The prime minister is back on a ward at St Thomas\u2019 hospital after being discharged from the intensive care unit. The health secretary Matt Hancock said that from next week every NHS hospital will receive a supply of PPE on a daily basis. Over the next three weeks, he said an online portal will be rolled out allowing primary care and social care to request PPE from a central inventory, so demand can be tracked and deliveries made according to need. Downing Street said it was \u201cconfident\u201d the housing secretary Robert Jenrick had complied with physical distancing rules after he came under fire for driving 40 miles to drop off food and medicine to his elderly parents. Nicola Sturgeon pledged a bailout for Scottish universities, a day after St Andrews revealed it had lost \u00a325m and faced its worst financial crisis in recent history. And in a difficult day for police forces, Cambridgeshire police caused a stir online after a now-deleted tweet appeared to suggest that officers were checking \u201cnon-essential aisles\u201d in a local supermarket, while South Yorkshire police apologised after a man was reprimanded for using his own front lawn. This came a day after comments by a chief constable from another force \u2013 in which suggested officers could search shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules \u2013 were deemed \u201cnot appropriate\u201d by Priti Patel, the home secretary. A huge thank you to everybody who got in touch today with a story and to all of you for reading along. That\u2019s it from us here on the UK side, but you can head over to our global live blog where our worldwide coverage of the coronavirus pandemic continues. The latest episode of Anywhere but Westminster went up today and it\u2019s an especially eye-opening one. John and John speak to families who are on the brink, grappling with the everyday experience of living in confinement, dealing with everything from autism to living in small houses and properties without outdoor space. You can watch the full episode here. The NHS coronavirus volunteer scheme is taking longer than expected to implement, according to officials. The extraordinary willingness of the British public to help out has been considered one of the few bright points of the crisis, but only a few thousand tasks are being carried out around the country so far. Neil Churchill, an NHS England administrator working on the volunteer team, posted on a Facebook group for volunteer helpers on Friday morning, explaining \u201cwhy it\u2019s taking time for you to get your first tasks\u201d. The official said there were \u201ca lot more [identities] to check\u201d than initially expected \u2013 and it was only after that that \u201cwe ask people in the NHS to make referrals\u201d. But NHS staff have also been slow to call for the volunteers to assist. Churchill said: It just takes time for info to get through to every GP practice, every pharmacist and every discharge team. Referrals are in the thousands right now and we expect they will be in the tens of thousands soon. Volunteers are registered on the Good SAM app and when signed in wait for an alert indicating a job needs doing. But Facebook groups for volunteers are full of people expressing disappointment that they had waited hours without being tasked. Melanie Westell, 41, from Kent, said she had signed up to volunteer two and a half weeks ago and last Friday she was told she had been accepted. She added: I have been on duty for 87 hours over the last week and have not had anything come through. The only thing I can put it down to is that when doctors or pharmacies, for example, refer vulnerable people to the service they have to fill out a form for all the services they may need. Hancock said there is still a \u201clot of work\u201d needed to reach the target he set of 100,000 daily Covid-19 tests by the end of April. Asked how he expects to achieve this, he said: We have had a huge number of offers from people who have come to us and said: \u2018We can turn this facility, which hasn\u2019t been a coronavirus testing facility, into a coronavirus testing facility\u2019. Hancock said some of the centres that had been offered included ones the government did not know about. We are working 24/7 to hit it [the target]. Everyone can see the daily trajectory, which has almost doubled since I set it, and we\u2019ve clearly got a lot of work to get to our 100,000, but we are on track. Asked about reports that he has been holding meetings of between 10 and 20 people in person, Hancock said he works from home when he can and is making use of video-conferencing. He said that when he does come into the office he follows social distancing guidelines. Van-Tam was asked about oxygen supplies and he said: This disease is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in my almost three decades in medicine. It is really, really unusual in that the requirement for patients who are hospitalised to have oxygen is very high. And sorry to go back to the hosepipe analogy, but if everyone in a certain area turns on their sprinkler in the garden at the same time, the water pressure will go down for a while. He said it is a \u201clogistic and engineering challenge\u201d to create thousands of extra intensive care beds with ventilators, and also secure the oxygen supply that goes behind them. Now, I do know that there has been absolutely enormous logistic work 24/7 behind the scenes to keep hospitals supplied with oxygen. But you\u2019re right, we have seen one or two reports of where something has gone slightly wrong with an oxygen supply. And that\u2019s partly about the stress on the whole engineering system of a hospital, that is required to produce the oxygen demands for double the number of ventilators, and we have to learn as we go along, and our engineers have to adapt. And you are going to see these isolated incidents and we\u2019ll learn from them. But oxygen supply \u2013 you\u2019re right to flag it, it\u2019s an unprecedented demand with this virus. May called it \u201cfrustrating\u201d that people were continuing to flout physical distancing rules. She said: The reason that is frustrating is because there\u2019s also still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work. Sam, a nurse in a mental health organisation in the east of England, had grief from her neighbours because she was travelling to work. Our nurses, our healthcare staff, need to be able to get to work, it\u2019s right and proper they do, but I ask of everybody: please stay at home, save lives and protect my staff. Van-Tam said scientists had been clear that closing borders \u201cwould not work\u201d as a measure to prevent the ingress of coronavirus into the UK. I understand the point you\u2019re making and I see where you\u2019re coming from, in terms of when we get this under control, doesn\u2019t that change the situation? But [it] won\u2019t go from a position of widespread community transmission amongst our own people to a position of zero transmission amongst our own people, which of course was the case back in December 2019. We will likely go back to low levels of transmission and the virus will continue to be here, in and around us in our communities, I suspect, for a very long time, even if we can keep the levels right down. They are taking questions from the media now. On the issue of face masks, Hancock said the government will \u201cfollow the science\u201d, which he says states they \u201cdon\u2019t have a material impact outside of those settings which Public Health England have set out\u201d. He added: But also here we are following the international evidence too. The World Health Organization have themselves looked into this very recently, and came to the conclusion that face masks should be saved for those in health and care who really need them. So it is not a risk-free option to have face masks, for everybody to wear face masks, because that means that it\u2019s harder to get hold of face masks for the people where the science says that they\u2019re needed. The number of deaths is broadly in line with what is happening in other countries, Van-Tam says. With the number of people in critical care, the overall trend has remained the same, says Van-Tam. There may be some signs that the curve is beginning to bend but it\u2019s premature, absolutely, to say that we\u2019re at a peak. The push that we\u2019re making with social distancing has to continue. With the number of people occupying hospital beds who have been diagnosed with Covid-19, the curve is \u201cbending\u201d, says Van-Tam. It\u2019s impossible to say that we have peaked. London has gone down in the last day, but the north-east and Yorkshire have gone up. The curve is beginning to bend and your hard work is beginning to pay off, but this needs to continue. The number of new cases is at a high level and the number is varying day by day, says Van-Tam. We are in a dangerous phase still and I must reinforce to you that this is not over. Van-Tam is speaking now. Transport use has stayed at low levels in all forms. This must keep going \u2013 \u201cthis is not over\u201d, he said. We need to take the pain now to make the gain in a few weeks\u2019 time. Alongside the new NHS hospitals in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Harrogate and Bristol; Sunderland and Exeter will soon have Nightingale hospitals too. May is speaking now. She says staying at home is saving lives. The actions that you take this weekend will have consequences. Remember the sacrifices that others are making. Countless others will not be home this weekend because they are working in a hospital or in a social care setting saving patients\u2019 lives. She also thanks key workers for the work they are doing that allows health and social care staff to keep working. Hancock has once again urged people to stay at home this bank holiday weekend. Stay at home, because spreading the virus today risks lives tomorrow. Do it for the NHS, do it for the people you love. The third strand is future supply \u2013 ensuring there is enough PPE to see us through the crisis, Hancock says. New supply lines are being established from across the world, buying directly from manufacturers according to standards. Domestic production will also be ramped up. Many businesses have come forward to repurpose their production lines to meet needs. In particular, Hancock has thanked Burberry, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, Ineos and Diageo for their efforts. He invites other businesses to contact the government if they can do the same. The second strand is distribution \u2013 making sure that anyone who needs PPE can get it at the right time. Hancock called this a \u201cherculean logistical effort\u201d bringing together the NHS, private industry and the armed forces to create a \u201cgiant\u201d PPE network on an \u201cunprecedented\u201d scale. That network is now delivering daily to the frontline. So far more than 752m pieces of PPE have been delivered. Every NHS hospital has received a supply of PPE once every 72 hours \u2013 from next week this will be daily. In the coming weeks, PPE delivery systems will be scaled up further. Over the next three weeks an online portal will be rolled out allowing primary care and social care to request PPE from a central inventory, so demand can be tracked and deliveries made according to need. Today the government has published its PPE plan, which has three strands, Hancock said. Strand one is on guidance \u2013 who needs PPE, when they need it, and who does not. That means only using it when there is a clinical need and not using more than is needed. The new guidance included the clinical advice that many items of PPE can be used for a whole session, not be changed after treating each individual patient. Outside of health and social care, the best way to protect yourself and others is regularly hand-washing and keeping 2 metres apart \u2013 and to stay at home. Hancock has set a goal that everyone working in a critical role will get the PPE they need to protect themselves. He noted the huge international demand on global supplies of PPE. There is also high demand for PPE within the UK, so everyone should use \u201cno more and no less\u201d than what they clinically need. In normal times the NHS supply chain for PPE provides equipment to 233 hospital trusts. Right now, 58,000 separate health and care providers need PPE. Yesterday, Hancock said he opened a mega-lab in Milton Keynes. Two more are on track, one in Cheshire and Glasgow. AstraZeneca and GSK are opening another in Cambridge. There are now 15 drive-through testing centres for NHS staff including in Glasgow, London and Plymouth. Hancock said there is now capacity for \u201call key social care staff and NHS staff\u201d who need to be tested to get tested. The health secretary said that yesterday, 19,116 tests were carried out across the UK, from which 5,706 people tested positive. The number of people currently in hospital with symptoms is 19,304. 8,958 people who tested positive have died in hospital, an increase of 980 since yesterday. This is more than the worst daily rise recorded by Italy, which was 969. The prime minister\u2019s condition \u201ccontinues to improve\u201d and he wants to thank the entire clinical team who have treated him. Hancock is speaking now. This Easter will be another test of the nation\u2019s resolve, he said. However warm the weather, however tempting your local beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home. The government\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefing is due to begin shortly and will be fronted by the health secretary Matt Hancock. He will be joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam and the chief nursing officer for England, Ruth May. Boris Johnson has \u201cbeen able to do short walks\u201d as part of his recovery and has spoken to his doctors and medical team to thank them for \u201cthe incredible care\u201d he has received, Downing Street has said. The prime minister is back on a ward at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital after being discharged from the intensive care unit where he was being treated for Covid-19. A No 10 spokesman said: The Prime Minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery. He has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease. United Private Hire Drivers, the representative body for UK private hire drivers, has initiated a legal challenge against what it has deemed central and local government failure to protect licensed private hire drivers and their passengers from Covid-19 infection. Launching an emergency Crowdjustice campaign to raise the funds necessary to apply for a judicial review at the high court, the organisation has called on the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to urge the government to introduce safety standards for private operators. UPHD said the action comes after one member died after contracting coronavirus and another two have become seriously ill. Ayub Akthar passed away last week due to complications relating to Covid-19. Abdurzak Hadi became seriously ill but is now recovering. Transport for London and other licensing authorities have not insisted upon separation distance requirements, PPE, detailed safety protocols and driver training. In contrast, UPHD highlights how the Dutch authorities have introduced emergency regulations to control the risk of Covid-19 infection in cabs by enforcing a 1.5 metre separation, mandatory use of personal protection equipment, sanitation routines and limiting service to one passenger at a time. Private hire operators such as Uber and Addison Lee have targeted NHS staff with free and discounted journeys during this time of pandemic. UPHD said although this is welcome, it presents significant mutual risk for passengers and drivers and, as a result, regulatory action is needed to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus in licensed private hire vehicles. James Farrar, chair of UPHD, said: In an industry rife with worker rights abuse, the government must act quickly to put appropriate controls in place and if they do not, we will take legal action. We are prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure no driver dies because of corporate greed and regulatory inaction. Simon Cox, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers, said: Key workers and members of the public making necessary journeys need private hire drivers. The health secretary has made draconian regulations against shops and members of the public, to protect the right to life. But no regulations have been made against private hire operators like Uber. They operate without any laws requiring them to protect their passengers and drivers from Covid-19. The government must urgently use its powers to regulate private hire operators. Experts in the US have warned of a potential rise in suicides as a result of public health measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. Writing in the journal JAMA psychiatry, the team said their warning does not mean such measures should not be used, but it is important suicide prevention is enhanced. Among their concerns, the trio of researchers from the University of Washington and Florida State University note the impact of the coronavirus on businesses, writing: Economic downturns are usually associated with higher suicide rates compared with periods of relative prosperity. Experts have already warned that mass unemployment in the US could result in widespread mental health problems. The new article also reports that physical distancing could be problematic. \u201cSuicidal thoughts and behaviours are associated with social isolation and loneliness,\u201d they write, adding that approaches to staying connected through technology should be promoted. Among other concerns, the trio suggest measures such as school closures may make it harder for people to keep appointments for mental health treatment \u2013 with the team arguing for interventions including better screening of Covid-19 patients for mental health problems, and remote suicide prevention schemes. Additionally the team say healthcare professionals have an elevated risk of suicide, and call for greater support for those on the frontline of the pandemic. It is not the first time such concerns have been raised. In the UK it was announced this week that NHS staff will be offered free mental health support to help them cope with the situation. Responding to the article, an NHS England spokesperson said: The NHS is pulling out all the stops to respond to the biggest global health threat in a century, while also ensuring people can still access the mental health services they need. There is capacity across the country to treat all those needing mental health support and 24/7 NHS crisis lines are ramping up across the country so we urge everyone to continue to come forward for essential and urgent care. Prof Rory O\u2019Connor of the Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory at the University of Glasgow welcomed the study, saying it chimed with ongoing work in the UK. But, he said, mental health consequences of the pandemic will not affect everyone equally: Those who are already vulnerable, including those who are socially disadvantaged and those with pre-existing mental health conditions are most at risk of suicide. We need to prioritise and shield the most vulnerable. O\u2019Connor added that his own team has launched a study to identify who is most at risk of suicide and how to mitigate such risks. Rises in suicide and self-harm are not inevitable, especially if we act urgently. I urge the government to ensure that protecting the mental health of the nation is central to the Covid-19 response. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted 24 hours a day on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org, while they have also put together information regarding mental health during the coronavirus outbreak here. Following a degree of backlash after The Times reported (paywall) that our elected representatives are being offered \u00a310,000 for additional office costs incurred as a result of the pandemic by parliament\u2019s expenses authority, several MPs have taken to social media to clarify that this money is not \u201cextra pay\u201d for politicians. Rather than being to help MPs work from home \u2013 as it has been framed in some reports \u2013 the money is available to be claimed in order to buy additional equipment such as laptops and printers for staff who are now having to work from home during the lockdown. This is on top of the \u00a326,000 MPs can claim to cover office costs. The extra funds will be available until March 2021 and come with a relaxation of the rules on evidence of purchases. In guidance, published last month, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) said it was \u201ccommitted to supporting MPs and their staff to carry on with their work as far as possible\u201d during this \u201cuncertain and challenging time for the country\u201d. This thread is from the Labour MP Nadia Whittome: This is from the Conservative MP Julie Marson: This is from the Labour MP Wes Streeting: And this is from the Conservative MP George Freeman: For added context on how parliament works, the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman has also written this: Another 29 people are reported to have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the total there to 315. There have been 502 new cases of the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed positive tests to 4,591, Public Health Wales said. In other very British news, South Yorkshire police have apologised after a video circulating on social media appeared to show an officer reprimanding a man for using his own front lawn. The force said on Twitter, where the video has so far been viewed more than 340,000 times, that the officer in the video had good intentions but was \u201cill-informed\u201d. It comes on the same day Cambridgeshire police had to clarify that their force was \u201cnot monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets\u201d after an earlier now-deleted tweet attracted backlash for appearing to suggest officers had checked \u201cnon essential aisles\u201d in a local Tesco. This is all just a day after the chief constable of Northamptonshire police, Nick Adderley, was criticised for the controversial suggestion that officers could start searching shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules. Adderley has since said his use of language was \u201cclumsy\u201d after being criticised for his remarks, including by the home secretary Priti Patel, who said they were \u201cnot appropriate\u201d. Afternoon! This is Lucy Campbell again, bringing you up to speed with all the latest UK coronavirus developments for the rest of the day. I\u2019m extremely grateful to everyone who has already been in touch with tips and suggestions. If you\u2019d like to contact me please feel free to email me at lucy.campbell@guadian.co.uk or via Twitter @lucy_campbell_. Police Scotland has issued more than 500 fines to people ignoring the lockdown since the emergency powers came into force two weeks ago, and arrested others who refused to follow instructions, the chief constable, Iain Livingstone has said. Taking part for the first time in Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference, Livingstone said the fines and arrests came after police had to break up house parties or large groups of people gathering outside. In the first week, the force issued just over 140 fixed penalty notices, implying non-compliance has increased nearly three-fold in the last week. The fines cost \u00a360 or \u00a330 if paid within 28 days. \u201cWith the continued support and cooperation of our fellow citizens, Police Scotland will explain the legal instructions, encourage compliance and when necessary, enforce the law,\u201d he said. Policing of this would be \u201cfair, reasonable and proportionate,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cDo not make personal exemptions bespoke to your own circumstances.\u201d Asked by the BBC if she was worried people were growing fatigued by the lockdown, Sturgeon said: \u201cOf course I worry about people tiring of this. I think we all find it more difficult to comply with these rules as every day passes. \u201cThat will get more difficult as we go into spring and the weather gets better, the nights get lighter. Nobody is under any illusion about that. But that is why it remains important for all us in government to be very clear with people: we will not ask you to do this for a minute longer than necessary.\u201d Asked why the former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was not fined for twice breaching the lockdown and only given a verbal warning, Livingstone said the police rightly accepted her immediate acknowledgement she had broken the law and would not do so again. NHS England has announced 866 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 8,114. Of the 866 new deaths announced today, 117 occurred on 9 April while 720 took place between 1 April and 8 April. The remaining 29 deaths occurred in March, including one on March 5. A further 10 people with coronavirus have died in Northern Ireland, taking the total number of deaths to 92. There are 112 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland - now a total of 1,589. The first minister of Wales said the coronavirus lockdown could be \u201ctightened\u201d in Wales, including people not being allowed outside to exercise, if there was \u201clarge-scale flouting\u201d of the guidelines. Speaking at a press briefing in Cardiff, Mark Drakeford added fines could be increased but said he did not want to toughen measures because the rules are \u201can enormous burden\u201d already. We check every weekend with the police whether they think they have the powers they need and it\u2019s important they are satisfied because they have to administer them. The position last weekend was that their powers are sufficient, but if they come to me to say they need more powers, they will get more powers. He added: \u201cThe small minority [who flout rules] need to get the message and get into line.\u201d The first minister also said he would only relax physical distancing measures \u201cwhen the evidence shows it is safe\u201d, and that such a decision would not be based on any similar actions in England. We will do the right thing for Wales at the time that it is right for Wales and we won\u2019t be doing that by looking over our shoulders at what others are doing. Drakeford also denied announcing an extension of the lockdown in Wales on Wednesday to \u201cget in ahead of Westminster\u201d. He said: \u201cI wanted to be honest with people here in Wales and did not want them going into Easter believing they were on the final stretch and come next week the restrictions would be all over.\u201d This is Jessica Murray, taking over the blog while my colleague Lucy has a short break. A 30-year-old man has been charged with fraud after allegedly spending six free nights at a hotel by claiming to be an NHS worker. Ben Quince checked into the Casa hotel, in Chesterfield, at the end of March on a floor reserved for NHS staff, Derbyshire police said. He stayed there for six nights and allegedly told staff he worked in the A&amp;E department at Chesterfield Royal hospital. The hotel is offering complimentary lodgings for health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the force said. Quince, of no fixed address, has been charged with fraud by false representation. He appeared at Southern Derbyshire magistrates court on Monday and was bailed to appear again at a later date, police said. Nicola Sturgeon has pledged her government will pass on the full Scottish share of any Treasury bailout for universities but said they had to have further discussions on changing the way the Scottish Funding Council, which finances the sector, funds teaching costs for students and research. The first minister was asked about the Guardian\u2019s report that Prof Sally Mapstone, the principal of the University of St Andrews, had warned her university was facing its worst financial crisis in recent history and had already lost \u00a325m. She said the urgent priorities were confronting the public health challenge and the preservation of life, but added: The scale of the financial crisis facing universities is well understood by ministers. We clearly want our universities to remain where they are right now, which is at the very forefront of global education in the quality of the education and research that they\u2019re renowned for. Unlike in England and Wales, Scottish universities do not charge Scottish students tuition fees but instead get a per capita sum from the SFC to cover teaching costs; universities say that figure is less than the costs of teaching Scottish students. They use fees paid by foreign students to balance the books. University principals say they could lose between 50% and 100% of their income from foreign students, if they refuse to come to the UK because of the pandemic. Universities are now planning to put their staff on furlough; some predict smaller universities will be merged or shut down. They are pressing the Scottish government to consider higher per capita payments for teaching and an increase in research and postgraduate funding to protect their finances. Sturgeon said: There are some very complex discussions we need to have. We know exactly what the universities have been asking for and will continue to have those discussions. Here are all the main points from this afternoon\u2019s lobby briefing from my colleague Frances Perraudin, including an update on the prime minister\u2019s health and the wider government response to the pandemic. On Boris Johnson\u2019s condition, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The prime minister is back on a ward and continuing his recovery, which is at an early stage. He continues to be in very good spirits. There will be just one daily update about his condition now he is out of intensive care. Asked what contact Johnson had had with No 10, the spokesman said: The PM is just beginning his recovery and he will be taking advice from his medical team. The PM is enormously grateful for the care he is receiving from NHS staff. I am told that he was waving his thanks at all of the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit to the ward. Asked about criticism of the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick for travelling more than an hour to visit his parents at the weekend, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said: The secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys that he made. We are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules. Like everybody else ministers have been told to work from home wherever possible and not make unnecessary journeys. As part of the coronavirus response there will be occasions where ministers have no option but to work from Whitehall. In the event this is required and the rest of the household is living elsewhere, it\u2019s not an \u2018unnecessary journey\u2019 for them to travel to rejoin their family. Asked to comment on Cambridge police saying they would monitor \u201cnon-essential\u201d supermarket aisles, he said: We set out a list of shops which could remain open and if the shops are on that list then they are free to sell whatever they have in stock, obviously providing its legal to do so. The Foreign Office announced this morning that it had chartered 12 more flights to bring more than 3,000 stranded UK nationals back from India. Asked if the government accepted that it had been too slow to get UK citizens home from India, the spokesman said: We are facing an unprecedented situation. The FCO has been working hard to bring British nationals back from countries around the world. The spokesman said that in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday, 15,194 coronavirus tests were carried out in NHS and PHE labs, including on 2,970 NHS staff. Also on Thursday, 29m PPE items were delivered to 268 trusts and organisations. 10,000 mechanical ventilators are currently available and another 1,500 on order, due to arrive shortly. The NHS has \u201csufficient spare capacity\u201d in terms of intensive care units and ventilators, he said. Firefighters are to fit face masks for frontline NHS and clinical care staff and deliver medical supplies to hospitals and care facilities during the coronavirus outbreak. Firefighters have been wearing respiratory masks for decades and the specialist trainers are certified to undertake the face-fit testing. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recently warned that the incorrect fitting of a protective face mask can increase the risk of Covid-19 infection and \u201clead to immediate or long-term ill-health or can even put the ...wearer\u2019s life in danger.\u201d Under the agreement, firefighters could also assist in the delivery of PPE to the social care sector which has reported critical shortages of essential equipment. Matt Wrack, Fire Brigades Union (FBU) General Secretary, said: This public health crisis will require all of us to do our bit to get through it, and firefighters rightly want to play as much of a part as they can. Under a previous agreement, fire and rescue personnel were already able to assist in delivery of essential items like food and medicines to vulnerable people, drive ambulances, assist ambulance staff and move dead bodies, should the outbreak cause mass casualties. Firefighters will maintain their core responsibilities while providing the services specifically related to the pandemic. The agreement made by the FBU with fire chiefs provides for the arrangements to be in place for an initial two months but the time period can be altered if all parties agree. Downing Street said shops that are allowed to remain open during the lockdown are free to sell whatever items they have in stock. Asked about the idea of police patrolling particular supermarket aisles to see what people are buying, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: We set out a list of shops which could remain open and if the shops are on that list then they are free to sell whatever they have in stock. Obviously provided it\u2019s legal to do so. Commenting on the news that the housing secretary Robert Jenrick visited his elderly parents, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said they were \u201cconfident\u201d he had complied with physical distancing rules: The secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys which he made. We\u2019re confident that he complied with the social distancing rules. The spokesman added Jenrick has said himself that his wife and children consider their home in Herefordshire to be their family home. Asked about cabinet ministers commuting to and from London, the spokesman said: Like everybody else, ministers have been told to work from home wherever possible, and not make unnecessary journeys. As part of the coronavirus response there will be occasions when ministers have no option but to work from Whitehall. Boris Johnson is in \u201cvery good spirits\u201d after being discharged from intensive care, Downing Street said at the daily lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said he was \u201cenormously grateful\u201d for the care he had received from NHS staff at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital. He said: I am told he was waving his thanks towards the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward. Hopefully it was clear to the staff that he was waving his gratitude. The spokesman said he was not aware of any contact between Johnson and No 10 and that it was too early to say how long he would need to remain in hospital. He added: The prime minister is back on a ward and continuing his recovery which is at an early stage. He continues to be in very good spirits. Decisions such as this will be on the advice of his medical team. They have given him brilliant care. A man has been arrested in Greater Manchester after biting a female police constable and punching two other officers as they enforced lockdown. Police were called on Thursday evening to reports a man was causing a disturbance on Drake Street in Rochdale. Attending officers had attempted to explain to the man that in line with government guidelines around Covid-19, people shouldn\u2019t be going around to other people\u2019s homes, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. While trying to engage with the man, two officers were both punched. One of those officers - a 21-year-old female police constable - was then seriously bitten and had to attend hospital, before being discharged to recover at home. A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, domestic violence assault, section 18 assault with intent to resist arrest and regulation 8 of the Health Protection Regulation 2020 (Coronavirus). He remains in police custody for questioning by officers. Superintendent Richard Hunt, of GMP\u2019s Rochdale district, said: No police officer should have to come to work \u2013 doing a job to serve and protect our communities \u2013 and be assaulted. It is absolutely disgusting that my officer was faced with this last night and all of our thoughts are with her as she rests at home. This is a particularly challenging time for everybody at the moment, made worse by something so mindless like this. Having spoken to the officer earlier this morning, she said that last night\u2019s incident was a stark contrast to the support she has felt over the past few days, whilst she has been delivering Easter eggs to local children whilst out on patrol. This just goes to show that thankfully, incidents like this are not a reflection of the vast majority of the public, who are showing great support to us. A further 48 people have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the total there to 495, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. Sturgeon said there are now 5,275 confirmed positive cases in Scotland, up by 318 from 4,957 the day before. There are 207 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of five on Thursday. Sturgeon added that 1,832 people are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Two-thirds (67%) of nurses do not feel they have access to sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE), a survey has found. Almost 3,500 nurses responded to the survey by the Nursing Standard, with just under a third (31%) saying they have used their own money to buy PPE, and one in 10 (11%) saying they resorted to making their own. One nurse described the PPE provision as shocking, inadequate and unsafe. She added: I feel I am risking my life to care for these patients. And I feel I will be the next victim of Covid-19 if it carries on. There were also complaints that masks, when available, are frequently poorly fitting and out of date, some by years. Almost all staff said they have access to disposable gowns (96%) and gloves (98%) but only 27% reported access to fluid-resistant surgical masks and 42% reported they had eye protection through a visor or goggles. Public Health England has different advice for the level of PPE staff should wear in different settings but some healthcare workers have suggested the guidelines do not offer them sufficient protection. Additionally, NHS staff have been complaining for weeks about low specification PPE and shortages of protective equipment. NHS England and ministers have insisted that shortages of PPE are due to distribution issues rather than inadequate supplies and that they have scaled up deliveries over the past three weeks. The leaders of the UK\u2019s headteachers\u2019 unions have told the Department for Education they hope schools in England can reopen even for as little as two weeks before the summer holidays, if scientific advice allows. The leaders of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) told Schools Week that the DfE had shown interest in the idea of pupils having a limited return before the end of July, rather than waiting until the new school year starts in September. Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL, said it would be \u201cincredibly cathartic\u201d if schools could reopen, and helpful for pupils preparing to move from primary to secondary school. But he cautioned: What we don\u2019t want to do is spook people into thinking schools will be opening in a week\u2019s time, but we do need to start thinking about what it would look like if we get children back for a few weeks in the summer term. Of course, it won\u2019t happen if the public health experts say the timing isn\u2019t right, but it\u2019s something to start thinking about. Paul Whiteman of the NAHT said: Once the scientific advice is that schools can return safely, they should do so, even if it\u2019s for a very limited period before the summer break, as this will allow young people to reacquaint themselves with the educational environment. The DfE\u2019s position is that schools in England remain closed \u201cuntil further notice\u201d except for defined groups, and the governments in Wales and Scotland have explicitly ruled out schools reopening in the near term. A boutique hotel in Edinburgh run by one of the world\u2019s oldest medical bodies says it has now donated more than 1,000 nights of free accommodation to health workers involved in combating the coronavirus. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd), which traces its origins to 1505 and now trains and accredits surgeons from across the world, opened its hotel Ten Hill Place next to its headquarters, Surgeons\u2019 Hall, in 2005 to raise funds. It said the hotel has made 129 bedrooms available for hospital staff, with packed continental breakfasts and free evening meals, to reduce their need to commute and help medical staff avoid other vulnerable family members in isolation. It is also in talks with Scotland\u2019s interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, about converting the hotel into temporary hospital accommodation if the city\u2019s hospitals overflow. Prof Michael Griffin, the president of the RSCEd, said: We\u2019ve heard and seen directly from our colleagues how severe the impact Covid-19 is on our health service. Having accommodation near hospitals to rest and recover allows our colleagues to be looked after, at a time when they need the most support. Fewer than one in five healthcare workers who suspected they had coronavirus actually tested positive for the disease, according to one of the first published UK studies of mass testing on NHS workers. Scientists from Sheffield, which started testing all symptomatic healthcare workers a fortnight before much of the rest of the UK, have published research showing that 81% of staff reporting symptoms tested negative. Some 1,533 staff were tested over the two weeks from 17 March. Of these, just 282 (18%) tested positive. Five (&lt; 1%) had an indeterminate result. More than a third of staff had completed at least one shift while symptomatic. Twenty-five were nursing staff, eight were doctors, nine were other patient-facing clinical staff, nine were laboratory or secretarial staff and one worked in cleaning services. On 17 March, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (STH) started testing any staff who were complaining of an \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d. This was defined as anyone with a reported fever and one of: cough, sore throat, runny nose, myalgia, headache. They were directed to self-swab in the on-site assessment pods and given written and pictorial instructions to show how to do it correctly. Four times a day the swabs were transported to the laboratory at the Northern General hospital, where they were tested. The majority of test results were communicated to staff on the same or the next day. Staff with a negative test were able to return to work if they felt well enough to do so. Concluding their study, the Sheffield scientists said: In a time where healthcare systems are particularly stretched, it is important to be able to maximise the available workforce. Facilitating testing may substantially decrease absence in staff when [coronavirus] can be excluded. They added: While it is important that the provision of testing is carefully balanced with consideration of laboratory capacity, increasing laboratory capacity to allow widespread testing of NHS staff could be a vital tool in achieving adequate staffing during the Covid-19 outbreak, and reducing the risk of transmission to vulnerable patients. Earlier on in the UK\u2019s coronavirus crisis, Sheffield was one of the local authorities with the highest number of cases \u2013 a fact local virologists attributed to Sheffield testing more people, earlier, than almost anywhere else. On 1 April, a consultant virologist in the city claimed Sheffield was carrying out 10% of all tests in the UK. The public have been warned they are more likely to see police officers in masks and gloves in certain situations during the pandemic where there is considered to be a risk of transmission. Police chiefs said officers can wear fluid-resistant masks and gloves when sat in cars or vans with colleagues or when they can not keep 2 metres away from members of the public. The guidance said: It is recommended that PPE (minimum of a fluid resistant surgical mask and gloves (non-latex)) should be readily available for officers where it is necessary to deploy double-crewed patrols or in personnel carriers. They have also be told at all times they should have PPE \u2018readily available\u2019 capable of being donned quickly. John Apter, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said the public should not be concerned if they, on occasions, see police officers wearing PPE: This is not only about protecting colleagues, it\u2019s also about protecting the public. Policing is dangerous and unpredictable but every measure must be taken to keep officers as safe as possible. Face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers are the absolute basic we would expect our colleagues to be provided with in this current crisis. The guidance was issued by the National Police Chiefs Council and College of Policing. Officers are told they should fully protect themselves if dealing with someone infected with the virus and to maintain social distancing. Chief constable Andy Rhodes, the NPCC wellbeing lead, said: We have sufficient stocks of personal protective equipment for all forces and have established a reliable supply chain to ensure it is available to forces in the quantities needed. There are \u201cheartbreaking\u201d cases of employees being made redundant after being denied help from the government\u2019s job retention scheme, Citizens Advice has said, fearing the government\u2019s \u201cbold\u201d action to protect workers during the pandemic could be undermined by confusion and \u201cpatchy use\u201d of the scheme by some employers. The charity said advisers are seeing daily cases of people who are at risk of slipping through the safety net despite potentially being entitled to support. New research by the charity shows around six million people in the UK (18% of the workforce) have had their hours cut, been laid off or made redundant. Almost four out of 10 (38%) have lost household income because of the crisis, with nearly one in 12 (8%) losing 80% of household income. Demand for its redundancy advice has doubled, with its web page titled \u201cwhat to do if your employer has told you not to work\u201d being the most-read page this month with more than 175,000 views. The charity highlighted the case of a father-of-four called Mark who returned to work as an HGV driver in February, after spending eight months caring for his daughter who is undergoing treatment for a rare cancer. In March, the family were told they needed to self-isolate as his daughter is one of the 1.5m who must be shielded. Mark was made redundant the next day as he could not return to work. He said: I spoke to my manager and explained that if someone in my home caught coronavirus and passed it on to my daughter the chances are she would die. They said that as a driver I would not be in contact with many people and could I not just self-isolate in my cabin. I said that wouldn\u2019t be possible. My family and their wellbeing comes first, so I have to accept that I no longer have a job. It\u2019s just really insensitive and feels wrong that they can let me go for following the government guidelines to shield my daughter as she is high risk. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: The government has unveiled a remarkable package of support to help people keep their heads above water during this crisis. It must now ensure employers are using this to protect their workers, as well as opening it up to cover even more people. We\u2019re already starting to see heartbreaking cases where employees have been denied help from the scheme and have instead been made redundant. While it\u2019s not clear how much of this is due to confusion, cash flow fears, or the need to downsize, we think the Government needs a clear plan to protect people if the support is not filtering through. That is the only way to reduce the burden on the benefits system, and retain the link between an employer and their staff. Costume staff from the English National Opera have turned their skills to making scrubs for medics on the frontline of the Covid-19 pandemic. On their GoFundMe page, organiser Sarah Bowern explains: We are a team of costume staff from the English National Opera raising money to make scrubs for our amazing NHS. The costume team for the BBC drama His Dark Materials have also so far raised more than \u00a341,000 to help dress medics and released their first scrubs this week. The team behind the campaign also worked on Downton Abbey and have been backed by actor Hugh Bonneville who tweeted: The original costume team from Downton Abbey are putting their talents to about the most important use imaginable right now. The legendary Manchester nightclub, the Hacienda, which closed down in 1997, is hosting a stay at home rave tomorrow to help keep people entertained and encourage them not to venture out over the Easter weekend. The line-up includes former Hacienda resident DJs Graeme Park, Jon DaSilva and Tom Wainwright, as well as US house music legends Todd Terry, David Morales and Roger Sanchez. The event, which begins at noon and finishes at midnight, can be watched online here. Morrisons Foundation, the charitable arm of Morrisons supermarket, has set aside a fund of \u00a3500,000 over the next three months to help charities offer additional protection, services and support to the homeless as a result of Covid-19. Rough sleepers have been identified as one of the most at-risk groups, as they are more likely to have underlying health conditions and are less able to access basic sanitation. Charities can apply online for grants of up to \u00a310,000. Charities will be able to apply for financial help to support rough sleepers, which includes supplying food and healthcare essentials. It also covers the delivery of services in hostels and shelters, including the payment for additional staff, purchase of PPE equipment and the provision of emergency accommodation. The fund will also allow charities to provide information and advice regarding health and wellbeing services and helplines. David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, said: Morrisons is committed to helping the most vulnerable in our society. We know that the coronavirus outbreak presents a particular risk to the homeless and we want to do our bit to help. This new fund will help charities doing vital work to care for the homeless at this critical time. Nick Connolly, the managing director of End Youth Homelessness, said: Our member charities need cash to pay for staff, personal protective equipment, food and other essentials to a level they could not possibly have envisaged a few months ago. We are so pleased this is being recognised. Further to our earlier post, Cambridgeshire police have posted another statement on Twitter to clarify that officers \u201care not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets\u201d. It said an earlier tweet (now deleted) had been made by an \u201cover exuberant officer\u201d. It caused a stir online after it seemed to suggest officers had checked \u201cthe non essential aisles were empty\u201d in a local Tesco. The force tweeted: For clarification, the force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets. This message was sent with good intentions by an over exuberant officer who has been spoken to since this tweet was published. Whilst the majority of people in our communities are abiding by the social distancing measures we have had to issue a small number of fines to those who are flouting the rules. None of these have been in relation to shopping or supermarket visits. The initial tweet had come just a day after the chief constable of Northamptonshire Police, Nick Adderley, was criticised for the controversial suggestion that officers could start searching shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules. Adderley has since said his use of language was \u201cclumsy\u201d after being criticised for his remarks, including by the home secretary Priti Patel who said they were \u201cnot appropriate\u201d. The shadow home secretary has urged the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick to fully explain himself after the Guardian revealed he had travelled more than an hour away to visit his parents at the weekend \u2013 despite warning others to stay at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The communities secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own. It also emerged that Jenrick travelled 150 miles from his London property, where he stayed at the start of the lockdown, to his \u00a31.2m Herefordshire home from where he travelled to his parents. His website says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London. Asked whether he thought Jenrick was ignoring the government\u2019s stay at home advice, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think that\u2019s for him to explain. As you know, the delivery of essential supplies like food and medicine to vulnerable people, vulnerable family members, would be permissible in the exceptions that there are for people to go outside. But I think it\u2019s very important now for public confidence that Robert Jenrick fully explains himself and why exactly that journey was necessary. The full story is here. A doctors\u2019 leader has insisted that GPs will visit elderly residents of care homes during the coronavirus outbreak after complaints that doctors were refusing to attend sick patients in residential care. Dozens of elderly residents, many of whom have underlying health problems and dementia, have died in Scottish care homes or fallen ill with Corvid-19, including several large clusters. Care England, the industry body, estimates up to 1,000 people have died in English care homes but have not been officially counted. The older\u2019s people\u2019s charity Age Scotland, said earlier this week it knew of cases where GPs were failing to visit care homes and insisting on doing telephone consultations or referring people to an NHS helpline. The Royal College of GPs issued a joint statement with Scottish Care, the umbrella body for care homes, on Friday to insist GPs would visit patients where necessary but confirmed the pandemic had led to a significant shift towards telephone and video consultations. Dr Carey Lunan, the chair of RCGP Scotland, and Prof Donald Macaskill of Scottish Care said the situation was worsened by a shortage of personal protective equipment; they and the Royal College of Nursing had written to the Scottish government last week to complain. Lunan and Macaskill said they knew it was \u201can incredibly worrying time\u201d for residents and their families. GPs will continue to deliver the same high level of care and support that they have always provided to their patients in care homes. GPs have had to rapidly adapt the way that they deliver clinical care in the last few weeks, with much more advice and assessment being done over the telephone or by video consulting, where it is safe and appropriate to do so. The safety of care home residents is very important to GPs, and for that reason, they would only visit in person where there is a clinical need to do so, to reduce the potential risk of bringing any infection into the home. If a face to face visit is needed, they will wear the appropriate PPE to protect staff and residents. It seems Cambridgeshire police have raised some eyebrows on social media with the news that officers attended Tesco in the village of Bar Hill this morning and checked \u201cnon-essential aisles\u201d. Judging by comments on the post on Twitter, this has left many confused over what constitutes (and who determines what constitutes) a \u201cnon-essential\u201d aisle or item. Officers have been patrolling supermarkets this morning, just a day after a chief constable was criticised for suggesting officers could search shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules. The Northamptonshire police chief constable, Nick Adderley, has since said his use of language was \u201cclumsy\u201d after being criticised for his remarks, including by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who said they were \u201cnot appropriate\u201d. The tweet by the force\u2019s Cambridge team said: Officers visited Tesco Barhill this morning as part of their patrols around supermarkets and green spaces this weekend. Good to see everyone was abiding by social distancing measures and the non essential aisles were empty. Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, Cambridgeshire police issued thanks to a local chocolatier for an essential (?) delivery... A 460-bed Nightingale hospital for the north-east is to be built in Washington, Tyne and Wear, the Conservative MP Richard Holden has said. It is being built with the help of the army at the International Advanced Manufacturing Park in a unit that is bigger than a football pitch, and will be divided into 16 wards, which will take coronavirus patients if units in the region cannot cope with demand. The MP for North West Durham tweeted: A similar development for the south-west is being created at the Westpoint Arena in Exeter, according to reports. The NHS has already set up temporary hospitals in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Harrogate. In a separate interview this morning as he did the early broadcast round, Dr Paul Cosford said it was \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d to expect the lockdown to continue for several weeks. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think several weeks isn\u2019t unreasonable. Let\u2019s hope its sooner than that. All my experience dealing with any sort of infectious disease suggests once you start getting things under control, that is the time you absolutely need to continue with all your measures so you can bring the disease right down, essentially to crack it across the country. He added there was the possibility the restrictions could be lifted in stages. He said: I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later. Just for now, we are getting on top of this but we have got an awfully long way to go and it is absolutely critical that we continue with all the actions that are required of us. The O2 arena in Greenwich is being turned into a training facility for NHS staff, in a bid to support the rapidly constructed NHS Nightingale hospital at ExCel London. At present, the centre is expected to operate from 12 April until 29 June \u2013 with the facility available without a hire fee. While no patients will be treated at the O2, the facility is expected to support staff training. \u201cWhile this will result in further rescheduling of events booked to take place during this period, the priority for us all at this time is to help save lives and we know our customers and partners will understand our desire to support the NHS in this way,\u201d the O2 said on its website. Dr Paul Cosford, the medical director for Public Health England, has called for people to stay at home over the Easter weekend because physical distancing measures are working. Reiterating the \u201cgood news\u201d issued by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, at the daily news briefing on Thursday, Cosford said the number of new cases looked to be starting to flatten and the number of deaths was not accelerating as fast as it would if there was \u201cuncontrolled transmission\u201d across communities. With \u201csome time yet\u201d still to go before the UK gets through the peak, Cosford said \u201cwe must carry on\u201d with physical distancing. He told Good Morning Britain: People are complying [with the measures] in a very large majority and the impact that is having is that transmission is much, much less than it would otherwise be. The most important thing now is we continue [to stay at home] so we can get through the peak and come down the other side. Good morning!

The TV presenter Kate Garraway says her husband, who is being treated in hospital for Covid-19, is still in intensive care and \u201cvery ill\u201d. In a message read out on air by her Good Morning Britain co-presenter Ben Shephard, Garraway said it \u201cremains an excruciatingly worrying time\u201d. Her husband, Derek Draper, 52, a former lobbyist and political adviser, was admitted to hospital last Monday. Garraway praised the NHS team treating him as \u201cextraordinary\u201d, saying: \u201cI know that it\u2019s only their professionalism, dedication and bravery that has kept Derek with us so far. I also know that they are working just as hard on all the patients in their care.\u201d She added: It is hard to find the right words because thank you alone just doesn\u2019t seem enough but I do thank them with all my heart as I know Derek would also want to if he could. I also want to say thank you so much to everyone who has sent messages of support. I\u2019m sorry that I haven\u2019t been able to respond to them but I hope you understand I\u2019m focusing on Derek and my family right now. However, in quieter moments, I am seeing them and they are so comforting and wonderful to read. I am very aware that I\u2019m not the only one going through this torture, there are thousands of families everywhere worried about their loved ones and hundreds more every day too that are having to deal with the worst news that their loved ones have been taken by this horrific virus. I want to send a message of love and support to all of you going through this. You are not alone, we must all stand together and support each other. And I\u2019m praying to be able to be talking with you soon with some positive news. Love, Kate.\u201d She and Draper, who have been married since 2005, have a daughter and a son. Boris Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley, has spoken of his relief after the prime minister was moved from intensive care where he was being treated for Covid-19. Stanley Johnson said he was \u201camazingly thankful\u201d for the efforts of the NHS and appreciative for the outpouring of support. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said his son must now rest to continue recovering from coronavirus. The prime minister is still being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. \u201cThis is pretty straightforward now. He must rest up. As I understand it, he has moved from the ICU into a recovery unit but I don\u2019t think you can say this is out of the wood now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.\u201d He added: \u201cTo use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now.\u201d My colleague, Robert Booth, also brings readers an exclusive story on today\u2019s Guardian front page detailing how hundreds of people are dying in care homes from confirmed or suspected coronavirus without yet being officially counted. He reports that more than 120 residents of the UK\u2019s largest charitable provider of care homes are thought to have died from the virus in the last three weeks, while another network of care homes is reported to have recorded 88 deaths. Care England, the industry body, estimated the death toll was likely to be close to 1,000, despite the only available official figure for care home fatalities being dramatically lower. He has also written a harrowing accompanying piece shining a light on the struggle going on inside UK care homes as they battle rising Covid-19 deaths. In one Buckinghamshire care home, in which eight patients with dementia have died in quick succession in just three weeks, he writes: Now relatives of the dying must say goodbye by phone or through bedroom windows, the solace of touch made impossible by fear of contagion.\u201d Morning folks, Simon Murphy here to steer you through this morning\u2019s UK coronavirus news. To recap, the nation was given a dose of good news when it emerged last night that prime minister Boris Johnson had been moved from intensive care where he was being treated for coronavirus. He remains at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. Separately, the Guardian revealed that the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick travelled to visit his parents at the weekend, despite repeatedly urging the public to stay at home during the lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. The Guardian established that the housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own. Jenrick defended himself on Twitter after a source close to him had earlier admitted that he had made the journey during lockdown conditions, but said he dropped off food and medication, and did not enter the house. The Guardian understands that the local community has been supporting Jenrick\u2019s parents by delivering groceries in recent weeks. This was not denied, though the source said Jenrick had collected and delivered medication for his parents, too. The story was followed up widely across Fleet Street, including on the front page of the Daily Telegraph: It was also taken up by the Daily Mail on its front page, focusing on Jenrick also staying at his second home. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has chartered 12 more flights to bring more than 3,000 stranded UK nationals back from India. It follows seven flights that have already been arranged between April 8 and April 12 and will bring the total number of Britons repatriated from India to around 5,000. The new flights will leave from Goa, Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Thiruvananthapuram between April 13 and April 20 with bookings opened on Friday.",

For Rihanna, that meant donating $2.1m to domestic violence charities in a crisis that has threatened to keep victims trapped inside with abusive partners. Cardi B\u2019s donations came in the form of a giveaway: she promised to donate $1,000 every hour for the next 42 days, a total of about $1m, to people badly affected by the pandemic. She came up with the idea after getting messaged by fans in need, but, she warned: \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure you really do need it, so don\u2019t be lying so you can lend your fucking boyfriend some money!\u201d Taylor Swift has similarly, although more quietly, been donating $3,000 packages to fans in need. As thousands across the US struggle to sign up for unemployment cheques, it is no wonder that celebrities feel obligated to step up. But they are also standing in for a country failing to provide adequate care. When Rihanna donated personal protective equipment to healthcare providers in New York (as well as a $5m donation to global organizations protecting healthcare workers and marginalized communities), she was giving what authorities should have been providing. Nonetheless, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, showed his gratitude by tweeting: \u201cWe\u2019re so appreciative of your help and that of so many others who have stepped up.\u201d Less powerful individuals are also taking on officials to demand better.

Tie Me Down!. \u201cHollywood (and Madonna) had fallen in love with him.\u201d</p> <p>Madonna had the flamenco party Almod\u00f3var had arranged for her filmed for the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed With Madonna). \u201cShe didn\u2019t ask for permission to use our images, and she even dubbed me, because my English mustn\u2019t have been that good,\u201d Almod\u00f3var complains. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if this seems like a settling of scores \u2013 if it had been the other way round (me filming Madonna and her team and making a film with all that material which I would then premiere around the world), I would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit; I\u2019d still be recovering from it. Madonna treated us like simpletons and I had to say it one day.\u201d</p> <p>He said Madonna decided on the seating plan and placed Banderas\u2019s then-wife Ana Leza far away from him, with herself by his side. \u201cAntonio\u2019s harassment was one of the main storylines and she, obviously, edited in how she dispatched Ana Leza with only one sentence. At the end of the dinner, Ana dared to get close to our table and told the divine blonde sarcastically, \u2018I see you like my husband, it doesn\u2019t surprise me, all women like him, but I don\u2019t mind because I am very modern.\u2019 To which Madonna replied: \u2018Get lost.\u2019 All this may seem frivolous, and it is.\u201d</p> <p>He also says Madonna also asked Banderas, who didn\u2019t speak English then, a provocative question via Almod\u00f3var. \u201cAsk him, she told me again, if he likes women to hit him \u2026 Antonio made the same gesture, which meant neither/nor, but that he was at the service of ladies\u2019 desires.\u201d</p> <p>Madonna has not responded to his post. The Guardian has contacted her UK representatives for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Oscar-winning Spanish film director Pedro Almod\u00f3var has written \u201ca settling of scores\u201d in a long diary entry written during the coronavirus lockdown, which accuses Madonna of treating him and actor Antonio Banderas as \u201csimpletons\u201d, and not asking permission to use footage of them in a documentary. In the post published in translation on IndieWire, Almod\u00f3var recalls first meeting Madonna on the set of the film Dick Tracy, and then later in Madrid during her 1990 Blond Ambition world tour. \u201cAside from myself, she was only interested in meeting one other guest, Antonio Banderas,\u201d he said of the latter meeting, with Banderas having recently acted in Almod\u00f3var\u2019s film Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!. \u201cHollywood (and Madonna) had fallen in love with him.\u201d Madonna had the flamenco party Almod\u00f3var had arranged for her filmed for the documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed With Madonna). \u201cShe didn\u2019t ask for permission to use our images, and she even dubbed me, because my English mustn\u2019t have been that good,\u201d Almod\u00f3var complains. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if this seems like a settling of scores \u2013 if it had been the other way round (me filming Madonna and her team and making a film with all that material which I would then premiere around the world), I would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit; I\u2019d still be recovering from it. Madonna treated us like simpletons and I had to say it one day.\u201d He said Madonna decided on the seating plan and placed Banderas\u2019s then-wife Ana Leza far away from him, with herself by his side. \u201cAntonio\u2019s harassment was one of the main storylines and she, obviously, edited in how she dispatched Ana Leza with only one sentence. At the end of the dinner, Ana dared to get close to our table and told the divine blonde sarcastically, \u2018I see you like my husband, it doesn\u2019t surprise me, all women like him, but I don\u2019t mind because I am very modern.\u2019 To which Madonna replied: \u2018Get lost.\u2019 All this may seem frivolous, and it is.\u201d He also says Madonna also asked Banderas, who didn\u2019t speak English then, a provocative question via Almod\u00f3var. \u201cAsk him, she told me again, if he likes women to hit him \u2026 Antonio made the same gesture, which meant neither/nor, but that he was at the service of ladies\u2019 desires.\u201d Madonna has not responded to his post. The Guardian has contacted her UK representatives for comment.",

Due to the pandemic, Givenchy cancelled its women\u2019s pre-spring collection and it will not make an autumn/winter 2020 couture collection.",

Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">they comprise 44% of medical staff</a> compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales \u2013 the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was \u201cextremely disturbing and worrying\u201d, the BMA chair said.</p> <p>\u201cAt face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random \u2013 to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,\u201d Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. \u201cNot only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There\u2019s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill.</p> <p>\u201cWe have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there\u2019s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed \u2013 the government must act now.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\"> 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white</a>.</p> <p>Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated.</p> <p>Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/nhs-doctors-lacking-ppe-bullied-into-treating-covid-19-patients\">a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis</a> \u2013 thereby putting themselves in danger.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/02/black-nhs-staff-more-likely-bullied-than-white-colleagues\">BAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels</a> compared to their white counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.\u201d</p> <p>He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of \u201cthe vast majority \u2013 I think only one was born here \u2013 who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others\u201d.</p> <p>Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.\u201d</p> <p>Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message. He said difficulties speaking English could lead to problems accessing NHS 111 either online or on the phone.</p> <p>Nagpaul also highlighted the higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease among BAME communities than in the white population, adding: \u201cPrevious inequalities will be greater at a time of crisis. This [coronavirus] may be bringing into focus historic inequalities facing BAME communities.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>He said the best advice for BAME doctors to protect themselves against Covid-19 until more was known about the virus was the same as for any of their colleagues: ensure they are wearing appropriate PPE. He urged them not to risk their life if it was not forthcoming.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to safeguard our BAME population and the BAME medical officers,\u201d he said \u201cThese are workers who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-treating-minority-ethnic-doctors-as-outsiders\">already experiencing significant hardships working for the NHS</a>. They are serving the nation at a time of unprecedented crisis. The government must take steps to address this.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working hard to protect all communities, adding that translations of the public information leaflet, posted to all 30 million households in the UK, were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-leaflet\">available on its website</a>.</p>",

Even allowing for the overrepresentation of BAME staff in the NHS \u2013 they comprise 44% of medical staff compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales \u2013 the fact that they were all from ethnic minorities was \u201cextremely disturbing and worrying\u201d, the BMA chair said. \u201cAt face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random \u2013 to have the first 10 doctors of all being of BAME background,\u201d Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. \u201cNot only that, we also know that in terms of the BAME population, they make up about a third of those in intensive care. There\u2019s a disproportionate percentage of BAME people getting ill. \u201cWe have heard the virus does not discriminate between individuals but there\u2019s no doubt there appears to be a manifest disproportionate severity of infection in BAME people and doctors. This has to be addressed \u2013 the government must act now.\u201d As well as the 10 doctors, three out of six nurses named as having died have also been BAME as was a hospital pharmacist and at least one healthcare assistant. The overall death figures in the UK have not been broken down by ethnicity but early research published this week showed that 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were non-white. Nagpaul said BAME health professionals were understandably concerned about the deaths of their colleagues and what it might mean for them. The BMA chair said it might be too early to get firm answers but that it needed to be investigated. Among the factors he speculated could be contributing was whether BAME doctors felt less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 a recurring complaint among healthcare workers during the crisis \u2013 thereby putting themselves in danger. \u201cBAME doctors often feel bullied and harassed at higher levels compared to their white counterparts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are twice as likely not to raise concerns because of fears of recrimination.\u201d He said the death of BAME doctors was particularly upsetting because of \u201cthe vast majority \u2013 I think only one was born here \u2013 who have come from overseas and have given their lives to the NHS, to save the lives of others\u201d. Among the wider BAME population, he suggested the fact that many were in key worker roles, combined with their living arrangements, could be contributing to their disproportionate presence in intensive care units. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a high proportion of BAME people not able to stay at home, serving the nation, putting themselves at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you add that to overcrowded and multigenerational occupancies, the infections can be brought back home and spread to other members of the family.\u201d Nagpaul questioned whether enough was being done in terms of translating information leaflets about Covid-19 and physical distancing for people for whom English is a second language, suggesting mosques and temples could be used by the government to help relay the message. He said difficulties speaking English could lead to problems accessing NHS 111 either online or on the phone. Nagpaul also highlighted the higher prevalence of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease among BAME communities than in the white population, adding: \u201cPrevious inequalities will be greater at a time of crisis. This [coronavirus] may be bringing into focus historic inequalities facing BAME communities.\u201d He said the best advice for BAME doctors to protect themselves against Covid-19 until more was known about the virus was the same as for any of their colleagues: ensure they are wearing appropriate PPE. He urged them not to risk their life if it was not forthcoming. \u201cWe need to safeguard our BAME population and the BAME medical officers,\u201d he said \u201cThese are workers who are already experiencing significant hardships working for the NHS. They are serving the nation at a time of unprecedented crisis. The government must take steps to address this.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working hard to protect all communities, adding that translations of the public information leaflet, posted to all 30 million households in the UK, were available on its website.",

      "bodyText": "Liam Gallagher has announced a free concert for NHS workers to acknowledge their efforts during the coronavirus outbreak. Gallagher said it was an \u201chonour\u201d to announce the concert at London\u2019s 20,000-capacity O2 Arena, adding that NHS workers \u201cdo an incredible job, we are very lucky to have them\u201d. The concert will take place on Thursday 29 October. \u201cNHS staff and NHS contract staff who work in NHS hospitals in the UK\u201d can apply for tickets, at a limit of two per person. Successful applicants can bring a non-NHS guest as the second ticketholder. NHS workers can apply from 9am on Wednesday 15 April via the O2 Arena website. Gallagher is the second British indie-rock artist to announce a free NHS concert this week. Welsh trio Manic Street Preachers will play Cardiff\u2019s Motorpoint Arena on 4 and 5 December \u2013 the first show is free for NHS workers, with the second paid show available to all, with proceeds going to NHS Wales. \u201cWe wanted to do something to show our appreciation, love and respect for the NHS and its amazing brave workers,\u201d the band said. \u201cOne free show and one fundraising show seemed the best way for us to express our deep gratitude for all their heroic work.\u201d Tickets for those concerts have gone on sale today. Eighties pop star Rick Astley will play two free concerts, at Manchester Arena on 28 October and Wembley\u2019s SSE Arena on 1 November, with tickets available to all NHS and emergency services staff. \u201cWe are all going to have a massive party together celebrating you and what you are doing,\u201d he said announcing the Wembley show, after the Manchester concert sold out in 30 minutes. Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott, the songwriting duo who were at the heart of the Beautiful South, have also announced two arena shows for NHS workers, on 13 October in Nottingham (sold out) and 15 October at Wembley. They have had four Top 5 albums since 2014 as a duo, including a No 1 this year with Manchester Calling. Heaton said in a statement: \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic should remind everyone, and let no one forget, that our National Health Service is the most brilliant and significant institution in our lives. The men and women who serve us and care for us, give us hope and sacrifice their own wellbeing, can never be thanked enough. We are just musicians, so there is little we can do but sing for you.\u201d Finally, Irish pop-rockers the Script will play a free concert at Dublin\u2019s 3Arena on 9 February for 13,000 British and Irish national health service workers, with the band heralding them as making \u201csacrifices day in and day out, working harder than anyone\u201d. Tickets sold out in 30 minutes earlier this week.",

Nandy\u2019s office has let the foreign secretary know they are seeking a meeting with the permanent secretary \u201cas an absolute matter of urgency\u201d, a spokesman said after a conference call with 70 MPs and staff to discuss the continuing repatriation crisis. MPs expressed concern about Britons stranded in India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand, which closed its borders two weeks ago. They also expressed frustration that 11 new rescue flights were being laid on for India while none were being planned for Pakistan, where it emerged there could be as many as 20,000 stranded Britons. During the call there were also complaints that the Foreign Office was fobbing off politicians who were making representations about their constituents with stock emails and an \u201cauto-response\u201d saying emails were not being monitored. Planes organised by the government have already been organised for Peru, Ghana, Algeria, India, Nepal and South Africa, with Ecuador and Bolivia also on the list. There have also been calls for charter flights to be laid on to Argentina. A retired GP, Adrienne Newton, who has been stranded for weeks in C\u00f3rdoba, 700km (435 miles) from Buenos Aires, said the embassy, had sent details at 1am on the day of a potential Air France flight from Buenos Aires.

Even for those lucky enough to have a garden, it will seem perverse. Spring is about life and renewal, while all around is death and sorrow.</p> <p>And yet the timing brings consolation, too, and not just because an hour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/07/closing-uk-parks-and-public-spaces-tipping-point-coronavirus-covid-19\">licen</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/07/closing-uk-parks-and-public-spaces-tipping-point-coronavirus-covid-19\">sed exercise</a> is more enticing if the weather\u2019s fine. True, it might be odd to talk of timing when it\u2019s not always obvious what day it is. We\u2019ve become unmoored from the calendar and even the clock. (With no evenings out, some are finding that every night is an early night.) Those furloughed or unaccustomedly working from home find themselves in an unfamiliar limbo: their surroundings suggest they\u2019re off work, and yet they\u2019re not on holiday. When the distinction between work and home is already blurred, and when you\u2019re not allowed to go anywhere, a four-day holiday weekend can seem \u2026 confusing.</p> <p>But this period is about more than a couple of days off.

Thanks to Zoom, relatives in scattered parts of north London, as well as in-laws in the countryside and a son and a niece abroad, several of them on their own, joined together to retell the story of the ancient Hebrews and their escape from slavery in Egypt to freedom. Over wobbly video link, and often out of sync, we sang the familiar songs, the melodies taught by generations long gone. At a second Zoom seder with friends, we broke off at 8pm to clap for the NHS and other carers. </p> <p>Before I\u2019d seen it, I thought that, like the weather, there would be something cruelly perverse about the notion of Passover in lockdown. It is billed as the \u201cfestival of our freedom\u201d, and yet we were to be under virtual house arrest, separated from those we love. But once the seder was under way, I felt my resistance receding. Sure, the video feed was glitchy and lagging, but we were experiencing it together. And the threat of the virus only made the proceedings more poignant. We were recalling a time when our ancestors were not free; when 10 plagues struck the land of Egypt; when people cried out for their ordeal to end. All that felt less abstract this year.</p> <p>The story of the seder is one of hope: after slavery, liberation.

      "bodyText": "The most deprived Londoners would be disproportionately affected by park closures if lockdown measures on public green spaces were increased, Guardian analysis has found. Londoners living in deprived areas and those from BAME backgrounds share less space and have less access to private gardens and public parks, according to an examination of mapping data. A third of all land in the wealthiest 10% of London wards was taken up by private gardens, while in the poorest 10%, just over a fifth was found to be taken up by garden space. That suggests people in the most deprived areas would be disproportionately affected by further park closures if lockdown restrictions became more severe. At least three boroughs have imposed partial park closures, in addition to shutting outdoor gyms and playgrounds, at some point during the UK\u2019s lockdown period. A further 17 have issued warnings to residents that parks will be closed if government guidelines are not followed. Current government guidelines say people should only leave their house for exercise once a day, and keep 2 metres apart from others at all times. London is the UK\u2019s most densely populated region and the lockdown has led to pressure on public green space. Scenes of sunbathers in Brockwell Park in south London on 4 April led to a temporary closure of the park and police also reported moving more than 100 people from Primrose Hill. The analysis is based on data which categorises the total land area of a ward into its uses, including domestic garden space. It shows that the most affluent decile of wards had the highest proportion of private garden space, and the most deprived decile had the lowest. Population density was also greatest in the poorest deciles meaning more people share less space. Meredith Whitten, a postdoctoral fellow at the LSE\u2019s school of geography and environment, said access to green space was vital for public health. \u201cEven before the pandemic, there was an increasing focus on research on the physical and mental health benefits of green space. \u201cBeing near green space makes us move more and that has benefits. Having access to nature gives us a sense of calmness and tranquility ... that helps with reducing the stress that comes especially from urban living.\u201d In the poorest decile, around half the residents were BAME on average, more than double the proportion in the richest decile, where 20% were non-white. A similar trend is apparent when looking at access to public parks and green space. Again, the wealthiest wards had the greatest proportion of public space on average at 35% compared to 25% in the most deprived. Whitten said there were similar trends during the 19th century. \u201cIn the Victorian era, the wealthier classes had their squares and gardens but the working class didn\u2019t have any because they lived in very crowded, often slumlike conditions.\u201d \u201cThe Victorians recognised they needed to provide some access to nature and that\u2019s really how the public parks movement in Britain started.\u201d Tower Hamlets council closed Victoria Park for a period but has now reopened it with limited hours. On 27 March, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham council reversed its decision to close parks following a government announcement of new emergency laws. As of 8 April, the vast majority of London councils were advising residents that parks remained open. However, more than half of the 33 councils had issued warnings, stating that if people did not follow government guidelines, the situation would be reviewed. Figures released by Google last week show that footfall in London parks on 29 March was down by approximately 59% compared to activity in January and February 2020.. Methodology Data on the percentage of gardens for each ward area was taken from the 2005 Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government report, Land Use by Borough and Ward, the most up-to-date measure available publicly. A 2018 report published by the Mayor of London\u2019s office states broad land usage categories have stayed roughly the same since 2002. Data on the percentage of parks for each ward area was taken from the 2015 Greater London Authority report, Ward Profiles and Atlas as were the percentage of BAME residents and population density folr each ward area, which date to 2011 and 2013 respectively. All deprivation comparisons are based on the 2015 deprivation data at ward level for 2015 as published by Public Health England. (The 2015 data does not give a London region deprivation score, therefore the median deprivation score has been used for comparison). Because of differences in ward boundaries between 2005 and 2015, the analysis is based on 483 of 659 areas (or 73%) of London boroughs.",

Despite this, staff and students across the UK are launching initiatives to support both their local community and the NHS.</p> <p>Harrogate grammar school, a comprehensive in North Yorkshire, has repurposed its design department as a PPE production line, and has made more than 1,000 visors so far.</p> <p>Its headteacher, Neil Renton, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had parents who\u2019ve been furloughed or lost jobs, who are ex-engineers, asking if they can help.

It\u2019s a bit of a blast from the past to be under that logo again, and nice to be using the visors made by the laser cutter I used at school.\u201d</p> <p>Schools are used to providing support for their more vulnerable students but since the crisis, extraordinary efforts are being made to help communities.</p> <p>At Meadowfield primary school in Leeds, almost half the students are entitled to free school meals. As well as providing hot meals for families to collect each day, the school has sent out 145 food parcels containing enough supplies for two weeks, with the aim of sustaining vulnerable families over the Easter holidays.</p> <p>The headteacher, Helen Stout, said: \u201cThe butchers we use as a supplier have offered to give us bacon and sausages, and the local grocers have offered to do some delivery for us. People have been really kind and benevolent, and it\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re doing our bit.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s become a bit of a different role.

Along with the tributes, the school set up a fundraiser for their local hospital, with a target of \u00a3500 \u2013 a figure that has been trebled in just two days.</p> <p>\u201cIt really has taken on a life of its own,\u201d said Orla Donnelly, the vice-principal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been swamped with people paying tribute to NHS workers, saying what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re so proud.

      "bodyText": "From university and school closures to A-level cancellations, young people have been deeply affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Despite this, staff and students across the UK are launching initiatives to support both their local community and the NHS. Harrogate grammar school, a comprehensive in North Yorkshire, has repurposed its design department as a PPE production line, and has made more than 1,000 visors so far. Its headteacher, Neil Renton, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had parents who\u2019ve been furloughed or lost jobs, who are ex-engineers, asking if they can help. We\u2019ve not been able to support that as we\u2019ve had so many staff members volunteer. I think it comes from an overwhelming desire from our teachers, who believe in public service, to make a difference.\u201d The visors have been sent to local hospitals, paramedics and GP surgeries, as well as alumni working on the frontline. Jack Sheriff, who left the school in 2014, is a junior doctor on a coronavirus ward in the Midlands, and received a pack of six visors last week, stamped with the school\u2019s emblem, the NHS logo, and the message \u201cwe stand together\u201d. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have contact with people from your past who helped you get to where you are, and who are still supporting you and thinking of you. It\u2019s a bit of a blast from the past to be under that logo again, and nice to be using the visors made by the laser cutter I used at school.\u201d Schools are used to providing support for their more vulnerable students but since the crisis, extraordinary efforts are being made to help communities. At Meadowfield primary school in Leeds, almost half the students are entitled to free school meals. As well as providing hot meals for families to collect each day, the school has sent out 145 food parcels containing enough supplies for two weeks, with the aim of sustaining vulnerable families over the Easter holidays. The headteacher, Helen Stout, said: \u201cThe butchers we use as a supplier have offered to give us bacon and sausages, and the local grocers have offered to do some delivery for us. People have been really kind and benevolent, and it\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re doing our bit. \u201cIt\u2019s become a bit of a different role. It\u2019s not just being head of a primary school, it\u2019s managing community spirit.\u201d Alongside staff-led directives to support pupils, students are embracing initiatives to celebrate and assist the key workers around them. At Thornhill College in Derry, many students expressed their fear and anxiety at the pandemic, many of whom had family and friends working on the frontline of the NHS. In response, the school asked for tributes to NHS staff to share on social media, and have been overwhelmed with the response. Along with the tributes, the school set up a fundraiser for their local hospital, with a target of \u00a3500 \u2013 a figure that has been trebled in just two days. \u201cIt really has taken on a life of its own,\u201d said Orla Donnelly, the vice-principal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been swamped with people paying tribute to NHS workers, saying what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re so proud. Past pupils, teachers, mums, grannies and aunts are all doing it too. \u201cOur corridors are silent and classrooms are empty, it doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s only little, small things we\u2019re doing but it\u2019s contributing to that overwhelming feeling of gratitude for the frontline.\u201d Medical students across the UK have been supporting NHS workers by babysitting for children, buying groceries, or driving them to work, as part of the National Health Supporters organisation, which receives between 50 and 100 requests for babysitting each day. Fourth-year medical student Saif Khan set up a branch in Manchester where he studies, which is now helping about 25 families in the city. He said: \u201cWhen my course got put on hold, we had free time, and I thought we could help NHS colleagues, many are our teachers and mentors. I put a post on Facebook to our medical school society and within three days I had received 400 responses to be volunteers from not only medical students, but other healthcare students like nurses and speech therapists.\u201d Other medical students have been joining the NHS prematurely, taking a combination of paid and voluntary roles in hospitals to support the strained service. \u201cI\u2019ve been at medical school for five years, and the last two years I\u2019ve been in a purely clinical setting, so I\u2019m familiar with hospitals,\u201d said Phoebe Gray, a penultimate-year medical student who signed up to work at her local hospital in Bristol on the day her exams were cancelled. \u201cIt seemed silly just to sit around. It feels like we ought to be there when hospitals need us.\u201d On her induction day, Gray was joined by scores of other trainees from across the medical profession, from mental health nurses to paramedics. She is now working as a nursing assistant in an intensive care unit, caring for a combination of cardiovascular and coronavirus patients \u2013 her first time working in a nursing role. \u201cIt\u2019s good to feel like a cog in a moving machine,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou do hear horror stories, but when you hear people clapping outside on a Thursday evening, it does make you proud. Obviously it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

The victim \u2013 who health authorities named as 15-year-old Alvanei Xirixana \u2013 died on Thursday night after spending almost a week in intensive care in Boa Vista, a Brazilian city near the Yanomami\u2019s Portugal-sized reserve. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that Xirixana was from Rehebe, a village along the Uraricoera River which wildcat goldminers use to illegally access the mineral-rich territory. The website Amaz\u00f4nia Real said the village\u2019s 70 or so members had been isolated, as well as the victim\u2019s parents, five health workers and a local pilot. It was not clear how or where the teenager, who reportedly lived outside the reserve, had become infected, although reports have suggested Yanomami leaders suspect illegal gold prospectors could be responsible for bringing coronavirus into their 26,000-strong community. The teenager\u2019s death has rekindled painful memories for the Yanomami as well as fears over the coronavirus\u2019s potential to wreak havoc on indigenous communities across South America. Carlo Zaquini, an Italian missionary who has worked with the Yanomami in Brazil for more than half a century, watched Yanomami communities brought to their knees during the 1970s and 1980s by epidemics caused by an influx of roadbuilders and gold miners. \u201cIt was like driving a bulldozer into a glass factory.

Brazilian health authorities have so far detected 24 suspected coronavirus cases among the country\u2019s 850,000-strong indigenous population, according to the official news agency, Ag\u00eancia Brasil. \u201cIndigenous people have lived with epidemics brought by the white man since the 16th century,\u201d columnist Bernardo Mello Franco wrote in Brazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper this week. \u201cNow, with the arrival of coronavirus, the threat is back.\u201d Up to 20,000 illegal goldminers called garimpeiros are believed to be working in the area inhabited by the Yanomami along Brazil\u2019s border with Venezuela. Sofia Mendon\u00e7a, a Brazilian public health physician who works with indigenous communities, said their eviction was essential if indigenous lives were to be saved. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get these people out of the [indigenous] areas the chance of contagion is much greater,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a warned. Zaquini said he hoped health authorities were better prepared to protect the Yanomami than during past epidemics, with dozens of health posts now existing within their reserve. \u201cThere are some things in the past that left me traumatized and I hope these things don\u2019t repeat themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I view the current situation with real, real pessimism.\u201d",

With Covid-19 cases in the thousands, Evers implored the lawmakers to delay in-person voting for the state\u2019s presidential primary and mail a ballot to every voter in the state.</p> <p>It was a meeting only in name. Republicans, who control 63 of 99 seats in the state assembly, sent just one member. He brought the session to order and then immediately ended it without taking up the governor\u2019s request. It took just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrickdmarley/status/1246549489671905280?s=20\">17 seconds</a>.

It took even less time.</p> <p>The legislature\u2019s defiance was a naked display of unabashed power \u2013 an elected body refusing its governor\u2019s request and turning its back on its constituents in a time of crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think many people who are aware of what\u2019s going on would say that it\u2019s anything even resembling a democracy</p> <footer> <cite>Jay Heck of Common Cause</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Republican lawmakers who didn\u2019t even bother to show up for the emergency session on Saturday knew that their re-election was guaranteed because of a successful party effort over the last 10 years to entrench themselves in power. Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting, it was a stunning series of events.</p> <p>That assault on democracy began in 2011, when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin. It was part of a national Republican effort, called Project Redmap, to capture state legislatures and, with those victories, to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district. The goal of<a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\"> R</a><a href=\"http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/\">edmap</a> was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats \u2013 a process called gerrymandering. The writer and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/millennial-politicians-unrigged-excerpt-david-daley\">David Daley</a> called Project Redmap \u201cthe most audacious political heist of modern times\u201d.</p> <p>Karl Rove, former senior adviser to George W Bush announced the redistricting effort in the Wall Street Journal, claiming, rightly, that whoever controls redistricting also controls Congress. Later, according to the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/27/ratfcked-the-influence-of-redistricting\">New Yorker</a>, when Rove addressed potential funders of Redmap in Dallas, he said \u201cPeople call us a vast rightwing conspiracy.

So far, turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016, and that is believed to benefit Republicans, who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court. It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers\u2019 last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Wisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state, and there had been fights over redistricting before. But in 2011, Republicans took it to a new level. They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol, where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts. They closely regulated who had access to the room where maps were drawn, even requiring Republican lawmakers to <a href=\"http://archive.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/lawmakers-were-made-to-pledge-secrecy-over-redistricting-9643ep0-138826854.html/\">sign agreements</a> to keep discussions about the maps secret.</p> <p>Republicans understood that they were drawing maps to maintain power far beyond that year. \u201cThe maps we pass will determine who\u2019s here 10 years from now,\u201d one memo at the time read.<strong> </strong>One assembly district belonging to Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat in the state general assembly, was cracked into four different Republican-friendly districts, Daley wrote in Ratf**ked: Why Your Vote Doesn\u2019t Count.</p> <p>The plan worked almost exactly as the mapmakers predicted. In 2012, the first election with the new map in place, Republicans won less than half the votes, but conquered 60 of the state\u2019s 99 assembly seats. The Republicans grew their majority in 2014 and 2016, despite earning just over 50% of the statewide vote.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Republicans could act brazenly without fear because gerrymandered maps make it impossible for them to lose their majority</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the Brennan Center at NYU</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt seems impervious to what happens with voters,\u201d said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt really looks like an unresponsive institution.\u201d</p> <p>Michael Li, a voting rights expert at the non-partisan Brennan Center at NYU, wrote this week: \u201cWisconsin\u2019s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats with a <em>minority</em> of the vote.</p> <p>\u201cRepublicans could act brazenly without fear of electoral blowback because gerrymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-meets-coronavirus-wisconsin\">he wrote</a>.

      "bodyText": "Less than 72 hours before polls opened in Wisconsin on 7 April, the state legislature convened to weigh an emergency request from the governor, Tony Evers. With Covid-19 cases in the thousands, Evers implored the lawmakers to delay in-person voting for the state\u2019s presidential primary and mail a ballot to every voter in the state. It was a meeting only in name. Republicans, who control 63 of 99 seats in the state assembly, sent just one member. He brought the session to order and then immediately ended it without taking up the governor\u2019s request. It took just 17 seconds. In the Republican-controlled state senate, the same thing happened, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. It took even less time. The legislature\u2019s defiance was a naked display of unabashed power \u2013 an elected body refusing its governor\u2019s request and turning its back on its constituents in a time of crisis. The Republican lawmakers who didn\u2019t even bother to show up for the emergency session on Saturday knew that their re-election was guaranteed because of a successful party effort over the last 10 years to entrench themselves in power. Even in a state at the center of some of the most hard-nosed fights over voting, it was a stunning series of events. That assault on democracy began in 2011, when Republicans drew new lines for political districts in Wisconsin. It was part of a national Republican effort, called Project Redmap, to capture state legislatures and, with those victories, to gain control over redrawing the lines of each district. The goal of Redmap was to conjure districts that would advantage Republicans and disadvantage Democrats \u2013 a process called gerrymandering. The writer and author David Daley called Project Redmap \u201cthe most audacious political heist of modern times\u201d. Karl Rove, former senior adviser to George W Bush announced the redistricting effort in the Wall Street Journal, claiming, rightly, that whoever controls redistricting also controls Congress. Later, according to the New Yorker, when Rove addressed potential funders of Redmap in Dallas, he said \u201cPeople call us a vast rightwing conspiracy. But we\u2019re really a half-assed rightwing conspiracy. Now it\u2019s time to get serious.\u201d For $1.1m \u2013 a small sum in campaign dollars \u2013 Republicans won the state legislature and went on to curb Democratic power by passing a strict voter ID law, making it harder for minorities and students to vote, and later stripped statewide elected officials of some of their authority. \u201cI don\u2019t think many people who are aware of what\u2019s going on, and are tuned into politics and government in this state, would say that it\u2019s anything even resembling a democracy,\u201d said Jay Heck, the executive director of the Wisconsin chapter of Common Cause, a government watchdog group. On Tuesday, voters risked their lives to go to the polls, waiting hours in line in Milwaukee. So far, turnout looks like it will be a fraction of what it was in 2016, and that is believed to benefit Republicans, who were seeking to maintain control of a seat on the conservative-leaning state supreme court. It was the state supreme court who voted along partisan lines to overrule Evers\u2019 last-minute effort and to allow the election to move forward. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Wisconsin had long held a reputation as a bipartisan state, and there had been fights over redistricting before. But in 2011, Republicans took it to a new level. They deployed mapmakers to the offices of a law firm across from the state capitol, where they drew different options for maps that tested how much of an advantage could be gained in districts.

Yet no matter how bad things get \u2013 and this being Babylon Berlin they often get pretty terrible \u2013 Rath and Ritter continue to support each other in one of the more touching detective partnerships on TV. It\u2019s one that has you rooting for him to overcome his demons and her to be given the recognition she deserves. Will tonight\u2019s concluding two episodes give them the happy-ish endings they desire? Given that the dark shadow of history is moving ever closer that seems unlikely. In any case, if you haven\u2019t been watching this most gripping and evocative of shows then now is the time to start. Babylon Berlin concludes Sky Atlantic, 9pm, Friday",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown is facing its biggest test yet amid rising temperatures at the start of the Easter bank holiday weekend as police mobilised to stop getaways to second homes and a government \u201cStay Home Save Lives\u201d message was targeted at younger men in particular. A multi-pronged policing response included stopping caravans and those suspected of going to second homes, patrols of urban parks and rural beauty spots, as well as Ministry of Defence police boats engaging with people on beaches through loudspeakers. Celebrities including the England rugby head coach, Eddie Jones, the TV presenter Emma Willis and the former boxer David Haye have been deployed as part of a government-sponsored social media campaign. Men aged 18 to 35, who are among the most likely to be in breach of social distancing guidelines, are understood to be a particular focus of the campaign, which also targets the broader population. As well as warning that people face being fined \u00a360 on the spot by the police if they fail to follow social distancing from strangers, the appeal strongly focuses on saving lives by reducing the impact on the NHS. There was an early indication that an Easter getaway might not materialise as images released by the location technology firm TomTom showed a dramatic fall in traffic levels for London, Manchester and Birmingham on Thursday compared with the equivalent day last year. But concerns about the coming days were heightened by new data, based on people who consented to having their movements tracked by Google, showing that visits to parks increased last weekend compared with two weeks ago. Chief nursing officer Ruth May spoke at Friday\u2019s Covid 19 Downing Street briefing of her \u201cenormous frustration\u201d at how some people were clearly not respecting social distancing or coming out in large numbers and said she had seen a \u201chorde\u201d of cyclists crossing Westminster Bridge as she made her way to the event. She added: \u201cThe reason it\u2019s also frustrating is that there are still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work.\u201d It came amid warnings that some police forces could move to an \u201cenforcement phase\u201d from a current approach of just issuing advice to people breaking rules, and the first minister of Wales said restrictions could get worse if people flout social distancing rules. Dr Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, called for people to stay at home over Easter because social distancing measures are working. \u201cPeople are complying [with the measures] in a very large majority and the impact that is having is that transmission is much, much less than it would otherwise be,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. A picture was meanwhile emerging of differing police responses, sometimes guided by their demographics and relationships with local communities. In London, where the Metropolitan police is understood to be taking a less hands-on approach, in contrast to forces in other parts of the country, action nevertheless included the closure by local authorities of a pitch and putt course in Queen\u2019s Park due to people sunbathing and gathering in groups of more than two. In Wales, where police had said that some visitors were travelling along B-roads at night to evade them - officers were investigating reports that second homeowners have been sending ahead their luggage using courier services so that if they were stopped in their car on the way they could plead innocence. Police were stopping drivers on their way south through Conway on Friday to check they were not holidaymakers heading for the Llyn Peninsula, Anglesey or any other popular tourist destination. Some English incomers still managed to get through. S4C Welsh television featured a stand-off between an angry local resident and a couple staying at an Airbnb property in Snowdonia. \u201cHow dare you come to this village and dare spread this, there\u2019s a lot of old people here and sick people.

Cumbria roads police said it had also only used \u201cwords of advice\u201d by midday on Friday, tweeting \u201cthe fells and lakes will be here when this is over\u201d. In North Yorkshire, police in Scarborough tweeted photos of a deserted seafront as well as the near-deserted A64 to Malton. In Merseyside, local officers reported New Brighton promenade was also empty. But social media also underlined the problems of policing. Cambridgeshire police deleted a tweet saying they were patrolling around supermarkets, insisting it was not monitoring what people were buying, while South Yorkshire police apologised after a video circulating on social media appeared to show an officer reprimanding a man for using his own front lawn. \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK? \u2022 This article was amended on 10 April 2020.

The internationally recognised government said on Friday that a male patient had been identified in the port town of Ash Shihr in the government-controlled province of Hadhramaut, but gave no further details other than that the man was being treated and was in a stable condition. The local governor, Farag al-Bouhsni, said on his Facebook page that the area would be placed under a partial curfew and all workers at the town\u2019s port would be quarantined for 14 days. Neighbouring al-Mahra province has closed its border with Hadhramaut, he added. Pictures of soldiers patrolling Ash Shihr\u2019s empty streets were published by Yemeni media. Health workers and aid agencies have been dreading the inevitable outbreak of Covid-19 in Yemen, where testing facilities are almost non-existent and the virus could have a uniquely dangerous impact. More than half of Yemen\u2019s hospitals and clinics have been destroyed or closed during the bitter war between Houthi rebels, who control the capital Sana\u2019a, and the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore the exiled UN-backed government. The majority of attacks on civilian infrastructure have been carried out by the coalition, which is supported militarily by the UK, US and other western nations. At least 80% of the 28-million-strong population is reliant on aid to survive in what the UN has called the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Deep poverty, dire water shortages and a lack of adequate sanitation have already made Yemen a breeding ground for malnutrition and disease, most notably the worst cholera outbreaks in modern history. In an unprecedented step designed to show its awareness of the threat posed to Yemen by the pandemic, Riyadh began a unilateral two-week ceasefire on humanitarian grounds on Thursday. If it sticks, it would be the first nationwide halt to the fighting after several recent failed attempts, but the move has been met with scepticism by Houthi leaders. \u201cWe consider the ceasefire a political and media manoeuvre,\u201d the Houthi spokesman Mohamed Abdel-Salam told Al Jazeera. Fierce fighting in al-Jawf governorate between rebel forces and militias loyal to the government, which has displaced tens of thousands of people, has sporadically continued since the ceasefire was announced. A rival Houthi offer of a ceasefire is highly conditional, and appears to apply only to Saudi Arabia, and not the Yemeni government. Martin Griffiths, the UN\u2019s special envoy to Yemen, said on Friday that his office was in regular contact with both sides \u201con reaching agreements on a nationwide ceasefire, humanitarian and economic measures to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people\u201d. The ceasefire announcement was cautiously welcomed by a consortium of more than 50 NGOs working in Yemen, including Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Tearfund and the International Rescue Committee. \u201cWe urge all parties to the conflict in Yemen to immediately halt fighting, to implement a ceasefire on the ground without delay, to release all detainees and those forcibly disappeared, and to work with the UN special envoy to urgently restart comprehensive and inclusive political negotiations to end the conflict,\u201d the group said. Also on Friday, the UN\u2019s World Food Programme said it was being forced to halve aid to Houthi-controlled Yemen because of a funding crisis. The UN agency is feeding more than 12 million Yemenis a month, 80% of whom live in Houthi territory. From next week, deliveries will only reach families every other month, instead of monthly.

      "bodyText": "If any lingering doubts remained, Tuesday should have erased them all. Republicans will weaponize anything \u2013 even in-person voting during a deadly pandemic \u2013 to maintain power, avoid accountability and bend electoral rules in their favor. Worse, the US supreme court will have their back. Make no mistake: the deliberate chaos and unthinkable images from Wisconsin on Tuesday \u2013 Americans on line for hours, wearing homemade masks, risking a gruesome respiratory disease to exercise their right to vote \u2013 wasn\u2019t just a warning sign for November\u2019s elections. It was Republicans\u2019 dress rehearsal. It\u2019s scarcely 200 days until the real show. The coronavirus has already pushed more than a dozen states to postpone primaries and forced fearful Ohio and Wisconsin governors into court the day before an election, desperate to avoid worsening a public health crisis. It\u2019s quite likely that the virus will threaten in-person voting in many states and cities in November as well. That\u2019s why a growing non-partisan chorus has called for expanding vote-by-mail options this fall. It can be done; five states already conduct all their elections this way and every state allows some level of mail-in voting. It doesn\u2019t favor either party \u2013 just ask Republicans in Utah and Colorado. It\u2019s safer during a pandemic, but also secure: a study of hundreds of millions of votes in Oregon, ever since it became the first to adopt all-mail elections, found fewer than 15 fraudulent ballots cast over more than a decade. Republicans, however, have fought efforts to fund expanded voting options this fall. President Trump recently told Fox &amp; Friends: \u201cIf you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d On Wednesday, he tweeted that vote by mail creates \u201ctremendous potential\u201d for voter fraud and mused that \u201cfor whatever reason, [it] doesn\u2019t work out well for Republicans\u201d. Georgia\u2019s state house speaker knows that reason, opposing it because it \u201cwill certainly drive up turnout\u201d and \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives\u201d. But while the quiet part sometimes comes out louder than expected, most of the Republican party\u2019s anti-vote-by-mail excuses are ludicrous. If the president\u2019s intention is to conjure phoney visions of voter fraud, others hope to simply slow-walk reform. When Senate Democrats attempted to add election protection safeguards to the first coronavirus stimulus package, the Republican senator John Barrasso insisted they \u201chave no place in an emergency rescue package for the American people\u201d. Election assistance funding, sniffed his colleague Marsha Blackburn, \u201chas nothing to do with Covid-19\u201d.

When Robin Vos, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican assembly speaker, tried to deny it, he wore a mask and full personal protective gear.

      "body": "<p>Recently \u2013 oh, no particular reason \u2013 I\u2019ve found myself returning to the ancient philosophical idea known as <a href=\"https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2017/07/24/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-dichotomy-of-control/\" title=\"\">\u201cthe dichotomy of control\u201d</a>. \u201cSome things are within our power, while others are not,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epictetus/\" title=\"\">Epictetus</a>, the Greek Stoic, in a line you\u2019d be justified in dismissing as obvious, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that we ignore its ramifications every day, and suffer as a result. In every situation, there are things we can control and things we can\u2019t, and struggling to control the latter is a recipe for anxiety and stress. \u201cPartial control\u201d, like the kind I have over my three-year-old\u2019s behaviour, can be broken down into the two: I usually have total control over what I say or do; and none, technically, over how he reacts.</p> <p>It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s echoed widely elsewhere, for example in the <a href=\"https://www.beliefnet.com/prayers/protestant/addiction/serenity-prayer.aspx\" title=\"\">Serenity Prayer</a>, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, and in an <a href=\"https://fakebuddhaquotes.com/if-the-problem-can-be-solved-why-worry/\" title=\"\">observation with Buddhist origins</a>: if a problem can be fixed, there\u2019s no need to worry about it; and if it can\u2019t be fixed, well, why bother worrying?</p> <p>Which is fine so far as it goes: it\u2019s surely true that <em>if</em> I could manage never to fret about things I can\u2019t affect, <em>then</em> life would proceed serenely. But it strikes me as a major weakness of Stoicism \u2013 at least in its rediscovered, newly fashionable form \u2013 to assume that seeing the truth in an insight like this can bring peace of mind by itself. Among the many things I can\u2019t control, it turns out, are my own emotions. What Sigmund Freud and his successors brought to psychology was the understanding that conscious thought might be only a tiny sliver of what\u2019s going on in the mind as a whole. So if a global pandemic triggers my particular anxieties around death, or illness, or job security \u2013 anxieties formed over decades, and embedded in my unconscious \u2013 it\u2019s radically insufficient to try to think myself into realising they\u2019re futile. If pointlessness caused things to vanish, <a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/2987/popsockets-are-a-sin?zd=2&amp;zi=ygbznp7r\" title=\"\">Pop</a><a href=\"https://theoutline.com/post/2987/popsockets-are-a-sin?zd=2&amp;zi=ygbznp7r\" title=\"\">Sockets</a> that people stick on the backs of their phones wouldn\u2019t exist. Yet they do.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, in my experience, the dichotomy of control is best approached as a preliminary tool. You use it to distinguish what you can control from what you can\u2019t \u2013 but peace of mind arrives only when you begin taking action in the realm of the former. (As the saying goes, you can\u2019t think yourself into new ways of acting, but you can act yourself into new ways of thinking.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/13/would-a-society-of-moral-saints-be-a-worse-place-to-live\">Would a society of moral saints be a worse place to live? | Oliver Burkeman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s often less a matter of realising how little control you have than how much.

      "bodyText": "Recently \u2013 oh, no particular reason \u2013 I\u2019ve found myself returning to the ancient philosophical idea known as \u201cthe dichotomy of control\u201d. \u201cSome things are within our power, while others are not,\u201d wrote Epictetus, the Greek Stoic, in a line you\u2019d be justified in dismissing as obvious, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that we ignore its ramifications every day, and suffer as a result. In every situation, there are things we can control and things we can\u2019t, and struggling to control the latter is a recipe for anxiety and stress. \u201cPartial control\u201d, like the kind I have over my three-year-old\u2019s behaviour, can be broken down into the two: I usually have total control over what I say or do; and none, technically, over how he reacts. It\u2019s an idea that\u2019s echoed widely elsewhere, for example in the Serenity Prayer, associated with Alcoholics Anonymous, and in an observation with Buddhist origins: if a problem can be fixed, there\u2019s no need to worry about it; and if it can\u2019t be fixed, well, why bother worrying? Which is fine so far as it goes: it\u2019s surely true that if I could manage never to fret about things I can\u2019t affect, then life would proceed serenely. But it strikes me as a major weakness of Stoicism \u2013 at least in its rediscovered, newly fashionable form \u2013 to assume that seeing the truth in an insight like this can bring peace of mind by itself. Among the many things I can\u2019t control, it turns out, are my own emotions. What Sigmund Freud and his successors brought to psychology was the understanding that conscious thought might be only a tiny sliver of what\u2019s going on in the mind as a whole. So if a global pandemic triggers my particular anxieties around death, or illness, or job security \u2013 anxieties formed over decades, and embedded in my unconscious \u2013 it\u2019s radically insufficient to try to think myself into realising they\u2019re futile. If pointlessness caused things to vanish, PopSockets that people stick on the backs of their phones wouldn\u2019t exist. Yet they do. That\u2019s why, in my experience, the dichotomy of control is best approached as a preliminary tool. You use it to distinguish what you can control from what you can\u2019t \u2013 but peace of mind arrives only when you begin taking action in the realm of the former. (As the saying goes, you can\u2019t think yourself into new ways of acting, but you can act yourself into new ways of thinking.) It\u2019s often less a matter of realising how little control you have than how much. You can\u2019t stop the worldwide spread of a disease, but you can do plenty to stop it spreading through you. You can\u2019t choose physical fitness, but you can choose to eat well, and to move. You can\u2019t choose to make it through today\u2019s to-do list, but you can choose to spend the next three hours diligently attacking it. And so on. There\u2019s a deep kind of freedom to be found here, even in the presence of severe external constraints. Your goals shift from external ones, about imposing certain changes on the world, to internal ones, about how you plan to act upon the world. These are objectives you can aim at wholeheartedly, fully expecting to accomplish \u2013 secure in the knowledge that they don\u2019t require the cooperation of forces whose assistance you\u2019re in no position to compel. Read this Massimo Pigliucci and Gregory Lopez offer ancient insights for thriving in a world you can\u2019t control in their book, Live Like a Stoic.",

Shortly before the Masters, Woods knocked Rory McIlroy out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/30/tiger-woods-beats-rory-mcilroy-to-reach-wgc-dell-match-play-quarters\" title=\"\">WGC Match Play in Texas</a>. \u201cHe played very well,\u201d says McIlroy. \u201cI could see him as one of the Masters favourites on the back of what I saw there. He was driving the ball better. With how good his iron play is, if he drives it well he will always have a great chance at Augusta.\u201d Woods had Georgia on his mind all right. \u201cAugusta started probably back in October, November,\u201d he said last February of his Masters planning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb6085f814d85137337620c6a0ce53aead6d11cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb6085f814d85137337620c6a0ce53aead6d11cf/0_94_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Going into the final round of the Masters in 2019, the Open champion Francesco Molinari (right) topped the leaderboard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Going into the final round of the Masters in 2019, the Open champion Francesco Molinari (right) topped the leaderboard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You cannot win the Masters on Thursday or Friday but you can sure as hell lose it. A 70 and a 68 had Woods one stroke from the halfway lead, held by a quintet including Scott, Molinari and Koepka. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much conversation with Tiger during those first two rounds,\u201d says Jon Rahm, one of his playing partners. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t unusual at a major.\u201d</p> <p>A Saturday pairing with Poulter led people to highlight the \u201cnew\u201d Tiger. In 2018 the duo were also third-round companions but nowhere near Masters contention. \u201cHe shot five under, I shot four under and I played great,\u201d says the Englishman. \u201cAt that point I was thinking: \u2018If I can have another day like that I might have a chance.\u2019 He was ready, he had all the shots and was pretty damn good. He had more of his game together than a year earlier, by a mile. There was a buzz out there all day Saturday. Playing with him was fun, but you could sense he was lurking.\u201d</p> <p>It felt as if 99% of the Sunday gallery \u2013 10 deep in places \u2013 were manning the 1st fairway as Woods, Molinari and Finau appeared on the tee. By midday, Woods strode to the 10th trailing the Italian by one. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt this, if I\u2019m within six of the lead starting the back nine on Sunday, I\u2019ve got a shot at it,\u201d Woods says.</p> <p>Poulter had Koepka and Webb Simpson for company in the penultimate group. Koepka\u2019s threat to Woods was obvious: the Floridian arrived at the 83rd Masters having won on two of his previous three major outings.

The Italian, who brushed Woods aside en route to Open Championship glory the previous July, shared fifth from such a commanding earlier position. \u201cHaving the Claret Jug and winning a major not long before already told me I was able to do it,\u201d Molinari says. \u201cIn some ways it made the disappointment a little bit bigger; that time I wasn\u2019t able to close it out.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott can reel off Koepka\u2019s closing stretch as if it were yesterday. \u201cEagles 13, great chance at 14 and left it short, 15 I thought he had holed it for eagle, 16 the ball just stayed above the slope ...\u201d The key, though, is that Koepka was \u201cright back in it\u201d. Woods delivered a crushing blow to all the young pretenders with a glorious for-the-ages tee shot at the par three 16th, almost resulting in a hole-in-one. The Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, in the gallery directly behind Woods, was among those caught in the moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/09/sports-quiz-masters-golf-augusta\">Golf quiz: how much do you know about the Masters?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elliott adds: \u201cWe were on the 17th tee when Tiger\u2019s shot came in.

      "bodyText": "The propensity of the Masters to deliver moments in time is beyond golfing parallel. They needn\u2019t always arrive at the tournament\u2019s 72nd hole. If the Hogan Bridge, Butler Cabin and Magnolia Lane define Augusta National, its celebrated tournament also has reference points throughout the sprawling acreage. When Ian Poulter is taken back to the Masters Sunday of 2019, he recalls his view from the 13th tee. Poulter was one of a quartet from the tournament\u2019s closing two groups \u2013 each consisting of three players, unusually \u2013 to find water at the 12th. Behind him Tiger Woods played safe on the world\u2019s most famous par three and found dry land. \u201cI looked across as he hit his shot into the middle of the green and from that point he had control of what he was doing,\u201d says Poulter. \u201cIt was inevitable.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d was a 15th major championship, Woods\u2019s first since 2008 and a conquest for which words barely deliver justice. The intervening 11 years had witnessed adultery shame, fitness woes and a form slump that triggered the widespread depiction of a fallen hero. Tremors reverberated beyond sport as this instantly recognisable figure conjured the ultimate redemption tale amid wild, uncharacteristic celebration. Courtesy of a win in 2013, Adam Scott has automatic entry to one of sport\u2019s most exclusive spaces: the champions\u2019 locker room at Augusta National. Having signed off with a 73 for a share of 18th, 12 months ago, Scott seized an unexpected opportunity. The Australian discovered \u201cseven or eight\u201d past Masters champions gathered round a television. \u201cI came in having finished and they were all sitting there,\u201d says Scott. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is cool.\u2019 I mean, you don\u2019t all hang out that much. You don\u2019t get that group of people together very often. There was definitely a fraternity feeling. Everyone was very excited that Tiger was doing what he was doing. \u201cAs I was finishing my round you got a sense, as he was taking the lead on the back nine, that something special could be happening. There\u2019s always an electricity in the air at Augusta on a Sunday, but then when Tiger or certain people are in the mix there\u2019s something more. All of us were definitely cheering hard for Tiger to win. You just had that sense it was a significant moment in the sport again.\u201d This was no standard Masters denouement even before Woods set pulses racing. Storms forecast for Augusta ensured early tee times and those three-balls as opposed to pairs. Woods started day four two shots adrift of Francesco Molinari, tied with Tony Finau and one ahead of Brooks Koepka. \u201cWe had never really been in contention on the last day of the Masters so it didn\u2019t feel \u2018different\u2019 for us,\u201d says Ricky Elliott, Koepka\u2019s caddie, of a dawn alarm call.

Shortly before the Masters, Woods knocked Rory McIlroy out of the WGC Match Play in Texas. \u201cHe played very well,\u201d says McIlroy. \u201cI could see him as one of the Masters favourites on the back of what I saw there.

However, how do you even begin to replace a singer and lyricist as charismatic and gifted as the subsequently legendary 23-year-old?</p> <p>Shrewdly, they didn\u2019t try. Sumner stepped into the breach as singer, while Morris\u2019s girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert \u2013 who had already filled in for Curtis on guitar at a gig at Eric\u2019s in Liverpool after he hurt his hand \u2013 was drafted in on guitar and keyboards. This minimised the disruption to the chemistry that produced Unknown Pleasures and Closer \u2013 two of the finest albums of the post-punk era \u2013 and meant they could become a thoroughly reinvented band, albeit one that still carried Joy Division\u2019s heart and soul.</p> <p>Movement, the 1981 debut, didn\u2019t quite shake off that band\u2019s long shadow, but with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, New Order found their sound. It\u2019s the heavenly hum of guitars and electronics, agony and ecstasy, sunlight bursting through the clouds \u2013 and one of the great pioneering albums of the 80s.</p> <p>Here, the Salford/Macclesfield quartet cast off post-punk gloom, head towards the dancefloor and embrace pop. The change is apparent from the opening song, the mighty Age of Consent, as Peter Hook\u2019s euphoric, twangy bass riff leads into a keyboard- and guitar-soaked melodrama. However, PCL is full to bursting with avenues to explore. Side one careers from the mournful We All Stand to the giddy electro-pop of The Village, a distant cousin of 1982\u2019s similarly sequencer-driven single, Temptation. 5-8-6 is electronic dancefloor pop from the same well as Blue Monday. That much-loved 80s classic isn\u2019t on the album (neither New Order nor Joy Division put singles on albums back then), but teed up PCL for a wider audience by becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time.</p> <p>Side two of the album is slightly more statuesque. There\u2019s the shimmering majesty of Your Silent Face (initially titled Kraftwerk 1, in homage to the German electronic predecessors) , the tense Ultraviolence, the electro-vocoder odyssey Ecstasy and sublime, melancholy Leave Me Alone, which shows they could still make new shapes from guitars and drums. It\u2019s a record full of possible futures \u2013 for New Order and for pop \u2013 and the band\u2019s defining album is the perfect place to start.</p> <h2>The three albums to check out next</h2> <p><strong>Low-Life (1985)</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3XW6NLILqo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x3XW6NLILqo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Blue Monday gave New Order a mainstream audience without entirely shedding the army of Joy Division/post-punk era fans (myself included), who wore long overcoats, pretended to read Dostoevsky, scoured record fairs for obscure bootlegs and swapped tapes of soundchecks with their mates. Low-Life (1985) carries off the tricky feat of catering for the different camps of fans. As with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, it unveils a different style with virtually every track. Opener Love Vigilantes \u2013 about a returning soldier \u2013 is one of the band\u2019s great guitar pop songs.

      "bodyText": "The album to start with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies (1983) After Joy Division singer Ian Curtis took his own life on 18 May 1980, there was never much doubt among the surviving three members \u2013 guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris \u2013 over whether they\u2019d carry on. However, how do you even begin to replace a singer and lyricist as charismatic and gifted as the subsequently legendary 23-year-old? Shrewdly, they didn\u2019t try. Sumner stepped into the breach as singer, while Morris\u2019s girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert \u2013 who had already filled in for Curtis on guitar at a gig at Eric\u2019s in Liverpool after he hurt his hand \u2013 was drafted in on guitar and keyboards. This minimised the disruption to the chemistry that produced Unknown Pleasures and Closer \u2013 two of the finest albums of the post-punk era \u2013 and meant they could become a thoroughly reinvented band, albeit one that still carried Joy Division\u2019s heart and soul. Movement, the 1981 debut, didn\u2019t quite shake off that band\u2019s long shadow, but with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, New Order found their sound. It\u2019s the heavenly hum of guitars and electronics, agony and ecstasy, sunlight bursting through the clouds \u2013 and one of the great pioneering albums of the 80s. Here, the Salford/Macclesfield quartet cast off post-punk gloom, head towards the dancefloor and embrace pop. The change is apparent from the opening song, the mighty Age of Consent, as Peter Hook\u2019s euphoric, twangy bass riff leads into a keyboard- and guitar-soaked melodrama. However, PCL is full to bursting with avenues to explore. Side one careers from the mournful We All Stand to the giddy electro-pop of The Village, a distant cousin of 1982\u2019s similarly sequencer-driven single, Temptation. 5-8-6 is electronic dancefloor pop from the same well as Blue Monday. That much-loved 80s classic isn\u2019t on the album (neither New Order nor Joy Division put singles on albums back then), but teed up PCL for a wider audience by becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time. Side two of the album is slightly more statuesque. There\u2019s the shimmering majesty of Your Silent Face (initially titled Kraftwerk 1, in homage to the German electronic predecessors) , the tense Ultraviolence, the electro-vocoder odyssey Ecstasy and sublime, melancholy Leave Me Alone, which shows they could still make new shapes from guitars and drums. It\u2019s a record full of possible futures \u2013 for New Order and for pop \u2013 and the band\u2019s defining album is the perfect place to start. The three albums to check out next Low-Life (1985) Blue Monday gave New Order a mainstream audience without entirely shedding the army of Joy Division/post-punk era fans (myself included), who wore long overcoats, pretended to read Dostoevsky, scoured record fairs for obscure bootlegs and swapped tapes of soundchecks with their mates. Low-Life (1985) carries off the tricky feat of catering for the different camps of fans. As with Power, Corruption &amp; Lies, it unveils a different style with virtually every track. Opener Love Vigilantes \u2013 about a returning soldier \u2013 is one of the band\u2019s great guitar pop songs. The Joy Division end of the band\u2019s sound is represented by the driving, post-punky Sunrise, a brooding This Time of Night and beautifully, well, elegiac Elegia, an aural memorial to Curtis that appeared years later in an 18-minute version. The newlyacquired Saturday-night-beer-monster fanbase could wobble along to Sub-Culture and Face Up. Possibly best of all, hit single The Perfect Kiss utilises state of the art Emulator sampling technology to produce a dancefloor killer featuring frog croaks. Technique (1988) Peter Hook\u2019s book Substance is full of eyebrow-rocketing tales of how New Order recorded their acid-house-era classic in Ibiza, leaving behind a trail of trashed cars, hedonism and fracturing relationships. A battle between the band\u2019s rock and electronic camps over how the album should sound hinted at the growing schisms that led to a 90s hiatus and eventually Hook\u2019s estrangement from the band. Given all this \u2013 and the fact that partying took priority over recording until they relocated to Peter Gabriel\u2019s Real World back in the UK \u2013 it\u2019s remarkable that they managed to come back with much at all, never mind such a fantastic album. Technique assimilates Balearic beats but is recognisably, inimitably New Order. The band\u2019s most dancefloor album starts off with the acid-house-flavoured Fine Time and ends with the supernaturally melancholy Vanishing Point, while the rest of the album careers from guitar pop (Run, Dream Attack) to plangent electronic pop (Round and Round, Mr Disco), the sound of summer adventures, Ibizan clubs and long, reflective sunsets. Brotherhood (1986) Power, Corruption &amp; Lies and Low-Life defined New Order as a band who were able to weave together guitars and electronics, a format used by countless bands today. However, Brotherhood separates the two sides again, virtually entirely, with a guitar/drums side and an electronic side. Brian Eno had done something similar with the very different halves of Before and After Science, while David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d divided neatly into rock music and synthesiser stuff.

      "bodyText": "Her recipes are sometimes tricky and even alarming. Who has a copper turbot kettle? How do you crush chestnuts through a sieve with a pestle? Who makes macaroni cheese with no sauce? \u201cIt is quite dry,\u201d admitted Kathy Hipperson, a historical interpreter who plays the country house Victorian cook Avis Crocombe. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s not horrible, it\u2019s different.\u201d Hipperson is the front person for English Heritage\u2019s online historical cooking demonstrations, one of a number of online cookery programmes that have attracted huge interest in the last few weeks. English Heritage\u2019s offering alone has gone from having a small dedicated following to almost 2m views since mid-March. \u201cPeople are craving something different to watch I think,\u201d said Hipperson. \u201cThey want to take their mind off the situation and try something new. I would definitely encourage people to try the recipes.\u201d English Heritage is not alone in seeing a surge in interest in online cookery demonstrations. Nearly 5.5 million people have this week watched Oprah Winfrey on her Instagram page make spaghetti carbonara \u201cfor the first time\u201d after she watched Jamie Oliver on YouTube. On Thursday, Winfrey, in California, and Oliver, in Essex, teamed up for an Instagram live stream to make his Singapore-style fried rice together, a recipe made from using up scraps of veg and any bacon, sausage or frozen prawns you can find. Many chefs, stuck in their real kitchen rather than their work one, are also taking to Instagram. Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich, the founders of Honey &amp; Co, have started their #honeyandcoathome series from their south London home offering a flourless chocolate cake for Passover and hot cross non-denominational buns. Massimo Bottura, the Italian multiple-Michelin award winning chef, is livestreaming his family dinner prep every night. His toasted almond and saba ice cream with a pistachio sauce is not exactly cupboard leftovers but still had more than 200,000 views. Food historian and writer Angela Clutton will on Saturday at 1pm be cooking lamb chops and veg from her kitchen as part of a daily Instagram live series created by Borough Market in London. \u201cThere is a lot going on and people have been just so fast in putting these things together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because food is always such a great connector, it brings people together and somehow it is still managing to do that even when we can\u2019t actually be together. I have to say I find it incredibly reassuring.\u201d Crocombe was the real cook at Audley End House in Essex between 1880 and 1884, serving Lord and Lady Braybrooke and their guests. Hipperson has been playing her for more than a decade, part of a team of interpreters putting on live demonstrations in the kitchens as well as the YouTube videos which have now taken off in such a big way. Hipperson said Crocombe had become a phenomenon in the same way people love Downton Abbey. \u201cShe was a real person, working in the kitchen, and people can relate to her \u2026 she\u2019s not a monarch. \u201cI make her as I imagine she would be, quite stern but clearly loving her work. She is quite joyful to watch I think. The fact that we are cooking real historical recipes is a factor too.\u201d The recipes include hearty soups and ice cream made from staple ingredients. Others are a bit more of a performance. For example, turbot \u00e0 l\u2019anglaise sees Crocombe advising us to get a scullery maid to wash and pat dry the fish. She then rubs it with half a lemon, puts it in a turbot kettle and adds water. Once that\u2019s on the heat, prepare a sauce with some butter, diced lobster and pounded roe and get a kitchen maid to push it through a sieve. Hipperson admitted US audiences \u201creally did not like\u201d the Victorian macaroni cheese recipe which is made from pasta, cheese, breadcrumbs and butter. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get much further away from mac and cheese.\u201d Others are much more straightforward, said Hipperson, such as the queen drop biscuits, cheese seftons and, this weekend for Easter, saffron buns. \u201cSome of them are trickier, like the apple dumplings, but they are just divine.\u201d Avis Crocombe is one part of a much bigger History at Home hub launched this week by English Heritage, an online resource of videos, podcasts, articles and activity sheets. All its properties are closed but Matt Thompson, head collections curator, hopes the hub will provide distraction and comfort during the lockdown. \u201cFor me, it is a 21st-century cabinet of curiosities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all in one place and we are planning new content. It really helps, I think, to remember that there is so much more outside our own four walls, it is all still there.\u201d How to make saffron buns \u2013 the Victorian way Ingredients: Makes 10-12 buns Flour \u2013 250g/9 oz/2 cups Sugar \u2013 55g/2 oz /1\u20443 cup Salt \u2013 a pinch Yeast \u2013 4g dried or 10g fresh Milk \u2013 90ml/3 fl oz/\u00bd cup, slightly warmed Eggs \u2013 1 egg, lightly beaten Currants \u2013 55g Spices/cinnamon, cloves and mace \u2013 a pinch of each Lemon \u2013 the zest of \u00bd lemon Caraway seeds \u2013 (optional) \u00bc tsp Butter \u2013 30g/1 oz/\u00bc stick Lard \u2013 30g/1 oz/1 tbsp Saffron \u2013 pinch, soaked for 2 hours in 2 tsp warm milk To glaze: 1 egg Pinch of salt 1 tbsp milk Method: First, make a basic bread dough. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, egg and yeast together with enough milk to make a soft, but not sticky dough.

You wonder what\u2019s behind the government\u2019s refusal to give a straight answer along the lines of \u201cmany weeks more\u201d. An aversion to spoilers? Maybe it welcomes the distraction. On Thursday, Dominic Raab intoned that this crisis had \u201cmade us think long and hard about who the key workers are in our lives\u201d. Not that hard, as it turned out. Also on Thursday, the government sneaked out its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmdfoster/status/1248253551689773057\">points-based immigration planning</a>, which ranks many of the same \u201cessential workers\u201d somewhere between convicted foreign sex killers and people who tick yes to the visa inquiry \u201cHave you ever been involved in preparing an act of terrorism?\u201d. Or to put it the way the official Home Office guidance prefers: \u201cThere will not be an immigration route specifically for those who do not meet the skills or salary threshold for the skilled worker route.\u201d Forgive me if even mentioning the people getting us through it constitutes some kind of crisis faux pas. For some, ignoring the realities low-paid nurses or delivery workers face is key to the spirit of national togetherness.</p> <p>One of the unwritten conventions of British public life is that no matter how ill-advised or ill-prepared any military action we\u2019ve committed to is, once it starts, you get behind the troops. The government keeps telling us this current crisis is a war, so in the spirit of speaking their preferred language, I guess the troops are us. Not them: they\u2019re the generals. So let me be clear that I\u2019m very much getting behind us, and thank us for our service.</p> <p>But when we\u2019re seeing 1,000 casualties a day - just as we did in Italy while our generals were still deciding not to act \u2013 and grave problems with testing, and NHS staff are crying out daily for the right kit, it\u2019s certainly worth considering whether the troops were led into an ambush. The people dying right now are likely to have caught the disease in the middle of last month (between 11 and 21 March), when the government\u2019s advisers reportedly surmised the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-path-speci/special-report-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm-idUSKBN21P1VF\">British people would never accept a lockdown</a>. It\u2019s \u2013 how to put this blandly enough not to offend the free-speech snowflakes out there? \u2013 OK to wonder if we might have expected better.</p> <p>Instead, though, there\u2019s a sort of meth-assisted Boys\u2019 Own quality to some of the more obsessive lines of inquiry. This week, there was some focus on whether Dominic Raab had written the so-called \u201cletters of last resort\u201d, replacing the versions of them Boris Johnson wrote when he took office, which contain instructions for who takes military charge in the event of the nuclear obliteration of the government. It\u2019s an interesting question, isn\u2019t it? A thousand people are dying every day and some members of the lobby would very much like to know if Mr Raab has written to a submarine captain.</p> <p>Then again, given the seismic collapse in ad revenues, it looks like all of us journalists are going to need to retrain into different careers after this, so it\u2019s probably good to showcase alternative skill sets. On this evidence, a few would make excellent submarine crew, because they seem pretty relaxed about waiting to find out what the fuck happened until six months after the event.</p> <p>Maybe at some subconscious level, people thought this level of fatality was something that just couldn\u2019t happen in the UK, like winning the Eurovision song contest or becoming a police state. It\u2019s funny how quickly you go from the old certainties to mildly watching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alain_Tolhurst/status/1248261411303759872\">Thursday\u2019s clip of the Northants police chief</a> threatening to get his officers to search the contents of people\u2019s shopping baskets for items he deems non-essential. What can you say? In the spirit of national togetherness, my main takeout from this is that we should really commit to a Eurovision entry next year.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The government keeps telling us this current crisis is a war, so in the spirit of speaking their preferred language, I guess the troops are us. Not them: they\u2019re the generals. So let me be clear that I\u2019m very much getting behind us, and thank us for our service. But when we\u2019re seeing 1,000 casualties a day - just as we did in Italy while our generals were still deciding not to act \u2013 and grave problems with testing, and NHS staff are crying out daily for the right kit, it\u2019s certainly worth considering whether the troops were led into an ambush. The people dying right now are likely to have caught the disease in the middle of last month (between 11 and 21 March), when the government\u2019s advisers reportedly surmised the British people would never accept a lockdown. It\u2019s \u2013 how to put this blandly enough not to offend the free-speech snowflakes out there? \u2013 OK to wonder if we might have expected better. Instead, though, there\u2019s a sort of meth-assisted Boys\u2019 Own quality to some of the more obsessive lines of inquiry. This week, there was some focus on whether Dominic Raab had written the so-called \u201cletters of last resort\u201d, replacing the versions of them Boris Johnson wrote when he took office, which contain instructions for who takes military charge in the event of the nuclear obliteration of the government. It\u2019s an interesting question, isn\u2019t it? A thousand people are dying every day and some members of the lobby would very much like to know if Mr Raab has written to a submarine captain. Then again, given the seismic collapse in ad revenues, it looks like all of us journalists are going to need to retrain into different careers after this, so it\u2019s probably good to showcase alternative skill sets. On this evidence, a few would make excellent submarine crew, because they seem pretty relaxed about waiting to find out what the fuck happened until six months after the event. Maybe at some subconscious level, people thought this level of fatality was something that just couldn\u2019t happen in the UK, like winning the Eurovision song contest or becoming a police state. It\u2019s funny how quickly you go from the old certainties to mildly watching Thursday\u2019s clip of the Northants police chief threatening to get his officers to search the contents of people\u2019s shopping baskets for items he deems non-essential. What can you say? In the spirit of national togetherness, my main takeout from this is that we should really commit to a Eurovision entry next year. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

The University of Oxford study aims to track the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children and young people. Its earliest findings suggest younger children (aged four to 10) are more worried than those in the 11-16 age group. The results are based on the responses of 1,500 parents who have so far signed up to the Co-SPACE (Covid-19 Supporting Parents, Adolescents and Children in Epidemics) survey and indicate that more than half of younger children (53%) are worried about family and friends catching the disease. A third of parents (33%) who took part in the survey said their child was worried they would catch Covid-19 themselves, nearly a quarter (23%) of the youngest children were frightened of infecting someone else and more than a third (36%) were anxious about missing school work. Almost a fifth (17%) of parents said their younger children were afraid to leave the house and 19% said their children were worried the family would not have enough food and other essential items during the outbreak, after news coverage of panic buying and empty supermarket shelves. Parents of children in the younger age bracket also said their children were worried about the amount of money coming into the household (16%), and about the long-term impact of the disease outbreak on the future (15%). According to parents\u2019 perceptions, their older children are significantly less worried, though researchers point out it can be hard for parents to know what their adolescent children are feeling, in contrast with younger children who may express their fears more openly to their parents. Less than 2% of 11- to 16-year-olds are worried about the long-term impact of the crisis on their job prospects and the economy, according to their parents; 5% are worried about money coming in; 8% are afraid to leave the house, and one in 10 (11%) are worried about not enough food. Older children are worried about their families, with two out of five (41%) frightened that friends and relatives will catch the disease; just over a fifth (22%) are worried they will catch Covid-19 themselves and one in 10 (11%) are anxious they could pass the infection to someone else. Cathy Creswell, professor of developmental clinical psychology at Oxford and one of the study leads, said: \u201cClearly [children] are aware there\u2019s a threat in the environment.

      "bodyText": "The rise of Peter Navarro \u2013 the man put in charge of marshalling emergency US production of medical equipment in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 is in many ways a classic story of the Trump era. The 70-year-old White House trade adviser was first recruited by Trump because he wrote a string of books about the Chinese strategic threat \u2013 one called Death by China \u2013 despite having spent almost no time in the country and having no grasp of the language. Five of Navarro\u2019s books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views. Navarro made headlines in the past week by challenging Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and the public face of the US scientific community\u2019s race to contain Covid-19 \u2013 in a showdown in the White House situation room over the merits of an experimental drug. When asked later why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, Navarro replied: \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\u201d People who have worked closely with Navarro agree he is undoubtedly bright. He holds a PhD in economics from Harvard. But there is nothing in his career to date that suggests he has the credentials or experience to manage the state intervention necessary to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country will need over the course of this pandemic. Before coming to the White House, Navarro was a west coast academic economist with views on trade far outside the American mainstream and a failed political career behind him, have lost five elections and won none in his adoptive home town of San Diego. His former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics. \u201cOn one level it\u2019s amusing but on another level, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d added Remer, a San Diego political consultant. Navarro\u2019s appearance in the Trump camp during the 2016 presidential campaign came as a shock to those who knew him from his days in San Diego politics.

The government-commissioned study, reportedly the first of its kind in continental Europe, was led by the polling company Sora, which is known for projecting election results, in cooperation with the Red Cross, the Medical University of Vienna, and other institutions. The study made it possible to estimate the prevalence of acute coronavirus infections in Austria among those not in hospital at the beginning of April, and was designed to provide a clearer picture of the total number of infections, given gaps in testing. The research, if replicated and confirmed elsewhere, would appear to scotch hopes of countries being remotely close to relying on \u201cherd immunity\u201d \u2013 where enough of the population is exposed to the virus to build up a combined immunity \u2013 as a viable policy option. The study stands in contrast to controversial modelling by researchers at Oxford University who, in one scenario they examined, suggested most people in the UK might already have been infected with Covid-19. The co-founder of Sora, Christoph Hofinger, told a news conference: \u201cBased on this study, we believe that 0.33% of the population in Austria was acutely infected in early April.\u201d Given the margin of error, the figure was 95% likely to be between 0.12% and 0.76%.

However, researchers, speaking at a press conference to release the results, said the study provided only a \u201csnapshot\u201d and did not account for asymptomatic infections, or people who were immune. \u201cWe did not find out how many people are immune, but only how many people in Austria are currently acutely infected,\u201d said G\u00fcnther Ogris, from Sora. The issue of the proportion of asymptomatic infections in the population remains highly contested, with a World Health Organization report in February suggesting truly asymptomatic cases were relatively rare. However, another small Chinese study, reported in the British Medical Journal earlier this month, posited that up to four-fifths of all infections could be without symptoms. Ogris said Sora had \u201cdefined the population as all people living in Austria\u201d, and added that the youngest test subject was not yet a year old, and the oldest was aged 94. Commenting on the result, the science minister, Heinz Fassmann, said it indicated a low rate of immunity, which meant that without controls there was a continued risk of an exponential growth in infections. \u201cThe mountain is higher than expected and we are not yet on the safe side,\u201d he said. Austria\u2019s current policy is to test people with symptoms, especially if they have been to a known hotspot or in close contact with an infected individual. That means many people, such as those with no symptoms, or no known contact to an at-risk area, go undetected.

The figure indicates how contagious an infection is. As the R<sub>0</sub> number drops below one, each existing infection causes less than one new infection; eventually, the outbreak will decline and die out. When R<sub>0</sub> remains steadily less than one, governments may decide to gradually loosen restrictions, with the lockdown relaxed earlier in lower intensity areas and later in hotspot cities such as London.</p> <p>New data <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30746-7/fulltext\">published this week</a> in the Lancet, from a team of researchers at the University of Hong Kong led by the clinician Gabriel Leung, shows that the spread of infection in China outside Wuhan, measured by the R<sub>0</sub> in four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou) fell below one within two weeks of partial lockdown. This is good news; it shows a partial lockdown can quite quickly suppress transmission of the virus. Our national lockdown and social distancing measures may already have brought the R<sub>0</sub> down across much of the country.</p> <p>But the problem still remains of how to prevent a second surge. The Hong Kong researchers worry that as economic activity restarts, local and imported cases of coronavirus could lead to new outbreaks. And the R<sub>0</sub> rate varies across different regions: case fatality rates were just below 1% in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou compared with 5.9% in Wuhan. We will likely also see a higher rate of infection and death rate in London than the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Moreover there\u2019s a crucial difference between the response to coronavirus in China and that in the UK. From the beginning of the outbreak, the Lancet researchers note, \u201conly residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down\u201d. Health authorities also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">found cases</a>, traced contacts and isolated them, monitoring their quarantine closely.</p> <p>So it was not just a lockdown and social distancing that were responsible for bringing down the R<sub>0</sub> number in China, but the country\u2019s community surveillance approach. Scarred by memories of the Sars outbreak in 2002, China and other east Asian states acted with greater speed, imposing total or partial lockdowns supported by a protective shield of community measures \u2013 finding people with the virus, isolating them swiftly, and tracing those they contacted.</p> <p>In South Korea, this took the form of mass testing and digital contact tracing; in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam, health authorities identified cases based on people\u2019s symptoms, and used testing when available. Strict isolation of cases and contacts was monitored by phone apps and home visits. Rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach, China varied the lockdown across different regions. While Wuhan was under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">total lockdown</a>, other provinces had more autonomy, and focused on quarantining the household clusters where most transmission took place.</p> <p>Data seems to show that this approach is the right one. Death rates in Asian countries have been lower than in the US and Europe (South Korea\u2019s death rate, for example, is four per million and stable; the UK\u2019s is 105 per million \u2013 and rising). In addition to helping reduce the R<sub>0</sub> number, a community shield may also allow governments to lift national lockdowns more quickly. Rather than maintaining a prolonged lockdown, governments can target measures at people who actually have coronavirus. This would likely be far less disruptive to the economy: better to quarantine 10% of people who have coronavirus symptoms than an entire population.</p> <p>At first, Britain eschewed the community shield approach. On 12 March the government stopped community testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\">moved to a \u201cdelay\u201d phase</a>, explaining that a managed spread of the virus across 60% of the population, with a case fatality rate around 1%, would hopefully produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">herd immunity</a> and allow the economy to move on. After its modellers realised this strategy would overwhelm the NHS, the government enforced a lockdown. It is now attempting to conduct 10,000 tests a day, mostly in hospitals for patients and health workers.</p> <p>Despite Britain\u2019s slow start, there are reasons for hope. Behind the scenes, general practices and public health workers are working at tremendous speed to build our own protective shield. They\u2019re finding places to treat infected patients who aren\u2019t sick enough for hospital but can\u2019t be nursed at home, visiting those with long-term conditions or coronavirus symptoms, and building a picture of community spread using 111 data. The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new <a href=\"https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/nhsx-coronavirus-contact-tracking-app/\">NHSX app</a> and the popular <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Zoe Covid symptom tracker</a>.</p> <p>We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown. After this, we can then get most people back to work, focus on quarantining individual cases and contacts, and suppress outbreaks if they arise. Hopefully this approach will help us avoid further national lockdowns. But it will take a long time before life returns to normal.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London</p> <p><br></p>",

At first, Britain eschewed the community shield approach. On 12 March the government stopped community testing and moved to a \u201cdelay\u201d phase, explaining that a managed spread of the virus across 60% of the population, with a case fatality rate around 1%, would hopefully produce herd immunity and allow the economy to move on. After its modellers realised this strategy would overwhelm the NHS, the government enforced a lockdown. It is now attempting to conduct 10,000 tests a day, mostly in hospitals for patients and health workers. Despite Britain\u2019s slow start, there are reasons for hope. Behind the scenes, general practices and public health workers are working at tremendous speed to build our own protective shield. They\u2019re finding places to treat infected patients who aren\u2019t sick enough for hospital but can\u2019t be nursed at home, visiting those with long-term conditions or coronavirus symptoms, and building a picture of community spread using 111 data. The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new NHSX app and the popular Zoe Covid symptom tracker. We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown. After this, we can then get most people back to work, focus on quarantining individual cases and contacts, and suppress outbreaks if they arise. Hopefully this approach will help us avoid further national lockdowns. But it will take a long time before life returns to normal. \u2022 Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London",

      "bodyText": "Two former senior executives at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges on Thursday as the US government continued its sprawling investigation into bribery and corruption in world football. A South American sports company, Full Play group, also pleaded not guilty to an additional racketeering conspiracy charge. During a hearing in federal court, held via teleconference due to the coronavirus pandemic, Hernan Lopez, former CEO of Fox International Channels, and Carlos Martinez, former president of Fox Latin America, were arraigned for their alleged involvement in bribery schemes for lucrative broadcast rights to the 2018 and 2022 football World Cups as well as the Copa Libertadores, South America\u2019s biggest club competition. Both were granted bail set at $15m, with an evening curfew and international travel bans also imposed. Lopez left Murdoch\u2019s Fox in January 2016 to set up the podcast company Wondery, which received financial support from Fox when it was founded. At the hearing on Thursday, lawyers for the media executive persuaded the US district judge Pamela Chen to exempt Lopez\u2019s shares in the company from the bail package. Lopez\u2019s attorney Matthew Umhofer had argued that Lopez\u2019s bond amount should be significantly reduced to $500,000 with no curfew or prior permission for domestic travel. But Chen ultimately rejected the arguments. In arguing against Lopez\u2019s travel restrictions, Umhofer told the court that FBI agents had \u201cto come to Mr Lopez\u2019s door\u201d in July of 2016 with regards to the justice department\u2019s sprawling investigation of football corruption, indicating the former executive had known of his interest to prosecutors for over three years. Martinez, who left Fox in May 2019, according to his professional social networking page, was also forced by the government to hand over a number firearms to local police in Doral, Florida, as part of his bond. Prosecutors allege that Lopez and Martinez had \u201crelied on loyalty secured through the payment of bribes\u201d to South American football officials in order to \u201cadvance the business interest of Fox\u201d and obtain \u201cconfidential bidding information\u201d to win American broadcast rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The alleged scheme occurred during Rupert Murdoch\u2019s ownership of 21st Century Fox. He sold the company to Disney for $71bn in March 2019. Fox and Disney have declined to comment on the indictments. The US justice department\u2019s investigation into corruption in world football\u2019s governing body, Fifa, was announced at dawn raid in July 2015. Twenty-six individuals have pleaded guilty as part of the investigation, with two former South American administrators found guilty at trial in 2017.",

It was the same reticence that governed the slow reaction to the 2008 financial crisis. In other words, the EU is not a true political union, like the United States or Russia or even the United Kingdom. When one EU country hits trouble, as Greece and Italy have done over Mediterranean migrants since 2015, the EU itself is silent. It turns its back and hopes trouble will go away.</p> <p>Political unions are specific things \u2013 a marriage of regions, provinces, states in one national unit \u2013 based on a sufficiency of shared identity and shared responsibility.

Nor did Britain say that to Northern Ireland when the province collapsed into bloodshed in the 1970s. It has been pouring in money ever since.</p> <p>The Maastricht treaty of 1992 was based on an ambition to drive Europe towards just such a goal. That, and the subsequent Lisbon treaty of 2007, produced much bureaucratic infrastructure, ever wider \u201ccompetences\u201d, an executive presidency and an enhanced parliament \u2013 which, it was hoped, would convey consent to central authority.

When ministerial talks collapsed on Thursday over the plan for a \u201ccoronabond\u201d, the reaction seemed terminal. Germans and Dutch insulted Italians and Spaniards.

His <a href=\"https://robertjenrick.com/about-robert/\">website</a> says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London.</p> \n<p>The revelations also prompted a former Tory minister to accuse Jenrick of \u201carrogance\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The shadow home secretary has demanded that the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick fully explain himself after travelling more than an hour to visit his parents at the weekend \u2013 despite warning others to stay at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The Guardian revealed that the housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if they are tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own. It also emerged that Jenrick travelled 150 miles from his London property, where he stayed at the start of the lockdown, to his \u00a31.2m Herefordshire home from where he travelled to his parents. His website says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London. The revelations also prompted a former Tory minister to accuse Jenrick of \u201carrogance\u201d. But Jenrick defended his actions, saying he went to deliver food and medicine to his isolating parents. However, the Guardian understands his parents \u2013 who are aged 69 and 79 \u2013 were already receiving help from the local community, raising questions over the necessity of his trip. Asked whether he thought Jenrick was ignoring the government\u2019s stay-at-home advice, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think that\u2019s for him to explain. As you know, the delivery of essential supplies like food and medicine to vulnerable people, vulnerable family members, would be permissible in the exceptions that there are for people to go outside. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s very important now for public confidence that Robert Jenrick fully explains himself and why exactly that journey was necessary.\u201d Downing Street defended Jenrick with a spokesman insisting the minister had complied with social distancing guidelines. Government instructions say: \u201cYou should not be visiting family members who do not live in your home.\u201d The only exception is if they need help, such as having shopping or medication dropped off. The former Tory minister Anna Soubry, who left the party in opposition to its stance on Brexit, tweeted on Friday morning: \u201cThe selfish arrogance of 2 trips #RobertJenrick telling cramped families in inner city high rises or squeezed suburban homes to #StayAtHome is bad enough but justifying it by asserting he didn\u2019t break the rules is shameful. Snr Ministers must practise what they preach.\u201d She added: \u201c#RobertJenrick didn\u2019t break #COVID-19 rules but he totally ignored his own instruction to #StayHome which he repeatedly said in media interviews &amp; from the No 10 podium. It smacks of arrogance. For some time many of us have said Govt messaging must be clear, consistent &amp; honest.\u201d Steve Reed, Labour\u2019s new communities spokesman, earlier told the Daily Mail: \u201cMPs need to set an example to everyone about the importance of not moving around the country and if Robert Jenrick can\u2019t provide a very good explanation as to why these trips were necessary then he needs to consider his position.\u201d The row over Jenrick\u2019s movements broke out after Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer last week quit her post following intense criticism after she twice visited her second home. And it came amid ongoing questions over the whereabouts of Dominic Cummings, whose location Downing Street has repeatedly refused to clarify when asked this week. After the Guardian\u2019s story on Jenrick was published, the minister tweeted: \u201cFor clarity \u2013 my parents asked me to deliver some essentials \u2013 including medicines. They are both self-isolating due to age and my father\u2019s medical condition and I respected social distancing rules.\u201d Defending moving to his Herefordshire property, he told the Mail that his family considered it the family home. Nearly three weeks ago the government published guidance warning people against all but essential travel, highlighting this \u201cdoes not include visits to second homes\u201d and that \u201cpeople must remain in their primary residence\u201d. Jenrick\u2019s actions were defended by others, with Prof Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of Public Health England (PHE), suggesting it sounded like Jenrick had remained within the four \u201cclear\u201d guidelines by travelling 40 miles to deliver medicine and other essential items. \u201cI can\u2019t comment on Mr Jenrick. It sounds as if what he did was within one of the four guidelines to me, but others will obviously have to think about that more,\u201d he said. Speaking at the daily No 10 lobby briefing, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cThe secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys that he made. \u201cWe are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules.\u201d",

But this is only the start. There are so many pop stars with valuable skills that could be imparted to the general public...</p> <p><strong>Mariah Carey: denial<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mariahcarey\">Mariah Carey</a> doesn\u2019t have birthdays or age, she simply celebrates \u201canniversaries\u201d of turning 12 years old. It\u2019s getting a bit weird now, as her children are catching up (twins Moroccan and Monroe are nine this month), but honestly, wouldn\u2019t we all be having far fewer panic attacks if we retreated into fantastical denial? Also: birthdays in isolation don\u2019t count, right?</p> <p><strong>Enya: isolation skills<br></strong>Notoriously reclusive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/enya-dark-sky-island-album-feature\">Enya</a> lives alone in a castle in Dublin, rarely appears in public and spends her days singing in a made-up language to her cats. And, castle aside, that\u2019s basically 2020 vibes all round. Admittedly it\u2019d be quite the U-turn for her to start giving out tips on how to survive isolation over Instagram Live, but in a rare interview five years ago, she revealed she got really into Breaking Bad. Feels like a good place to start.</p> <p><strong>Adele: pub banter<br></strong>After months only socialising on House Party, we\u2019ll all have forgotten how to interact when we\u2019re finally allowed back in pubs. So draft in the A-list\u2019s face of relatable normality, who everyone wants to go on a night out with: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\">Adele</a>. Imagine her reminding us that if we want to leave a conversation in real life, it\u2019s not OK to pretend the wifi\u2019s gone down and simply slam your laptop shut. When you\u2019re in an IRL pub, you can\u2019t help yourself from the fridge \u2013 and please, please wear clothes on your bottom half. </p> <p><strong>Ariana Grande: working from home style<br></strong>Before recent events, the internet mocked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\">Ariana Grande</a> for living in oversized hoodies, always wearing her hair in a ponytail and mostly communicating by Twitter, but look at us now. Turns out she was actually a visionary.</p> <p><strong>Rita Ora: side hustle<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rita-ora\">Rita Ora</a> never met a side project she didn\u2019t like: from actor to model to TV presenter to fashion designer, she\u2019s had a crack at everything, alongside what is ostensibly her actual job (mid-level pop star). She even joined The Masked Singer panel, despite not being able to name one celebrity who wasn\u2019t her real-life friend. It didn\u2019t matter! In these economically unstable, furloughing times, it\u2019s good to be open to new things. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Look, you know the deal. We\u2019re in a global pandemic, and everyone has to do what they can to help other people. It might be shopping for your elderly neighbour, or it could be nailing your parents\u2019 front door shut because they\u2019re insisting if they stay inside \u201cthe disease wins!\u201d Celebs are also pitching in: BTS are teaching Korean online, Natalie Portman is giving acting lessons and Joe Wicks is making horny mums pretend to like online workouts. But this is only the start. There are so many pop stars with valuable skills that could be imparted to the general public... Mariah Carey: denial Mariah Carey doesn\u2019t have birthdays or age, she simply celebrates \u201canniversaries\u201d of turning 12 years old. It\u2019s getting a bit weird now, as her children are catching up (twins Moroccan and Monroe are nine this month), but honestly, wouldn\u2019t we all be having far fewer panic attacks if we retreated into fantastical denial? Also: birthdays in isolation don\u2019t count, right? Enya: isolation skills Notoriously reclusive Enya lives alone in a castle in Dublin, rarely appears in public and spends her days singing in a made-up language to her cats. And, castle aside, that\u2019s basically 2020 vibes all round. Admittedly it\u2019d be quite the U-turn for her to start giving out tips on how to survive isolation over Instagram Live, but in a rare interview five years ago, she revealed she got really into Breaking Bad. Feels like a good place to start. Adele: pub banter After months only socialising on House Party, we\u2019ll all have forgotten how to interact when we\u2019re finally allowed back in pubs. So draft in the A-list\u2019s face of relatable normality, who everyone wants to go on a night out with: Adele. Imagine her reminding us that if we want to leave a conversation in real life, it\u2019s not OK to pretend the wifi\u2019s gone down and simply slam your laptop shut. When you\u2019re in an IRL pub, you can\u2019t help yourself from the fridge \u2013 and please, please wear clothes on your bottom half. Ariana Grande: working from home style Before recent events, the internet mocked Ariana Grande for living in oversized hoodies, always wearing her hair in a ponytail and mostly communicating by Twitter, but look at us now. Turns out she was actually a visionary. Rita Ora: side hustle Rita Ora never met a side project she didn\u2019t like: from actor to model to TV presenter to fashion designer, she\u2019s had a crack at everything, alongside what is ostensibly her actual job (mid-level pop star). She even joined The Masked Singer panel, despite not being able to name one celebrity who wasn\u2019t her real-life friend. It didn\u2019t matter! In these economically unstable, furloughing times, it\u2019s good to be open to new things.",

      "bodyText": "Chile has received early plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus crisis and boasts Latin America\u2019s highest testing rate for the infection. But health workers on the frontline of the outbreak fear authorities are overestimating hospitals\u2019 capacity to care for critically ill patients. The country\u2019s health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, has praised Chile\u2019s health system as \u201cone of the best on the planet\u201d and insisted that enough beds have been available for critical patients. So far, Chile\u2019s Covid-19 mortality rate is 0.95% \u2013 well below the global average of 4.7% \u2013 but medics warn that this figure is giving authorities a false sense of security. \u201cIt\u2019s far too soon to say whether Chile is tackling this successfully,\u201d warned Dr Claudia Cort\u00e9s, an infectious disease specialist in the capital, Santiago. Despite increases in the numbers of Covid cases in Chile\u2019s capital, the majority of the city is not under quarantine. Several districts have been on lockdown for the past two weeks, but these measures will be lifted next week in six affected neighbourhoods. Early Covid-19 cases were concentrated in Santiago\u2019s rich neighbourhoods, imported by wealthy families returning from their summer holidays in Europe. Most of those cases were treated in private hospitals. But Cort\u00e9s works between private and public hospitals attending Covid-19 patients \u2013 and she fears death rates will rocket as the virus spreads to poorer areas. \u201cPeople in public hospitals get sick differently from ones in private hospitals \u2014 they are like two different worlds,\u201d she said. Dr Gabriel de la Fuente Tessler, who works with critically ill Covid-19 patients in a Santiago public hospital, also believes the statistics are misleading. He identified the lack of ventilators as a key problem: his hospital has only 18 machines, 14 of which are already in use. Each day, more patients are coming in, and no one is leaving. \u201cThe bus is filling up, and soon there won\u2019t be any seats,\u201d Fuente said. Temuco, 845km south of the capital, has seen Chile\u2019s highest coronavirus death rates. Located in Chile\u2019s poorest region, Araucania, the city is plagued by high pollution levels, contributing to respiratory sickness in locals. Temuco\u2019s central hospital has dedicated three floors to critical Covid-19 patients. Videos from the overrun hospital have circulated on social media, with staff resorting to wearing bin bags and adhesive tape as forms of protection. Family of deceased coronavirus patients told local media the hospital was turning away critical patients due to lack of resources. Dr Carolina Chahin, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital, predicted the upcoming winter months would hit Chile\u2019s colder, southern regions hard. \u201cWe do not feel prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cThe public health system in Chile is impoverished,\u201d she said, adding that Temuco\u2019s hospital was the only one in the region with equipment to care for critical Covid-19 cases. Last week, all of its ventilators were at capacity. The health ministry immediately shipped six new machines to the hospital but Chahin said they did not have the staff to operate them. Doctors suspect the virus will quickly spread, exacerbated by the Easter holiday weekend.

There are Ground Zeros dotted throughout the city, like Jacobi, one of 11 major public hospitals that are all now pushed to, and beyond, the limit.</p> \n<p>As the crisis thickens, a picture of how the virus is ravaging the city has come into view carrying with it a sobering realization. Coronavirus may not in itself discriminate, but its outcomes certainly do. It has inflicted its terrible toll not so much on New York City, but on the two cities it contains.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoronavirus has exposed New York\u2019s two societies,\u201d Jumaane Williams, the public advocate who acts as the official watchdog for New Yorkers, told the Guardian. \u201cOne society was able to run away to the Hamptons or work from home and have food delivered to their door; the other society was deemed \u2018essential workers\u2019 and made to go out to work with no protection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Different boroughs, even different neighborhoods within each borough, are experiencing coronavirus almost as though it were two different contagions. In wealthier white areas the residential streets are empty; parking spots that are fought over in normal times now stand vacant following an exodus to out-of-town weekend homes or Airbnbs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We have almost 100% people of color in our emergency room.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sean Petty</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In places like the Bronx \u2013 which is 84% black, Latino or mixed race \u2013 the sidewalks are still bustling with people making their way into work.

While those city dwellers who have the luxury to do so are in lockdown in their homes, these communities have no choice but to put themselves in harm\u2019s way every day.</p> \n<p>If you superimpose <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/new-york-citys-frontline-workers/\">a map</a> of where frontline workers live within New York over <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-nyc\">a map</a> of the 76,876 confirmed cases in the city, the two are virtually identical.

      "bodyText": "When Sean Petty walked into the emergency room of Jacobi medical center in the Bronx, at the start of his nursing shift on Monday, he was assailed by a catastrophic scene. About 60 people, almost all of them African Americans or Latinos from the surrounding area of New York City, all displaying classic symptoms of Covid-19, were gasping on stretchers everywhere he looked. \u201cEvery nook and cranny of the emergency department was full of patients attached to portable oxygen tanks, people so sick they needed beds. The stretchers filled the room and spilled down the corridors, 10 patients in just one hallway,\u201d he said. The dreadful sounds of sickness filled the room. \u201cIt\u2019s like a chorus, a cacophony of coughing.\u201d Petty, a pediatric emergency nurse who now spends much of his time caring for adults with coronavirus, could not help envisaging the thousands of contagious micro-droplets being expelled into the air with all that coughing. \u201cI felt like I was walking into a cloud of poison,\u201d he said. Petty is on the frontline of the frontline: New York City. The metropolis has become the focus of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, just as in 2001 it became the focus of the worldwide al-Qaida terrorist threat on 9/11. Day by day, the statistics tell their own grim story. On Tuesday, the New York City death toll overtook that of 9/11 and now stands at 3,602 (2,753 died in the city in the 2001 terrorist attacks). On Wednesday, it was announced that New York had suffered its highest number of fatalities in a 24-hour period \u2013 806 lives snuffed out in just one day. Even that was almost certainly an undercount, as those New Yorkers who die at home are not being included in the figures. The attack is coming in waves \u2013 not just on one sunny morning in September as when the Twin Towers came down, but over days and relentless weeks. There are Ground Zeros dotted throughout the city, like Jacobi, one of 11 major public hospitals that are all now pushed to, and beyond, the limit. As the crisis thickens, a picture of how the virus is ravaging the city has come into view carrying with it a sobering realization. Coronavirus may not in itself discriminate, but its outcomes certainly do. It has inflicted its terrible toll not so much on New York City, but on the two cities it contains. \u201cCoronavirus has exposed New York\u2019s two societies,\u201d Jumaane Williams, the public advocate who acts as the official watchdog for New Yorkers, told the Guardian. \u201cOne society was able to run away to the Hamptons or work from home and have food delivered to their door; the other society was deemed \u2018essential workers\u2019 and made to go out to work with no protection.\u201d Different boroughs, even different neighborhoods within each borough, are experiencing coronavirus almost as though it were two different contagions. In wealthier white areas the residential streets are empty; parking spots that are fought over in normal times now stand vacant following an exodus to out-of-town weekend homes or Airbnbs. In places like the Bronx \u2013 which is 84% black, Latino or mixed race \u2013 the sidewalks are still bustling with people making their way into work. There is still a rush hour. \u201cWe used to call them \u2018service workers\u2019,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow they are \u2018essential workers\u2019 and we have left them to fend for themselves.\u201d The public advocate pointed out that 79% of New York\u2019s frontline workers \u2013 nurses, subway staff, sanitation workers, van drivers, grocery cashiers \u2013 are African American or Latino. While those city dwellers who have the luxury to do so are in lockdown in their homes, these communities have no choice but to put themselves in harm\u2019s way every day. If you superimpose a map of where frontline workers live within New York over a map of the 76,876 confirmed cases in the city, the two are virtually identical. In Queens, the most intense concentration of Covid-19 infections are in precisely those neighborhoods with large numbers of essential workers. One telling detail: at least 41 subway and bus workers have died from coronavirus. A diversity review by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in 2016 found that 55% of its 72,000 employees were black or Latino, and 82% were male \u2013 which is also telling as more men than women are dying from the virus. \u201cWe put people out there and said you got to go to work, but we didn\u2019t give them protective gear or additional testing to keep them safe. It was almost as though these groups were expendable to keep the city moving,\u201d Williams said. This week a tiger tested positive at Bronx Zoo. It generated plenty of headlines, but few media articles made the point that Williams highlighted. \u201cA tiger tests positive \u2013 that\u2019s good to know. If we have enough diagnostic test kits for tigers, shouldn\u2019t we have enough for our own frontline humans?\u201d Two miles away from Bronx Zoo, back in the ER of the Jacobi medical center, Sean Petty sees the impact of New York\u2019s two societies every day. \u201cWe have almost 100% people of color in our emergency room,\u201d Petty said. Most of the adult Covid patients he cares for are also wrestling with underlying health conditions that make them far more vulnerable to the disease. \u201cOur patients are coming in with all of the comorbidities associated with poverty and racism \u2013 diabetes, asthma, hypertension. We have patients who are sicker and more likely to die because their lives have been conditioned by these chronic illnesses.\u201d Reliable data has been hard to come by, as both city and state authorities resisted for several weeks releasing official figures on the grounds that the subject of disparities was less important than keeping hospitals afloat. Journalists at the independent not-for-profit news site THE CITY were driven to do their own analysis of NYC department of health data and found that in the Bronx people are dying at twice the rate of New Yorkers as a whole. On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio finally caved to pressure and posted preliminary findings that unambiguously underline the racial breakdown of coronavirus\u2019s deadly toll. Black and Latino New Yorkers are dying at double the rate of white and Asian New Yorkers, following precisely the public advocate\u2019s narrative of two societies. \u201cThere are clear inequalities, clear disparities in how this disease is affecting the people of our city,\u201d De Blasio said. In recent days Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, has tentatively suggested that the crisis may already have reached its apex and could be plateauing as the curves for new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions all show signs of flattening. If there are indications that the city may be starting to prevail against the disease, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to Sean Petty. When he looks out of the window of the staff room during shift breaks he sees the refrigerated truck lined up to receive the bodies of Covid victims \u2013 one of 80 parked outside hospitals around the city. \u201cThere is no good news story here,\u201d he said. Already Jacobi has lost two frontline health workers, an educator in the psychiatric department and a nurse\u2019s aide. On top of what he sees as preventable tragedies, Petty said what rattled him most was when a Jacobi emergency room resident aged 27 was admitted into intensive care. \u201cThat was a huge wake-up call for me. To see a 27-year-old person sent to ICU who was working a hundred yards from me, that shook me.\u201d Petty said he has never felt as angry towards the US healthcare system and towards government \u2013 the Trump administration as well as city and state leaders \u2013 for failing to protect the city\u2019s frontline workers. Through his union, the New York State Nurses Association, he has had to fight every step of the way to secure basic personal protective equipment (PPE) to keep him and his colleagues safe. As the virus claims more victims, the city is having to think the unthinkable. Rikers Island, the notorious New York jail complex that is fighting its own Covid-19 outbreak and saw the first death of a detainee on Sunday, has been paying prisoners $6 an hour to dig mass graves on a nearby island in the Bronx though recently they switched to contract labourers. This week a New York city council member revealed in a tweet that has since been deleted that mass burials were being considered in local parks, 10 caskets per grave. He later backtracked and said it was a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d. Political leaders, from De Blasio locally, to Cuomo regionally and Donald Trump nationally, have all tried to calm emotions by pointing to high-profile initiatives intended to provide some relief for hospitals pushed to the edge. The Javits Convention Center has been turned into a military-run hospital; the USNS Comfort, a naval hospital ship, is also now docked in the Hudson River. But so far these headline-grabbing schemes have been full of sound and fury, delivering very little. Between them, the Javits and Comfort have treated just over 100 patients. A far less glamorous but much more substantial pattern of events is unfolding in the outer boroughs where most Covid victims live, away from the cameras and the political grandstanding. Here doctors and nurses are working far longer hours, at greater pace, than ever before, and with less protective equipment. Ventilator shortages mean making phone calls across the wards to see if other units can share. Patients are transferred between hospitals when one is running out of space. And health workers who normally wouldn\u2019t work in an ER or intensive care have been reassigned to fill the need. Across the city, the practice of medicine has been turned on its head. A physician working at Bellevue hospital in Manhattan said he tries to see patients from outside the room window to minimize exposure, often guiding them to adjust their oxygen levels themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re having to be innovative,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not necessarily comfortable.\u201d Dozens of health workers have become sick on his unit, he said, but most have recovered quickly and returned to work. A physician at Elmhurst hospital, which like Jacobi is in the thick of the crisis, and treats many low-income and immigrant populations, said he is now having conversations with patients and their families about end-of-life care six or seven times a day, instead of once every two weeks. \u201cThese discussions are intensely personal and very emotional,\u201d he said. And now that he can\u2019t invite the family into the patient room, or hold the patient\u2019s hand, \u201cthere\u2019s a degree of detachment and depersonalization\u201d. With such heartbreaking conversations now being held across the city, racial disparities continue to distort everything. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock, an urgent care physician, has witnessed the gulf in experiences of the virus in central Brooklyn where she works across several clinics. When she goes to work at a site in an African American or Latino neighborhood she knows she will be inundated with patients with Covid-like symptoms. In higher-income white neighborhoods the demand for health services has actually declined since the start of the crisis, to the extent that several clinics in these areas have been closed. \u201cThis pandemic is laying bare the inequities that have always existed in New York city,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t invest in people, we don\u2019t invest in neighborhoods, and this is what we get.\u201d",

MLB The Show 20 (PS4; \u00a344.99) The best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won\u2019t threaten your double glazing is The Show\u2019s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It\u2019s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress. The Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus. AO Tennis 2 (PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One; \u00a347.99) For the first time since 1945, there will be no Wimbledon champion. In real life, anyway: AO2 enables you to play out the tournament and declare your own victor. While The Championships aren\u2019t officially licensed, the game\u2019s \u201cLondon\u201d stadium and the \u201cLarge Gold 4\u201d and \u201cMedium Silver 17\u201d trophies are clearly inspired by the biggest event on the tennis calendar. It\u2019s slightly more complex than the other games listed here as custom tournaments require at least eight players, but there\u2019s an easy way to offset this: simply start your competition, then simulate the entire quarter-finals round. You\u2019re now set for four-way action featuring your pick of Rafael Nadal, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Ash Barty, Johanna Konta and more. If you have a few younger players in your household, Mario Tennis Aces (Nintendo Switch) is a lot of fun and allows four-player matches, and it\u2019s portable so you can take it out into the garden. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour Golf (PS4, Xbox One; \u00a370+) Five years after release, EA\u2019s most recent golfing effort enjoys a cult following \u2013 to the point that secondhand copies start at \u00a370. That\u2019s purely down to its offline excellence. While PGA\u2019s lack of online options disappointed, sofa-based play is of a pass-the-pad nature that immaculately apes the series\u2019 Mega Drive roots. Up to four players compete over 12 courses, the pick of which is Paracel Storm: a preposterous yet brilliant 18-hole round based on Battlefield 4. Stick-swinging controls suit players of all ages, but Sega alumni can make use of a classic three-tap technique if so preferred. If you have trouble getting a copy, serious players might want to try The Golf Club 2019, which aims to be a very accurate simulation of the sport. More accessible alternatives include the long-running cartoon-style favourite Everybody\u2019s Golf (PS4) or the incredibly hectic Party Golf (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), currently just \u00a32 on Switch. NBA 2K20 (PS4, Xbox One; \u00a345.99) Visual Concepts\u2019s basketball veteran goes one step beyond the other games listed. In addition to setting up offline tournaments, you can create online competitions too. Up to 35 friends can join you in playing out a real NBA season with six expansion teams, or a created one that mixes classic rosters with contemporary ones. If you\u2019d rather stick to home-bound b-ball, the offline Playoffs mode is the way to go: a straight knockout tournament where up to 16 players can be user-controlled. Again, set-up options are plentiful, including a fantasy draft option in case you\u2019re desperate to make Giannis Antetokounmpo a Brooklyn Net. Got your own favourite multiplayer sports games?

His previous series, The Book of the Ancestor, was set in the lush equatorial region of the planet Abeth. <em>The Girl and the Stars</em> explores that world\u2019s harsh polar region, where the temperature is 40 below zero and the Ictha people eke out a precarious existence on inhospitable ice plains. Life is harsh, and the halt and lame \u2013 plus those who don\u2019t conform \u2013 are sacrificed so that others might live. Sixteen-year-old Yaz and her younger brother find themselves cast out of the tribe at the Pit of the Missing, literally thrown into a hellish netherworld beneath the polar ice cap. What follows is not only a thrilling fight for survival among the sub-realm\u2019s demons, monsters and lost tribes, but a revelatory coming of age story as Yaz learns the truth about her world and her place in it. <em>The Girl and the Stars</em> is a compelling picaresque that melds fantasy and science fiction to stirring effect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1320002a2e2b347407e0cde0636b36301631da1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1320002a2e2b347407e0cde0636b36301631da1a/0_0_236_347/236.jpg\" alt=\"The Book of Koli\" width=\"236\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/15/girl-with-gifts-mr-carey-review\">The Girl With All the Gifts</a></em> author MR Carey shifts seamlessly from fantasy to science fiction with <strong>The Book of Koli</strong> (Orbit, \u00a38.99), an apocalyptic dystopia set in a post-climate crisis world very different from our own. The genetic manipulation of nature has led to man-eating trees and monstrous wild animals. Teenager Koli lives in the enclave of Mythen Rood, a village surrounded by inimical nature and governed by a select few known as Ramparts, an elite who can access ancient technology. In a first-person narrative, the barely literate Koli tells the story of how he craves to become one of the elite, and how his life changes when he steals a piece of technology \u2013 an AI that rapidly becomes a character in its own right. Thrust out into the wilderness, with the wise-cracking Japanese AI as a companion, Koli embarks on a journey as perilous as it is enlightening. <em>The Book of Koli </em>is the enthralling first volume of a projected trilogy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"20ad8b04b0502db7a264c31c6b8534b572c0d6ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20ad8b04b0502db7a264c31c6b8534b572c0d6ee/0_0_225_346/225..jpg\" alt=\"Chosen Ones \" width=\"225\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In <strong>Chosen Ones</strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99),<em> </em>the first adult novel by the bestselling young adult author Veronica Roth, she ditches the teenage angst of the Divergent series and tackles some seriously grown-up themes. Ten years before the novel opens, five teenagers known as the Chosen Ones defeated an evil entity called the Dark One, whose malign energy created natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people worldwide. The Chosen Ones had fame thrust on them, and at a cost. Through her heroine Sloane Andrews, Roth examines the psychological effects: empty celebrity and debilitating flashbacks. Ten years after the Dark One was vanquished, a Chosen One dies and Sloane must face the fact that the evil has returned. A skilled storyteller, Roth examines issues of racism and responsibility in a well-plotted supernatural thriller, the first in a series.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5557934cb4146f88ad76d3d24e8076e0296a79db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5557934cb4146f88ad76d3d24e8076e0296a79db/0_0_325_499/325..jpg\" alt=\"Incendiary\" width=\"325\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Zoraida C\u00f3rdova\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/incendiary-9781473677579.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Incendiary</a></strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99) is another fantasy epic with a plucky but vulnerable heroine: this time a lush reimagining of the Spanish Inquisition spiced with a fascinating magical system. Renata Convida belongs to the Moria people, who are blessed with occult abilities; Renata can steal the memories of others, leaving her victims as little more than hollow shells. As a child she worked for King Fernando, reading the memories of spies and enemies. Ten years later, after being snatched from the royal court, Renata is on the side of the Whispers, rebels who are working to overthrow the king. After a slow-burn start, the novel picks up pace, and the thrills and reversals of fortune come thick and fast. <em>Incendiary</em> is the first book of a duology.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dae168b98f71b98e8255646d8c554e9a7920f021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dae168b98f71b98e8255646d8c554e9a7920f021/0_0_328_499/328..jpg\" alt=\"Looking Glass\" width=\"328\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The four linked novellas in Christina Henry\u2019s <strong>Looking Glass</strong> (Titan, \u00a37.99) return to the world of her novels <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/15/the-best-recent-science-fiction-and-fantasy-novels-reviews-roundup\">Alice</a></em> and <em>Red Queen</em>, in which she gave <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2015/jul/04/alice-in-wonderland-150-years-alice-day-cs-lewis-john-tenniel-hilary-mckay\">Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland</a></em> a macabre modernisation.

      "bodyText": "Mark Lawrence has produced more than a dozen novels in a decade, and The Girl and the Stars (Harper Voyager, \u00a314.99) is one of the best. His previous series, The Book of the Ancestor, was set in the lush equatorial region of the planet Abeth. The Girl and the Stars explores that world\u2019s harsh polar region, where the temperature is 40 below zero and the Ictha people eke out a precarious existence on inhospitable ice plains. Life is harsh, and the halt and lame \u2013 plus those who don\u2019t conform \u2013 are sacrificed so that others might live. Sixteen-year-old Yaz and her younger brother find themselves cast out of the tribe at the Pit of the Missing, literally thrown into a hellish netherworld beneath the polar ice cap. What follows is not only a thrilling fight for survival among the sub-realm\u2019s demons, monsters and lost tribes, but a revelatory coming of age story as Yaz learns the truth about her world and her place in it. The Girl and the Stars is a compelling picaresque that melds fantasy and science fiction to stirring effect. The Girl With All the Gifts author MR Carey shifts seamlessly from fantasy to science fiction with The Book of Koli (Orbit, \u00a38.99), an apocalyptic dystopia set in a post-climate crisis world very different from our own. The genetic manipulation of nature has led to man-eating trees and monstrous wild animals. Teenager Koli lives in the enclave of Mythen Rood, a village surrounded by inimical nature and governed by a select few known as Ramparts, an elite who can access ancient technology. In a first-person narrative, the barely literate Koli tells the story of how he craves to become one of the elite, and how his life changes when he steals a piece of technology \u2013 an AI that rapidly becomes a character in its own right. Thrust out into the wilderness, with the wise-cracking Japanese AI as a companion, Koli embarks on a journey as perilous as it is enlightening. The Book of Koli is the enthralling first volume of a projected trilogy. In Chosen Ones (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99), the first adult novel by the bestselling young adult author Veronica Roth, she ditches the teenage angst of the Divergent series and tackles some seriously grown-up themes. Ten years before the novel opens, five teenagers known as the Chosen Ones defeated an evil entity called the Dark One, whose malign energy created natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people worldwide. The Chosen Ones had fame thrust on them, and at a cost. Through her heroine Sloane Andrews, Roth examines the psychological effects: empty celebrity and debilitating flashbacks. Ten years after the Dark One was vanquished, a Chosen One dies and Sloane must face the fact that the evil has returned. A skilled storyteller, Roth examines issues of racism and responsibility in a well-plotted supernatural thriller, the first in a series. Zoraida C\u00f3rdova\u2019s Incendiary (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a314.99) is another fantasy epic with a plucky but vulnerable heroine: this time a lush reimagining of the Spanish Inquisition spiced with a fascinating magical system. Renata Convida belongs to the Moria people, who are blessed with occult abilities; Renata can steal the memories of others, leaving her victims as little more than hollow shells. As a child she worked for King Fernando, reading the memories of spies and enemies. Ten years later, after being snatched from the royal court, Renata is on the side of the Whispers, rebels who are working to overthrow the king. After a slow-burn start, the novel picks up pace, and the thrills and reversals of fortune come thick and fast. Incendiary is the first book of a duology. The four linked novellas in Christina Henry\u2019s Looking Glass (Titan, \u00a37.99) return to the world of her novels Alice and Red Queen, in which she gave Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland a macabre modernisation. The stories feature Alice\u2019s younger sister Elizabeth, a now grown-up Alice and her werewolf lover Hatcher, and dramatise their conflicts with characters monstrously transformed from Lewis Carroll\u2019s originals by Henry\u2019s grim-dark and fecund imagination. The best of the four volumes are the Girl in Amber, in which Alice, invested with magical abilities, fights off nightmarish creatures in a phantasmagorical house of horrors; and When I First Came to Town, featuring Hatcher as young man in the Old City, where he is a prizefighter pitched against the monstrous Grinder. For the most part Henry ably captures Carroll\u2019s period tone, aside from the occasional jarring Americanism. However, while the stories work well as metaphor, with Alice as everywoman, the protagonist\u2019s magical ability does tend to undercut tension and jeopardy. \u2022 Eric Brown\u2019s latest novel, The Martian Menace, is published by Titan.",

A football special, no one else on board and no other way to go. Packed in and unable to move, glasses of piss passed along precariously and chucked out of the window. Songs hammered out on the ceiling and the sides, even if we didn\u2019t know all of the words.</p> <p>As we got closer to Gij\u00f3n, some Sporting fans waited on the platforms of stations the train sped through \u2013 Veri\u00f1a and La Calzada at a guess, looking at the map 23 years later \u2013 and threw things, thudding against the side.</p> <p>It pulled into Gij\u00f3n and the police boxed us in on all sides and ran us to the stadium all along the beachfront, three kilometres covered quickly. A few rocks flew, a bottle or two, hence the helmets, yet mostly it was insults and not much else \u2013 most tongue in cheek, accepted and reciprocated. They welcomed us and we proposed a swap deal for the UK: Gibraltar for Gij\u00f3n.

He insisted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t football, this is poetry.\u201d He was only half right, another politician telling porkies, and six years on Oviedo fans had more reason to hate him than anyone in Gij\u00f3n when he proposed to put the club out of business and they rose up to rescue it.

      "bodyText": "\u201cGet a workman\u2019s helmet.\u201d \u201cEh?\u201d \u201cBlue, if they\u2019ve got one.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d It didn\u2019t make a lot of sense \u2026 at least not until we got off the train a few days later. Turned out Jaime was right. When a small group of us said we were going to the Asturian derby between Sporting Gij\u00f3n and Real Oviedo, his response was to buy a hard hat. We hadn\u2019t and we were exposed. Not that we were the only ones. Not all of the thousand or so fans travelling there wore helmets but there might have been a couple of hundred when they arrived at the station in Oviedo that afternoon. In the mind\u2019s eye it is more, and a lot of them are covered with football stickers. Looking back, that derby might not even be a good thing, something to hang on to, still less to celebrate, but it doesn\u2019t go away. First, an apology: the headline in La Nueva Espa\u00f1a that morning called it the \u201cgreatest show on earth, more than a match\u201d, but in fact it wasn\u2019t much of a match at all, still less a great game, confirmation of what one report called a \u201ctendency to nil-nilism\u201d. Well, they did say favourite and this did come to mind, a memory crystallising in that piece of sartorial advice and the essential silliness of it all. This was huge, friends in Oviedo had said. Rooting out the reports now says so too. The match preview opened with the line \u201cat last the day arrives\u201d. That day was a Sunday in January 1997 and they loaded us \u2013 too many of us \u2013 on to a train to Gij\u00f3n, 35km away. A football special, no one else on board and no other way to go. Packed in and unable to move, glasses of piss passed along precariously and chucked out of the window. Songs hammered out on the ceiling and the sides, even if we didn\u2019t know all of the words. As we got closer to Gij\u00f3n, some Sporting fans waited on the platforms of stations the train sped through \u2013 Veri\u00f1a and La Calzada at a guess, looking at the map 23 years later \u2013 and threw things, thudding against the side. It pulled into Gij\u00f3n and the police boxed us in on all sides and ran us to the stadium all along the beachfront, three kilometres covered quickly. A few rocks flew, a bottle or two, hence the helmets, yet mostly it was insults and not much else \u2013 most tongue in cheek, accepted and reciprocated. They welcomed us and we proposed a swap deal for the UK: Gibraltar for Gij\u00f3n. They never did take us up on that. We kept running, all the way to the Molin\u00f3n, where the mayor of Oviedo said the city\u2019s team played \u201cbeautifully\u201d. He insisted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t football, this is poetry.\u201d He was only half right, another politician telling porkies, and six years on Oviedo fans had more reason to hate him than anyone in Gij\u00f3n when he proposed to put the club out of business and they rose up to rescue it. Yet if anyone deserved anything that day it probably was Oviedo. Managed by Juanma Lillo, they had two goals disallowed and a penalty turned down in the 0-0 draw. Peter Dubovsky, rest his soul, hit the bar. Lillo wasn\u2019t happy about the ref but he doesn\u2019t linger in my mental version, which is more in line with the match ratings for the two keepers: \u201cAblanedo: not a game with much work.\u201d And \u201cMora: more relaxed than he could have imagined.\u201d In fact, the game almost doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 beating double-winning Atl\u00e9tico 4-1 that year, now that was a game \u2013 but nor does it matter.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s probably not the greatest, most productive skill to be proud of, but my ability to watch hours and hours of TV was always something that, I felt, set me apart from other people. At my peak, if you can call it that, I thought nothing of spending six, seven hours with the same show. I once devoured an entire series of 24 on DVD in one sitting, and consumed all 86 episodes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/14/the-sopranos-at-20-how-the-hit-show-changed-the-gangster-genre\">The Sopranos</a> in 13 days. In my defence, with the latter, I had just been made redundant and had nothing better to do. Plus, it made staying in my dressing gown all day look like cosplay, rather than mild depression.</p> <p>I always had other hobbies, and I\u2019ve always enjoyed going outside, but if I set my mind to TV, that\u2019s what I did without much thought for anything else.</p> <p>I turned this to my advantage in later years, too, writing about TV for the first eight or nine years of my working life, and I still dip in every <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/brad-pitt-snoop-dogg-asap-rocky-peaky-blinders-steven-knight-gangster-series\">now and again</a>. But in the past couple of years, I\u2019ve noticed my concentration span disappear. Perhaps it\u2019s guilt catching up with me for all the years I spent slack-jawed on the sofa letting yet another box set of forgettable US TV wash over me? Or maybe I\u2019m distracted by worry \u2013 about everything from the climate crisis to the feeling I should be doing something better with my time?</p> <p>I don\u2019t think it takes a psychiatrist to work out why I might not be able to concentrate at the moment, but even before the whole global pandemic thing, I couldn\u2019t really focus on TV. I\u2019ve got stuff to do; too much tension makes my chest tight; too much shouting sets my teeth on edge. Needless to say, news and current affairs are off the menu, and on it are The Repair Shop, Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing and not much else. \u201cHow slow can you go?\u201d I seem to be asking my television.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried documentaries, wondering if it was more realism I craved, but this coincided with a trend for genuinely staggering factual series about almost unbelievable events. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/19/making-a-murderer-season-2-review\">Making a Murderer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life\">Wild</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/11/wild-wild-country-review-netflixs-take-on-the-cult-that-threatened-american-life\"> Wild Country</a>, The Keepers, The Staircase, you know, all those. \u201cTry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/insane-intoxicating-tale-of-big-cats-is-perfect-lockdown-tv-tiger-watch-james-mcavoy-greta-gerwig\">Tiger King</a>,\u201d is the latest advice from friends trying to suggest something to watch during the lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d they say.</p> <p>A global pandemic that has left thousands dead and threatens the very fabric of society is about as much crazy as I can deal with this month, thank you. Some guy with a big cat will have to wait, no matter how daft his mullet is.</p> <p>Thankfully, I have found a few things to watch. Given how much Wheeler Dealers, How It\u2019s Made and The New Yankee Workshop I used to sit through on Discovery Shed, it\u2019s hardly a surprise to me, but most of my viewing now revolves around the restoration of old things. I stumbled upon this new world during a break on a night shift at this very paper last year. I\u2019m not sure why it spoke to me the way it did, but as soon as I saw this film of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpRdVBC5PNo\">restoration of a seized 1960s chainsaw</a>, I knew it was the only thing I wanted to watch. And with 10m views, I\u2019m far from the only person to enjoy this 38-minute slice of nerdy bliss. Thank you, Will Matthews, I owe you.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpRdVBC5PNo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TpRdVBC5PNo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>From there, I fell down a tool-restoration rabbit hole. King among them is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrMVIBtqFW6O0-MWq26gqw/featured\">My Mechanics</a>, a YouTube channel with about 1.3 million subscribers and more than 123m views. He \u2013 I assume he\u2019s a he, you only see a pair of hands in the videos and there\u2019s no talking \u2013 is based in Switzerland. And that\u2019s about all the information there is. Where does he get the projects from? How has he mastered working with so many materials? Who paid for all those amazing tools? Does he have a day job? Why doesn\u2019t he fix the broken button on his sandblasting machine? Many questions, but I don\u2019t care about the answers, really, I just sit back and watch another video. At least I did \u2013 I\u2019ve now seen them all, several times, and eagerly await the next. One was uploaded this week, thankfully, the restoration of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KahctElSnpw\">barn find oil lamp</a>, and it\u2019s perfect.</p> <p>If watching someone restore an old Game Boy or PlayStation sounds more your thing, then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_suVrG2dA5BTjJhNLwthQ\">Odd Tinkering</a> is the channel for you. Who knew 1980s plastic could be bleached and exposed to UV light to come up looking like new?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/stewartmacdonald\">StewMac</a>, the video channel of luthier supply company Stewart MacDonald, is another source of endless fascination (for me, at least) and sits perfectly at the intersection of what now appears to be my two main interests \u2013 restoration videos and guitars. If you can\u2019t marvel as <a href=\"http://www.danerlewine.com/\">Dan Erlewine</a> masterfully restores a butchered <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUUuMzxJ9h8\">1953 Fender Telecaster</a>, or replaces a mother-of-pearl inlay in the neck of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KJwBie5XBo\">Martin D-45</a>, then I can\u2019t help you.</p> <p>Of course, there is a temptation to analyse this viewing in a way that makes it seem philosophically pure, that in witnessing the restoration of an item that would otherwise be thrown on the scrapheap, that I\u2019m somehow making a stand against consumerism and the disposability of life in the 21st century.</p> <p>Maybe that\u2019s true, but really, I just like seeing rusty old bits of metal get a once-over with a sandblaster.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s probably not the greatest, most productive skill to be proud of, but my ability to watch hours and hours of TV was always something that, I felt, set me apart from other people. At my peak, if you can call it that, I thought nothing of spending six, seven hours with the same show. I once devoured an entire series of 24 on DVD in one sitting, and consumed all 86 episodes of The Sopranos in 13 days. In my defence, with the latter, I had just been made redundant and had nothing better to do. Plus, it made staying in my dressing gown all day look like cosplay, rather than mild depression. I always had other hobbies, and I\u2019ve always enjoyed going outside, but if I set my mind to TV, that\u2019s what I did without much thought for anything else. I turned this to my advantage in later years, too, writing about TV for the first eight or nine years of my working life, and I still dip in every now and again. But in the past couple of years, I\u2019ve noticed my concentration span disappear. Perhaps it\u2019s guilt catching up with me for all the years I spent slack-jawed on the sofa letting yet another box set of forgettable US TV wash over me? Or maybe I\u2019m distracted by worry \u2013 about everything from the climate crisis to the feeling I should be doing something better with my time? I don\u2019t think it takes a psychiatrist to work out why I might not be able to concentrate at the moment, but even before the whole global pandemic thing, I couldn\u2019t really focus on TV. I\u2019ve got stuff to do; too much tension makes my chest tight; too much shouting sets my teeth on edge. Needless to say, news and current affairs are off the menu, and on it are The Repair Shop, Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing and not much else. \u201cHow slow can you go?\u201d I seem to be asking my television. I\u2019ve tried documentaries, wondering if it was more realism I craved, but this coincided with a trend for genuinely staggering factual series about almost unbelievable events. Making a Murderer, Wild Wild Country, The Keepers, The Staircase, you know, all those. \u201cTry Tiger King,\u201d is the latest advice from friends trying to suggest something to watch during the lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d they say. A global pandemic that has left thousands dead and threatens the very fabric of society is about as much crazy as I can deal with this month, thank you. Some guy with a big cat will have to wait, no matter how daft his mullet is. Thankfully, I have found a few things to watch. Given how much Wheeler Dealers, How It\u2019s Made and The New Yankee Workshop I used to sit through on Discovery Shed, it\u2019s hardly a surprise to me, but most of my viewing now revolves around the restoration of old things. I stumbled upon this new world during a break on a night shift at this very paper last year. I\u2019m not sure why it spoke to me the way it did, but as soon as I saw this film of the restoration of a seized 1960s chainsaw, I knew it was the only thing I wanted to watch. And with 10m views, I\u2019m far from the only person to enjoy this 38-minute slice of nerdy bliss. Thank you, Will Matthews, I owe you. From there, I fell down a tool-restoration rabbit hole. King among them is My Mechanics, a YouTube channel with about 1.3 million subscribers and more than 123m views. He \u2013 I assume he\u2019s a he, you only see a pair of hands in the videos and there\u2019s no talking \u2013 is based in Switzerland. And that\u2019s about all the information there is. Where does he get the projects from? How has he mastered working with so many materials? Who paid for all those amazing tools? Does he have a day job? Why doesn\u2019t he fix the broken button on his sandblasting machine? Many questions, but I don\u2019t care about the answers, really, I just sit back and watch another video. At least I did \u2013 I\u2019ve now seen them all, several times, and eagerly await the next. One was uploaded this week, thankfully, the restoration of a barn find oil lamp, and it\u2019s perfect. If watching someone restore an old Game Boy or PlayStation sounds more your thing, then Odd Tinkering is the channel for you. Who knew 1980s plastic could be bleached and exposed to UV light to come up looking like new? StewMac, the video channel of luthier supply company Stewart MacDonald, is another source of endless fascination (for me, at least) and sits perfectly at the intersection of what now appears to be my two main interests \u2013 restoration videos and guitars. If you can\u2019t marvel as Dan Erlewine masterfully restores a butchered 1953 Fender Telecaster, or replaces a mother-of-pearl inlay in the neck of a Martin D-45, then I can\u2019t help you. Of course, there is a temptation to analyse this viewing in a way that makes it seem philosophically pure, that in witnessing the restoration of an item that would otherwise be thrown on the scrapheap, that I\u2019m somehow making a stand against consumerism and the disposability of life in the 21st century. Maybe that\u2019s true, but really, I just like seeing rusty old bits of metal get a once-over with a sandblaster.",

      "body": "<p>Over the course of the past year you may have given idle thought to repainting all or part of your home. In lockdown, you might have decided now is the time. If so, you are not alone: paint companies are still delivering and sales are brisk. But is this really the time to embark on such a project? And can you make a success of it, even if you have never done it before? We asked the experts the best way to go about it.</p> <h2><strong>Before you start</strong></h2> <p>The good news is, you can save a lot of money by painting your own home, because labour accounts for the majority of decorating costs. The bad news is, there\u2019s a reason painters are expensive. Painting is difficult.</p> <p>The biggest mistake first-timers make is thinking too big, according to Joa Studholme, author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/farrow-ball-how-to-decorate-9781784720872.html\">How to Decorate</a> and colour curator for the paint company Farrow &amp; Ball. \u201cMy main piece of advice is to start small,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have a small hall, that can be a good place to start. There you can indulge your fantasies of doing something quite strong and bold, which might be something you\u2019re feeling you want to do right now, but then you don\u2019t have to look at it all day.\u201d</p> <p>Painting a whole room will certainly keep you busy, but if you are new to it, you probably won\u2019t find it terribly therapeutic. \u201cI do it where I think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m gonna paint this, and it\u2019s gonna be really soothing,\u2019\u201d says Studholme, \u201cAnd, actually, painting is stressful. Smaller things are much better to do.\u201d For beginners, she suggests starting with your front door, or the legs of a table. \u201cPaint the inside of a cupboard in a jolly colour and that will make you smile every time you open it,\u201d she says. When you have some idea of what it entails, you can move on to a room.</p> <h2><strong>Choosing colours</strong></h2> <p>Lockdown may seem like fertile ground for ill-advised decisions, but Edward Bulmer, an interior designer and head of the <a href=\"https://www.edwardbulmerpaint.co.uk/\">Edward Bulmer Natural Paint</a> company, says there may never be a better time to pick colours. \u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s not often that we can contemplate our rooms at all times of day,\u201d he says, \u201cand in varying weathers, and probably with full-on use, if you\u2019ve got your family around.\u201d</p> <p>You can still order sample pots from many companies, including Bulmer\u2019s and <a href=\"https://www.farrow-ball.com/\">Farrow &amp; Ball</a> (delivery times may be a bit longer, but none of us is going anywhere). Instead of applying it to the wall, paint a generous piece of card \u2013 A5 or larger \u2013 or a bit of old wallpaper. \u201cThen place it against the wall round the room and look at it in different lights,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cYou might feel like a right idiot doing it, but that\u2019s the best way to gauge how it\u2019s going to look.\u201d</p> <p>If you don\u2019t know where to begin, try being led by the colours of other surfaces in the room: floors, worktops, tiles, any large bits of furniture. \u201cSome decision that\u2019s already out of your hands,\u201d says Bulmer. Work with what you\u2019ve got.</p> <h2><strong>Tools and supplies</strong></h2> <p>At the minimum you will need a scraper, masking tape, some sandpaper, filler, ample dust sheets, a decent brush or two, and a roller and tray. \u201cWe advise a medium pile roller, not a foam roller,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cIt will help the paint lay a bit more like it would with a brush.\u201d As for paint, the amount you need varies depending on the type, but five litres of emulsion will cover around 60 square metres. Emulsion is for walls and ceilings; eggshell for woodwork. Cheap paint is probably a false economy, because it won\u2019t go as far. \u201cOne of the expensive ingredients in paint is titanium dioxide, the basic white pigment,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cNormally, to make a paint cheaper you use less of that, so you\u2019ll have less coverage.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Getting ready</strong></h2> <p>\u201cPreparation is everything,\u201d says Studholme. Professional painters spend far longer prepping a room than they do painting it. Push all the furniture into the middle of the room and cover it with dust sheets. Scrape away any loose old paint. Fill cracks and nail holes, and sand flat. Sand to create a key (an adhesive surface) for the new paint. Mask the edges of carpet. Apply primer to your walls, and don\u2019t worry too much what it looks like; it\u2019s just there to provide a stable painting surface.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2524c6cec31b9c8d0b7ee1d58749a890afabda7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2524c6cec31b9c8d0b7ee1d58749a890afabda7/1731_491_3866_2319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man painting a ceiling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If painting a ceiling, start by painting the edges and other tricky bits.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cultura Creative (RF)/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The ceiling</strong></h2> <p>If you are doing the ceiling, that should be done first; you can get up there with either a ladder or a roller on a pole. Beforehand, paint round the edges where the ceiling meets the wall or any architectural features, using a small brush. You can mask the edges with tape if you are unsure of yourself. Then roll. Expect to come away heavily speckled.</p> <h2><strong>The walls</strong></h2> <p>Start by \u201ccutting in\u201d the top edge where the wall meets the ceiling, carefully, with a brush, by eye. Do the same along any woodwork edges (you can be a bit less precise here, because you are painting the woodwork later). If this part sounds daunting, Studholme has a simple solution that also happens to be fashionable: paint everything \u2013 walls, ceilings, woodwork \u2013 the same colour. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier for home decorating and it makes the room look bigger,\u201d she says. It\u2019s by no means a radical idea. \u201cThere\u2019s historic precedent for it. Georgian rooms were often painted in one colour.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to rolling your walls, the main advice is to keep going. \u201cThat\u2019s the single pitfall, really,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cModern emulsion is lovely and quick-drying, but it also means that what you have to do is start, and carry on. Not start, stop, take a phone call and have a cup of coffee.\u201d A stop-start approach yields a streaky finish. Paint a single coat in one go, and let it dry overnight. Two coats should be sufficient in most cases.</p> <h2><strong>Woodwork</strong></h2> <p>This is where real care is required: painting windows, door frames and skirting boards with nice straight edges and without getting any drips or splatters on your freshly painted walls. Not once but three times, because you will need primer plus two top coats. It\u2019s fiddly, but there is still an opportunity for some creativity here. \u201cOne trick is to paint the spindles of your stair balustrade dark,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cThat\u2019s quite laborious, but it\u2019s quite a fun thing to do, and it makes a huge difference. It creates this satisfying dark core, a backbone through your house.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49c66a64bcbbb51c6be85b3088f7bf22b5904886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49c66a64bcbbb51c6be85b3088f7bf22b5904886/0_236_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Use tape to mask off areas before painting woodwork\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Use tape to mask off areas before painting woodwork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grafner/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Floors</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI love a painted floor,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cThe rule with painted floors is that they always look much lighter than you expect. Nobody realises how much light bounces on to a floor. If you paint a floor light, it will bounce light all round your room.\u201d It\u2019s also just about the cheapest way to cover a floor there is.</p> <p>You will need a robust, hard-wearing paint. There are specialist floor paints, and some experts even recommend boat paint. It is a big undertaking \u2013 you need to completely empty the room \u2013 but is not that technically challenging. \u201cPainting floors is easy,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cGravity helps. Having said that, you do need to let them cure for a few days before you walk on them.\u201d If you are stuck in two rooms during the lockdown, now might not be the time to restrict yourself to one. You also need to think about what part of the room you are going to end up in when you finish, or you might literally paint yourself into a corner.</p> <h2><strong>Radiators</strong></h2> <p>The factory finish of a modern radiator does not need to be painted but if it is obtrusive, you might want to hide it. In that case, a light sanding and an oil undercoat, followed by \u201cthe eggshell version of the wall\u201d should suffice, says Bulmer. There is such a thing as radiator paint, but it might not come in the colour you need. The radiator should be cold when you paint it and will need to remain off for 24 hours afterwards, so the weather forecast might be a consideration.</p> <h2><strong>Finishing up</strong></h2> <p>Once you have completed the project, Studholme suggests you make a record of all the colours and finishes you have used in case you need to repaint any bits later. Store leftover paint in a cool, dry, frost-free place, ready for touching-up or any other little projects. \u201cLast night, I got on a ladder and painted a square round the mirror above our fireplace,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it might be nice to have a little bit of colour there. It took me probably eight minutes to do it, and I can paint it out again tomorrow if I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Over the course of the past year you may have given idle thought to repainting all or part of your home. In lockdown, you might have decided now is the time. If so, you are not alone: paint companies are still delivering and sales are brisk. But is this really the time to embark on such a project? And can you make a success of it, even if you have never done it before? We asked the experts the best way to go about it. Before you start The good news is, you can save a lot of money by painting your own home, because labour accounts for the majority of decorating costs. The bad news is, there\u2019s a reason painters are expensive. Painting is difficult. The biggest mistake first-timers make is thinking too big, according to Joa Studholme, author of How to Decorate and colour curator for the paint company Farrow &amp; Ball. \u201cMy main piece of advice is to start small,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have a small hall, that can be a good place to start. There you can indulge your fantasies of doing something quite strong and bold, which might be something you\u2019re feeling you want to do right now, but then you don\u2019t have to look at it all day.\u201d Painting a whole room will certainly keep you busy, but if you are new to it, you probably won\u2019t find it terribly therapeutic. \u201cI do it where I think: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m gonna paint this, and it\u2019s gonna be really soothing,\u2019\u201d says Studholme, \u201cAnd, actually, painting is stressful. Smaller things are much better to do.\u201d For beginners, she suggests starting with your front door, or the legs of a table. \u201cPaint the inside of a cupboard in a jolly colour and that will make you smile every time you open it,\u201d she says. When you have some idea of what it entails, you can move on to a room. Choosing colours Lockdown may seem like fertile ground for ill-advised decisions, but Edward Bulmer, an interior designer and head of the Edward Bulmer Natural Paint company, says there may never be a better time to pick colours. \u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s not often that we can contemplate our rooms at all times of day,\u201d he says, \u201cand in varying weathers, and probably with full-on use, if you\u2019ve got your family around.\u201d You can still order sample pots from many companies, including Bulmer\u2019s and Farrow &amp; Ball (delivery times may be a bit longer, but none of us is going anywhere). Instead of applying it to the wall, paint a generous piece of card \u2013 A5 or larger \u2013 or a bit of old wallpaper. \u201cThen place it against the wall round the room and look at it in different lights,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cYou might feel like a right idiot doing it, but that\u2019s the best way to gauge how it\u2019s going to look.\u201d If you don\u2019t know where to begin, try being led by the colours of other surfaces in the room: floors, worktops, tiles, any large bits of furniture. \u201cSome decision that\u2019s already out of your hands,\u201d says Bulmer. Work with what you\u2019ve got. Tools and supplies At the minimum you will need a scraper, masking tape, some sandpaper, filler, ample dust sheets, a decent brush or two, and a roller and tray. \u201cWe advise a medium pile roller, not a foam roller,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cIt will help the paint lay a bit more like it would with a brush.\u201d As for paint, the amount you need varies depending on the type, but five litres of emulsion will cover around 60 square metres. Emulsion is for walls and ceilings; eggshell for woodwork. Cheap paint is probably a false economy, because it won\u2019t go as far. \u201cOne of the expensive ingredients in paint is titanium dioxide, the basic white pigment,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cNormally, to make a paint cheaper you use less of that, so you\u2019ll have less coverage.\u201d Getting ready \u201cPreparation is everything,\u201d says Studholme. Professional painters spend far longer prepping a room than they do painting it. Push all the furniture into the middle of the room and cover it with dust sheets. Scrape away any loose old paint. Fill cracks and nail holes, and sand flat. Sand to create a key (an adhesive surface) for the new paint. Mask the edges of carpet. Apply primer to your walls, and don\u2019t worry too much what it looks like; it\u2019s just there to provide a stable painting surface. The ceiling If you are doing the ceiling, that should be done first; you can get up there with either a ladder or a roller on a pole. Beforehand, paint round the edges where the ceiling meets the wall or any architectural features, using a small brush. You can mask the edges with tape if you are unsure of yourself. Then roll. Expect to come away heavily speckled. The walls Start by \u201ccutting in\u201d the top edge where the wall meets the ceiling, carefully, with a brush, by eye. Do the same along any woodwork edges (you can be a bit less precise here, because you are painting the woodwork later). If this part sounds daunting, Studholme has a simple solution that also happens to be fashionable: paint everything \u2013 walls, ceilings, woodwork \u2013 the same colour. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier for home decorating and it makes the room look bigger,\u201d she says. It\u2019s by no means a radical idea. \u201cThere\u2019s historic precedent for it. Georgian rooms were often painted in one colour.\u201d When it comes to rolling your walls, the main advice is to keep going. \u201cThat\u2019s the single pitfall, really,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cModern emulsion is lovely and quick-drying, but it also means that what you have to do is start, and carry on. Not start, stop, take a phone call and have a cup of coffee.\u201d A stop-start approach yields a streaky finish. Paint a single coat in one go, and let it dry overnight. Two coats should be sufficient in most cases. Woodwork This is where real care is required: painting windows, door frames and skirting boards with nice straight edges and without getting any drips or splatters on your freshly painted walls. Not once but three times, because you will need primer plus two top coats. It\u2019s fiddly, but there is still an opportunity for some creativity here. \u201cOne trick is to paint the spindles of your stair balustrade dark,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cThat\u2019s quite laborious, but it\u2019s quite a fun thing to do, and it makes a huge difference. It creates this satisfying dark core, a backbone through your house.\u201d Floors \u201cI love a painted floor,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cThe rule with painted floors is that they always look much lighter than you expect. Nobody realises how much light bounces on to a floor. If you paint a floor light, it will bounce light all round your room.\u201d It\u2019s also just about the cheapest way to cover a floor there is. You will need a robust, hard-wearing paint. There are specialist floor paints, and some experts even recommend boat paint. It is a big undertaking \u2013 you need to completely empty the room \u2013 but is not that technically challenging. \u201cPainting floors is easy,\u201d says Studholme. \u201cGravity helps. Having said that, you do need to let them cure for a few days before you walk on them.\u201d If you are stuck in two rooms during the lockdown, now might not be the time to restrict yourself to one. You also need to think about what part of the room you are going to end up in when you finish, or you might literally paint yourself into a corner. Radiators The factory finish of a modern radiator does not need to be painted but if it is obtrusive, you might want to hide it. In that case, a light sanding and an oil undercoat, followed by \u201cthe eggshell version of the wall\u201d should suffice, says Bulmer. There is such a thing as radiator paint, but it might not come in the colour you need. The radiator should be cold when you paint it and will need to remain off for 24 hours afterwards, so the weather forecast might be a consideration. Finishing up Once you have completed the project, Studholme suggests you make a record of all the colours and finishes you have used in case you need to repaint any bits later. Store leftover paint in a cool, dry, frost-free place, ready for touching-up or any other little projects. \u201cLast night, I got on a ladder and painted a square round the mirror above our fireplace,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it might be nice to have a little bit of colour there. It took me probably eight minutes to do it, and I can paint it out again tomorrow if I don\u2019t like it.\u201d",

Inspired by the recent social media trend, Jane, her husband Chris, their son Nick and daughter Amy \u2013 who are all in lockdown together \u2013 set themselves an Easter challenge to recreate a classic artwork using things they already had at home. To achieve the image, they took four separate shots in their back garden \u2013 changing costumes and poses between each \u2013 and then stitched the photos together digitally. \u201cMy husband kept saying: \u2018We\u2019ve got to be quick because the light keeps changing.\u2019 He was putting us under loads of pressure.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, <b>more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries</b>, according to the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a>.</p>\n    <p>There have been <b>over 69,500 deaths globally</b>. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.</p>\n    <p>More than <b>264,000 people are recorded as having recovered</b> from the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Huanan seafood wholesale market in central Wuhan was the kind of place where people often caught colds. Vendors started setting up as early as 3am, plunging their hands into buckets of cold water as they cleaned and prepared produce for the customers that arrived every morning.</p> \n<p>The sprawling market of more than 20 streets spanned two sides of a main road in an upscale neighbourhood of the commercial district of Hankou. Racks of meat were hung on hooks or spilled out on plastic mats. Workers walked around in welly boots. Drains lined the kerb alongside stores selling everything from live poultry to seafood and cooking ingredients. It was crowded but clean.</p> \n<p>So, in mid-December when Lan, who sold dried seafood at one of more than 1,000 stalls in Huanan, felt unwell, he thought little of it.</p> \n<p>He stayed home to rest but after losing 3kg in just a few days, he decided to go to his regular hospital for a check up.</p> \n<p>From there he was sent to a hospital that specialises in infectious diseases and was admitted on 19 December. He remembers how the staff praised his positive attitude. \u201cI was just a little bit sick. I wasn\u2019t scared in the slightest,\u201d said Lan, who asked not to disclose his full name.</p> \n<p>Lan could not have known then that he was among the first cases of a new, highly contagious coronavirus that would kill more than 2,500 people in his city and engulf the world, infecting more than 1.6 million people so far and killing more than 95,000. The World Health Organization has described the outbreak of Covid-19 as the worst global crisis since the second world war. \u201cI thought I had a cold. I had no idea,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus infections began cropping up in Wuhan in December \u2013 and reportedly as early as November \u2013 but the Chinese authorities did not inform the public that the virus could pass between humans until late January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241/0_364_5461_3277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, as China celebrates what it claims is victory over the disease, the number of infections and deaths is increasing around the world. Officials from Australia, the US and the UK have accused Beijing of suppressing information, allowing a localised outbreak to turn into a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Beijing claims its strict lockdowns bought the world time that health authorities in some countries chose to squander. But interviews with early patients, medical workers and residents, as well as leaked internal documents, accounts from whistleblowers and research studies, show delays in the first few weeks of the epidemic, government missteps that would have far-reaching consequences.</p> \n<h2>Human-to-human transmission</h2> \n<p>By the end of December, before Lan recovered after more than 20 days in hospital, word had gotten out in Wuhan about a mystery illness. Internet users circulated screenshots of a WeChat conversation on 30 December in which a doctor at Wuhan Red Cross hospital, Liu Wen, warned colleagues of confirmed cases of a contagious coronavirus at another hospital. \u201cWash your hands! Face masks! Gloves!\u201d the medic wrote.</p> \n<p>That same day an ophthalmologist at Wuhan central hospital named Li Wenliang told a WeChat group of former medical school classmates that seven people at his hospital had contracted what he believed to be Sars, the outbreak that killed more than 600 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1/0_24_5745_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An \u201curgent notice\u201d from the Wuhan health commission warning of \u201csuccessive cases of unknown pneumonia\u201d was also leaked and posted online on 30 December. The statement ordered hospitals to \u201cstrengthen responsible leadership\u201d and ensure that no one \u201cdisclose information to the public without authorisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under growing pressure, the following day the health commission said researchers were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, its first official notice about the virus. There was no \u201cobvious evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the statement said, describing the outbreak as linked to the seafood market and assuring the public that all patients had been quarantined and their contacts placed under observation. \u201cThe disease is preventable and controllable,\u201d it added.</p> \n<p>A day later, on 1 January, the Huanan seafood market was closed and Wuhan\u2019s public security bureau announced that eight people had been \u201cpunished\u201d for spreading rumours. Authorities also tasked hospitals to screen for pneumonia cases linked to the market. It wasn\u2019t until 20 January that vendors in the market were asked to submit to temperature checks and blood tests.</p> \n<p>But across the Yangtze River, some 6 miles (10km) away, people who had never been to the market were falling sick. In the second week of January, Coco Han, 22, developed a cough she couldn\u2019t shake.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3deca7accfd51e95a50b8060a9ac7def9d4abf4b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3deca7accfd51e95a50b8060a9ac7def9d4abf4b/0_340_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Han, 22, in Wuhan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco Han, 22, in Wuhan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After a week, she went to see her local clinic on 20 January and had a CT scan done. The results showed an infection on her lungs. A medic in a full hazmat suit escorted her to another hospital for more tests.</p> \n<p>Han\u2019s mother joined her in a crowded waiting room where those waiting began to panic. Han had a mask but her mother had not thought to wear one, given the government\u2019s assurance. A young woman in line in front of them fainted and Han\u2019s mother hugged her, telling Han not to look.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe all knew we might have the virus. Everyone was scared,\u201d Han said. \u201cI think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn\u2019t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Han was told that she probably had \u201cthat pneumonia\u201d, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn\u2019t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Daron Hu, 35, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on 16 January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south.</p> \n<p>By the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of 20 January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission.</p> \n<p>Hu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next 24 days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. \u201cI saw some people give up.

      "bodyText": "The Huanan seafood wholesale market in central Wuhan was the kind of place where people often caught colds. Vendors started setting up as early as 3am, plunging their hands into buckets of cold water as they cleaned and prepared produce for the customers that arrived every morning. The sprawling market of more than 20 streets spanned two sides of a main road in an upscale neighbourhood of the commercial district of Hankou. Racks of meat were hung on hooks or spilled out on plastic mats. Workers walked around in welly boots. Drains lined the kerb alongside stores selling everything from live poultry to seafood and cooking ingredients. It was crowded but clean. So, in mid-December when Lan, who sold dried seafood at one of more than 1,000 stalls in Huanan, felt unwell, he thought little of it. He stayed home to rest but after losing 3kg in just a few days, he decided to go to his regular hospital for a check up. From there he was sent to a hospital that specialises in infectious diseases and was admitted on 19 December. He remembers how the staff praised his positive attitude. \u201cI was just a little bit sick. I wasn\u2019t scared in the slightest,\u201d said Lan, who asked not to disclose his full name. Lan could not have known then that he was among the first cases of a new, highly contagious coronavirus that would kill more than 2,500 people in his city and engulf the world, infecting more than 1.6 million people so far and killing more than 95,000. The World Health Organization has described the outbreak of Covid-19 as the worst global crisis since the second world war. \u201cI thought I had a cold. I had no idea,\u201d he said. Coronavirus infections began cropping up in Wuhan in December \u2013 and reportedly as early as November \u2013 but the Chinese authorities did not inform the public that the virus could pass between humans until late January. Now, as China celebrates what it claims is victory over the disease, the number of infections and deaths is increasing around the world. Officials from Australia, the US and the UK have accused Beijing of suppressing information, allowing a localised outbreak to turn into a pandemic. Beijing claims its strict lockdowns bought the world time that health authorities in some countries chose to squander. But interviews with early patients, medical workers and residents, as well as leaked internal documents, accounts from whistleblowers and research studies, show delays in the first few weeks of the epidemic, government missteps that would have far-reaching consequences. Human-to-human transmission By the end of December, before Lan recovered after more than 20 days in hospital, word had gotten out in Wuhan about a mystery illness. Internet users circulated screenshots of a WeChat conversation on 30 December in which a doctor at Wuhan Red Cross hospital, Liu Wen, warned colleagues of confirmed cases of a contagious coronavirus at another hospital. \u201cWash your hands! Face masks! Gloves!\u201d the medic wrote. That same day an ophthalmologist at Wuhan central hospital named Li Wenliang told a WeChat group of former medical school classmates that seven people at his hospital had contracted what he believed to be Sars, the outbreak that killed more than 600 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03. An \u201curgent notice\u201d from the Wuhan health commission warning of \u201csuccessive cases of unknown pneumonia\u201d was also leaked and posted online on 30 December. The statement ordered hospitals to \u201cstrengthen responsible leadership\u201d and ensure that no one \u201cdisclose information to the public without authorisation.\u201d Under growing pressure, the following day the health commission said researchers were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, its first official notice about the virus. There was no \u201cobvious evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the statement said, describing the outbreak as linked to the seafood market and assuring the public that all patients had been quarantined and their contacts placed under observation. \u201cThe disease is preventable and controllable,\u201d it added. A day later, on 1 January, the Huanan seafood market was closed and Wuhan\u2019s public security bureau announced that eight people had been \u201cpunished\u201d for spreading rumours. Authorities also tasked hospitals to screen for pneumonia cases linked to the market. It wasn\u2019t until 20 January that vendors in the market were asked to submit to temperature checks and blood tests. But across the Yangtze River, some 6 miles (10km) away, people who had never been to the market were falling sick. In the second week of January, Coco Han, 22, developed a cough she couldn\u2019t shake. After a week, she went to see her local clinic on 20 January and had a CT scan done. The results showed an infection on her lungs. A medic in a full hazmat suit escorted her to another hospital for more tests. Han\u2019s mother joined her in a crowded waiting room where those waiting began to panic. Han had a mask but her mother had not thought to wear one, given the government\u2019s assurance. A young woman in line in front of them fainted and Han\u2019s mother hugged her, telling Han not to look. \u201cWe all knew we might have the virus. Everyone was scared,\u201d Han said. \u201cI think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn\u2019t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.\u201d While Han was told that she probably had \u201cthat pneumonia\u201d, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others. \u201cI was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn\u2019t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,\u201d she said. Daron Hu, 35, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on 16 January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south. By the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of 20 January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission. Hu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next 24 days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. \u201cI saw some people give up. It is very lonely,\u201d Hu said. \u2018Things felt out of control\u2019 By the time officials revealed the infectiousness of the virus, hospitals in Wuhan were already overwhelmed and the numbers increased after the announcement. Video taken on 22 and 23 January showed crowds of patients at Wuhan No 6 hospital in Wuchang, another district of Wuhan. \u201cIt was so busy.

      "body": "<p>Sunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns\">causing outrage</a>. The police are involved; the parks may be shut.</p> \n<p>Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong?</p> \n<p>Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people\u2019s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don\u2019t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don\u2019t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic <em> </em>in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don\u2019t harm anyone else \u2013 they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?</p> \n<p>Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between individual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.</p> \n<p>It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/03/john-stuart-mill-on-liberty-100-best-nonfiction-books-review-robert-mccrum\">John Stuart Mill</a> said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.</p> \n<p>But if you can do that while making yourself happier \u2013 by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown \u2013 it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/lockdown-viral-trends-5g-towers-coronavirus-cases\">righteous fury</a>, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home.

      "bodyText": "Sunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is causing outrage. The police are involved; the parks may be shut. Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong? Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people\u2019s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don\u2019t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don\u2019t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don\u2019t harm anyone else \u2013 they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that? Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between individual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer. It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, John Stuart Mill said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people. But if you can do that while making yourself happier \u2013 by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown \u2013 it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a righteous fury, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong. Can that really be true? Immanuel Kant thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair. If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time.

Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space. Lockdown reinforces existing social inequalities.

I think it\u2019s magnificent. But then again, I haven\u2019t left my flat for three weeks and just ate a whole a jar of jalape\u00f1os. Chai No More Cake Cabin fever or not, this box-of-frogs whopper from artsy Japanese four-piece Chai absolutely bangs. \u201cLook at you, that\u2019s way too much / Your face is made up like a cake!\u201d they wail in prissy unison, over what sounds for all the world like Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s Army of Me and Nine Inch Nails\u2019s Closer nipple-twisting each other to death at a sexy party. The cake is a metaphor for makeup. Of course it is. PartyNextDoor ft Rihanna Believe It Where has Rihanna been? Not a peep from her for three years, then out of nowhere she sticks her head above the parapet to wibble five words on this not wholly unpleasant yet instantly forgettable conjugal jam, before she\u2019s off again, disparu. Lovely to hear her dulcets, but for the Ri-Public this\u2019ll be like a nicotine patch, or screaming into a pillow because you want to go outside: it\u2019ll take the edge off, but not for long. Jess Williamson Infinite Scroll \u201cTime did unfold like an infinite scroll\u201d seems prescient at the moment, but rather than watching all three Lord of the Rings films while you languish in the Ocado queue, Austin tunester Williamson is deconstructing society\u2019s addiction to social media, making its languid desert-pop genuinely heartbreaking. Kings of Leon Going Nowhere Few phrases these days conjure as little excitement as \u201cthere\u2019s a new Kings of Leon song\u201d. And this is basically Oasis\u2019s Songbird, only with all that song\u2019s affable, doofus charm sucked out, so it sort of just plods hither and thither like a dying dog.

Since an Italian missionary was identified as CAR\u2019s first coronavirus case last month, xenophobia has been on the rise. Stories widely published in the country\u2019s newspapers and on social media have portrayed foreigners as unwelcome importers of a disease that could further impoverish the country. Thousands of non-nationals are employed in CAR by UN agencies and aid organisations, which provide about 70% of the country\u2019s health services. The UN has extended a curfew for employees due to \u201crecent incidents of verbal aggression and intimidation as well as risks of stigmatisation of UN staff, international NGOs and humanitarian actors\u201d, according to an internal memo. The UN peacekeeping force has suspended most internal travel and stopped bringing in new contingents of \u201cblue helmets\u201d. Alarmist rhetoric in CAR\u2019s media is stoking animosity. One tabloid has accused Emmanuel Macron\u2019s administration in France of using coronavirus \u201cto destabilise French-speaking African countries\u201d. Others described the arrival of the infected Italian as \u201cthe poisoning of an entire people\u201d and have raged about \u201ca genocide\u201d against Africans. \u201cThe spike in threats and violence against foreigners and humanitarian personnel, also spread by the media, pose significant safety and security risks that can result in reduced operations when they are needed the most,\u201d said the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) in a recent report. \u201cThe aid pipeline could face ruptures and stock-outs, depriving the most affected people from the only existing safety net.\u201d Humanitarian groups fear the impact of the pandemic in CAR could be disastrous.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, each NHS trust would send out individual emails of the number of people who had died. Now the daily totals are approaching the 1,000 mark, we are down to one global email per day. It feels as if so many people are losing their individual identity and just becoming a statistic. So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease. Just so that he and thousands of others like him don\u2019t get forgotten.</p> <p>Pete wasn\u2019t a close friend: more of a friend of a friend and someone my wife would join on long weekend walks. But he was a lovely man. He was at Exeter University several years before me \u2013 he took his studies so seriously, it took him four years to complete a three-year degree \u2013 but photos from that time show him as a dead ringer for Steely Dan\u2019s Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter. He was also known for driving his motorbike far too fast and for crashing cars. On leaving Exeter, he went on to establish his own communications business in Brighton and was heavily involved in several charities working in India and Africa. He is survived by his wife, Heidi, and his two children. My heart goes out to them. It\u2019s still not clear what the rules are for funerals in the time of the coronavirus but it will undoubtedly be a scaled back affair. Sometime, when this horror is all over, we will have a party to remember him properly. And for all the many others whose deaths were merely reported as a grim number at the daily Downing Street press conference.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I found myself totally unsettled by the news that Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. So much so, that I had to switch off Twitter and stop watching the news: even though it is literally my job to watch the news. Part of the shock was that less than three hours earlier, Dominic Raab had insisted at the Downing Street press conference that Boris had only gone to hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">as a precaution</a> and was basically still in charge of the country. So the only possible conclusion was that Raab had lied about the gravity of Boris\u2019s condition or that, even as de facto deputy prime minister, he had not been kept in the loop. Neither of which inspired much confidence in the government. If we couldn\u2019t trust the government to tell the truth about something so critical as the prime minister\u2019s health, why should we trust it to tell the truth about anything else? The No 10 communications team really needs to start upping its game: we\u2019re long past the point where serious news can be withheld for a few hours. But mostly my shock at the deterioration of Boris\u2019s condition was on a more existential level. You can dislike his politics and think little of of his suitability as prime minister, but he is still the country\u2019s leader. At a very basic, psychoanalytical level Boris is the country\u2019s daddy. And no one ever wants to lose their dad, no matter how crap a dad he has been. We want our parents to be strong. Invincible, even. The last thing we want is proof that the coronavirus really is totally indiscriminate.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Finding ways of filling up the days \u2013 other than with work \u2013 is proving to be more and more of a challenge. I have had two more goes at Hilary Mantel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review-thomas-cromwell\">The Mirror and the Light</a> but still haven\u2019t got the concentration to get past the first four pages. That makes it six attempts at the book so far, but it\u2019s testament to the power of the writing that I have been gripped on each occasion. By this time next week, I am determined to make it to at least page six. My wife is rather more inventive than me and had found on Twitter the #GettyMuseumChallenge, which encouraged everyone to recreate works of art using objects they had lying around the house. After a great deal of passive resistance from me \u2013 \u201cWhy on earth would I want to do that?\u201d \u2013 Jill persuaded me to join her as Piero della Francesca\u2019s Duke and Duchess of Urbino.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48/0_693_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her costume was constructed using some lace bought from a French market some years ago, along with a pair of headphones covered with tin foil and a paper flower.

      "bodyText": "Monday In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, each NHS trust would send out individual emails of the number of people who had died. Now the daily totals are approaching the 1,000 mark, we are down to one global email per day. It feels as if so many people are losing their individual identity and just becoming a statistic. So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease. Just so that he and thousands of others like him don\u2019t get forgotten. Pete wasn\u2019t a close friend: more of a friend of a friend and someone my wife would join on long weekend walks. But he was a lovely man. He was at Exeter University several years before me \u2013 he took his studies so seriously, it took him four years to complete a three-year degree \u2013 but photos from that time show him as a dead ringer for Steely Dan\u2019s Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter. He was also known for driving his motorbike far too fast and for crashing cars. On leaving Exeter, he went on to establish his own communications business in Brighton and was heavily involved in several charities working in India and Africa. He is survived by his wife, Heidi, and his two children. My heart goes out to them. It\u2019s still not clear what the rules are for funerals in the time of the coronavirus but it will undoubtedly be a scaled back affair. Sometime, when this horror is all over, we will have a party to remember him properly. And for all the many others whose deaths were merely reported as a grim number at the daily Downing Street press conference. Tuesday I found myself totally unsettled by the news that Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. So much so, that I had to switch off Twitter and stop watching the news: even though it is literally my job to watch the news. Part of the shock was that less than three hours earlier, Dominic Raab had insisted at the Downing Street press conference that Boris had only gone to hospital as a precaution and was basically still in charge of the country. So the only possible conclusion was that Raab had lied about the gravity of Boris\u2019s condition or that, even as de facto deputy prime minister, he had not been kept in the loop. Neither of which inspired much confidence in the government. If we couldn\u2019t trust the government to tell the truth about something so critical as the prime minister\u2019s health, why should we trust it to tell the truth about anything else? The No 10 communications team really needs to start upping its game: we\u2019re long past the point where serious news can be withheld for a few hours. But mostly my shock at the deterioration of Boris\u2019s condition was on a more existential level. You can dislike his politics and think little of of his suitability as prime minister, but he is still the country\u2019s leader. At a very basic, psychoanalytical level Boris is the country\u2019s daddy. And no one ever wants to lose their dad, no matter how crap a dad he has been. We want our parents to be strong. Invincible, even. The last thing we want is proof that the coronavirus really is totally indiscriminate. Wednesday Finding ways of filling up the days \u2013 other than with work \u2013 is proving to be more and more of a challenge. I have had two more goes at Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Mirror and the Light but still haven\u2019t got the concentration to get past the first four pages. That makes it six attempts at the book so far, but it\u2019s testament to the power of the writing that I have been gripped on each occasion. By this time next week, I am determined to make it to at least page six. My wife is rather more inventive than me and had found on Twitter the #GettyMuseumChallenge, which encouraged everyone to recreate works of art using objects they had lying around the house. After a great deal of passive resistance from me \u2013 \u201cWhy on earth would I want to do that?\u201d \u2013 Jill persuaded me to join her as Piero della Francesca\u2019s Duke and Duchess of Urbino. Her costume was constructed using some lace bought from a French market some years ago, along with a pair of headphones covered with tin foil and a paper flower. Mine was made from some red felt, left over from making one of the children\u2019s Christmas stockings, rounded off with a heavy Le Creuset saucepan for the head gear. It certainly had the necessary gravitas. Once the pictures were taken against the kitchen wall, our son Photoshopped them into the appropriate frame and we posted the diptych on Twitter and got a wonderful response from many people. Apart from the bloke who suggested I should have gone the whole hog and broken my nose like the original duke. Now our fame is to be extended further. Yesterday I got an email from a producer working on a TV film Grayson Perry is making about creativity in lockdown, requesting permission to use our photo. A Bafta surely must be in the offing. Thursday I have spent most of the football season wishing Spurs could play rather more like Liverpool and less like a bunch of bored, non-league players.

But now spring is here, we thought it was a good time to freshen it up, and we hope you like the new changes as much as we do. Global coronavirus cases pass 1.6m amid fears of second wave Confirmed coronavirus deaths around the world have exceeded 95,000 and there are at least 1.6m cases. Countries including Spain and Italy report their rates of infection are beginning to plateau while others, such as Russia, announce record 24-hour rises. Many countries now enter the Easter and Passover holidays, or look towards the Ramadan month of fasting, as citizens are told to continue to abide by physical distancing measures. Warnings. Despite Trump\u2019s claims, the World Health Organization warned of the human-to-human transmission risk as early as 10 January and urged precautions, though it did tweet days later appearing to contradict itself. Ignored. Many of the WHO\u2019s most powerful members snubbed its advice and are now playing catch-up or suffering consequences, while the organisation, whose budget is smaller than many hospitals, is caught in US-China rivalry. Record NY Covid-19 deaths as state hires burial laborers New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus toll for the third consecutive day on Wednesday as 799 deaths were announced. City officials have contracted laborers to bury the rising number of victims in an area long used to bury those with no known next of kin. The state governor, Andrew Cuomo, warned the effect of the outbreak on the state\u2019s economy was expected to be more devastating than 9/11 and pointed to the 1918 Spanish flu, which came in three waves. Tribute. Frank Gabrin, 60, America\u2019s first ER doctor to die treating Covid-19 patients, had voiced concerns over the lack of protective equipment at New York hospitals and had worn the same mask for several shifts. Death toll. The infectious diseases chief, Anthony Fauci, has dismissed baseless \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d that the official number of US deaths from Covid-19 has been overstated after claims on rightwing media. Bolthole. A businessman from Manhattan rented a mansion with a bowling alley in Long Island \u2013 now one of the worst-hit areas of New York state \u2013 for almost $2m until the end of September in an attempt to flee the pandemic. US unemployment rises 6.6m in a week as shutdowns reverberate More people have been put out of work in the last three weeks than in the two years of the last recession, with 16m jobs gone in the past three weeks, including more than 6.6m in the past seven days. Job losses are rising in every state and economists are predicting the unemployment rate will soon reach 15% or higher, unprecedented in the postwar era. The largest increases were in California (up 871,992), New York (up 286,596), Michigan (up 176,329) and Florida (up 154,171). Depression, not recession. Economists have warned that unemployment in Britain and the US could surpass the levels reached during the 1930s Great Depression within months, following a never-seen-before business collapse. In other news\u2026 LGBTQ rights pioneer Phyllis Lyon, who was among the first to marry another woman in California, has died at her home aged 95. Tributes have said her courage changed the course of history. Two former 21st Century Fox executives have pleaded not guilty to bribery scheme charges for lucrative football tournament broadcast rights, as the US government continues to investigation corruption in the sport. Hamas security forces in the Gaza Strip arrested local peace campaigners for \u201cestablishing normalisation activities with the Israeli occupation\u201d after they held a virtual conference with Israeli activists. Joe Biden faces a deeply uncertain election in a transformed political and economic landscape, with the Democratic nominee-in-waiting due to speak with Trump to discuss the federal Covid-19 response this week . Must-reads The inequality virus: how the pandemic hit America\u2019s poorest Without European-style welfare nor public healthcare, workers employed on precarious contracts in the US are particularly vulnerable to sudden shocks, casting doubt on the president\u2019s claims of a strong economy, with four in 10 workers believed not to have even $400 in savings.

      "body": "<p>The volume of food that would otherwise be wasted and is received every week by the UK\u2019s largest food redistribution charity has more than doubled since the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>In a better-than-average \u201cgood week\u201d FareShare would typically be given 350 tonnes of food via its 24 regional distribution centres, but this has soared to 711 tonnes a week after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country, it has revealed.</p> <p>The organisation takes good quality surplus food from across the industry \u2013 direct from suppliers as well as from supermarkets \u2013 and redistributes it to almost 11,000 frontline charities and community groups. This typically provides 1m meals a week to vulnerable and needy people, along with essentials for regional food banks run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/more-people-than-ever-turning-to-food-banks-charity-says\">the Trussell Trust</a> and smaller local projects.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Lindsay Boswell, said the organisation had \u201cripped up\u201d its business model in order to adjust to the unprecedented disruption to the food and drink supply chain triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been real plate-spinning,\u201d said Boswell. \u201cIn the early phase we suffered from a complete collapse in food donations as shoppers rushed out to panic buy and demand soared. That was very worrying. Then the government\u2019s decision to close food service companies opened the floodgates.</p> <p>\u201cWith diminishing numbers of volunteers due to self-isolation we had to channel all our resources into making sure it was collected on time and not wasted.\u201d Without physical distancing restrictions the organisation would probably be tripling its flow of food, he estimates. There has also been a switch in focus from providing food for meals to assembling food parcels.</p> <p>Boswell says virtually all donations have been gratefully received although there had been some \u201cwell-motivated offers, including a pantechnicon full of iceberg lettuces\u201d which could not be used due to a massive amount of existing salad crop. Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/food-banks\">food banks</a> and rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness\">homelessness </a>in the UK.</p> <p>But wholesalers have been struggling to deal with tens of thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and dairy products no longer required by restaurants, hotels and schools.</p> <p>As much as \u00a320m of food with a shelf life of less than three months was at one stage lying in warehouses, according to the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/london-pubs-cinemas-and-gyms-may-close-in-covid-19-clampdown\">ordered the closure</a> of millions of hospitality businesses around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Boswell added: \u201cAn estimated 35% of the calories we consume are outside the home. So if you think of all those meals, whether school lunches or going out to restaurants in the evening \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of food that now has nowhere to go.\u201d</p> <p>In London FareShare has partnered with the capital\u2019s two other major food redistribution charities \u2013 City Harvest and the Felix Project \u2013 to provide a more targeted emergency response service for Londoners during the coronavirus crisis. The three organisations have formed the London Food Alliance, with each taking the lead in a designated borough to help distribute food to people in local communities.</p> <p>It is now boosting its 1,500-strong army of volunteers, helped by a new partnership with the British Red Cross, and in a single week it received more volunteer applications than for the whole of last year. \u201cWe regard many new volunteers as the fifth cavalry \u2013 we may not need you now but we will,\u201d said Boswell. A call for experienced forklift operators led to 24 qualified people responding within just two hours.</p> <p>As well as routinely supplying surplus food, FareShare\u2019s major supermarket partners are also providing \u201ctop up\u201d food as well as funding to help with logistics. This week the Co-op convenience store chain scrapped its \u00a32.5m Easter advertising campaign and will instead use the airtime to encourage viewers to donate to FareShare.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The volume of food that would otherwise be wasted and is received every week by the UK\u2019s largest food redistribution charity has more than doubled since the coronavirus lockdown. In a better-than-average \u201cgood week\u201d FareShare would typically be given 350 tonnes of food via its 24 regional distribution centres, but this has soared to 711 tonnes a week after the government ordered the closure of millions of hospitality businesses around the country, it has revealed. The organisation takes good quality surplus food from across the industry \u2013 direct from suppliers as well as from supermarkets \u2013 and redistributes it to almost 11,000 frontline charities and community groups. This typically provides 1m meals a week to vulnerable and needy people, along with essentials for regional food banks run by the Trussell Trust and smaller local projects. Its chief executive, Lindsay Boswell, said the organisation had \u201cripped up\u201d its business model in order to adjust to the unprecedented disruption to the food and drink supply chain triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s been real plate-spinning,\u201d said Boswell. \u201cIn the early phase we suffered from a complete collapse in food donations as shoppers rushed out to panic buy and demand soared. That was very worrying. Then the government\u2019s decision to close food service companies opened the floodgates. \u201cWith diminishing numbers of volunteers due to self-isolation we had to channel all our resources into making sure it was collected on time and not wasted.\u201d Without physical distancing restrictions the organisation would probably be tripling its flow of food, he estimates. There has also been a switch in focus from providing food for meals to assembling food parcels. Boswell says virtually all donations have been gratefully received although there had been some \u201cwell-motivated offers, including a pantechnicon full of iceberg lettuces\u201d which could not be used due to a massive amount of existing salad crop. Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus, demand for surplus food had soared against a background of growing dependence on food banks and rising homelessness in the UK. But wholesalers have been struggling to deal with tens of thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables, fresh meat and dairy products no longer required by restaurants, hotels and schools. As much as \u00a320m of food with a shelf life of less than three months was at one stage lying in warehouses, according to the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, after the government ordered the closure of millions of hospitality businesses around the country. Boswell added: \u201cAn estimated 35% of the calories we consume are outside the home. So if you think of all those meals, whether school lunches or going out to restaurants in the evening \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of food that now has nowhere to go.\u201d In London FareShare has partnered with the capital\u2019s two other major food redistribution charities \u2013 City Harvest and the Felix Project \u2013 to provide a more targeted emergency response service for Londoners during the coronavirus crisis. The three organisations have formed the London Food Alliance, with each taking the lead in a designated borough to help distribute food to people in local communities. It is now boosting its 1,500-strong army of volunteers, helped by a new partnership with the British Red Cross, and in a single week it received more volunteer applications than for the whole of last year. \u201cWe regard many new volunteers as the fifth cavalry \u2013 we may not need you now but we will,\u201d said Boswell. A call for experienced forklift operators led to 24 qualified people responding within just two hours. As well as routinely supplying surplus food, FareShare\u2019s major supermarket partners are also providing \u201ctop up\u201d food as well as funding to help with logistics. This week the Co-op convenience store chain scrapped its \u00a32.5m Easter advertising campaign and will instead use the airtime to encourage viewers to donate to FareShare.",

And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,\u201d she adds with a chuckle.</p> <p>Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals \u2013 World Cup Willie \u2013 and separated the tournament\u2019s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery.</p> <p>\u201cDad brought it home [after it had been recovered] and he actually slept with it under the bed until we won it,\u201d recalls Ferris. \u201cAnd then it went to a special place to be displayed.

I\u2019ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog.

First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.\u201d</p> <p>When Nobby Stiles\u2019 contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris\u2019s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles.</p> <p>Follows\u2019 journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students.</p> <p>In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. \u201cIn a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,\u201d says Ferris. \u201cHe could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/28/coe-and-ovetts-olympic-debt-to-bureaucrat-who-defied-thatcher\">Coe and Ovett's Olympic debt to bureaucrat who defied Thatcher | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer.

      "bodyText": "Much has been made of the Football Association\u2019s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women\u2019s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows \u2013 the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus \u2013 into its Sport Hall of Fame. The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women\u2019s football \u2013 which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women\u2019s Football Association \u2013 happened by chance. Follows\u2019s daughter, Maggie Ferris \u2013 another Nottingham alumnus \u2013 mentioned her father in a routine fundraising phone call with the university. The student that jotted down a few notes from their call took them away and soon afterwards the university and Ferris began to explore the history of a man who had a firm belief in equality and a person\u2019s right to play sport and felt the lifting of the ban was natural. \u201cHe was always campaigning about things,\u201d explains Ferris. \u201cThat was just part of what he was. And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,\u201d she adds with a chuckle. Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals \u2013 World Cup Willie \u2013 and separated the tournament\u2019s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery. \u201cDad brought it home [after it had been recovered] and he actually slept with it under the bed until we won it,\u201d recalls Ferris. \u201cAnd then it went to a special place to be displayed. When it was due to be taken to Mexico for the 1970 World Cup there was a real issue of how they were going to get it there. \u201cThe Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I\u2019ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.\u201d When Nobby Stiles\u2019 contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris\u2019s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles. Follows\u2019 journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students. In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. \u201cIn a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,\u201d says Ferris. \u201cHe could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.\u201d Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. After the war that enabled him to become general secretary of Balpa. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962. His dual career paths gave him a unique role in the Munich air disaster in 1958. \u201cWhen there was the the crash with the Busby Babes in it Dad was the general secretary of Balpa, but he was also treasurer of the FA,\u201d explains Ferris. Follows became the union representative of the pilot, Captain James Thain, who was initially blamed for the crash, and spent more than a decade working on the case to clear his name. \u201cInitially he was a scapegoat, guilty [of failing] to clear the ice on the wings despite witnesses saying there was no ice, but Dad got him cleared in 1968,\u201d says Ferris. Three years later Follows drafted the letter that would lift the ban on women\u2019s football. \u201cI knew about it being reversed,\u201d says Ferris, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know about the ban [coming into force] in the 20s. I just knew that there wasn\u2019t any women\u2019s football and accepted that as the status quo.\u201d It would be one of his last big acts at the FA \u2013 he left less than two years later and became chairman of the British Olympics Association in 1977. He saw off intense pressure from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, defending the right of British athletes to compete at the Games. \u201cThat was so stressful,\u201d remembers Ferris. \u201cI think that led to him having his first heart attack.

Most of the cases we\u2019ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There\u2019s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>A total of 6,203 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Australia, and there have been 54 deaths. New South Wales remains the state hardest hit, and Sydney in particular.</p> \n  <h2>NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order</h2> \n  <p>Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/10/nsw-minister-don-harwin-fined-1000-for-breaching-coronavirus-public-health-order\">breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order</a>. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, accepted his resignation.</p> \n  <h2>Doubt cast over NRL\u2019s return</h2> \n  <p>A day after the NRL <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/09/nrl-2020-season-restart-decision\">revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May,</a> the league\u2019s plans showed signs of unravelling. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he had not been consulted on the league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time, while the commonwealth deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/10/nrl-restart-date-paul-kelly-brad-hazzard\">expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon</a>.</p> \n  <h2>Australians warned not to travel over Easter</h2> \n  <p>State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/09/australians-warned-to-avoid-all-non-essential-travel-over-easter-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">over the Easter holidays</a>, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those breaching social distancing laws by travelling.</p> \n  <h2>Queensland highlights \u2018Covid-19 hot spots\u2019 in NSW</h2> \n  <p>Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state.

Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days.

home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order.</p> \n  <p>While Harwin maintained he had sought, and followed, official advice on whether he was allowed to relocate to his holiday home, he accepted the controversy surrounding his move \u2013 as the government was urging people to stay home over Easter \u2013 was a \u201cdistraction\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Berejiklian accepted Harwin\u2019s resignation, issuing a statement:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>During this health crisis my government has asked the community to make greater sacrifices than all of us have ever had to make before.</p> \n   <p>These sacrifices are saving lives, and I am proud of the people of NSW for continuing to uphold the law in the interest of public health.</p> \n   <p>Late last night I was advised minister Don Harwin had been fined $1,000 for breaching a public health order.</p> \n   <p>The police, who have been tasked by my government with enforcing these health orders, came to the conclusion that minister Harwin breached the order.</p> \n   <p>Whilst minister Harwin has served the people of NSW well, and he continues to assure me that he did not break the rules, the orders in

This long weekend, stay home, stay well, save lives. Australia\u2019s new infection rate continues to slow The commonwealth deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, says that \u201cthe curve is definitely decreasing\u201d, the result of the border closures of a little over a fortnight ago and the social distancing measures enacted. I would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we\u2019ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There\u2019s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. A total of 6,203 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Australia, and there have been 54 deaths. New South Wales remains the state hardest hit, and Sydney in particular. NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, accepted his resignation. Doubt cast over NRL\u2019s return A day after the NRL revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May, the league\u2019s plans showed signs of unravelling. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he had not been consulted on the league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time, while the commonwealth deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon. Australians warned not to travel over Easter State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel over the Easter holidays, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those breaching social distancing laws by travelling. Queensland highlights \u2018Covid-19 hot spots\u2019 in NSW Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state. The state\u2019s chief medical officer posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW. Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days. It marks the first time Australians have been required to quarantine for travelling from a specific part of the country. Chef Pete Evans\u2019 recipe to treat Covid condemned Peak medical groups have criticised the Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans for suggesting that a $15,000 \u201csubtle energy platform\u201d could be used to treat coronavirus, saying such claims are baseless, ill-informed and dangerous. Evans, a television host and paleo diet enthusiast who has previously promoted anti-vaccination ideas, was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u2013 dismissed by the Australian Medical Association as a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d \u2013 for $14,990 on his website. Evans\u2019 ad said the machine was a \u201csubtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d. Covid-19 has so far infected more than 1.6 million people globally and killed 95,000. It has ground economies to a halt all over the world and has the potential to force hundreds of millions into poverty. There is no evidence that it can be treated or cured by coloured lights. Hard-pressed GPs face rent reduction requests from pathology giants GP practices are under pressure to accept a 50% reduction in rental payments from major pathology corporations. It follows news that doctor-owned general practices are on the brink of financial collapse due to revenue losses from Covid-19. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has accepted the resignation of her arts minister, Don Harwin, after he was fined $1,000 for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. While Harwin maintained he had sought, and followed, official advice on whether he was allowed to relocate to his holiday home, he accepted the controversy surrounding his move \u2013 as the government was urging people to stay home over Easter \u2013 was a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Berejiklian accepted Harwin\u2019s resignation, issuing a statement: During this health crisis my government has asked the community to make greater sacrifices than all of us have ever had to make before. These sacrifices are saving lives, and I am proud of the people of NSW for continuing to uphold the law in the interest of public health. Late last night I was advised minister Don Harwin had been fined $1,000 for breaching a public health order. The police, who have been tasked by my government with enforcing these health orders, came to the conclusion that minister Harwin breached the order. Whilst minister Harwin has served the people of NSW well, and he continues to assure me that he did not break the rules, the orders in place apply equally to everybody. Accordingly, minister Harwin has appropriately resigned from cabinet. Internationally now ... aerial footage shows a mass grave being dug on New York\u2019s Hart Island to deal with the surge in deaths caused by the coronavirus. A warning: this video contains sensitive material. As New York deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the length of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in its public cemetery on Hart Island. Aerial video captured workers digging graves on the island, a one-mile, limited-access strip near the Bronx. Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can\u2019t afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Operations have now increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day. NSW arts minister Don Harwin has resigned from the government after he was fined $1,000 by police for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. As governments around Australia were urging their citizens to stay home over Easter, Harwin was spotted earlier in the week at his Pearl Beach house, more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. Harwin maintained he sought formal advice that his living arrangements complied with the direction for people to stay at home, and that he acted in accordance with those orders. But he says the controversy over his getaway was a \u201cdistraction\u201d for the government at a critical time. He has offered his resignation to the premier. His statement in full: Today I have offered my resignation to the premier as a minister in her government. There is nothing more important than the work of the government in fighting the coronavirus crisis. I will not allow my circumstances to be a distraction from that work and I very much regret that my residential arrangements have become an issue during this time. At all times I have sought to act in accordance with public health orders and I sought advice that my living arrangements complied with those orders. I remain confident that I have acted in accordance with those orders. I know however that perception is just as important during these times. The premier and her team are doing an outstanding job during the biggest crisis our state and nation have faced during our lifetimes. It is absolutely vital they should be able to focus entirely on the health and economic issues facing our community. It\u2019s had a very good run today, but worthy of repeating. Game of Bones: And while the focus has been on Sydney, the NSW government is seeking to roll out rapid testing for Covid-19 in regional areas to reduce waiting times. So far, 70% of tests in NSW have been in Sydney, which has identified clusters in the capital. But if you don\u2019t test, you don\u2019t find \u2026 Again, our beloved friends at AAP: Regional NSW towns will soon have access to rapid coronavirus testing, meaning samples won\u2019t have to be sent to Sydney for analysis. Broken Hill health workers will over Easter repurpose a machine used to rapidly test flu samples so it can detect the novel coronavirus. It should be operational by Monday and more regional areas will follow as specific hardware is imported. \u201cThat is really important, particularly for the more distant sites,\u201d the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said on Friday. \u201cHaving that point-of-care testing, or testing that comes back in about an hour, is very useful because it gives us more rapid identification of cases.\u201d St Vincent\u2019s hospital is already using its repurposed GeneXpert machine in its emergency department and will also begin trialling another molecular test in the coming days. Of the 137,000 people tested for coronavirus in NSW since January, 70% have been in Sydney or on the Central Coast. Just 322 people in far western NSW have been tested while northern NSW and the Murrumbidgee are the two regions were there have been fewer than one test per 1,000 residents. Those three regions account for 100 positive cases. Chant defended the current turnaround time for testing \u2013 which can see results for Sydney-based cases returned within 24 hours. \u201cThe issue for rural and remote areas is the time it takes for specimens to come down to Sydney,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we get more [novel coronavirus] cartridges for our GeneXperts, we will be looking at deploying this test across various sites. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a mind to supporting rural and regional communities so we can give them access to the testing that is much more prompt in the metropolitan area.\u201d NSW is the state with the most Covid-19 infections in the country. (It should be noted that, by international standards, Australia and NZ have very low numbers of cases, low rates of community transmission, and low death rates. See here from Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin and some other reporter: But there is an interesting breakdown of cases in NSW, provided by NSW Health. In the 24 hours to 8pm Thursday, an additional 49 cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in NSW. The total number of cases is 2,822 Deaths: 22 Cases tested and excluded: 134,619 Total people tested: 137,441 A total of 543 of NSW\u2019s cases - nearly one-fifth - have originated from a cruise ship (in particular the Ruby Princess, which was controversially allowed to dock at Circular Quay in March). Of NSW\u2019s 2,822 cases; Overseas acquired: 1,677 Locally acquired (contact of confirmed case and/or known cluster): 682 Locally acquired (contact not identified): 427 Under investigation: 36 The largest number of infections, by age group, is among people aged 20 to 29, with 611 confirmed cases. This is interesting, from AAP: A group of 18 Queensland drivers has been hit with fines for disobeying coronavirus regulations after police stopped a noisy burnout gathering. Officers were called to an industrial area in Loganholme, south of Brisbane, where they cordoned off a street about 11pm on Thursday. More than 10 vehicles were intercepted and 18 infringement notices of $1,334 issued for failing to comply with a Covid-19 direction, police said on Friday. It seems the burn-outs were fine \u2013 if needless, noisy and self-defeating (they\u2019re your tyres after all) \u2013 you just can\u2019t do burn-outs in a group. I\u2019m reminded of that age-old philosophical question: if you do a massive burn-out, but none of your mates are around to watch, have you really burnt out at all? In case you missed this earlier, it\u2019s very good. Do try this at home. Stay home. Save Lives. Take the Bins Out*. *only on bin night The Western Australia minister for health and deputy premier Roger Cook has reported seven new cases of Covid-19 in the state, as well as four new cases linked to the cruise ship Artania. The 11 new cases are in people aged between 25 and 78, and bring the state\u2019s total to 506. The total number of cases linked to cruise ships is 191, more than one-third of the total. Six people have died in WA. Also in Western Australia, several hundred passengers who had been on board the Vasco da Gama cruise ship are due to end their quarantine today. The West Australian passengers have been held on Rottnest Island, they will be ferried back to Perth this afternoon. But hundreds of others from the east coast and other parts of Australia are coming out of quarantine, today and in coming days, without a way home because of mass cancellation of flights across the country. Cook said the state government would continue to accommodate those passengers, while finding a way to get them home. The state government is aware that there are limited flights available for people returning home following their 14-day isolation in Western Australia. The department of health is liaising with other agencies and airlines to determine viable solutions to get these people home as soon as practicable. While flights are being arranged to transport people home, they will continue to be accommodated by the state. We want to reassure people who have been in isolation that we will be working to make the transition home as smooth as possible so they can return to their homes and families as quickly as they can. We understand those in isolation and quarantine have enjoyed difficulty and stress and appreciate the sacrifice they and their family and friends are making to keep our communities safe. The state\u2019s deputy chief health officer Robin Lawrence said those who had completed their quarantine, but who were still waiting to fly home, would be allowed out of their hotels. For the passengers from the Vasco da Gama, that would be in a few hours. As of 4:30pm they will have some increased freedom to move around the local area and the city as long as they maintain social distancing, as required. We are very grateful for their patience and consideration during the 14 days they have been undertaking quarantine. For all other future passengers, we will be in contact to work out where they have come from and how they can get home and we thank them for their patience in keeping the state of Western Australia, themselves and their families safe this time. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer has posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW and ordered anyone returning to the state from those locations to quarantine for 14 days. It has been one week since Queensland closed its border to New South Wales for the first time since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919. Police have been enforcing the \u201chard closure\u201d at three checkpoints between the towns of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads on either side of the border. The gates have also been shut on the state\u2019s two other shared borders between the Northern Territory and South Australia. Queensland residents are exempt from the ban, but from Saturday those returning home from a list of designated inter-state \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d will be forced to undergo two weeks quarantine. Good afternoon, Ben Doherty here, my thanks to my colleagues for their work today. And thank you for your company this afternoon. Please feel free to get in touch via twitter @BenDohertyCorro or email ben.doherty@theguardian.com . Social distancing, how important is it? This, from the Ohio department of health in the US, is excellent. They\u2019ve wrapped up the press conference in Adelaide. And I\u2019m going to wrap up here, too. I\u2019ll leave you with my excellent colleague Ben Doherty who will take over from here. Cusack says at this stage there is no case to close the state\u2019s beaches. Marshall is asked about photographs local media published apparently showing groups of people. Marshall says: \u201cI have spent time down at the beach myself today and I can tell you that there were a lot of people enjoying their time but the most important thing is we are trying to guard against large numbers of people congregating in close vicinity, but not people walking the dog, going for a jog. \u201cWe do not want to see reporters, with all due respect, or members of the public try to separate people. They could be people of the same family, people living together.\u201d Cusack says there are 15 people in South Australian hospital. Six are in ICU and four are in a critical condition. Michael Cusack, the SA Health executive director of medical service, says that the state has recorded seven new cases overnight. There are 428 in the state. The cases range in age from 23 to a person in their 80s. He says: \u201cAt this point in time there is no link we have found between any of the cases in schools or any residential aged care facility, and importantly there are no additional cases where we think that there has been local transmission. In terms of good news, the number of people that are known to have recovered has increased ...\u201d The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, is addressing the media as we speak. Marshall says the former Wakefield hospital is now ready to take patients. It has been transformed into a Covid-19 facility. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will address the children of Australia in a special broadcast on the ABC, the network has announced. The ABC says in a statement that Morrison will answer questions from children on the Monday bulletin of its flagship children\u2019s news program, Behind The News. An ABC statement said the broadcast would include questions such as: \u201cMy question is, what\u2019s your advice to the population who have lost their jobs as their workplaces have shut down?\u201d \u201cHow long do you think it will take to find a cure for the coronavirus?\u201d The program will air 6.25pm on Monday. Advocates for the unemployed have called on the government to extend the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplements to disability support pensioners and carers. The Guardian reported last month that people on these payments would now receive a lower base rate of income support than a jobseeker or a person receiving parenting payment who did not have a disability. \u201c[The Australian Unemployed Workers Union] has been flooded with calls and messages from our members who have been unfairly excluded from the $550 supplement, and thousands of people have signed our petition to #RaiseTheDSP,\u201d a statement read. \u201cThe minister has been granted extraordinary new powers that mean she can do this without going back to parliament. No legislation is required.\u201d A Greens motion to include these welfare recipients in the coronavirus supplement failed to win the support of the government or Labor this week. However, the minister, Anne Ruston, can extend the supplement without legislation. \u201cI\u2019m on DSP, not parenting payment but I\u2019m the only person raising my children, why is it I\u2019m not seen to have extra costs/needs,\u201d said Emma, a respondent to an AUWU survey. Of the outbreak at the Northwest hospital, Courtney says: \u201cAll staff who worked at the Northwest regional hospital in the medical or surgical wards will be asked to quarantine for 14 days. We will be providing accommodation for those staff who are unable to quarantine in their own homes.\u201d Courtney says that staff will be tested, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. A fourth person has died in Tasmania, the state\u2019s health minister has just announced. Sarah Courtney says the man was elderly and died at Northwest hospital. She extends her condolences to his family. Courtney says there were four more Covid-19 cases confirmed overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total to 111. Northern Territory police have issued a statement outlining the fines issued yesterday for social distancing rules. Police said they fined a 32-year-old woman who \u201cabsconded from mandatory quarantine in Darwin\u201d. \u201cThe woman arrived in the NT on 7 April 2020, travelling from Adelaide and was required to remain in a hotel for 14 days,\u201d a police statement said. \u201cPolice located the woman and issued her a fine before returning her to her hotel.\u201d Police also said a 22-year-old man in Araluen also \u201cbreached quarantine by leaving his house to register his new vehicle at the MVR\u201d. \u201cThe man had returned to the NT by road from South Australia on 29 March 2020.\u201d A further six people were issued with infringement notices relating to mass gatherings. Police said 3,630 compliance checks had now been completed with 17 fines issued. Just to recap deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly\u2019s comments on the NRL\u2019s decision to restart. Kelly said emphasised that we all have a responsibility to continue with social distancing measures. He said that although the league\u2019s players were not at high risk, others who are involved in the game would be. Kelly specifically named two coaches, Wayne Bennett and Ricky Stuart, as being vulnerable to Covid-19. \u201cTo be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track,\u201d he said. He added that it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether May is the right time to restart the league, but that the NRL would \u201cdefinitely need to get some permission to do that\u201d. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed today that he hadn\u2019t been consulted prior to the league\u2019s announcement of a planned restart date. Kelly reiterates that the health advices on schools remains the same. That is that the schools can remain open. But he notes that \u201cwe\u2019ll be having more to say about schools in the coming weeks.\u201d And with that, the press conference has concluded. Kelly is asked by a journalist, and we are thankful to her: what about about NRL Island? He says: \u201cIt sounds like a reality show they might continue it on, not just the playing, but what happens for the rest of the week, the mind boggles. If they\u2019re by themselves and they\u2019re away from the rest of society, then that is a thing. \u201cBut I just reiterate the young men and women who play the game won\u2019t be the only ones there. They need to think carefully about their coaching staff and other supporters. And think about their social responsibility, even on the island.\u201d Is the NRL risking the community by saying they will return to the game? Kelly says: \u201cThe other part I say about the NRL, they\u2019re general very fit young men and women, so they \u2013 they themselves are not at high risk and if they were just part of the \u2013 I understand the proposal is to play -continue to play in empty stadium, so they could be their own microcosm. \u201cFor them, it may not be a big problem. There\u2019s other people around the teams, Wayne Bennett is in his 70s, he would be in a vulnerable group, Ricky Stuart with the mighty Raiders, he would potentially be in a vulnerable group, so thinking about the team, not just the players, but those \u2013 the support staff around them, is important. And, look, they\u2019re making their plans for the road out I encourage them to do so in other sports. But whether May is the time will remain to be seen and definitely they\u2019ll need to get some permission to do that.\u201d Kelly is asked about the NRL\u2019s plans to restart the game next month. He is asked whether the NRL would need permission from state government or whether they are, for want of a better word, \u201ca law unto unto themselves in this regard\u201d? He says: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re a law unto themselves. Some of the players and coaches may think so, but they\u2019re part of society and they have a part \u2013 as we have all done, to support not only safety for themselves but for all of us. To be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track. \u201cI\u2019ve said here before on average, what we know about this virus, if we don\u2019t have these social distancing measures, one person can lead to 400 other cases within a month. And so, that is the sort of explosive epidemic we\u2019ve seen in other countries. And we just cannot afford at this stage to be considering that happening.\u201d Kelly says border closures will be a component of what happens into the future. \u201cBut we also do need to our trade both back and forth, to continue in the society that we love. So these are all elements that will be part of the road out, as the Prime Minister said. It\u2019s too early to talk about that road out for the time being.\u201d Kelly says that \u201cthe curve is definitely decreasing\u201d. \u201cI would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we\u2019ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There\u2019s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. \u201cSo, we need to see what happens with those and to learn from other countries that have going through a much more difficult time with much larger epidemics to see what happens as they pass that peak and see what happens from there, about being guided, what to do to get back to some sort of normality, a new normality, I would suggest, at least in the shorter term.\u201d Kelly said that it would be a great \u201cachievement\u201d if the virus began to die out in parts of Australia. But he adds: \u201cIt does bring with it a challenge, of course, it would mean the most of us would not have been exposed yet. So we would remain susceptible to the virus if it was re-introduced.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has started speaking in Canberra. He is asked if about the possibility that people can became immune to the virus. \u201cYes, that would be a very important thing to know. At this stage, we\u2019re only - I calculated this week - 14weeks into the virus. Only the first cases in Australia were in mid-to-late January. So it\u2019s only very early. So at this stage, if we were able to look at people that might have been exposed at that time or indeed were diagnosed with the virus and see if they can immune now, it would be very short-term immunity still. \u201cIt remains to be seen what happens in the longer term. There\u2019s studies done in China, there will be studies here in Australia as well, looking at that immune element. But at this time we can\u2019t tell.\u201d Let\u2019s wrap up some of today\u2019s developments. NSW recorded its 22nd death and Victoria its 13th. It takes Australia\u2019s death toll to 53. Embattled NSW minister Don Harwin was fined $1,000 for breaching social distancing laws. Authorities are urging people to stay home for Easter, and police are turning people around who are heading to holiday spots. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is yet to discuss the NRL\u2019s restart date 28 May with the league. Tasmanian police have told 15 people on their way to holiday spots to go home during Covid-19 patrols over the past 24 hours. AAP reports that the force intercepted more than 35 people in cars - including some towing caravans and boats - and turned them back as needed. Three people have been arrested or summoned to appear in court over Covid-19 related offences, the force confirmed on Friday. \u201cThis Easter, if you are away from your primary residence and try to go to your shack and you don\u2019t have a valid excuse, you will not only be turned around, but you could be charged and face a substantial fine,\u201d Acting Assistant Commissioner Jo Stolp said. Premier Peter Gutwein told residents on Thursday not to leave their homes unnecessarily, with fines of up to $16,800 or six months\u2019 jail. Helicopters are monitoring people\u2019s movements, hovering over regional communities including Bicheno, Friendly Beaches, Coles Bay, Dunalley and Primrose Sands. Officers are also patrolling on foot in Bridport, St Helens, Longford, Great Lake, Port Sorell, Somerset and Smithton among the areas. Tasmania had recorded 111 cases of the virus as of Thursday night, with 48 of those people recovering. The NSW government has announced that healthcare workers would now benefit from free parking at public hospital carparks during the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cOur healthcare workers are on the frontline of our battle with Covid-19 and we need to do whatever we can to support them during this difficult time,\u201d the premier, Gladys Berejiklian said. \u201cWe hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.\u201d The free parking begins from today. Some good news for the more than 100 Australian and New Zealand residents who were aboard the Antartica cruise that was anchored of the coast of Uruguay. AAP reports that the group are expected to land in Melbourne over Easter after Aurora Expeditions, the operator of the Greg Mortimer ship, chartered a flight from Montevideo. The news was confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told AAP on Friday. Of the more than 200 people on the vessel, 96 are Australian passengers and crew, along with roughly 16 New Zealand citizens. Five Australians have already been taken off the Greg Mortimer and admitted to hospital in Montevideo, DFAT said. Thanks to Michael for his efforts this morning. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you for today. Thanks for your company. I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes, who will take you through the afternoon. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has issued a statement slamming celebrity chef Pete Evans, after the Channel Seven star and reality television host posted a video falsely suggesting a $15,000 light machine could be used treat Covid-19. In a live video posted to his Facebook page, the My Kitchen Rules judge said the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u201cis a pretty amazing tool\u201d and claims there are \u201ca thousand different recipes\u201d including \u201ca couple on there for Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. Evans is selling the product on his own website for $14,990. It states the product is \u201ca hybrid subtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d with \u201cfour transmitted energies\u201d which \u201cstimulate and invigorate the entire body to optimise and improve potential health, wellness and athletic performance\u201d. The post has been condemned by RACGP president Harry Nespolon, who said Evans, who has in the past promoted anti-vaccination views, \u201cneeds to stop\u201d. Nespolon said he had suggested several months ago Evans should \u201cleave vaccinations alone\u201d. \u201cWell, he should also steer well clear of peddling devices which he claims use \u2018subtle energy\u2019 to counter Covid-19. He just needs to stop it right now. \u201cIt is a reality that many people look up to Mr Evans in his roles as a popular chef and television host. I once again urge him to book an appointment with his local GP to learn about the damage he is doing on social media.\u201d Quickly to the ACT, where three new cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is now 103. The new confirmed cases are two women and one man, aged between 26 and 51. One is a close contact of a previous confirmed case and the other two are under investigation. Kerry Chant says the 69-year-old man who died in Newcastle overnight likely contracted the virus \u201cduring a recent trip interstate\u201d. The man had travelled to Queensland. Obviously, we are watching locally acquired cases, and I think from the beginning I\u2019ve explained that they raise the major concern for me, because they reflect areas where we might need to have that focused testing to establish there\u2019s not broader transmission in the community. So, earlier this week, I called upon the community to increase testing in some of those areas, where we had identified cases. We will continue to update and call on the community to come forward to have increased testing in areas where we identify local transmission. Asked about the $1,000 fine levelled against arts minister Don Harwin last night for breaching public health orders, he says: Look, as I said yesterday in relation to Mr Harwin, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are, there are very strict rules to try and keep us all safe. And the imposition of a fine, if that\u2019s what the police consider appropriate, is a matter for them. I can\u2019t comment beyond that. That\u2019s not my purview. Hazzard is asked about the NRL\u2019s announcement yesterday that they will restart the competition on 28 May. He says he has only had one meeting with the game, which was about four weeks ago before it was shutdown. If the NRL want to go ahead, happy to have the chat and make sure, with medical advice, as to whether or not it\u2019s appropriate. The only meeting I\u2019ve had that I can tell you about is around about a month ago, with [chief executive] Todd Greenberg and [chairman] Peter V\u2019landys to talk about the issue. But that was before they actually made a decision to shut the game down. So, I haven\u2019t had any discussions with them at this stage. Hazzard has recovered from his coughing fit and is back taking questions. He\u2019s asked about new $5,000 on-the-spot fines in NSW for people who cough or spit on health workers. If I had my choice, I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine. There is another option. And that is that if the police choose to they can actually enforce a court attendance notice and a charge, which would allow an $11,000 fine and $6,000. But this is an on-the-spot $5,000 fine. I can\u2019t remember any fine like this in the past history, where a police officer could hand over a $5,000 fine on the spot. It\u2019s quite unprecedented. He\u2019s asked about a McDonald\u2019s worker who was allegedly spat on yesterday, and whether the fines should be extended. Says they will look at it. The NSW police have issued almost 50 new fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. Chant thanks the people of NSW for helping to slow the spread, and urges people not to neglect their normal medical needs. Yesterday we reported that GP clinics across the country are reporting a major drop in patient numbers due to the pandemic, either because of Covid-19 fears or problems transitioning to telehealth services. It\u2019s been pleasing to see that we\u2019ve continued to see an increase in testing numbers. And my message to the community is to please, our services are open over the Easter period and I would urge you to continue to access those services. I\u2019d also like to [send a message] to the community that our services are safe and available, so it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t neglect any other underlying chronic diseases, or if you develop symptoms that need - that you need to access urgent care, please continue to do so. Hazzard has had to hand over mid-sentence to the NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant because he\u2019s having a coughing fit. New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking in Sydney. He\u2019s announced that a 69-year-old man has died at the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle overnight, bringing the total number of deaths in NSW to 22. He says NSW has 49 new cases of Covid-19. That\u2019s very slightly more than the day before, when there was a three week low of 39 new cases. 211 cases are in NSW hospitals. 29 of those are in ICU. Of those 29, 23 are ventilated. If you haven\u2019t already watched Scottish sports broadcaster Andrew Cotter\u2019s commentary of his two labradors, Olive and Mabel, and their quiet battle over an orange rubber bone, I need to strongly insist you do so right now. It is, I assure you, an absolute tonic. My colleague Steph Harmon has written about it: The Gold Coast Airport has closed its terminal because there are no regular scheduled commercial flights to the tourism hotspot for the foreseeable future. AAP reports the terminal closed on Friday after the last Qantas and Virgin flights departed on Thursday. The operation of the runway and airfield operations will continue for general aviation and other activities. Gold Coast Airport boss Marion Charlton says the terminal will open when regular passenger flights resume. \u201cThe aviation industry is at the front line of this crisis, with passenger numbers falling steadily since the beginning of March,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with our partners throughout this challenging time.\u201d A few scenes of the Easter long weekend in Australia. Victoria has recorded another Covid-19 death, taking Australia\u2019s national death toll to 52. The latest death is a man in his 80s who died in hospital, the state government confirmed on Friday. It marks the 13th person to die from the virus in the state. Victoria also recorded 13 new cases in the past 24 hours. Forty-three people remain in hospital, with 13 of those in intensive care. Seven people have been released in the last 24 hours. Queensland\u2019s health minister, Stephen Miles, is speaking in Brisbane. The state has recorded 13 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. He\u2019s also confirmed that the state has issued 289 fines for breaches of public health orders. The fines begin at $1,300. Miles also revealed that one person in the state has been charged for allegedly spitting at a nurse. I was of course disgusted to hear that report [and] concerned for the wellbeing of that particular nurse, but nobody should treat our health workers like that. Everyone should know that the police will enforce the law and I understand charges have been laid. Hard to fathom, really. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, appeared on one of the commercial breakfast TV networks and admitted to feeling \u201ca degree of frustration\u201d with Australians stranded overseas. Thousands of Australians remain scattered overseas, and on Thursday the foreign affais minister outlined plans for charter flights for people trying to get home from various parts of the world. A special Qantas flight from Peru landed in Australia overnight. Birmingham said: There are frustrations, no doubt about that. We were one of the early countries in the world to urge Australians reconsider their need to travel, and to urge them to come home and to ultimately to urge them to or to tell them that travel was not to be undertaken and to enforce quite strict arrangements in place. There is a degree of frustration there. But our diplomats have been working day and night around the world to come up with solutions to help Australians be able to safely get home. That is why we have stepped in to make sure there are some regular flights available over the next few weeks. We can\u2019t guarantee that it will go on beyond that. But you can get home from places if you can connect in to London or Hong Kong or Singapore or San Francisco because we put in place those regular flights. We are also looking at exceptional circumstances where we do need to work to get aviation capacity into places such as Peru, where there is a flight that has come in overnight. It is the second one that has come out of there in a space of about a week. We have circumstances in Uruguay that we are working through, in South African and the Philippines. These are incredibly complex arrangements given the travel restrictions that other countries have imposed and the collapse in international aviation. It is not unreasonable that Australians who are overseas, some of whom will have ignored the travel warnings, will have to make a contribution to their return. Police in Victoria have issued 98 fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. The fines include nine children who were fined \u201cfor gathering in a private residence\u201d and a man who received four warnings before he was fined. Unlike in NSW, police in Victoria have refused to release data about the locations of the fines. We also don\u2019t know any demographic indicators about the people who have been fined. So, for example, their housing status or ethnicity. Victoria police say they conducted 754 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services in the past 24 hours. Since 21 March they have conducted a total of 18,386 spot checks. Once upon a time, when I was a journalist at a regional newspaper, my colleagues and I used to joke about the carbon-copy stories we\u2019d be forced to write on an annual basis. People working on Christmas Day, police warnings about double demerits and, of course, lines at the fish co-op on Good Friday. Well, Covid-19 has at least added a bit of spice to the latter yarn. AAP reports that the Sydney Fish Market will still open its doors for what is usually one its busiest days but this year strict social distancing measures and temperature checks will be in place. More than 40,000 people usually flock to the market on Good Friday to snap up seafood for the Easter weekend but this year only 400 people will be allowed on the site at one time. People will have their temperature checked on arrival, be given hand sanitiser and be asked to follow social distancing rules to limit the spread of Covid-19. \u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a very different Easter down at the fish market this weekend,\u201d a spokeswoman, Stephanie Margrain, told AAP. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no oysters on the boardwalk ... Come down, shop quickly and get home.\u201d The market has been working with NSW police and NSW Health to develop a plan that ensures people who have made a tradition out of going to the fish market on Good Friday can continue to do so safely. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to encourage lots of people to come down like we normally would, but we\u2019re conscious for many it is a tradition,\u201d she said. A 31-year-old man Palm Beach will face drug charges after Queensland police allegedly found 93kg of cannabis during a stop at a state border checkpoint on Wednesday. In a statement this morning Queensland police said officers at the checkpoint intercepted a Ford Ranger utility with a trailer trying to enter Queensland about 5.30pm on Wednesday. It will be alleged that during a search of the vehicle police found 93kg of cannabis and $4,300 in cash. Police say the drugs have a street value of about $450,000. A 31-year-old Palm Beach man was arrested and charged with the possession of dangerous drugs and the possession of property suspected of be used in connection with a drug offence. He has been bailed to appear at the Coolangatta magistrates court on 6 July. The man was also issued a $1,334 infringement notice for breaching the state\u2019s public health orders. Detective Inspector Chris Ahearn from the Gold Coast criminal investigation branch said \u201cany person attempting to enter our state, even if they are a Queensland resident, should expect a heightened level of scrutiny\u201d. \u201cIn addition to the current biosecurity risks, police will remain vigilant to disrupt any criminal activity,\u201d Ahearn said. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has released his own Easter message. Like the prime minister he\u2019s urged people to stay home during the \u201conce-in-a-generation health crisis\u201d caused by Covid-19. Easter is traditionally a time when Australians gather together. For Christians, they go to church services. For other Australians, they spend time together with family, with friends, and with other members of their local community. But this Easter is different. We need people to stay home. To stay home in the interest of their own health. But also, the health of others. The COVID-19 crisis is a once in a generation health crisis. And we need to take it seriously. Whilst overwhelmingly we want Australians to stay home, some people will be working. Our health workers, our police and emergency services, our transport workers. Some who work in industries like our supermarkets who will continue to work over the Easter break. We need to give them our thanks. They are keeping us safe and doing an extraordinary job in difficult times. This age of social distancing and self-isolation means that we are all keeping 1.5 metres apart. But in so many ways, we as Australians have never been as together as we are now. So, I wish all Australians a peaceful Easter at home. The good news for kids is that the Easter bunny is allowed to visit your home this Sunday. I wish you and your family all the best this Easter. The New South Wales Labor opposition has, perhaps unsurprisingly, seized on the $1,000 fine issued to the arts minister, Don Harwin, overnight. The shadow arts minister, Walt Secord, has issued a statement calling for Gladys Berejiklian to sack Harwin: The premier has no choice but to sack the arts minister. Yesterday, she defended him. An apology is not enough. Mr Harwin is a personal friend of the premier and a factional ally, but he is not above the law. He has been travelling back and forth to Sydney from Pearl Beach. Pearl Beach is an elderly community. These health orders are there to protect the most vulnerable. A man wearing an Akubra and brandishing a whip has been charged after allegedly threatening people outside the Chinese consulate in Sydney. After footage of the alleged incident was shared widely on social media, police said a 55-year-old was arrested at Dee Why on Thursday and charged after allegedly cracking the whip outside the consulate on 31 March. \u201cPolice will allege in court that the man threatened several members of the public while cracking the whip,\u201d they said. Let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s in the other papers today. The Sydney Morning Herald leads on Covid-19 clusters inside New South Wales hospitals after the state\u2019s health department revealed on Thursday that 12 new cases have been discovered at Gosford hospital. Two were hospital patients, six staff and four family members or friends. The paper is also reporting the concerns of retail workers, who say they are \u201cscared and desperate\u201d about catching Covid-19 and are begging for businesses to stop in-store trading. The Age in Melbourne lead on the education minister Dan Tehan\u2019s threat to cut funding to independent schools if they close during the pandemic. The Australian reports that the University of Melbourne will take a $500m revenue hit this year because of Covid-19, as the vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, and his executive team take a 20% pay cut. The Oz also says more than 600,000 Australians have registered their interest in drawing down as much as $20,000 from their superannuation funds. In Sydney the News Limited tabloid Daily Telegraph leads on Don Harwin, in Melbourne the Herald Sun goes coronavirus-free on the front page, instead reporting on the Good Friday cancer fundraising appeal, and the Hobart Mercury splashes on the Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein\u2019s message that \u201cthe gloves are off\u201d in police enforcement of public health orders over the Easter long weekend. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been moved out of intensive care. In a statement a few hours ago a spokesman said: The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits. You can follow our UK live blog here: As the rate of infection in Australia continues to fall, authorities are nervous about the potential for the Easter long weekend \u2013 when many people usually travel \u2013 could seet off a new wave of Covid-19 cases. They\u2019ve been urging people to stay at home over the break, and state premiers have warned police will be out in large numbers enforcing lockdown rules. Drawing on his faith, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, used his Easter message to drive home the importance of social distancing: I hope it is a time as you come together in your homes, together with your immediate family, that it will be a strong reminder about what\u2019s most important. For Christians, not being able to gather does not diminish the hope that we have through this important Easter period. This year, we will live out our faith by doing the right thing. That means staying at home, making sure we\u2019re checking on our neighbours and supporting our communities and families, our friends. First up, a little bit more on that Don Harwin news. Late last night the New South Wales police issued a statement saying they had issued a fine after being \u201calerted\u201d that a 55-year-old man had \u201crelocated to a holiday home at Pearl Beach, in contravention of current Ministerial Direction under the Public Health Act\u201d. \u201cAs part of inquiries, investigators from Central Metropolitan Region attended the Elizabeth Bay home unit and spoke with the man,\u201d NSW police said. \u201cFollowing further inquiries, the man was issued a $1000 PIN via email just before 9pm.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to sack Harwin, saying he didn\u2019t break the rules because he moved to his Central Coast home on 13 March, before the state lockdown came into effect. But multiple reports on Thursday indicated Harwin had travelled back to Sydney for appointments while staying at the Central Coast property. \u201cNo one individual or corporation is above these laws \u2013 anyone suspected of breaching the orders will be investigated and if a breach is detected, they will be dealt with in accordance with the Act,\u201d said the police commissioner, Mick Fuller. \u201cOn behalf of the community, I strongly urge those with information about breaches to contact police.\u201d Good morning. It\u2019s Friday, 10 April. Welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic in Australia. I\u2019m Michael McGowan. I\u2019ll be bringing you all of today\u2019s Good Friday news, but first here\u2019s how we left things last night: Australia reported its lowest number of new cases in three weeks on Thursday, with 96 people diagnosed since the last update, nationally. It was the first time in three weeks Australia\u2019s new cases have dropped below 100. One 76-year-old South Australian man died, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 51. The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s strict public health orders. Harwin got himself in strife after it emerged he had left Sydney for his property on the Central Coast, despite the Berejiklian government urging the public to delay non-essential travel. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, ordered independent schools to reopen and provide in-person education to children whose parents want it in term two. Tehan said he would make independent schools\u2019 funding contingent on complying with the order. The Block star Scott Cam has agreed to forgo his $345,000 salary as Australia\u2019s \u201cnational careers ambassador\u201d. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said Cam had agreed to give up his salary given his \u201crole has fundamentally changed\u201d due to Covid-19.",

I believe they often rip tents apart in order to devour the human occupants. Perhaps it is some<em>one</em> \u2013 a human, a murderer almost certainly. Unless of course it\u2019s just Gatsby, next door\u2019s cat, out on the scrounge again or pooing in our flower bed. Whatever, we\u2019re way too scared to unzip and have a look.</p> <p>We \u2013 my family \u2013 are camping in the garden. I say my family, but it\u2019s just me and the boys, eight and six. Their mum started off with us, but she disappeared after bedtime stories. Her words on leaving the tent? \u201cI\u2019m just going inside; I may be some time.\u201d I think she had planned it.</p> <p>To be honest, it\u2019s a good thing she left. Our four-person tent didn\u2019t fit in our tiny garden. So we put up my old festival tent, cosy for three; even that only just went in. I know, we\u2019re lucky \u2013 especially now \u2013 to have any garden. But I think you could do a version of this even without one. Put a tent up inside. If you haven\u2019t got a tent, make one out of sheets and the sofa cushions, maybe. Use your imagination \u2013 and then again to decide where you are. Alexa, play jungle noises.</p> <p>Why is home-holidaying such a great idea? It\u2019s cheap \u2013 really cheap; almost certainly the cheapest holiday you\u2019ll ever take. No fares, no accommodation, no campsite fees, just what you would have been consuming anyway, plus one bag of marshmallows. You can turn the heating off, too, and anyone still inside can put on an extra layer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5cdc516fb34f91d56d1ec22678a471ddbe3c27a/0_0_5152_3864/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Wollaston's boys take turns to burn their marshmallows\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sam\u2019s boys take turns to burn their marshmallows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: provided by Sam Wollaston</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no added eco-guilt \u2013 this is almost certainly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/green\">greenest holiday</a> you\u2019ll ever take, too. No flying, no driving, no emissions at all, apart from the ones that children produce anyway \u2013 especially in small tents, it seems. There may be a fire \u2013 but ours was just two bits of wood. Sorry, I suppose it wasn\u2019t entirely necessary, but I think we\u2019ve got some credit in that department.</p> <p>It\u2019s something to do, and something <em>different</em> to do. That has been one of the big problems during lockdown \u2013 the sameness of every day, of the weekdays merging into weekends, of not being able to get out, the lack of any kind of excitement or adventure that doesn\u2019t come via a screen. Garden camping offers proper terror, without putting anyone in danger, although I guess that depends on where you live.</p> <p>It is actually \u2013 amazingly and in spite of everything \u2013 quite fun. Not just doing stuff you do on holiday, and being a bit scared, but simply sleeping in a big pile together. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s transferable inside. Obviously, there\u2019s an upper age limit; if ours were much older, it would almost certainly be the lamest, most ridiculous idea ever. But this time they enjoyed it, the big-pileness of it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh. Fighting, too, of course, but fighting somewhere new. They want there to be a next time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They enjoyed it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh.

Our four-person tent didn\u2019t fit in our tiny garden. So we put up my old festival tent, cosy for three; even that only just went in. I know, we\u2019re lucky \u2013 especially now \u2013 to have any garden. But I think you could do a version of this even without one. Put a tent up inside. If you haven\u2019t got a tent, make one out of sheets and the sofa cushions, maybe. Use your imagination \u2013 and then again to decide where you are. Alexa, play jungle noises. Why is home-holidaying such a great idea? It\u2019s cheap \u2013 really cheap; almost certainly the cheapest holiday you\u2019ll ever take. No fares, no accommodation, no campsite fees, just what you would have been consuming anyway, plus one bag of marshmallows. You can turn the heating off, too, and anyone still inside can put on an extra layer. There\u2019s no added eco-guilt \u2013 this is almost certainly the greenest holiday you\u2019ll ever take, too. No flying, no driving, no emissions at all, apart from the ones that children produce anyway \u2013 especially in small tents, it seems. There may be a fire \u2013 but ours was just two bits of wood. Sorry, I suppose it wasn\u2019t entirely necessary, but I think we\u2019ve got some credit in that department. It\u2019s something to do, and something different to do. That has been one of the big problems during lockdown \u2013 the sameness of every day, of the weekdays merging into weekends, of not being able to get out, the lack of any kind of excitement or adventure that doesn\u2019t come via a screen. Garden camping offers proper terror, without putting anyone in danger, although I guess that depends on where you live. It is actually \u2013 amazingly and in spite of everything \u2013 quite fun. Not just doing stuff you do on holiday, and being a bit scared, but simply sleeping in a big pile together. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s transferable inside. Obviously, there\u2019s an upper age limit; if ours were much older, it would almost certainly be the lamest, most ridiculous idea ever. But this time they enjoyed it, the big-pileness of it, being close as a family, talking, having a laugh. Fighting, too, of course, but fighting somewhere new. They want there to be a next time. We were supposed to be going to Wales for a week, in the Easter holidays. Then we weren\u2019t going to Wales, or anywhere, obviously. No one even knows when the weekends are, let alone remembers when the Easter holidays were meant to be. The normal punctuation of life has gone. But why let this thing spoil everything? We\u2019ve had a bash at home-schooling (although we would definitely go straight into special measures if Ofsted visited); why shouldn\u2019t we home-holiday, too? There was some cheating. We cooked our pasta inside, but brought it out to eat. We made a fire in the barbecue to burn marshmallows on afterwards. Different people do different things on holiday; we burn marshmallows. Do what you do on holiday, to make it feel (a bit) like one. We also play cards on holiday, so after brushing teeth at the outside tap, that\u2019s what we did: old maid and whist. Followed by books. No, we cannot Zoom Mummy \u2013 she\u2019s only been gone five minutes. God, is it really only 8.25pm? It was quite a long night. And a cold one. (The boys were all right \u2013 they shared the air mattress \u2013 but I was on the ground.) And a noisy one. Camping in north-west London, you hear things you might not normally associate with camping, or hear in Wales, say. Not just the prowling murderer/cat, but the Jubilee line, bringing key-worker heroes home. A domestic disagreement (it\u2019s a good way of getting to know the neighbours better). An electric guitar from up the road (\u201cOI, PIPE DOWN, JIMI HENDRIX!\u201d) Also sirens \u2013 lots of sirens \u2013 a sobering reminder of what this is all really about. While we\u2019re playing Scott of the Antarctic, people nearby are dying. At last, is that the first 226 bus of the day, early-shift heroes off to work? That means it\u2019s just before five, and not too much longer of this to go. There\u2019s even a dawn chorus of sorts \u2013 the cooing of a London pigeon and something shrill and persistent, an avian alarm call, perhaps. Watch out \u2013 Gatsby\u2019s about. By the time we unzip and emerge, blinking and shivering, the local goldfinch posse is burbling busily at the bird feeder. See, we\u2019re reconnecting with nature, too. And our house! In a whole new light, bricks and mortar, heating, beds, porridge. What just yesterday was beginning to feel a little like a prison now looks like the greatest thing in the world, as One Ton Depot might have looked to Scott, Captain Oates and companions, had they made it. There\u2019s nothing like taking something away to make you really appreciate it. Learn to love home again \u2013 or appreciate it, at least. No, we\u2019re not doing it tonight, too \u2013 that was a short holiday, like a little early-season minibreak. They \u2013 I \u2013 need a good night\u2019s sleep in a warm bed. We will go again, though, soon. Next Tuesday? Oh, apparently, it\u2019s already in the diary. But now there\u2019s tidying up to do \u2013 damp stuff to come in, mattress to be deflated, tent to be unpitched and wrestled into the bag \u2026 the boring stuff, normally, but less so now \u2013 just stuff to do. The dos and don\u2019ts of home camping Do Take an eye mask and earplugs, just as you would at a festival. It\u2019s surprisingly loud out there at night. And a head torch, for reading and games. Or for pretending you\u2019re Bear Grylls. Check your garden for animal scat. The stink of cat poo all night really doesn\u2019t help. Make sure your phone is charged, so that when the kids eventually drop off you can stop pretending and go back to the serious business of checking Twitter and worrying. Don\u2019t Forget your toothbrush. (Remember that show, in the 90s?) But do brush al fresco for authenticity. Be fooled by signs of spring. It\u2019s cold out there \u2013 take lots of bedding. Allow any musical instruments. It\u2019s not fair on you or the neighbours. Attempt this on a booze-free night, if you\u2019re rash enough to be doing them. Be bullied into another night immediately. Yeah, it was fun \u2013 but not that much fun.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s debatable that lockdown has granted us all endless, fritterable free time to perfect our croquembouche tower skills or to weave elaborate, macrame hanging baskets. Some people on the frontline are not unbusy at all. Others found their actual jobs merely replaced with three or four other unpaid roles for which, until three weeks ago, they had no training. \u201cWho knew,\u201d said no sane person ever, \u201cthat being a full-time GCSE coach, short-order chef and Skype-based amateur social worker, all at once, could be so much fun?!\u201d Big shouts going out to all the WFH crew necking 4pm shots of last-resort Pedro Xim\u00e9nez straight from a fuzzy-rimmed bottle that has moved house six times, but that now tastes like sweet nectar.</p> <p>Still, although some of us lucky ones\u2019 jobs have changed rather than stopped, I do find myself with more time. Largely because tons of utterly pointless, life-robbing faff has been snatched away. Until recently, I wasted hours each week commuting on the Central line in London, my limbs and digits retracted into a space minute enough to pass the EasyJet carry-on baggage test. No more of that, for now.</p> <p>Grooming was another huge time thief, my being of an age when time spent preparing to be seen in public far outweighs the length of time spent out of the house. Being sexy is an arduous task, involving several layers of sand and cement, some boob hoisting, tweezering, and two good goings-over with a lint roller. Knackering. I won those hours back this week, and spent them watching all six hours of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/dec/16/best-of-tv-2015-no-2-wolf-hall\">Wolf Hall</a>, while eating slices of Nigella\u2019s onion supper pie (a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/19/nigella-lawson-domestic-goddess-book-review-cookworm\">Domestic Goddess</a> recipe that will save your soul) and caressing my lovely Patti Smith moustache. Covid-19 has steamrollered over so much, taken loved ones, ruined livelihoods, leaving a weird, bittersweet backwash of diaries emptying of chaff; the meetings about meetings before the proper meeting, the catch-up drinks already cancelled twice, the team-building day, the school run, the quick scoot to the shop for six eggs and a birthday card, the terrifying corporate Glee Club performance and, for all these things, the donning of actual pants and shoes beforehand.</p> <p>Still, like countless thousands of others right now, I am isolated from many people I\u2019d give anything simply to hang out with. This open-ended separation feels often unbearable. The thought that some may never be seen alive again, and no meaningful funeral permitted, is, well, let\u2019s not even linger there. Feelings are not facts, I mumble, letting the blackness come and go. Or banishing the gloom by batch-cooking lentil dal and deciphering the fast cooking techniques on my five-year-old Sage fast/slow cooker. Woooooh, steam! I lie about for hours, letting the cats use me as heated furniture, re-learning all the two-letter bridging words in Scrabble. And above all, I tell myself over and over, this has been only three short weeks and I am fortunate.</p> <p>Recently, I\u2019ve thought many times about my much-loved, acerbic grandmother, long since dead in 1993 but, in light of events, now all the more intriguing. During the second world war, my grandad was away for the best part of six years. She was alone, in the middle of nowhere, with one daughter (my mother), a sharp mind, a slightly lame leg and pernicious anaemia. He was not big on writing letters. She had, of course, no telephone or television. She did have a wireless, but it played only once or twice a week, my mother says, in order to eke out the battery.</p> <p>I think of them both every evening as I climb into bed at the end of another weird day. \u201cWhat did you both do for six years?\u201d I\u2019ve asked my mother on the phone several times recently, self-pitying my own drab lot; just sat here alone with my Netflix and Britbox and Zoom and Sky Q and WhatsApp. Will nobody think of my struggle?</p> <p>\u201cShe was always doing laundry,\u201d Mam says, struggling to remember. \u201cOr baking, if she could get eggs.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s debatable that lockdown has granted us all endless, fritterable free time to perfect our croquembouche tower skills or to weave elaborate, macrame hanging baskets. Some people on the frontline are not unbusy at all. Others found their actual jobs merely replaced with three or four other unpaid roles for which, until three weeks ago, they had no training. \u201cWho knew,\u201d said no sane person ever, \u201cthat being a full-time GCSE coach, short-order chef and Skype-based amateur social worker, all at once, could be so much fun?!\u201d Big shouts going out to all the WFH crew necking 4pm shots of last-resort Pedro Xim\u00e9nez straight from a fuzzy-rimmed bottle that has moved house six times, but that now tastes like sweet nectar. Still, although some of us lucky ones\u2019 jobs have changed rather than stopped, I do find myself with more time. Largely because tons of utterly pointless, life-robbing faff has been snatched away. Until recently, I wasted hours each week commuting on the Central line in London, my limbs and digits retracted into a space minute enough to pass the EasyJet carry-on baggage test. No more of that, for now. Grooming was another huge time thief, my being of an age when time spent preparing to be seen in public far outweighs the length of time spent out of the house. Being sexy is an arduous task, involving several layers of sand and cement, some boob hoisting, tweezering, and two good goings-over with a lint roller. Knackering. I won those hours back this week, and spent them watching all six hours of Wolf Hall, while eating slices of Nigella\u2019s onion supper pie (a Domestic Goddess recipe that will save your soul) and caressing my lovely Patti Smith moustache. Covid-19 has steamrollered over so much, taken loved ones, ruined livelihoods, leaving a weird, bittersweet backwash of diaries emptying of chaff; the meetings about meetings before the proper meeting, the catch-up drinks already cancelled twice, the team-building day, the school run, the quick scoot to the shop for six eggs and a birthday card, the terrifying corporate Glee Club performance and, for all these things, the donning of actual pants and shoes beforehand. Still, like countless thousands of others right now, I am isolated from many people I\u2019d give anything simply to hang out with. This open-ended separation feels often unbearable. The thought that some may never be seen alive again, and no meaningful funeral permitted, is, well, let\u2019s not even linger there. Feelings are not facts, I mumble, letting the blackness come and go. Or banishing the gloom by batch-cooking lentil dal and deciphering the fast cooking techniques on my five-year-old Sage fast/slow cooker. Woooooh, steam! I lie about for hours, letting the cats use me as heated furniture, re-learning all the two-letter bridging words in Scrabble. And above all, I tell myself over and over, this has been only three short weeks and I am fortunate. Recently, I\u2019ve thought many times about my much-loved, acerbic grandmother, long since dead in 1993 but, in light of events, now all the more intriguing. During the second world war, my grandad was away for the best part of six years. She was alone, in the middle of nowhere, with one daughter (my mother), a sharp mind, a slightly lame leg and pernicious anaemia. He was not big on writing letters. She had, of course, no telephone or television. She did have a wireless, but it played only once or twice a week, my mother says, in order to eke out the battery. I think of them both every evening as I climb into bed at the end of another weird day. \u201cWhat did you both do for six years?\u201d I\u2019ve asked my mother on the phone several times recently, self-pitying my own drab lot; just sat here alone with my Netflix and Britbox and Zoom and Sky Q and WhatsApp. Will nobody think of my struggle? \u201cShe was always doing laundry,\u201d Mam says, struggling to remember. \u201cOr baking, if she could get eggs. Oh, and she sometimes played gin rummy.\u201d \u201cHow did folk not go mad?\u201d I ask. \u201cWell, some folk might have done, but we didn\u2019t,\u201d she replies, as if mental health is a modern notion. \u201cHow did you get eggs? I thought they were rationed?\u201d I ask. \u201cOh, you had to secretly swap them for bread crusts with a farmer, so he could feed his chickens,\u201d she says, as if this is obvious. \u201cOne of you had to pretend to be going on holiday and set off on the bus with the crusts in a suitcase.\u201d Our chats, now that we have the time, never fail to surprise me. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even ask how we used to get bacon chops,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the squeamish.\u201d I\u2019m leaving that tale for Week Four of lockdown.",

In a charity poster that my super talented colleague Chris Clarke has created for NHS charities. Get yours here. Thank you for all your messages. Keep them coming. Also, do send any suggestions for where else to look for the Upside. In the meantime, we wish you a serene weekend and fortitude for the next phase. Bon courage!",

He said Canada should be aiming for 80% of the population but was currently around 20%.</p> <p>The World Health Organization recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups including pregnant women, healthcare workers, people with underlying chronic conditions, the elderly and children under five.</p> <p>The WHO has warned of disruption to routine immunisation activities during the pandemic because of strain on the health system and a \u201cdecreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance\u201d. It says there is a high potential for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles at this time, but mass vaccinations bringing together large groups of people should be avoided.

      "bodyText": "Higher influenza vaccination rates could help prevent a future pandemic by exposing new viruses like Covid-19, which was probably circulating much earlier than December 2019 but was mistaken for flu, an expert has said. If more people were vaccinated against flu, unusually high rates of flu-like illness would be more likely to raise red flags, said Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor in epidemiology from the University of Manitoba. \u201cGiven that both Covid-19 and influenza share similar early symptoms of illness, influenza vaccination status provides an additional mechanism to help distinguish potential infections that could be responsible for a patient\u2019s symptoms. \u201cNow I wonder how many things are written off as influenza where they may be new viruses which could impact world health.\u201d As the Covid-19 pandemic continues, some countries are approaching flu season. Governments have urged as many people as possible to get vaccinated against influenza to reduce the burden on health systems and virus testing labs. Kindrachuk said flu vaccination rates had traditionally been low and authorities must focus on increasing them. He said Canada should be aiming for 80% of the population but was currently around 20%. The World Health Organization recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups including pregnant women, healthcare workers, people with underlying chronic conditions, the elderly and children under five. The WHO has warned of disruption to routine immunisation activities during the pandemic because of strain on the health system and a \u201cdecreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance\u201d. It says there is a high potential for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles at this time, but mass vaccinations bringing together large groups of people should be avoided. Countries should instead \u201cmaintain continuity of immunisation services wherever services can be conducted under safe conditions.\u201d Australia and New Zealand have begun flu vaccinations early, and have prioritised the elderly, people with disabilities and health workers. Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt, has warned of the dangers of people falling ill with both the flu and Covid-19, while his New Zealand\u2019s counterpart, David Clark, said that although the flu shot does not protect people against Covid-19 \u201cit will help to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of demand on our hospitals this winter\u201d. South Africa has said it will prioritise health workers for vaccinations as it does not have enough, Bloomberg has reported. A few weeks before the known start of the coronavirus outbreak, China Daily reported the country had stockpiled twice as many vaccinations as the previous year for the coming winter and spring. In March the Guardian revealed that some Australian jurisdictions had failed to properly stockpile a common reagent that was needed to test for Covid-19 as well as other viruses including influenza. \u201cAs the virus has spread, exhaustion of the reagents and materials required for performing diagnostic testing has resulted in decreased testing capacities which has further exacerbated the tolls from this pandemic,\u201d said Kindrachuk. \u201cThis is an important point as many regions, including here in Canada, have now had to adopt more stringent diagnostic testing criteria so as to preserve testing capacity as the pandemic continues.\u201d In recent days a study from 2017-18 has been widely shared on social media, with readers suggesting that it shows flu vaccinations increase the chance of recipients contracting a coronavirus.

      "body": "<p>As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p> <p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. \u201cCorona\u201d, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Importantly, Covid-19 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself \u2013 we have to let it in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials \u2013 proteins, lipids and nucleotides \u2013<strong> </strong>to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell\u2019s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a<strong> </strong>shopping list of instructions<strong> </strong>on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA.</p> <p>Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery<strong> </strong>to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination.</p> <p>Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for<strong> </strong>T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic \u2013 powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a \u201ckiss of death\u201d. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here\u2019s the silver lining<strong>:</strong> memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory.</p> <p>The virus\u2019s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through \u201cshedding\u201d from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick<strong>-</strong>up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/should-pets-be-tested-coronavirus\">animal hosts</a> \u2013 so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don\u2019t know if animals can transmit back to humans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-vaccine-scientist-what-needs-to-be-done-now-hanneke-schuitemaker\">Vaccine scientist: \u2018Everything is so new in dealing with this coronavirus\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself \u2013 we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around<strong> </strong>cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces.</p> <p>We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don\u2019t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878121/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-strategy.pdf\">recruiting</a> 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection.</p> <p>What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bertoletti_lab/status/1247015473683632129\">Cytotoxic T-cells</a> may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don\u2019t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this.</p> <p>Our secret weapon is research.

      "bodyText": "As the daughter of an air force officer and a nurse, I am fascinated by defence systems. There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown. So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. \u201cCorona\u201d, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection. Think of a virus as a robot; it cannot reproduce so it needs a factory of materials \u2013 proteins, lipids and nucleotides \u2013 to build copies of itself. The coat allows the virus to attach itself to the target cell\u2019s membrane. The virus then fuses with the cell and releases a shopping list of instructions on how to build and assemble new viruses. This shopping list, the virus genome, is written in nucleotides (RNA). The first job of a virus that enters our bodies is to invade target cells so that it can comfortably remove its coat and deploy its RNA. Once inside, the virus commandeers the cell and borrows cellular machinery to build more viruses before immune cells detect the intruders and raise the alarm. Antibody proteins that are able to stick to the virus-spike proteins, and prevent attachment to the target cells, are called neutralising antibodies: generating them is often the goal of protective vaccination. Our infected cells make the ultimate sacrifice and invite their own destruction by displaying distress signals for T-cells, which swiftly detect and kill them. T-cells are cytotoxic \u2013 powerful serial killers that can recognise peptide fragments of virus displayed on the infected cell surface. When they do, they release a payload of toxic enzymes that kill the infected cell in a \u201ckiss of death\u201d. This strategic martyrdom is organised by the immune system to deprive the virus of its replication factories and can lead to the reduction of viral load in the patient. It takes several days for antiviral T-cells to expand and antibodies to be generated. Here\u2019s the silver lining: memory cells ensure that if we encounter the same virus again, we can react immediately with pre-existing defences. Sars-Cov-2 is new to humanity so we have no protective immunological memory. Vaccines prepared using harmless parts of the virus can help us build protective memory. The virus\u2019s enemy superpower is spreading. The virus achieves this through \u201cshedding\u201d from infected patients. Sars-Cov-2 is expert at hopping from person to person, and in some people, it achieves a stealthy existence with mild or no symptoms. Once many copies of the virus are made, it needs to jump to another host. It hitches a ride on droplets that can be coughed or sneezed to a distance of up to two metres. Droplets can survive on surfaces for several hours enabling pick-up by a new host, or they can be directly inhaled if another person is in close proximity. Studies are emerging into animal hosts \u2013 so far the virus has been detected in a few ferrets, cats, tigers and dogs. No animal deaths have yet been reported, and we don\u2019t know if animals can transmit back to humans. The age differential in fatalities for Covid-19 suggests, with some exceptions, that a healthy immune system is usually able to control infection. Meanwhile, an ageing or weakened immune system may struggle to deploy a protective arsenal. Importantly, Sars-Cov-2 cannot gain entry to our homes or bodies by itself \u2013 we have to let it in. This is why official advice has centred around cleaning our hands and avoiding touching our faces. We know that a healthy immune system is usually able to eliminate infection in a couple of weeks. However, we have no understanding of the components of our immune arsenal that contribute to this feat: some vaccines work by creating potent neutralising antibodies; other vaccines generate powerful memory T-cells. Antiviral antibodies emerge as early as three to four days after virus detection, but are they protective against future reinfection? We believe that antibodies to other coronaviruses (Sars, Mers) last from one to three years. Because this is a new virus, we don\u2019t yet know the answer to this question. Public Health England is recruiting 16,000 to 20,000 volunteers to monitor antibodies once a month for six to 12 months to confirm whether we can generate long-lasting antibody responses to Sars-Cov-2. Determining the quality of these antibodies will be important to understanding long-term protection. What is our most potent immune weapon against Covid-19? Cytotoxic T-cells may play an important role. Immunologists and virologists are working together to discover the correlates of protection, to design vaccines that offer long-term defences against Covid-19. Years of investment in research means that we can use existing approaches to respond to this new threat, and early mobilisation of research funders, philanthropists and academics are diverting resources to bolster these efforts on an unprecedented scale. Experience has taught us that vaccines are able to eradicate infections from this planet (for instance, smallpox), and medicines against viruses that don\u2019t embed their genetic material to our own (for example, hepatitis C) can also achieve this. Our secret weapon is research. Scientists are working hard on understanding Covid-19, and collaboration is key to this effort. But until a vaccine or treatment is available, we ought to work hard to protect ourselves and our families: isolate and prevent transmission by using physical distancing, face masks and sensible hygiene. If we all do our part, this little virus holding the world to ransom won\u2019t stand a chance. \u2022 Zania Stamataki is a senior lecturer and researcher in viral immunology at the University of Birmingham",

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organization is being urged to declare abortion an essential health service during the coronavirus pandemic. In guidance notes issued last week, the WHO advised all governments to identify and prioritise the health services each believed essential, listing reproductive health services as an example. Clinical guidelines published by the organisation last month said that women\u2019s right to sexual and reproductive healthcare \u201cshould be respected irrespective of Covid-19 status, including access to contraception and safe abortion\u201d. Simon Cooke, the CEO of Marie Stopes International (MSI), said a stronger pronouncement by the WHO would be \u201cimmensely helpful as it would help countries to see abortion from a public health perspective\u201d. There have been growing calls for governments to protect abortion services during the crisis. On Wednesday, 100 NGOs issued a joint statement imploring European states to find new ways to help women access services during lockdown, such as through online consultations and, as introduced in the UK introduced last month, by allowing them to take abortion pills at home. In the US, the Center for Reproductive Rights has filed emergency lawsuits in five states to thwart moves by legislators to ban abortion during the pandemic. \u201cFor us and for women who have unplanned pregnancies, it\u2019s a very worrying time and [abortion] is time critical,\u201d said Cooke. Last week, MSI warned that up 9.5 million women and girls would not access family planning services this year because of the pandemic, which could result in as many as 3m unintended pregnancies and 2.7m unsafe abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the majority of abortions are done in the first trimester, which makes them extremely safe. As countries go into lockdown or mobility is reduced, women will have to wait longer and the procedure becomes more complex,\u201d said Cooke. \u201cIn the UK that\u2019s one thing, where we have the infrastructure to deal with late terminations, but in many countries we operate in that\u2019s not an option. Therefore it becomes critical and there\u2019s a risk of unsafe abortion and complications.\u201d He said abortion was \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d to save lives. Unsafe abortionsaccount for between 4% and 13% of maternal deaths. Dr Jeanne Conry, president elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, said \u201cAbortion access is critical. Women need access or we will see more unintended pregnancies, more maternal mortality and more unsafe abortion,\u201d said Conry. \u201cAbortion is not an elective procedure, it\u2019s an essential part of women\u2019s healthcare. It\u2019s absolutely time dependent.\u201d She said telemedicine, where women can speak to doctors over the internet, was \u201ccritical right now\u201d . On Thursday, the International Planned Parenthood Federation said 23 of its member associations have had to reduce their abortion services because of Covid-19, with 5,600 clinics across 64 countries already closed. There were also reports of shortages of contraceptives and HIV medicines. \u201cThese figures show that millions of women and girls across the world now face an even greater challenge in trying to take care of their own health and bodies,\u201d said the IPPF\u2019s director general, Dr Alvaro Bermejo.",

Yet what begins with taut, engaging pop eventually starts to sag. At the Door\u2019s synth-pop dirge is dreary, while Ode to the Mets provides a decidedly unspectacular finale. It\u2019s the kind of drop-off in quality that suggests old indifference dies hard, but it\u2019s certainly not the whole story: The New Abnormal proves that when they put their minds to it, that old magic is still well within the Strokes\u2019s grasp.",

      "body": "<p>For readers attracted to stylistically challenging fiction, Adam Scovell\u2019s debut novel, <em>Mothlight</em>, was one of last year\u2019s treasures. Especially impressive was the high-wire act of Scovell\u2019s prose: his narrator, a young man pursuing a fervid obsession with moths, spoke with reserve and eloquence from a state of utmost madness. Now, in his follow-up, <em>How Pale the Winter Has Made Us</em>, Scovell gives voice to a new narrator who similarly conceals a psychotic frenzy behind a facade of self-possession, although her breakdown is sparked less by obsession than by alienation.</p> <p>Isabelle is an English \u00e9migr\u00e9 living with her French partner in Strasbourg. As winter sets in, she receives word from London that her father, a \u201cfailed painter\u201d, has hanged himself in a public park. The news arrives with \u201cacidic\u201d heartlessness from her mother, an abusive woman whose years of mistreatment culminate in an insistence that the funeral is Isabelle\u2019s responsibility. Isabelle can\u2019t turn to her partner for support because he has gone abroad, having fled \u201cthe growing frost of our relationship\u201d. So, alone on foreign soil, constricted by grief and solitude, this young woman\u2019s psyche splinters, and her distress manifests in harrowing phantasmagoria. At the edges of her vision, she begins to catch sight of the Erl-King: a skeletal spirit from Saxon folklore who devours wayward souls and seems to be hungry for hers.</p> <p>Desperate to outrun the ghoul \u2013 while also evading her mother\u2019s malice, dispelling thoughts of her father\u2019s body, and hiding her distress from her partner \u2013 Isabelle wanders the labyrinth of Strasbourg, aimless and anxious. Tranquillity via psychogeography is her subconscious intention. Immersing herself in the estranging city, she hopes to dissolve her woes in its hidden histories. Along the way she uncovers residual traces of bygone figures whose lives have left impressions on the streets: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/johann-wolfgang-von-goethe\">Goethe</a>, Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2015/dec/28/london-pilgrimage-gustave-dore-historic-visions-capital-city\">Gustave Dor\u00e9</a>. But as Isabelle repeatedly finds these figures themselves \u201chiding from spectres of lost fathers\u201d, their reconstructed narratives become projections of the turmoil she is trying to suppress. Profoundly withdrawn from the world around her, she can\u2019t see that her dispassionate ruminations on place are also self-lacerating expressions of her trauma \u2013 and her blindness leaves her even more vulnerable to the Erl-King.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84e36e0028de63db74443009151fb2f1985678fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84e36e0028de63db74443009151fb2f1985678fd/0_62_1492_895/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Hallucinatory imagery \u2026 Adam Scovell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hallucinatory imagery \u2026 Adam Scovell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The results are deeply unnerving, but Isabelle\u2019s fever dreams occasionally open on to an otherworldly beauty.

      "bodyText": "For readers attracted to stylistically challenging fiction, Adam Scovell\u2019s debut novel, Mothlight, was one of last year\u2019s treasures. Especially impressive was the high-wire act of Scovell\u2019s prose: his narrator, a young man pursuing a fervid obsession with moths, spoke with reserve and eloquence from a state of utmost madness. Now, in his follow-up, How Pale the Winter Has Made Us, Scovell gives voice to a new narrator who similarly conceals a psychotic frenzy behind a facade of self-possession, although her breakdown is sparked less by obsession than by alienation. Isabelle is an English \u00e9migr\u00e9 living with her French partner in Strasbourg. As winter sets in, she receives word from London that her father, a \u201cfailed painter\u201d, has hanged himself in a public park. The news arrives with \u201cacidic\u201d heartlessness from her mother, an abusive woman whose years of mistreatment culminate in an insistence that the funeral is Isabelle\u2019s responsibility. Isabelle can\u2019t turn to her partner for support because he has gone abroad, having fled \u201cthe growing frost of our relationship\u201d. So, alone on foreign soil, constricted by grief and solitude, this young woman\u2019s psyche splinters, and her distress manifests in harrowing phantasmagoria. At the edges of her vision, she begins to catch sight of the Erl-King: a skeletal spirit from Saxon folklore who devours wayward souls and seems to be hungry for hers. Desperate to outrun the ghoul \u2013 while also evading her mother\u2019s malice, dispelling thoughts of her father\u2019s body, and hiding her distress from her partner \u2013 Isabelle wanders the labyrinth of Strasbourg, aimless and anxious. Tranquillity via psychogeography is her subconscious intention. Immersing herself in the estranging city, she hopes to dissolve her woes in its hidden histories. Along the way she uncovers residual traces of bygone figures whose lives have left impressions on the streets: Goethe, Gutenberg, Gustave Dor\u00e9. But as Isabelle repeatedly finds these figures themselves \u201chiding from spectres of lost fathers\u201d, their reconstructed narratives become projections of the turmoil she is trying to suppress. Profoundly withdrawn from the world around her, she can\u2019t see that her dispassionate ruminations on place are also self-lacerating expressions of her trauma \u2013 and her blindness leaves her even more vulnerable to the Erl-King. The results are deeply unnerving, but Isabelle\u2019s fever dreams occasionally open on to an otherworldly beauty. Admittedly, those who anticipate pulse-quickening thrills from a story of madness and the macabre will be frustrated by the languid pace and sentences that indulge in extravagances such as: \u201cThe sharing of this wintery world would have broken the swelling spell that was dragging me pleasurably under the damp pavements within tenderly vile embraces.\u201d Then, too, with a male author voicing a female narrator who sounds like an echo of her male predecessor, the novel seems prepared to inflame live debates about the proprietorship of gender identities, not least when the self-harming Isabelle describes, at length, being raped by the Erl-King. But Scovell doesn\u2019t aspire to realism: instead he invests his talents in hallucinatory imagery, haunting atmospherics and prose that again blends the stately melancholia of WG Sebald with the logorrhoea of Thomas Bernhard. Abstruse and florid as Scovell\u2019s style can be, its rhythms over time become incantatory, and its mournful musicality and serpentine recursions are as hypnotic here as in Mothlight. And while its simple transference to another narrator may suggest a limit to his creative powers, diminishing Isabelle\u2019s distinctive persona, Scovell scales up something his debut confined to domestic settings: a disorienting effect described by Isabelle as the \u201cquiver[ing]\u201d of \u201ctemporal instability\u201d. In fact, How Pale the Winter Has Made Us is at its best when it maximises Mothlight\u2019s miniature trials of this effect, giving them a citywide sweep. Strasbourg itself is, of course, a nexus of unstable energies\u2013 it has long been at the mercy of national borders in flux, and anglophone outsiders can be baffled by its atmospheric oscillations between the French and German languages \u2013 but now Scovell adds time to the mix.

NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order.

Gaining fame in his home country as the organ and synth player for 70s jazz-funk outfit Walias Band, he relocated to Washington DC in the 80s, released a solo album in the US to little acclaim and ultimately gave up music to drive a cab.

      "bodyText": "Ethiopian multi-instrumentalist Hailu Mergia\u2019s backstory is one of \u201cworld music\u201d cliche. Gaining fame in his home country as the organ and synth player for 70s jazz-funk outfit Walias Band, he relocated to Washington DC in the 80s, released a solo album in the US to little acclaim and ultimately gave up music to drive a cab. In 2013, though, Mergia was \u201crediscovered\u201d by Awesome Tapes from Africa\u2019s Brian Shimkovitz, who reissued that 1985 solo accordion odyssey, Hailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument, and a star was (re)born. Of course, in his many years of relative obscurity Mergia continued to noodle away at his keyboard, honing his talent for skewed, ear-worming arrangements. The result was his first solo album in two decades, 2018\u2019s Lala Belu. Where that album\u2019s trio setup showcased a groove-laden, deep-swinging side to Mergia, his latest offering, Yene Mircha (My Choice), finds him taking a more meandering, sonically adventurous path.

In that film, Awkwafina\u2019s middle-aged dad was played by Tzi Ma, whose gentle, sensitive face mutely spoke volumes about hardship and sacrifice. He plays a very similar role in this heartfelt, flawed debut feature from Taiwanese-American director Alan Yang \u2013 whose track record is in TV comedy, having written and produced for the hit show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks and Recreation</a>.</p> <p>It is a very different work: serious and personal, clearly fictionalising at some level aspects of the director\u2019s own family experience, and perhaps self-conscious in a way that successful comedy isn\u2019t. Sometimes the transitions and flashbacks are a bit on the nose, and the modern-day sequences have a TV-movie look to them. And yet there is a real emotional surge in the way Yang conjures the past.</p> <p>Tzi Ma is Pin-Jui, a divorced Taiwanese guy living in New York, who has a tense relationship with his grownup daughter, Angela (Christine Ko). He has just returned to the city, having made a melancholy journey back to his hometown of Huwei (or \u201cTigertail\u201d) to attend the funeral of his mother (Kuei-Mei Yang) whom he could never persuade to join him in the US. The experience triggers a rush of memories: living with grandmother as a child under Chinese rule, and then as a young man (played by Hong-chi Lee), full of dreams and swagger, in love with his childhood sweetheart, Yuan (Yo-Hsing Fang), with whom he dances to American-style pop music in the local bars. But, above everything, he dreams of leaving Taiwan for America, and hanging out with Faye Dunaway. Yuan loves America, too, being a fan of Otis Redding.

The manager of the factory where Pin-Jui and his mum have jobs takes him aside and asks him to have dinner with his demure daughter, Zhenzhen (Kunjue Li), and tells him that, if they get married, he will pay for them to travel and get set up in the States. It is a powerful moment when Pin-Jui, having always been ashamed to take Yuan back to the humble place he shares with his widowed mother, finally does so, and Yang indirectly suggests that this is the point at which they have sex for the first time, but also when Pin-Jui is trying to show Yuan how desperately poor he is, so she will understand his need to get away at all costs.</p> <p>And so Pin-Jui\u2019s whole life is founded on a lie: a loveless marriage to a gentle, sensitive person who senses down deep that something is wrong but, schooled in the wifely duties of submission, simply thinks that all marriages are as tough and unhappy as hers. Zhenzhen\u2019s one friend is fellow Taiwanese Peijing (Cindera Che), who is quite unsentimental about her own unsatisfactory marriage. When Zhenzhen confides to her that she and her husband have nothing in common, she says: \u201cEventually, your life together is what you have in common.\u201d That is a grim thought \u2013 and yet many modern-day Americans, immigrants or otherwise, have seen their parents make the best of things in just this way.</p> <p>The scenes of childhood and youth work very well, but the modern-day part of the film is directed in an oddly flat way, and the all-important scenes with Angela have little of the charge that Yang puts into the earlier sequences.

Pin-Jui harshly tells Angela not to cry, just as his own tough grandmother told him. And so the cycle of pain continues.

The genre\u2019s continued absence elsewhere has meant that some of the streamer\u2019s lesser efforts have garnered celebratory reviews that seem less focused on the details of the film in question and more on its very existence but with their latest, the British-Italian farce Love Wedding Repeat, it\u2019s hard to imagine even the thirstiest romcom lover praising its subdued online launch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/03/coffee-kareem-review-fast-foul-and-fitfully-funny-netflix-comedy\">Coffee &amp; Kareem review \u2013 fast, filthy and fitfully funny Netflix comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a remake of the 2012 French comedy Plan de Table, throwing us into a familiar situation \u2013 a fraught wedding \u2013 and then adding a fantastical gimmick. The film starts out with a near-miss between Jack (Sam Claflin) and Dina (Olivia Munn), a goodbye that should have ended with a kiss, but fate had other ideas, and three years later they meet again at the Italian wedding of Jack\u2019s sister Hayley (Eleanor Tomlinson). As a Judi Dench-sounding narrator tells us, romance can be affected by the slightest of deviation within our daily lives and at a wedding, if place settings were to be moved around, the course of true love could go from running smoothly to not running at all.</p> <p>And so writer-director Dean Craig plays musical chairs with \u201cthe English table\u201d \u2013 Jack, Dina, Jack\u2019s \u201cnightmare ex\u201d Amanda (Freida Pinto) and her insecure new boyfriend Chaz (Allan Mustafa), boring kilt-wearing non-Scot Sidney (Tim Key), intense Rebecca (Aisling Bea), wannabe actor and \u201cman\u201d of honour Bryan (Joel Fry) and Marc (Jack Farthing), an uninvited coked-up former fling of the bride who threatens to ruin the whole day. We see their chaotic escapades play out before then rewinding to see what could also have happened if they\u2019d been seated differently. Hilarity should ensue either way except that it doesn\u2019t, replaced with the odd smirk along the way instead.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6CyqhYsLqo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x6CyqhYsLqo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As with the majority of Craig\u2019s previous scripts, from Caffeine to Death at a Funeral to A Few Best Men, the stage is set for all-out ensemble farce yet his moving parts of choice, including sedatives, dick jokes and a secret tryst, aren\u2019t really inventive enough to propel the film into the quippy, fast-paced comedy it so desperately wants to be. There have been a great many romcoms that have managed to find new ways to squeeze rom and com out of the most obvious setting of all but Love Wedding Repeat isn\u2019t one of them, its hackneyed backdrop instead serving as a blunt reminder of the better films that came before it. The reality-shifting device at its centre is also sloppily used with the film offering up one version of events, a montage of others and then another extended set of circumstances. A slicker film could have found a better way to use this twist, in both the script and the direction but things are mostly flat all round, a glass of champagne that\u2019s lost its fizz.</p> <p>Given the sheer amount flung at the wall, there are some things that briefly stick and its mostly down to some choice comedian casting. Key\u2019s specific line delivery is as amusing as it ever has been and he manages to find something of a groove with his one-note character and similarly Bea, whose star continues to ascend after last year\u2019s darkly funny Channel 4 and Hulu series This Way Up, tries her best with limited material (although oddly her funniest scenes arrive during the end credits). But at the opposite end, an incredibly wooden Pinto is disastrously miscast as the venomous ex while Claflin and Munn\u2019s chemistry fizzles out fast.</p> <p>The film\u2019s drunken lurch into earnest romance near the end, after leaning on bawdy humour for the most part, requires us to see these characters as something other than farcical chess pieces, an uphill battle for all involved. The frequent use of Claire de Lune, a glorious piece of music that would make footage of an Amazon warehouse seem emotional, becomes a lazy crutch, forcing us to feel something that just isn\u2019t there. A repeat viewing of an older romantic comedy would make for a better night in.</p> <ul> <li><p>Love Wedding Repeat is now available on Netflix</p></li> </ul>",

The film starts out with a near-miss between Jack (Sam Claflin) and Dina (Olivia Munn), a goodbye that should have ended with a kiss, but fate had other ideas, and three years later they meet again at the Italian wedding of Jack\u2019s sister Hayley (Eleanor Tomlinson). As a Judi Dench-sounding narrator tells us, romance can be affected by the slightest of deviation within our daily lives and at a wedding, if place settings were to be moved around, the course of true love could go from running smoothly to not running at all. And so writer-director Dean Craig plays musical chairs with \u201cthe English table\u201d \u2013 Jack, Dina, Jack\u2019s \u201cnightmare ex\u201d Amanda (Freida Pinto) and her insecure new boyfriend Chaz (Allan Mustafa), boring kilt-wearing non-Scot Sidney (Tim Key), intense Rebecca (Aisling Bea), wannabe actor and \u201cman\u201d of honour Bryan (Joel Fry) and Marc (Jack Farthing), an uninvited coked-up former fling of the bride who threatens to ruin the whole day. We see their chaotic escapades play out before then rewinding to see what could also have happened if they\u2019d been seated differently. Hilarity should ensue either way except that it doesn\u2019t, replaced with the odd smirk along the way instead. As with the majority of Craig\u2019s previous scripts, from Caffeine to Death at a Funeral to A Few Best Men, the stage is set for all-out ensemble farce yet his moving parts of choice, including sedatives, dick jokes and a secret tryst, aren\u2019t really inventive enough to propel the film into the quippy, fast-paced comedy it so desperately wants to be. There have been a great many romcoms that have managed to find new ways to squeeze rom and com out of the most obvious setting of all but Love Wedding Repeat isn\u2019t one of them, its hackneyed backdrop instead serving as a blunt reminder of the better films that came before it. The reality-shifting device at its centre is also sloppily used with the film offering up one version of events, a montage of others and then another extended set of circumstances. A slicker film could have found a better way to use this twist, in both the script and the direction but things are mostly flat all round, a glass of champagne that\u2019s lost its fizz. Given the sheer amount flung at the wall, there are some things that briefly stick and its mostly down to some choice comedian casting. Key\u2019s specific line delivery is as amusing as it ever has been and he manages to find something of a groove with his one-note character and similarly Bea, whose star continues to ascend after last year\u2019s darkly funny Channel 4 and Hulu series This Way Up, tries her best with limited material (although oddly her funniest scenes arrive during the end credits). But at the opposite end, an incredibly wooden Pinto is disastrously miscast as the venomous ex while Claflin and Munn\u2019s chemistry fizzles out fast. The film\u2019s drunken lurch into earnest romance near the end, after leaning on bawdy humour for the most part, requires us to see these characters as something other than farcical chess pieces, an uphill battle for all involved. The frequent use of Claire de Lune, a glorious piece of music that would make footage of an Amazon warehouse seem emotional, becomes a lazy crutch, forcing us to feel something that just isn\u2019t there. A repeat viewing of an older romantic comedy would make for a better night in. Love Wedding Repeat is now available on Netflix",

      "body": "<p>As a kid I read two kinds of books: cheap, paperback science fiction novels with covers festooned with spaceships and robots, and Herg\u00e9\u2019s Adventures of Tintin. How I adored Herg\u00e9! Best of all were those Tintin adventures that combined my two passions: <a href=\"http://en.tintin.com/albums/show/id/34/page/0/0/the-shooting-star\">The Shooting Star</a> (1941-42), <a href=\"http://en.tintin.com/albums/show/id/40/page/0/0/destination-moon\">Destination Moon/Explorers on the Moon</a> (1950-53) and <a href=\"https://tintin.fandom.com/wiki/Flight_714\">Flight 714 to Sydney</a> (1966-67).</p> <p>Child-me pored over on these books and their wonderful <em><a href=\"https://comicbookglossary.wordpress.com/ligne-claire/\">ligne claire</a></em> images. Captain Haddock was, I think, the first fictional character I genuinely loved. To this day I maintain that there is real genius in his characterisation, the way his grumpiness and slapstick reinforce rather than erode his splendid courage and comradeship, and the way his character grows, from the cowardly booze-hound we first meet in The Crab With the Golden Claws into something approaching noble.</p> <p>Still, to reread Tintin as an adult can be startling. Take The Shooting Star: a meteor is hurtling towards the Earth, growing brighter in the sky night by night, making the world so hot the tarmac melts on the roads. It promises apocalypse, but the meteor misses us, though an island-sized chunk breaks off and falls into the Atlantic. Since this rock contains valuable minerals unknown to our world, Tintin and Haddock mount an expedition to claim it. But a rival expedition also wants the prize.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d51ddf2bfc14d1df0097af5c8dbf3274787c02ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d51ddf2bfc14d1df0097af5c8dbf3274787c02ba/102_0_2212_3409/649..jpg\" alt=\"A page from Herg\u00e9\u2019s manuscript for The Shooting Star.\" width=\"649\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A page from Herg\u00e9\u2019s manuscript for The Shooting Star.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Studio Sebert/PIASA/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing in Nazi-occupied Belgium in 1941, Herg\u00e9 makes these rivals nasty Americans managed by a venal financier called Bohlwinkel, a bulb-nosed, pin-eyed caricature Jew. After the war, and mindful of the US market, Herg\u00e9 revised away the US: in later editions the rivals hail from the fictional country of S\u00e3o Rico, their stars-and-stripes redrawn as an imaginary flag. (Although their ships are still incongruously called the SS Peary and the SS Kentucky Star.) But he left in the disfiguring antisemitism, which speaks, alas, to his postwar priorities.</p> <p>None of this registered with me as a child, but as an adult I can\u2019t help but be struck by it. Collaborator is a harsh word, but it\u2019s hard to deny its applicability to Herg\u00e9. Then again, Tintin explicitly stands for interracial friendship, most prominently with his Chinese best friend, Tchang. (The two share one of Herg\u00e9\u2019s best stories, Tintin in Tibet). And The Red Sea Sharks (1958) is filled with horror at the modern-day trafficking of black Africans, even if its representation of those Africans is still mired in the patronising stereotypes of Tintin in the Congo (1931, a book quite properly unavailable in the UK because of its racism). Tintin, this blond Aryan, this upholder of the bourgeois status quo, is also Tintin, gay hero, living openly and happily with Haddock, befriending people regardless of class or race. It\u2019s complicated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/gallery/2016/jan/16/tintin-herges-masterpiece\">Tintin: Herg\u00e9's masterpiece \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Shooting Star is simultaneously a piece of Nazi-era propaganda and an ingeniously surreal subversion of that propaganda. It\u2019s a story about a team from German-occupied Europe beating the US to the meteoric prize. (Tintin pips the Yanks to the post by means of a deck-launched German Arado 196 seaplane.) But their prize is a nightmare: the extraterrestrial constitution of the meteor causes mushroom spores to bloom and swell to enormous size. A discarded apple core grows in moments into a gigantic tree dropping apples the size of boulders. A spider as big as a cow appears and chases Tintin across the waste. At the end, the mysterious star slips below the waves, as if it had never been, and Tintin and Snowy are rescued in the nick of time.</p> <p>Early in the story, when an escaped lunatic attempts to sabotage the expedition ship with dynamite, Tintin talks him down, using a megaphone to pretend to be the voice of God.

      "bodyText": "As a kid I read two kinds of books: cheap, paperback science fiction novels with covers festooned with spaceships and robots, and Herg\u00e9\u2019s Adventures of Tintin. How I adored Herg\u00e9! Best of all were those Tintin adventures that combined my two passions: The Shooting Star (1941-42), Destination Moon/Explorers on the Moon (1950-53) and Flight 714 to Sydney (1966-67). Child-me pored over on these books and their wonderful ligne claire images. Captain Haddock was, I think, the first fictional character I genuinely loved. To this day I maintain that there is real genius in his characterisation, the way his grumpiness and slapstick reinforce rather than erode his splendid courage and comradeship, and the way his character grows, from the cowardly booze-hound we first meet in The Crab With the Golden Claws into something approaching noble. Still, to reread Tintin as an adult can be startling. Take The Shooting Star: a meteor is hurtling towards the Earth, growing brighter in the sky night by night, making the world so hot the tarmac melts on the roads. It promises apocalypse, but the meteor misses us, though an island-sized chunk breaks off and falls into the Atlantic. Since this rock contains valuable minerals unknown to our world, Tintin and Haddock mount an expedition to claim it. But a rival expedition also wants the prize. Writing in Nazi-occupied Belgium in 1941, Herg\u00e9 makes these rivals nasty Americans managed by a venal financier called Bohlwinkel, a bulb-nosed, pin-eyed caricature Jew. After the war, and mindful of the US market, Herg\u00e9 revised away the US: in later editions the rivals hail from the fictional country of S\u00e3o Rico, their stars-and-stripes redrawn as an imaginary flag. (Although their ships are still incongruously called the SS Peary and the SS Kentucky Star.) But he left in the disfiguring antisemitism, which speaks, alas, to his postwar priorities. None of this registered with me as a child, but as an adult I can\u2019t help but be struck by it. Collaborator is a harsh word, but it\u2019s hard to deny its applicability to Herg\u00e9. Then again, Tintin explicitly stands for interracial friendship, most prominently with his Chinese best friend, Tchang. (The two share one of Herg\u00e9\u2019s best stories, Tintin in Tibet). And The Red Sea Sharks (1958) is filled with horror at the modern-day trafficking of black Africans, even if its representation of those Africans is still mired in the patronising stereotypes of Tintin in the Congo (1931, a book quite properly unavailable in the UK because of its racism). Tintin, this blond Aryan, this upholder of the bourgeois status quo, is also Tintin, gay hero, living openly and happily with Haddock, befriending people regardless of class or race. It\u2019s complicated. The Shooting Star is simultaneously a piece of Nazi-era propaganda and an ingeniously surreal subversion of that propaganda. It\u2019s a story about a team from German-occupied Europe beating the US to the meteoric prize. (Tintin pips the Yanks to the post by means of a deck-launched German Arado 196 seaplane.) But their prize is a nightmare: the extraterrestrial constitution of the meteor causes mushroom spores to bloom and swell to enormous size. A discarded apple core grows in moments into a gigantic tree dropping apples the size of boulders. A spider as big as a cow appears and chases Tintin across the waste. At the end, the mysterious star slips below the waves, as if it had never been, and Tintin and Snowy are rescued in the nick of time. Early in the story, when an escaped lunatic attempts to sabotage the expedition ship with dynamite, Tintin talks him down, using a megaphone to pretend to be the voice of God. When I read it as a kid, that seemed daft and funny. Now the whole story strikes me as a complicated riff on madness, on the insanity of the war years, on the arachnid ideology of Nazism, the giganticism of the US and the ultimately void prize for which they were competing. Fevered and brilliant, monstrous and hilarious, the book is a dream-haunting vision of sanity melting into madness, like the tarmac dissolving hot flowing tar at the book\u2019s beginnings.

It wasn\u2019t very fun. But I\u2019ve always managed to make feelgood music regardless of whether I\u2019m feeling good \u2013 perhaps that\u2019s set me in good stead for where we are now. I have been trying to achieve something every day, even if that is just a big cycle ride. I\u2019ve been doing cover versions or jamming on the guitar, and putting them on YouTube. And I want to get into film scoring \u2013 I now have so much time, it\u2019s something I want to work on as a craft. Maybe it\u2019s because everything seems so dramatic right now that film scores sound so good. So I\u2019ve been listening to Hans Zimmer\u2019s Inception soundtrack.

Moalem believes that the X-chromosome has always received a poor press, and that it is time this negative view is counteracted. He draws on swathes of medical and historical data to show that, in many instances, the superiority of women\u2019s biology is explicitly linked to their possession of the second X-chromosome. The greater complexity of women\u2019s biology, he claims, is the secret of their success \u2013 it is more difficult to make a female but, once made, she trumps the male in her lifelong survival skills, for instance in her hyperefficient immune system shrugging off infection and maximising the benefits of vaccination \u2013 which means that females can avoid the consequences of a wide range of life threatening events ranging from starvation and cancer to, Moalem has cautiously concluded, Covid-19.<br><br>In mainstream genetics it was long held that, despite having two X-chromosomes, female cells only made use of one: the second randomly switched off or deactivated early on in embryonic development, a process rather summarily described as an instance of \u201cgenetic redundancy\u201d. There was some evidence that the deactivation reduced female chances of succumbing to X-linked problems, due to the availability of an undamaged back-up. It was acknowledged, for example (though rather grudgingly), that women generally escaped being colour blind.

In a second group in this population (let\u2019s call them females), almost all can see the standard 1m colours, but some (perhaps as many as 15%) can see 100m colours. Would you excitedly rave about the amazing talent of this latter group? Or would you just describe them as \u201cnot usually colour blind\u201d? This same group has an immune system that has a profound talent to fight off many forms of infection and reap major benefits from vaccinations \u2013 with the down side that sometimes such hyperefficiency can lead to autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis.

Yet this book is full of wonderful titbits of information \u2013 from the existence of a female prostate gland to the number of honey bee flying miles it takes to make 1lb of honey. The celebration of the genetic diversity offered by the female\u2019s second X-chromosome is wholehearted and the examples Moalem gives are highly effective. He has written a powerful antidote to the myth of the \u201cweaker sex\u201d. \u2022 Gina Rippon\u2019s The Gendered Brain is published by Vintage. The Better Half: On the Genetic Superiority of Women by Sharon Moalem is published by Allen Lane (RRP \u00a320).",

For instance, you can click the time to get to notifications or battery icon to get to quick settings, or you can fling the cursor to each respective cursor with a bit of force instead. To bring up the dock you need to fling the cursor to the bottom of the screen. It\u2019s surprisingly fun, if using a cursor on a screen could ever be described as such.</p> <p>Not all the usual interactions you expect are supported, such as a lack of hover-over for tool tips, which stops some functions in web apps from working. Some buttons also refuse to click, such as the back arrow in Evernote. Clearly, some third-party app developers will need to do some work.</p> <p>Overall, trackpad and mouse support is fairly transformative for the iPad Pro as a work machine attached to a keyboard. It adds much-needed precision for text selection, working in spreadsheets and other office duties, while also reducing the strain of constant prodding of the screen.</p> <h2>Lidar and camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74082d26830325232004cedc6570ad701f4508a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74082d26830325232004cedc6570ad701f4508a6/700_427_3574_2145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple 12.9in iPad Pro review 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dual-camera and lidar lump on the back of the iPad Pro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The big new hardware addition to the iPad Pro for 2020 is a new dual-camera setup, similar to that used on the iPhone 11, and a lidar sensor.</p> <p>The cameras are good for a tablet, but not as good as those on the iPhone 11. Fine for random snaps, but a phone is likely better for keepsakes.</p> <p>The front-facing 7-megapixel camera is excellent for video calls \u2013 infinitely better than those fitted to Apple\u2019s laptops. I wish it was fitted to the top in landscape, rather than portrait, which would be far better for use in a keyboard case.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar\">lidar</a> sensor aids augmented reality (AR) apps.

But AR on a tablet remains niche.</p> <p>Instead the big changes are software as part of iPadOS 13.4, which is also available for older models. It makes the iPad Pro more of a full computer replacement than ever.</p> <p>I can finally get every part of my work done on the tablet, without resorting to hacky work-arounds or finishing on a PC. This review was written and edited, the photos imported and edited, and finally the lot inserted into the Guardian\u2019s backend systems, something I\u2019ve simply not been able to do before all on an iPad.</p> <p>The 12.9in screen was big enough not to feel cramped, while some tasks were faster and others slower than when working on a Mac or PC. But, finally, the answer to the ever-present question hanging over the iPad Pro of \u201ccan you get real work done on an iPad\u201d is: yes. And without massive adjustments too.</p> <p>It may not be much different from the last one, but the 2020 iPad Pro is the very best mobile tablet you can buy \u2013 which it absolutely should be for at least \u00a3969 for the 12.9in version \u2013 and arguably a solid laptop or PC replacement.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> good battery life, fast, beautiful screen, optional 4G, USB-C, great speakers, Face ID, mouse support, capable work PC replacement, lidar</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> very expensive, no kickstand without case, no headphone socket, will still need a PC for some tasks</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"818413feeb600f4b41e63b600b156f3d2a786a69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/818413feeb600f4b41e63b600b156f3d2a786a69/138_112_4388_2634/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple 12.9in iPad Pro review 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The all-screen design, thin profile, squared-off sides and rounded corners still look fantastic two years on</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/apple-macbook-air-review-2020-near-perfect-consumer-laptop\">Apple MacBook Air review: 2020\u2019s near-perfect consumer laptop</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/16in-macbook-pro-review-bigger-battery-new-keyboard-new-apple\">16in MacBook Pro review: bigger battery, new keyboard, new Apple</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/12/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-not-yet-ready-for-prime-time\">Microsoft Surface Pro X review: not yet ready for prime time</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/23/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-the-best-windows-10-tablet-pc-computer\">Microsoft Surface Pro 7 review: the best Windows 10 tablet PC you can buy</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/06/microsoft-surface-go-review-tablet-thats-better-for-work-than-play\">Microsoft Surface Go review: tablet that\u2019s better for work than play</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The 2020 iPad Pro takes 2018\u2019s wow-factor redesign and beefs up the camera on the back with lidar (light and radar) technology, commonly used in self-driving cars, not tablet computers. Apple re-invented the iPad Pro in 2018 with a stunning design featuring large, beautiful screens with thin bezels, Face ID instead of a Touch ID home button, and squared-off sides. The new \u00a3769 iPad Pro is essentially identical and just as stunning two years on as the original, here reviewed in its larger 12.9in form starting at \u00a3969 plus the Smart Keyboard Folio costing \u00a3199. The tablet has four excellent speakers in the sides, a USB-C port, magnetic wireless charger for the Apple Pencil stylus and a little pogo-pin smart connector on the back for keyboard cases. There\u2019s no headphones socket though. The camera lump has grown on the back, mirroring that used on the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, featuring a dual camera system and the lidar scanner \u2013 more on those in a moment. Specifications Screen: 12.9in 2732x2048 Liquid Retina display (264 pixels per inch) Processor: Apple A12Z Bionic RAM: 6GB Storage: 128, 256, 512 GB or 1TB Operating system: iPadOS 13.4 Camera: 12MP wide, 10MP ultrawide and Lidar scanner, 7MP TrueDepth selfie camera Connectivity: Wifi 6 (4G optional, eSim), Bluetooth 5, USB-C, Face ID Dimensions: 280.6 x 214.9 x 5.9mm Weight: 641g (4G version: 643g) Power and battery life The Apple A12Z Bionic processor is the same as the A12X Bionic used in the 2018 iPad Pro, but with an eight-core GPU instead of seven. It performs the same: fast and smooth. Apple says the iPad Pro is more powerful than many full-blown computers; certainly Affinity Photo was faster performing the same complex edits on the iPad Pro than on the new MacBook Air with an Intel Core i3 chip. Battery life wasn\u2019t quite as good as the previous model when tested in 2018. The new iPad Pro manages more than eight hours of constant work between charges; enough for day\u2019s work and watching a video on the commute home but not quite the 1.5 days working-day battery that 2018\u2019s model managed. Part of this discrepancy could be explained by the upgrade from iOS 12 to the more capable iPadOS 13.4, which does more, often concurrently, so will be more power hungry \u2013 but also more useful. With lighter use, such as reading or watching offline movies, the iPad Pro lasts well over nine hours between charges. Charging the 12.9in iPad Pro with the included folding 18W charger took three hours 20 minutes from flat. Using 45W charger shaved more than an hour off that time. Sustainability Apple does not give a rated lifecycle for the iPad Pro\u2019s battery, typically 500 full-charge cycles, but it can be replaced for \u00a399. The tablet is generally repairable, with the out-of-warranty service cost being \u00a3616.44, which includes the screen. The iPad Pro was only awarded a three out of 10 for repairability by the specialist iFixit. The iPad Pro has 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main board, flash and wireless charger and at least 35% recycled plastic used in multiple components. Apple is also using renewable energy for final assembly of the machine, and breaks down the tablet\u2019s environmental impact in its report. Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. iPadOS 13.4 Since splitting iOS into iPadOS for Apple\u2019s tablets and iOS for its smartphones, the iPad line has gained significant utility more befitting of a tablet computer. The big new addition for iPadOS 13.4 is Bluetooth or USB-C mouse and trackpad support, an update available for a large range of iPads, not just the iPad Pro. You don\u2019t quite get a mouse pointer on-screen like a Mac. Instead you get a morphing blob that changes shape when near actionable items. A caret appears when over text like a Mac, but when you go near a button the cursor jumps to it, morphing into a light-grey rectangle highlighting the button. This instant selection reduces the precision required to click something obvious. A trackpad is the best option for the iPad as it opens up a load of gestures many of which are similar to those on a Mac. Highlights include two-finger scrolling, three/four/five-finger swipes replicating iPadOS\u2019s navigation gestures (up for home etc), and a five-finger pinch to see recently used apps. You can even two-finger or right click, which brings up what would be the tap-and-hold menu on icons and items. The interface and cursor have a bit a momentum too. For instance, you can click the time to get to notifications or battery icon to get to quick settings, or you can fling the cursor to each respective cursor with a bit of force instead. To bring up the dock you need to fling the cursor to the bottom of the screen. It\u2019s surprisingly fun, if using a cursor on a screen could ever be described as such. Not all the usual interactions you expect are supported, such as a lack of hover-over for tool tips, which stops some functions in web apps from working. Some buttons also refuse to click, such as the back arrow in Evernote. Clearly, some third-party app developers will need to do some work. Overall, trackpad and mouse support is fairly transformative for the iPad Pro as a work machine attached to a keyboard. It adds much-needed precision for text selection, working in spreadsheets and other office duties, while also reducing the strain of constant prodding of the screen. Lidar and camera The big new hardware addition to the iPad Pro for 2020 is a new dual-camera setup, similar to that used on the iPhone 11, and a lidar sensor. The cameras are good for a tablet, but not as good as those on the iPhone 11. Fine for random snaps, but a phone is likely better for keepsakes. The front-facing 7-megapixel camera is excellent for video calls \u2013 infinitely better than those fitted to Apple\u2019s laptops. I wish it was fitted to the top in landscape, rather than portrait, which would be far better for use in a keyboard case. The lidar sensor aids augmented reality (AR) apps. It measures the distance to objects up to 5 metres away, allowing more accurate placement of virtual objects into the real world, particularly when they\u2019re placed behind real objects. The measure app, for instance, is more accurate, as is Ikea\u2019s furniture visualisation app. Other than the occasional points of interest, I have yet to be convinced of AR experiences through a tablet or a phone. Therefore lidar feels like a future-proofing addition that will be useful at some stage, once apps that can truly take advantage of it have appeared. Observations Face ID continues to be great Base models of the 2020 iPad Pro come 128GB of storage, twice as much as its predecessor Price The 2020 iPad Pro comes in space grey or silver, in two screen sizes, four storage options and versions with or without 4G. The wifi-only 11in iPad Pro costs \u00a3769 with 128GB of storage, \u00a3869 with 256GB, \u00a31,069 for 512GB and \u00a31,269 for 1TB. It costs \u00a3150 to add 4G to any of the storage versions. The wifi-only 12.9in iPad Pro costs \u00a3969 with 128GB of storage, \u00a31,069 with 256GB, \u00a31,269 for 512GB and \u00a31,469 for 1TB. It costs \u00a3150 to add 4G capability to any of the storage versions, which is especially useful for working on the go, but requires another mobile broadband subscription. The Apple Pencil costs \u00a3119 and the Smart Keyboard Folio costs \u00a3179 for the 11in iPad Pro and \u00a3199 for the 12.9in iPad Pro. Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard with integrated trackpad will cost \u00a3299 for the 11in and \u00a3349 for the 12.9in iPad Pro shipping in May. For comparison, Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro X costs from \u00a3999 and the Surface Pro 7 costs from \u00a3799 without keyboards. Verdict The 2020 iPad Pro is very much the 2018 model plus added cameras and lidar. It\u2019s a feature that improves AR and may prove transformative down the line. But AR on a tablet remains niche. Instead the big changes are software as part of iPadOS 13.4, which is also available for older models. It makes the iPad Pro more of a full computer replacement than ever. I can finally get every part of my work done on the tablet, without resorting to hacky work-arounds or finishing on a PC. This review was written and edited, the photos imported and edited, and finally the lot inserted into the Guardian\u2019s backend systems, something I\u2019ve simply not been able to do before all on an iPad. The 12.9in screen was big enough not to feel cramped, while some tasks were faster and others slower than when working on a Mac or PC. But, finally, the answer to the ever-present question hanging over the iPad Pro of \u201ccan you get real work done on an iPad\u201d is: yes. And without massive adjustments too. It may not be much different from the last one, but the 2020 iPad Pro is the very best mobile tablet you can buy \u2013 which it absolutely should be for at least \u00a3969 for the 12.9in version \u2013 and arguably a solid laptop or PC replacement. Pros: good battery life, fast, beautiful screen, optional 4G, USB-C, great speakers, Face ID, mouse support, capable work PC replacement, lidar Cons: very expensive, no kickstand without case, no headphone socket, will still need a PC for some tasks Other reviews Apple MacBook Air review: 2020\u2019s near-perfect consumer laptop 16in MacBook Pro review: bigger battery, new keyboard, new Apple Microsoft Surface Pro X review: not yet ready for prime time Microsoft Surface Pro 7 review: the best Windows 10 tablet PC you can buy Microsoft Surface Go review: tablet that\u2019s better for work than play",

However, Cassandra declined the god's advances. In retaliation, Apollo gave Cassandra prophetic powers but placed a curse on her that meant no one would believe her warnings or visions no matter how hard she tried to convince them.

Lavery was talented at recording moments like this in rapid oil sketch. Here he uses quick, fluid brushstrokes to describe both the clutter of this studio and the threatening presence of the tiny planes in the clear sky beyond.

While there she studied cubism under Andr\u00e9 Lhote. She first exhibited her non-figurative style in Dublin in 1922 and, along with Hone, is credited as one of female pioneers who brought modern art to Ireland. Jellett started the Irish Exhibition of Living Art a major annual exhibition of Irish abstract expressionism and avant-garde Irish art. Image: Composition c.1932, Mainie Jellett (1897\u20131944), Ulster Museum, 4:D - The woman in this painting is an allegory of fortune, and the monkey, who appears to be selecting playing cards, symbolises chance. The association of fortune with man\u2019s ability to shape his destiny by swift, decisive action was a popular concept during the Renaissance. It derived from the classical idea of fortune being an unpredictable force which must be seized to ensure success. Image: Allegory of Fortune, Lorenzo Lippi (1606\u20131665), Ulster Museum, 5:A - Kyle was born on the shores of Belfast Lough, and was particularly drawn to depicting the life of the sea and the work of women in harbour towns.

His paintings of County Wicklow, such as this one of the famous waterfall, attracted his patron Edmund Burke the Irish statesman and philosopher. Barret went on to be one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768. Image: The Waterfall at Powerscourt, George Barret the elder (1728/1732\u20131784), Ulster Museum, 7:C - Anne Marjorie Robinson was born in Belfast in 1858. Though she worked across multiple media, including panel painting and sculpture, her main practice was as a portrait miniature painter. She was an active member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters, established during a brief revival of the art at the turn of the century. The Ulster Museum holds 22 watercolour miniatures on ivory by the artist.

The journey started in France, or the Low Countries, then to Italy via the Mediterranean, returning through Austria-Hungary and Germany. The excavations of Pompeii (in 1748), the popularity of Roman poets such as Virgil and visits from high-profile English painters led to Italy becoming the focus of the journey, and subsequently landscape painting.

      "body": "<p>Helen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March \u2013 exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. \u201cIt felt like a 1960s-style birth,\u201d she jokes.</p> <p>She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. \u201cWe were hoping for the best,\u201d Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry \u2013 she hadn\u2019t brought enough food with her \u2013 so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again.</p> <p>For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. \u201cThe hardest bit of labour isn\u2019t the pushing,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cIt\u2019s the contractions. And doing that alone \u2026 you don\u2019t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can\u2019t have that person there with you.\u201d</p> <p>After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn\u2019t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn\u2019t known she had. \u201cIt gave me a newfound respect for women through history,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. \u201cIt\u2019s an anxious time for pregnant women,\u201d says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. \u201cThey are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. \u201cVisiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,\u201d says NHS England, \u201cbut our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.\u201d The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: \u201cAt the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.\u201d Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180/0_19_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Edmondson after the birth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Edmondson after the birth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Naomi Edmondson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section.</p> <p>What may be noticeable to mothers giving birth, however, is that hospitals seem emptier. A recent survey by the RCM found that 20% of midwife roles <a href=\"https://www.rcm.org.uk/media-releases/2020/march/rcm-plea-help-us-deliver-safe-care-for-pregnant-women/\">are currently unfilled</a> because of self-isolation, coronavirus or existing staff shortages. Last week, Lynsay Coventry, 54, died at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. She was the first midwife to die of Covid-19, showing the risks healthcare professionals are taking when carrying out their jobs.</p> <p>Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. \u201cThere was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: \u201cWe\u2019d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.\u201d She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages; some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews.</p> <p>Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. \u201cThe idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,\u201d she says.</p> <p>When it came to it, \u201cthe birth was great\u201d, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. \u201cThe fact I was not at home didn\u2019t matter.\u201d But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn\u2019t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. \u201cI started shouting at the midwives and crying,\u201d San says. \u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t meant to be there, this hadn\u2019t been the plan, I shouldn\u2019t be left alone with the baby and I wasn\u2019t coping.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507/0_0_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Martha San</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. \u201cIt just felt really wrong,\u201d San says. \u201cAfter the birth, I needed someone there and I didn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas\u2019s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. \u201cWhen they told me I couldn\u2019t have my water birth, I joked that I\u2019d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t actually expect that to happen.\u201d</p> <p>When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. \u201cI thought I could be like that for days.\u201d A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. \u201cI thought: it can\u2019t be the baby \u2013 it\u2019s too early,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even called the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn\u2019t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. \u201cI know that home births can be dangerous,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut maybe, subconsciously, I thought: \u2018I really don\u2019t want to have my baby on the labour ward.\u2019\u201d Collier-Thomas is not alone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/expectant-mothers-turn-to-freebirthing-after-home-births-cancelled\">as a result of the coronavirus lockdown</a>, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital; others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications.</p> <p>All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under \u2013 and are not bitter that their births didn\u2019t go as planned. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be upset,\u201d says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan \u201cbecause there\u2019s so much going on. I totally get it.\u201d Even though San\u2019s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. \u201cThey were doing an incredible job,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they can\u2019t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.\u201d</p> <p>The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn\u2019t end when you get home, though.

      "bodyText": "Helen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March \u2013 exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. \u201cIt felt like a 1960s-style birth,\u201d she jokes. She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. \u201cWe were hoping for the best,\u201d Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry \u2013 she hadn\u2019t brought enough food with her \u2013 so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again. For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. \u201cThe hardest bit of labour isn\u2019t the pushing,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cIt\u2019s the contractions. And doing that alone \u2026 you don\u2019t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can\u2019t have that person there with you.\u201d After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn\u2019t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn\u2019t known she had. \u201cIt gave me a newfound respect for women through history,\u201d she says. As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. \u201cIt\u2019s an anxious time for pregnant women,\u201d says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. \u201cThey are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.\u201d At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. \u201cVisiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,\u201d says NHS England, \u201cbut our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.\u201d The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: \u201cAt the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.\u201d Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth. But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section. What may be noticeable to mothers giving birth, however, is that hospitals seem emptier. A recent survey by the RCM found that 20% of midwife roles are currently unfilled because of self-isolation, coronavirus or existing staff shortages. Last week, Lynsay Coventry, 54, died at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. She was the first midwife to die of Covid-19, showing the risks healthcare professionals are taking when carrying out their jobs. Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. \u201cThere was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,\u201d she says. Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: \u201cWe\u2019d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.\u201d She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages; some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews. Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. \u201cThe idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,\u201d she says. When it came to it, \u201cthe birth was great\u201d, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. \u201cThe fact I was not at home didn\u2019t matter.\u201d But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn\u2019t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. \u201cI started shouting at the midwives and crying,\u201d San says. \u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t meant to be there, this hadn\u2019t been the plan, I shouldn\u2019t be left alone with the baby and I wasn\u2019t coping.\u201d A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. \u201cIt just felt really wrong,\u201d San says. \u201cAfter the birth, I needed someone there and I didn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas\u2019s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. \u201cWhen they told me I couldn\u2019t have my water birth, I joked that I\u2019d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t actually expect that to happen.\u201d When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. \u201cI thought I could be like that for days.\u201d A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. \u201cI thought: it can\u2019t be the baby \u2013 it\u2019s too early,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even called the hospital.\u201d Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn\u2019t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. \u201cI know that home births can be dangerous,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut maybe, subconsciously, I thought: \u2018I really don\u2019t want to have my baby on the labour ward.\u2019\u201d Collier-Thomas is not alone: as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital; others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications. All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under \u2013 and are not bitter that their births didn\u2019t go as planned. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be upset,\u201d says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan \u201cbecause there\u2019s so much going on. I totally get it.\u201d Even though San\u2019s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. \u201cThey were doing an incredible job,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they can\u2019t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.\u201d The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn\u2019t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won\u2019t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. \u201cThe staff were brilliant,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm and supportive.\u201d But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. \u201cWe\u2019re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful and overwhelming.\u201d For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. \u201cIt\u2019s really tainted everything,\u201d says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield.

      "body": "<p>For politicians in the US and western Europe seeking to distract from their own disastrous mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, the idea of \u201cChina\u201d has become a convenient scapegoat. The beauty of blaming \u201cChina\u201d lies in its ambiguity. Are critics merely condemning the way the Communist party concealed information during those crucial January weeks? Both <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/house-resolution-china-coronavirus-origin-trump-racism_n_5e7a2a80c5b6f5b7c54baf93?ri18n=true&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000098&amp;guccounter=1\">liberals</a> and conservatives in the US, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242202291718979587\">Donald Trump</a>, have used this defence.</p> <p>Or, is the clear subtext that the real culprits are the \u201cChinese people\u201d and their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-china-cornyn-blame/\">exotic culture and habits</a>? Leave it to Nigel Farage to clumsily play both sides, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/nigel-farage-china-coronavirus-west-rethink-1493085\">claiming</a> both that he held \u201cno ill-will against the Chinese people\u201d but that the problem lay with \u201cappalling hygiene conditions in Chinese wildlife markets\u201d and the customary diet of bats and pangolins. Whatever the intentions, we now see how criticisms of \u201cChina\u201d have translated into an upsurge of racist violence aimed at the Chinese and Asian diaspora living in the<a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/490373-attacks-on-asian-americans-at-about-100-per-day-due-to\"> US</a>,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/coronavirus-racism-europe-covid-19\"> western Europe</a> and<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8178421/Man-armed-WHIP-goes-racist-tirade-outside-Chinese-Consulate.html\"> Oceania</a>.</p> <p>I applaud the liberal condemnation of these attacks as <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-23/coronavirus-devastation-immigrants\">xenophobic</a>, but also worry that vague cries of tolerance for \u201cChinese people\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d play into the racist framing of the right, in which we wind up debating identity and difference at the expense of dynamic historical processes. Any serious attempt to grapple with China\u2019s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China\u2019s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus\u2019s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These dangerous sentiments will not disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s take the claim that the novel coronavirus was caused by a culturally peculiar fondness for eating pangolins. Though it is true that pangolin scales and meat are advertised as a sort of folk medicine in mainland China, statistics suggest the real key variable are the effects of globalisation, which have enriched the country\u2019s business classes. Prices for the animal have <a href=\"https://qz.com/874854/chinas-insatiable-thirst-for-pangolin-scales-is-fed-by-an-international-black-market/\">climbed from $14 </a>a kilo in 1994 to more than $600 today, while illegal shipments confiscated at the border regularly <a href=\"https://www.traffic.org/publications/reports/the-global-trafficking-of-pangolins/\">exceed 10 tonnes</a>. Customers ordering wildlife often do so in order to flaunt their wealth or to celebrate a good day on the stock market, although they remain a minority: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Cognition-types-and-frequency-analysis-of-Chinese-urban-residents-attitude-toward_tbl1_225329213\">most Chinese citizens</a> support strict limits, if not a ban, on wildlife consumption. Resurgent pangolin consumption is thus a result of economic liberalisation in China \u2013 which the US championed \u2013 not simply of traditional culture.</p> <p>It was <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/chinese-virus-world-market/\">these same economic forces</a> that also hastened the spread of the virus overseas. Wuhan, where the virus originated, originally served as a hub between coastal metropolises, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, and inland China. Although considered a \u201csecond-tier\u201d city, even Wuhan has been caught up in the latest phase of globalisation, as capital pursues cheaper land and labour markets inland. During February and March cases of the novel coronavirus illuminated economic linkages long hidden from view, such as Chinese investments into infrastructure in<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/irans-strategic-partnership-with-china-lies-at-root-of-its-coronavirus-outbreak-11583940683\"> Qom, Iran</a> or the ties between Wuhan\u2019s car parts industry and factories in<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march\"> Serbia, South Korea</a> and<a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/china/webasto-halts-travel-china-after-2-employees-germany-contract-coronavirus\"> Germany</a>. The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, but the ensuing spread and crisis also belong to the global assemblages of commerce, tourism, and supply chains erected by powerful interests in the 21st century.</p> <p>The great irony of blaming some vague notion of Chinese culture is that the best responses to the pandemic have come from the ethnic Chinese majority governments of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/world/taiwan-who-coronavirus-china/\">Taiwan</a> (five deaths, 380 cases), Singapore (six/1,910), and Hong Kong (four/974). Yes, their responsible policies were due largely to the trauma of the 2003 Sars epidemic but also have to do with the history of robust welfare states in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/opinion/covid-face-mask-shortage.html\">East Asia</a>, which, unlike Europe and the US, have increasingly invested in healthcare infrastructure to deal with precisely such crises.</p> <p>To push back on the anti-China line is not to apologise or defend the state\u2019s actions. It is clear that local officials were wrong to silence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Dr Li Wenliang</a>, who alerted friends about the virus as early as possible, and that the government has consistently downplayed the virus\u2019s contagiousness and the severity of deaths.</p> <p>But is the contrast between authoritarian and democratic regimes so stark, as<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/why-democracies-are-better-fighting-outbreaks/606976/\"> western ideologues</a> allege? Most observers agree that China covered up the crisis in Wuhan for three weeks in January, and this lost time probably decided the difference between a local versus a global epidemic. Nevertheless, it is still sobering to read reports that even from mid-January other governments took even longer to respond: the UK dragged its feet for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\"> an interminable eight weeks</a> and the US<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-intelligence-reports-from-january-and-february-warned-about-a-likely-pandemic/2020/03/20/299d8cda-6ad5-11ea-b5f1-a5a804158597_story.html\"> ignored clear warning signs for 70 days</a>.</p> <p>This inactivity was partly the product of a western exceptionalism that believed viruses and epidemics only happen \u201cover there\u201d, in poor and non-white countries. This is a crucial point for challenging anti-Asian racism. Rather than debate the blame game, as Justice is Global director Tobita Chow has written, we should point out how short-sighted <a href=\"https://fellowtravelersblog.com/2020/04/03/policy-from-the-people-cooperation-in-the-face-of-covid-19/\">nationalist perspectives</a> have produced fatally ineffective responses. During Italy\u2019s worst weeks, officials<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-center-lessons.html\"> admitted they</a> initially viewed the Wuhan crisis as a \u201cscience-fiction movie that had nothing to do with us\u201d. In the US, a<a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article241353836.html\"> Kansas politician stated</a> that his town was safe because it had only a few Chinese residents. In Philadelphia, in a more tragic offshoot of racial thinking, <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/03/coronavirus-immunity-racism-history-disease-yellow-fever/607891/\">rumours circulated</a> that the virus could not infect black Americans because it was a Chinese disease, misinformation that officials now fear <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-coronavirus-race-african-american-cases-rising-20200403.html\">exacerbated inequalities</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-black-people-ethnic-minority-deaths-pandemic-inequality-afua-hirsch\">If coronavirus doesn't discriminate, how come black people are bearing the brunt? | Afua Hirsch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, both the pandemic and the accompanying anti-Asian backlash are dynamics that go beyond questions of culture and xenophobia, carrying serious life-and-death consequences. Both are the indirect byproducts of China\u2019s emergence as a major force in global capitalism, not only forging the supply chains and travel networks that conveyed the virus but also threatening Euro-America\u2019s centuries-long economic and political prestige.</p> <p>In the US, such fears were already manifest in populist claims that China alone \u2013 and not the domestic political and business class \u2013 was to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs.

      "bodyText": "For politicians in the US and western Europe seeking to distract from their own disastrous mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, the idea of \u201cChina\u201d has become a convenient scapegoat. The beauty of blaming \u201cChina\u201d lies in its ambiguity. Are critics merely condemning the way the Communist party concealed information during those crucial January weeks? Both liberals and conservatives in the US, including Donald Trump, have used this defence. Or, is the clear subtext that the real culprits are the \u201cChinese people\u201d and their exotic culture and habits? Leave it to Nigel Farage to clumsily play both sides, claiming both that he held \u201cno ill-will against the Chinese people\u201d but that the problem lay with \u201cappalling hygiene conditions in Chinese wildlife markets\u201d and the customary diet of bats and pangolins. Whatever the intentions, we now see how criticisms of \u201cChina\u201d have translated into an upsurge of racist violence aimed at the Chinese and Asian diaspora living in the US, western Europe and Oceania. I applaud the liberal condemnation of these attacks as xenophobic, but also worry that vague cries of tolerance for \u201cChinese people\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d play into the racist framing of the right, in which we wind up debating identity and difference at the expense of dynamic historical processes. Any serious attempt to grapple with China\u2019s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China\u2019s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus\u2019s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash. Let\u2019s take the claim that the novel coronavirus was caused by a culturally peculiar fondness for eating pangolins. Though it is true that pangolin scales and meat are advertised as a sort of folk medicine in mainland China, statistics suggest the real key variable are the effects of globalisation, which have enriched the country\u2019s business classes. Prices for the animal have climbed from $14 a kilo in 1994 to more than $600 today, while illegal shipments confiscated at the border regularly exceed 10 tonnes. Customers ordering wildlife often do so in order to flaunt their wealth or to celebrate a good day on the stock market, although they remain a minority: most Chinese citizens support strict limits, if not a ban, on wildlife consumption. Resurgent pangolin consumption is thus a result of economic liberalisation in China \u2013 which the US championed \u2013 not simply of traditional culture. It was these same economic forces that also hastened the spread of the virus overseas. Wuhan, where the virus originated, originally served as a hub between coastal metropolises, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai, and inland China. Although considered a \u201csecond-tier\u201d city, even Wuhan has been caught up in the latest phase of globalisation, as capital pursues cheaper land and labour markets inland. During February and March cases of the novel coronavirus illuminated economic linkages long hidden from view, such as Chinese investments into infrastructure in Qom, Iran or the ties between Wuhan\u2019s car parts industry and factories in Serbia, South Korea and Germany. The coronavirus may have first appeared in China, but the ensuing spread and crisis also belong to the global assemblages of commerce, tourism, and supply chains erected by powerful interests in the 21st century. The great irony of blaming some vague notion of Chinese culture is that the best responses to the pandemic have come from the ethnic Chinese majority governments of Taiwan (five deaths, 380 cases), Singapore (six/1,910), and Hong Kong (four/974). Yes, their responsible policies were due largely to the trauma of the 2003 Sars epidemic but also have to do with the history of robust welfare states in East Asia, which, unlike Europe and the US, have increasingly invested in healthcare infrastructure to deal with precisely such crises. To push back on the anti-China line is not to apologise or defend the state\u2019s actions. It is clear that local officials were wrong to silence Dr Li Wenliang, who alerted friends about the virus as early as possible, and that the government has consistently downplayed the virus\u2019s contagiousness and the severity of deaths. But is the contrast between authoritarian and democratic regimes so stark, as western ideologues allege? Most observers agree that China covered up the crisis in Wuhan for three weeks in January, and this lost time probably decided the difference between a local versus a global epidemic. Nevertheless, it is still sobering to read reports that even from mid-January other governments took even longer to respond: the UK dragged its feet for an interminable eight weeks and the US ignored clear warning signs for 70 days. This inactivity was partly the product of a western exceptionalism that believed viruses and epidemics only happen \u201cover there\u201d, in poor and non-white countries. This is a crucial point for challenging anti-Asian racism. Rather than debate the blame game, as Justice is Global director Tobita Chow has written, we should point out how short-sighted nationalist perspectives have produced fatally ineffective responses. During Italy\u2019s worst weeks, officials admitted they initially viewed the Wuhan crisis as a \u201cscience-fiction movie that had nothing to do with us\u201d. In the US, a Kansas politician stated that his town was safe because it had only a few Chinese residents. In Philadelphia, in a more tragic offshoot of racial thinking, rumours circulated that the virus could not infect black Americans because it was a Chinese disease, misinformation that officials now fear exacerbated inequalities. Ultimately, both the pandemic and the accompanying anti-Asian backlash are dynamics that go beyond questions of culture and xenophobia, carrying serious life-and-death consequences. Both are the indirect byproducts of China\u2019s emergence as a major force in global capitalism, not only forging the supply chains and travel networks that conveyed the virus but also threatening Euro-America\u2019s centuries-long economic and political prestige. In the US, such fears were already manifest in populist claims that China alone \u2013 and not the domestic political and business class \u2013 was to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs. In the wake of a referendum result seen as a vote against globalisation, anxieties in the UK have recently been manifest in panic over Huawei providing the country\u2019s 5G network. Fears over China were not created by coronavirus, but find in it a most apt metaphor, as a global and invisible force of destruction. It follows that these dangerous sentiments will not automatically disappear when a vaccine is created, unless we demand more than liberal appeals for tolerance. We need to also recognise and confront the political-economic forces behind the west\u2019s anti-China backlash \u2013 and the inadequacy of nationalism in responding to the social and public health crises facing us today, which are global in scale. \u2022 Andrew Liu is an assistant professor of history at Villanova University and the author of Tea War: A History of Capitalism in China and India",

If that sounds worthy, perhaps it\u2019s exactly the boost we need right now; not least in the first episode, where Brown throws out a Mandela quote and implores us to temper our expectations with new experiences (or FFTs, \u201ceffing first times\u201d), especially in the current pandemic (\u201cI\u2019m a grown-ass person, but I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing \u2026 \u201d). Hannah J Davies Producer pick: Here\u2019s the Deal Chosen by Danielle Stephens (audio producer) Former vice president, current democratic nominee for the presidency and now \u2026 podcast host. In a week that saw Biden\u2019s only rival for the democratic nominee suspend his campaign, he sat down (virtually of course) with the Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. She is the reason to listen to this week\u2019s episode. Whitmer has simultaneously garnered admiration from the more powerful Democrat players, and drawn ire from a certain Republican in the White House for how she\u2019s dealing with Covid-19 in her state. She talks about having to work, and enjoy working, with Republicans across the aisle to build a consensus \u2013 breath of fresh air for anyone who, like me, who feels bipartisanship has been all but lost in the US. There\u2019s a small monologue by Biden in the middle about how great Americans have been through the coronavirus crisis, but you can skip that and come back in for the listener\u2019s questions at the end. Unfortunately for Joe, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s found his calling in podcasting. But it will certainly be interesting to see who else appears on the show in the run up to the November election.

      "body": "<p>Tommy Chong has got the munchies. It\u2019s early afternoon in locked-down LA, and last night he was on the pot cookies. \u201cMy wife, Shelby, just made a whole batch of them \u2013 oatmeal and maple syrup.\u201d He stops to correct himself. \u201cI put the pot in there, and of course I put too much in. Last night it got me almost comatose. Shelby got kinda mad at me. You know like when a kid gets so stoned all you do is sit there and grin.\u201d Chong is 82 next month.</p> <p>He sounds about four decades younger \u2013 his voice is deep, sexy, pulsing with life. Chong is one half of the most famous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/back-with-a-bong-why-we-need-stoner-movies-more-than-ever\">stoner comic partnership in history, Cheech and Chong</a>. In the 1970s, they not only sold out their live shows, they topped the album charts and had huge box-office hits with movies such as Up in Smoke and Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie. The double-act were as radical as they were bonkers. And while the films were ostensibly about two aspiring rock stars in search of the next spliff, they introduced audiences to a downtown, multiracial Los Angeles rarely seen in movies.</p> <p>Their characters, Pedro de Pacas (Richard \u201cCheech\u201d Marin ) and Anthony \u201cMan\u201d Stoner (Chong), were hopeless wasters, but heroically so. In their frequent spats with the police, they invariably won \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t have a clue how or indeed even notice that they had.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46fee27a6c2b501f9f4a0e5bf4a78dfcbbf543c5/0_0_3600_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy Chong, left, and Cheech Marin in Cheech and Chong in Concert, 1973.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel the vibe ... Tommy Chong, left, and Cheech Marin in Cheech and Chong in Concert, 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is more to Chong than Cheech, as he is quick to point out today. After they split up he enjoyed success as a solo comic and businessman (though that ended up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/film.usa\">jail sentence</a>). Before Cheech and Chong, he was a guitarist with Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, co-writing their hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know About Me</a> \u2013 a gorgeous song about a mixed-race relationship. Although they only had the one hit, the band were influential \u2013 something Chong is again quick to point out. A young Jimi Hendrix played with them, and they were partly responsible for the Jackson Five (who opened for them in 1968) signing to Motown. Or rather Chong was.</p> <p>\u201cI was the lawyer who signed the contract for them,\u201d he says. Hold on, I say, you\u2019re not a lawyer. Chong laughs. \u201cWell, I was the whitest guy they knew. I looked like a Jewish guy, a lawyer. So literally Bobby Taylor took the contract and gave it to me and said what d\u2019you think?\u201d Chong gave it the OK and the rest is history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48b7aec2e1f97ba99e4ce675ea58a2a2090d570d/0_0_3504_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roll up, roll up ...

Chong and Marin in the 1978 comedy Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chong segues from one celebrity anecdote to another, all of them connected by one degree of separation \u2013 himself. And now we have landed at British royalty. \u201cI played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know</a> for Prince Harry. We were in the Spencers\u2019 house. We went there for a wedding two years ago.\u201d Did he get high with Harry? \u201cHe was busy with the wedding,\u201d Chong says, discreetly. \u201cHe took a liking to Shelby because she had read all about him and knew his life story.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>England is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He may have a lot of time for Harry and Meghan, but not for the royal family as a whole. \u201cEngland itself is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system.\u201d Chong does not like to hold back. \u201cYou still have the system that colonised the world. Meghan wasn\u2019t white enough. She would never be white enough. I can see why they left. Megan could never be accepted into the royal family. She knew that and the whole family did. The whole English system is set up that way.\u201d</p> <p>From the royals he turns to Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t know Trump personally, but he says he remembers coming across his type as a young man in British Columbia. \u201cI knew people like Trump all my life in Canada \u2013 we called them gangsters. And they hung around the Stock Exchange in Vancouver. That\u2019s where his grandpa made all his money. Running whores, and gambling joints and bootlegging.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ef6988271b6f9bc48bf0362fd729e7ffa36c68b/0_0_3182_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Taylor and The Vancouvers ...clockwise from top, Bobby Taylor, Wes Henderson and Tommy Chong in about 1968.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chong is convinced that once he leaves office, Trump will face criminal charges. \u201cHe is a Russian asset. History will show that. He\u2019s been colluding with Russia from the get-go \u2013 the Mueller report even said it. The only reason they couldn\u2019t do anything is because he\u2019s the president, and the minute Trump\u2019s not president they\u2019re gonna put his ass in jail.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a big claim. Do you really think Trump will end up jailed? \u201cYes. If Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby are an example, yes, I think he will. So he\u2019s going to go. He\u2019s insulted too many people.\u201d When you go after judges, he says, it comes back to bite you in the ass.</p> <p>One of the things he finds most offensive about Trump is his attitude to people of colour. \u201cJust because you were born with money don\u2019t make you any better than anybody else on the planet, but he\u2019s still sticking to that thing that because he\u2019s white and privileged he somehow is better than other people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew people like Trump all my life in Canada \u2013\u00a0we called them gangsters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Race, and racism, has been at the heart of Chong\u2019s life and his humour. He grew up in Calgary, a conservative Canadian city, the son of a Chinese father and a Canadian mother with Celtic roots. He still sounds shocked by the attitudes he experienced there as a child. \u201cYou know, they would sell brazil nuts in the grocery store and they\u2019d call them nigger toes. And they had little <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/25/consider-liquorice\">black liquorice beans</a> called nigger babies. \u2018Can I have five cents worth of nigger babies?\u2019 Again he laughs \u2013 this time appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d<br><br>As a young boy he remembers his whole class apart from him being invited to a birthday party. \u201cI just looked out of the window of the second storey and could see my friends gathering around the fire. I was uninvited \u2019cos the girl\u2019s father was worried she might end up with a coloured guy or Chinese guy.\u201d</p> <p>By then, he was already used to being isolated. When he was a baby, his mother contracted TB and he developed pleurisy. \u201cMy first memories are hospital and my mom was quarantined in a sanitarium. I never saw her for the first three or four years of my life. So I feel I\u2019ve been through this pandemic before with my mother.\u201d</p> <p>How is he coping? He says he is missing his five children and the grandchildren. \u201cIt affects everybody\u2019s life. We can\u2019t do our family reunions. It\u2019s lonely. Even though you\u2019ve got your kids a phone call away, you still want to hold them and hug them and be part of their life.\u201d But, he stresses, he\u2019s lucky \u2013 he\u2019s got Shelby\u2019s company, her gourmet cooking and the pot cookies.<br><br>It was in the late 60s that he teamed up with Richard Marin, a Mexican-American whose nickname was Cheech. They played music and did comedy sketches in a Vancouver strip club. The funny stuff soon took over, and the strip club became a comedy club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55/711_304_4993_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Eshel/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheech and Chong prided themselves on taking things to extremes \u2013 spliffs the size of tubas (famously smoking labarador poo in their first film, Up in Smoke), idiocy off the IQ ratings and staggeringly incorrect sexual politics (in Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie, Cheech only desists from having sex with a woman who seems to have died on him because she wakes up).</p> <p>He says his favourite Cheech and Chong sketch is Hey, Margaret \u2013 about a husband describing a porn film to his wife. First, an elderly woman has sex with the pizza delivery man, then she has sex with a dog, and the husband reports it all back to Margaret with relish. Finally, she has sex with a \u201cgod-damned coloured guy\u201d and the husband turns away sickened. It was bad-taste comedy with bigotry as the butt of the joke.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GwxVGUJRzE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7GwxVGUJRzE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Why does he think they were so popular? Simple, he says. \u201cWe communicated with people. They would get high to come and see us and then we\u2019d act crazy and make them laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Could they really be such dedicated stoners and still be so prolific, or was it an act? Chong sounds slightly offended by the question. \u201cOh no, for the most part we were always high. We always smoked a little before we went out there. That was part of the job.\u201d</p> <p>Drugs, he says, were essential to the creative process. \u201cIt was my job as a writer and performer to deliver the goods. So if that meant being stoned, I gladly did it. I found that the more stoned I was, the more crazy the movie was, and the more successful we were.\u201d What was his drug of choice when writing? Oh, he says, there were a few. \u201cA little bit of cocaine and the acid and then the weed.\u201d</p> <p>Cheech and Chong appeared to be having the time of their lives. But by the mid-80s they had fallen out. \u201cWe had some pretty heated arguments. Cheech would go on vacation and I\u2019d be left alone to write the movies. Then he\u2019d come back and I\u2019d direct them, and he got tired of it. He was thinking I got too much credit.\u201d Did he have a point? \u201c Well, I maintain that if he\u2019d listened to me it would have been better all the way around.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his memoir, Marin called Chong \u201cthe world\u2019s humblest megalomaniac\u201d. Talking to Chong today, I get a sense of what he means. Alongside the hippy-dippy mellowness, there is a man who clearly likes doing things his way. \u201cThe only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d So it was a power struggle between him and Marin? \u201cWell, yeah, for sure. Because what Cheech wanted was the part where you got the power.\u201d</p> <p>Chong calls Marin a genius \u2013 not just for his comedic skills, but for his photographic memory and the sharpness of his brain. As for himself, he says his great gift has always been for teaming up with the right person \u2013 whether it be Marin or Shelby, his second wife, to whom he has been married for 45 years.</p> <p>At times, he sounds calculated when he talks about what Marin brought to the table. \u201cWe clicked from the off. And I soon realised I\u2019ve got a goldmine with this guy because LA is made up mostly of Mexicans. So I realised, oh man, we can own this place with comedy. And we do. I mean our comedy\u2019s lasted longer than anything.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, he says, it was money that did for them. \u201cI always say we broke up \u2019cos we got rich. My joke is you can\u2019t make a rich Mexican do shit! Hehehe! That still makes me laugh.\u201d Did wealth change them? \u201cYea. You make the wrong decision. You\u2019d rather do your summer house than go on the road again.\u201d Chong says if you\u2019re in the entertainment business and you\u2019re not 100% dedicated to entertaining, you might as well give up. And they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc/0_0_3000_1646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"549\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the split, Chong developed his solo standup. But he hated being away from Shelby. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave my wife at home. She\u2019s too beautiful to leave alone.\u201d (He tells me three times how beautiful she is and how much he loves her.) So Shelby learned how to do standup and went on the road with him. Occasionally, in his live act he would phone Cheech, but Cheech refused to play along. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be funny, so I quit phoning him.\u201d And they fell out some more.</p> <p>In 2003, at the age of 65, Chong was jailed for nine months for selling glass pipes on the internet that could be used for smoking cannabis (though they were produced as collectible works of art): each bong had his name and a picture of his face on it. It was a family business, and Chong agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the non-prosecution of Shelby and his son Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37/0_0_2000_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Srakocic/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says jail changed him, physically and spiritually.

His hair and beard turned white, and he emerged from incarceration looking rather professorial. Since then he has seen off two cancers, and returned to the road.</p> <p>Despite the rise of rightwing populists, impending environmental catastrophe and the Covid-19 pandemic, he says life has never been better.\u201cI see today as the best time to be alive because we weren\u2019t content with what we had. We were always looking for that better club, the better audience to play in front of.\u201d</p> <p>In his 80s, he has never been more occupied \u2013 gigging with Shelby, launching his own brand of marijuana (<a href=\"https://tommychong.com/\">Chong\u2019s Choice</a>) in 2016 when the drug was legalised for recreational use in California, and spending time with his kids. He even made up with Cheech, thanks to Paris. A decade ago his son found an email from Marin on Chong\u2019s computer asking if he wanted to try to put aside differences \u2013 Paris didn\u2019t bother to tell his dad, wrote yes and hit reply.</p> <p>Since then Cheech and Chong have been gigging again, with Shelby as their opening act. On the day we speak, he is supposed to be promoting a Cheech and Chong video game, but he is too excited about new opportunities to mention it. Doe he think the duo might make another film? Silence. But I can sense his boyish excitement at the other end of the line. \u201cWell I can\u2019t really tell you that now,\u201d he says coyly. So there might be one? \u201cI\u2019ve got to wait till it\u2019s a reality as opposed to telling you dreams. I\u2019ll turn it into a reality and then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p> <p>And with that he\u2019s off to satisfy those munchies and realise his dreams.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LDRLY.cheechandchong&amp;fbclid=IwAR2xj-ydYBefXm3qRn6tpBvJ0JYhS2qnk4lZ8I0GbJXiTdjvngUo8NVkAA8\">The Cheech &amp; Chong Bud Farm video game</a> is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheech-and-chong-bud-farm/id1498492128?fbclid=IwAR3fwQskLbdqsiRSmoMLw40rlhyXd0zv5Fb4lAAEddpoFq6Aj-Z36pH93F4\">available for download on 20 April</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tommy Chong has got the munchies. It\u2019s early afternoon in locked-down LA, and last night he was on the pot cookies. \u201cMy wife, Shelby, just made a whole batch of them \u2013 oatmeal and maple syrup.\u201d He stops to correct himself. \u201cI put the pot in there, and of course I put too much in. Last night it got me almost comatose. Shelby got kinda mad at me. You know like when a kid gets so stoned all you do is sit there and grin.\u201d Chong is 82 next month. He sounds about four decades younger \u2013 his voice is deep, sexy, pulsing with life. Chong is one half of the most famous stoner comic partnership in history, Cheech and Chong. In the 1970s, they not only sold out their live shows, they topped the album charts and had huge box-office hits with movies such as Up in Smoke and Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie. The double-act were as radical as they were bonkers. And while the films were ostensibly about two aspiring rock stars in search of the next spliff, they introduced audiences to a downtown, multiracial Los Angeles rarely seen in movies. Their characters, Pedro de Pacas (Richard \u201cCheech\u201d Marin ) and Anthony \u201cMan\u201d Stoner (Chong), were hopeless wasters, but heroically so. In their frequent spats with the police, they invariably won \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t have a clue how or indeed even notice that they had. But there is more to Chong than Cheech, as he is quick to point out today. After they split up he enjoyed success as a solo comic and businessman (though that ended up in a jail sentence). Before Cheech and Chong, he was a guitarist with Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, co-writing their hit single Does Your Mama Know About Me \u2013 a gorgeous song about a mixed-race relationship. Although they only had the one hit, the band were influential \u2013 something Chong is again quick to point out. A young Jimi Hendrix played with them, and they were partly responsible for the Jackson Five (who opened for them in 1968) signing to Motown. Or rather Chong was. \u201cI was the lawyer who signed the contract for them,\u201d he says. Hold on, I say, you\u2019re not a lawyer. Chong laughs. \u201cWell, I was the whitest guy they knew. I looked like a Jewish guy, a lawyer. So literally Bobby Taylor took the contract and gave it to me and said what d\u2019you think?\u201d Chong gave it the OK and the rest is history. Chong segues from one celebrity anecdote to another, all of them connected by one degree of separation \u2013 himself. And now we have landed at British royalty. \u201cI played Does Your Mama Know for Prince Harry. We were in the Spencers\u2019 house. We went there for a wedding two years ago.\u201d Did he get high with Harry? \u201cHe was busy with the wedding,\u201d Chong says, discreetly. \u201cHe took a liking to Shelby because she had read all about him and knew his life story.\u201d He may have a lot of time for Harry and Meghan, but not for the royal family as a whole. \u201cEngland itself is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system.\u201d Chong does not like to hold back. \u201cYou still have the system that colonised the world. Meghan wasn\u2019t white enough. She would never be white enough. I can see why they left. Megan could never be accepted into the royal family. She knew that and the whole family did. The whole English system is set up that way.\u201d From the royals he turns to Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t know Trump personally, but he says he remembers coming across his type as a young man in British Columbia. \u201cI knew people like Trump all my life in Canada \u2013 we called them gangsters. And they hung around the Stock Exchange in Vancouver. That\u2019s where his grandpa made all his money. Running whores, and gambling joints and bootlegging.\u201d Chong is convinced that once he leaves office, Trump will face criminal charges. \u201cHe is a Russian asset. History will show that. He\u2019s been colluding with Russia from the get-go \u2013 the Mueller report even said it. The only reason they couldn\u2019t do anything is because he\u2019s the president, and the minute Trump\u2019s not president they\u2019re gonna put his ass in jail.\u201d It\u2019s a big claim. Do you really think Trump will end up jailed? \u201cYes. If Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby are an example, yes, I think he will. So he\u2019s going to go. He\u2019s insulted too many people.\u201d When you go after judges, he says, it comes back to bite you in the ass. One of the things he finds most offensive about Trump is his attitude to people of colour. \u201cJust because you were born with money don\u2019t make you any better than anybody else on the planet, but he\u2019s still sticking to that thing that because he\u2019s white and privileged he somehow is better than other people.\u201d Race, and racism, has been at the heart of Chong\u2019s life and his humour. He grew up in Calgary, a conservative Canadian city, the son of a Chinese father and a Canadian mother with Celtic roots. He still sounds shocked by the attitudes he experienced there as a child. \u201cYou know, they would sell brazil nuts in the grocery store and they\u2019d call them nigger toes. And they had little black liquorice beans called nigger babies. \u2018Can I have five cents worth of nigger babies?\u2019 Again he laughs \u2013 this time appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d As a young boy he remembers his whole class apart from him being invited to a birthday party. \u201cI just looked out of the window of the second storey and could see my friends gathering around the fire. I was uninvited \u2019cos the girl\u2019s father was worried she might end up with a coloured guy or Chinese guy.\u201d By then, he was already used to being isolated. When he was a baby, his mother contracted TB and he developed pleurisy. \u201cMy first memories are hospital and my mom was quarantined in a sanitarium. I never saw her for the first three or four years of my life. So I feel I\u2019ve been through this pandemic before with my mother.\u201d How is he coping? He says he is missing his five children and the grandchildren. \u201cIt affects everybody\u2019s life. We can\u2019t do our family reunions. It\u2019s lonely. Even though you\u2019ve got your kids a phone call away, you still want to hold them and hug them and be part of their life.\u201d But, he stresses, he\u2019s lucky \u2013 he\u2019s got Shelby\u2019s company, her gourmet cooking and the pot cookies. It was in the late 60s that he teamed up with Richard Marin, a Mexican-American whose nickname was Cheech. They played music and did comedy sketches in a Vancouver strip club. The funny stuff soon took over, and the strip club became a comedy club. Cheech and Chong prided themselves on taking things to extremes \u2013 spliffs the size of tubas (famously smoking labarador poo in their first film, Up in Smoke), idiocy off the IQ ratings and staggeringly incorrect sexual politics (in Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie, Cheech only desists from having sex with a woman who seems to have died on him because she wakes up). He says his favourite Cheech and Chong sketch is Hey, Margaret \u2013 about a husband describing a porn film to his wife. First, an elderly woman has sex with the pizza delivery man, then she has sex with a dog, and the husband reports it all back to Margaret with relish. Finally, she has sex with a \u201cgod-damned coloured guy\u201d and the husband turns away sickened. It was bad-taste comedy with bigotry as the butt of the joke. Why does he think they were so popular? Simple, he says. \u201cWe communicated with people. They would get high to come and see us and then we\u2019d act crazy and make them laugh.\u201d Could they really be such dedicated stoners and still be so prolific, or was it an act? Chong sounds slightly offended by the question. \u201cOh no, for the most part we were always high. We always smoked a little before we went out there. That was part of the job.\u201d Drugs, he says, were essential to the creative process. \u201cIt was my job as a writer and performer to deliver the goods. So if that meant being stoned, I gladly did it. I found that the more stoned I was, the more crazy the movie was, and the more successful we were.\u201d What was his drug of choice when writing? Oh, he says, there were a few. \u201cA little bit of cocaine and the acid and then the weed.\u201d Cheech and Chong appeared to be having the time of their lives. But by the mid-80s they had fallen out. \u201cWe had some pretty heated arguments. Cheech would go on vacation and I\u2019d be left alone to write the movies. Then he\u2019d come back and I\u2019d direct them, and he got tired of it. He was thinking I got too much credit.\u201d Did he have a point? \u201c Well, I maintain that if he\u2019d listened to me it would have been better all the way around.\u201d In his memoir, Marin called Chong \u201cthe world\u2019s humblest megalomaniac\u201d. Talking to Chong today, I get a sense of what he means. Alongside the hippy-dippy mellowness, there is a man who clearly likes doing things his way. \u201cThe only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d So it was a power struggle between him and Marin? \u201cWell, yeah, for sure. Because what Cheech wanted was the part where you got the power.\u201d Chong calls Marin a genius \u2013 not just for his comedic skills, but for his photographic memory and the sharpness of his brain. As for himself, he says his great gift has always been for teaming up with the right person \u2013 whether it be Marin or Shelby, his second wife, to whom he has been married for 45 years. At times, he sounds calculated when he talks about what Marin brought to the table. \u201cWe clicked from the off. And I soon realised I\u2019ve got a goldmine with this guy because LA is made up mostly of Mexicans. So I realised, oh man, we can own this place with comedy. And we do. I mean our comedy\u2019s lasted longer than anything.\u201d In the end, he says, it was money that did for them. \u201cI always say we broke up \u2019cos we got rich. My joke is you can\u2019t make a rich Mexican do shit! Hehehe! That still makes me laugh.\u201d Did wealth change them? \u201cYea. You make the wrong decision. You\u2019d rather do your summer house than go on the road again.\u201d Chong says if you\u2019re in the entertainment business and you\u2019re not 100% dedicated to entertaining, you might as well give up. And they did. After the split, Chong developed his solo standup. But he hated being away from Shelby. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave my wife at home. She\u2019s too beautiful to leave alone.\u201d (He tells me three times how beautiful she is and how much he loves her.) So Shelby learned how to do standup and went on the road with him. Occasionally, in his live act he would phone Cheech, but Cheech refused to play along. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be funny, so I quit phoning him.\u201d And they fell out some more. In 2003, at the age of 65, Chong was jailed for nine months for selling glass pipes on the internet that could be used for smoking cannabis (though they were produced as collectible works of art): each bong had his name and a picture of his face on it. It was a family business, and Chong agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the non-prosecution of Shelby and his son Paris. He says jail changed him, physically and spiritually. He spent his time reading the I Ching and became more at peace with himself. His hair and beard turned white, and he emerged from incarceration looking rather professorial. Since then he has seen off two cancers, and returned to the road. Despite the rise of rightwing populists, impending environmental catastrophe and the Covid-19 pandemic, he says life has never been better.\u201cI see today as the best time to be alive because we weren\u2019t content with what we had. We were always looking for that better club, the better audience to play in front of.\u201d In his 80s, he has never been more occupied \u2013 gigging with Shelby, launching his own brand of marijuana (Chong\u2019s Choice) in 2016 when the drug was legalised for recreational use in California, and spending time with his kids. He even made up with Cheech, thanks to Paris. A decade ago his son found an email from Marin on Chong\u2019s computer asking if he wanted to try to put aside differences \u2013 Paris didn\u2019t bother to tell his dad, wrote yes and hit reply. Since then Cheech and Chong have been gigging again, with Shelby as their opening act. On the day we speak, he is supposed to be promoting a Cheech and Chong video game, but he is too excited about new opportunities to mention it. Doe he think the duo might make another film? Silence. But I can sense his boyish excitement at the other end of the line. \u201cWell I can\u2019t really tell you that now,\u201d he says coyly. So there might be one? \u201cI\u2019ve got to wait till it\u2019s a reality as opposed to telling you dreams. I\u2019ll turn it into a reality and then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d And with that he\u2019s off to satisfy those munchies and realise his dreams. \u2022 The Cheech &amp; Chong Bud Farm video game is available for download on 20 April",

      "body": "<p>If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.</p> <p>Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO\u2019s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.</p> <p>That is not the world we live in. \u201cThe W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247540701291638787\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.\u201d</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d.</p> <p>One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members.

It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-french-protective-mask-manufacturer-scraps-nhs-order-to-keep-masks-in-france\" title=\"\">ordered</a> millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain.

The WHO hasn\u2019t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it \u2013 quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.</p> <p>Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline \u2013 a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. \u201cAs it\u2019s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,\u201d said Wenham. \u201cNo one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own.

      "bodyText": "If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this. Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO\u2019s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need. That is not the world we live in. \u201cThe W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,\u201d tweeted Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO. Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s emergency committee. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.\u201d On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d. There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say. The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d * * * The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d. One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the bifurcated needle, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it. If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption. Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business. * * * Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day. Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann. In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued advice against travelling to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann. Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d \u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new. But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do. * * * If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down. First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010. To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?) Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response. When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations deployed more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists judged the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d. Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia. The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d. * * * Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China. Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently told Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of politicising the virus.) Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out. John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some reports suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.) Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late. Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even accused Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros denied the claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953. While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan claimed that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades. Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has more cases of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d * * * While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice. Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO asked for $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.) Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney. The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d. But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. In Sweden, restaurants are still open. Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS ordered millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany accused the US of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously sent inspectors to the factory of an American company in J\u00fcchen to ensure their medical masks weren\u2019t being exported against government orders. The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. \u201cGovernments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,\u201d said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn\u2019t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it \u2013 quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it. Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline \u2013 a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. \u201cAs it\u2019s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,\u201d said Wenham. \u201cNo one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren\u2019t thinking globally.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

That chaffinch with his individual take on the terminal flourish of his species\u2019 song. Two wrens rattling sabres across a no-go zone that includes our back garden. As the song of the one in the next street starts overlapping with that of two doors up, it\u2019s only a matter of time. Song overlapping or matching is a sign of aggression. Eventually my neighbour\u2019s wren falls silent. I settle to my laptop. Throughout the day, I get more reminders of the importance of physical distancing. The tunes vary, but the message is the same. From the canopy fringing the River Lagan, an elevenses song thrush, his deliberate flutings clearly audible against the traffic\u2019s lowered growl. Cosy house sparrow chatter accompanies lunch, but bursting through are slurred exhortations of a collared dove and a thin exasperation of a goldcrest. In the afternoon, the nearby pedestrian crossing beeps and a great tit responds with furious monosyllables. I wonder who has provoked him, for when I check the window there\u2019s no one to be seen. Evening: our blackbird has assumed his usual position on the chimney opposite. I stop to listen to his gorgeous baritone. And further away, another. And another. The chain of song reminds me of \u201call the birds\u201d of Edward Thomas\u2019s Adlestrop. \u201cFarther and farther.\u201d All heeding, all reminding each other: \u201cKeep your distance, keep your distance.\u201d",

Late on Thursday China\u2019s Taiwan affairs office accused Taiwan\u2019s government of \u201cunscrupulously using the virus to seek independence, venomously attacking the WHO and its responsible people, conniving with the green internet army to wantonly spread racist comments \u2026 We strongly condemn this.\u201d It followed the trading of accusations between the WHO and Taiwan over recent days, largely stemming from Taiwan\u2019s continued exclusion from WHO membership and activities because of lobbying by China\u2019s Communist party government, which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory.

In other developments: EU countries agreed to a \u20ac500bn relief deal for members hit hardest by the pandemic. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, was moved out of intensive care after being admitted three days earlier suffering from coronavirus. Around the world people have been told to stay home over the Easter holiday. Authorities in several countries have warned of roadblocks to enforce social distancing.

There have been calls for high-level inquiries into allegations of inhumane treatment in some aged care facilities. Around the world appalling stories have emerged from residential care homes for older people, including in Spain where the army has reported finding dead and abandoned people in their beds. The death toll in UK care homes is likely to be far higher than reported, the Guardian has learned, with hundreds of people dying from confirmed or suspected coronavirus without yet being officially counted. Bangladesh imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district, which is home to more than a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar, and South Africa extended its lockdown by a further fortnight, enforced by police and the army.

      "bodyText": "It started with taunts about stolen flip-flops, veered into a litany of horrors \u2013 abduction, murder, dismemberment, betrayal, vengeance \u2013 and ended with a party. The gangland feud propelling such violence and depravity has played out in Ireland and now moved to the UK. Robbie Lawlor, 36, a Dublin criminal suspected of multiple murders, was shot dead in the Belfast district of Ardoyne on Saturday, a cross-border ambush that added another corpse to a lethal saga and prompted his rivals to post footage of celebrations. The Police Service of Northern Ireland and the wider community fear a seemingly unending dispute between southern drug gangs is now being fought in the streets of Belfast. Paul McCusker, a councillor for the Social Democratic and Labour party who visited the murder scene, said people dreaded a revival \u201cof the bad old days of the Troubles\u201d in the form of apolitical criminal score-settling. \u201cThis community has been through too much over the last 50 years to have these gang wars in Dublin spilling out now on their streets.\u201d Lawlor was the 161st victim of Irish gang feuding since 2009, the central conflict driven by groups reportedly linked to two rival crime bosses, Christy Kinahan and Gerry Hutch. Hundreds of millions of euros in drug profits are at stake but the latest round of butchery dates from a seemingly trivial incident: the theft of a gym bag. Lawlor, recently released from prison, was mugged last December after leaving a Dublin gym. A group of youths punched and kicked him and filmed the assault, allegedly at the behest of a gangland foe. They later posted pictures of themselves wearing his flip-flops, along with taunts. What happened next plumbed a new level of barbarity. On 12 January, Keane Mulready-Woods, 17, a footsoldier for a Drogheda-based gang, who was reportedly involved in the mugging, vanished. The next day a sports bag containing human limbs \u2013 and a pair of flip-flops \u2013 was dumped in Coolock, a north Dublin suburb. Two days later another bag containing a head and other body parts were found in a burning car in another part of Dublin. DNA testing confirmed they belonged to the teenager. After waiting in vain for the torso to turn up, the family of Mulready-Woods buried the remains on 13 February. At the funeral mass, Father Phil Gaffney said a drug culture had infected Ireland and claimed another life. \u201cWhat arrogance. What appalling wickedness and evil,\u201d he said. \u201cThis murder has brought about an unparalleled level of revulsion, not alone in Drogheda, but throughout our country and, indeed, far beyond.\u201d Gaffney said Mulready-Woods was naive and fell in with the wrong people. \u201cI hope that his death will be a warning to other young teenagers who are being groomed by the ruthless criminals: that the promise of money and gifts will inevitably end in tragedy,\u201d he said. The inclusion of flip-flops with the remains was widely interpreted as a message to Lawlor\u2019s rivals that to cross him invited savage retribution. The man the tabloids have branded a \u201cpsycho\u201d and \u201csadistic killer\u201d met his own end last Saturday. Lawlor arrived in Belfast with at least three criminal associates to pick up tens of thousands of pounds owed to him for a drug deal, security sources in Northern Ireland told the Guardian. Shortly before noon he entered a house and encountered a waiting gunman. He tried to escape but was shot four times in the head and died in the front garden. One theory suggests the indebted drug dealer killed Lawlor. However, security and republican sources believe he was set up by another Belfast criminal who was supposed to be working with Lawlor but betrayed him to Dublin enemies. Lawlor had other foes \u2013 he was a hate figure for dissident republicans who suspected him in the killing of Alan Ryan, a Real IRA enforcer and extortionist, in Dublin in 2012. Lawlor\u2019s death prompted rivals to post images of toasts, dancing and cheering. Police on both sides of the border are now tasked with catching his killer, or killers. A 36-year-old man arrested in Belfast has been released on bail. Garda\u00ed in the republic have seized \u20ac50,000 in cash which they suspect was part of a bounty for the murder.",

Three had been swabbed for Covid-19, but NSW Health and Australian Border Force allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark at 6am and travel home, some on planes interstate, before the test results came in. </p> <h2>A corporate rabbit warren</h2> <p>Deciding who, if anyone, can be held to account for the debacle will involve delving into Carnival\u2019s complex corporate structure.</p> <p>In Australia Carnival trades as Carnival Australia but its status and structure is entirely opaque. Until recently, the NAB director Ann Sherry was billed as Carnival Australia\u2019s chairman, but Carnival says she no longer holds the role.</p> <p>A search of the corporate registry shows there is no Australian company named Carnival Australia. Instead, the words are a business name owned by one of the companies atop Carnival\u2019s globe-spanning corporate tree, the UK-registered Carnival PLC.</p> <p>According to Carnival\u2019s filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the group\u2019s only Australian subsidiary is the oddly named A.C.N. 098 290 834, which has paid-up share capital of $100 and is owned by Carnival PLC.</p> <p>Sherry is not and has never been a director of this company, and Carnival\u2019s spokesman, David Jones, did not respond to specific questions about what it did.

      "bodyText": "Lawyers keen to take action against the owner of the Ruby Princess, Carnival Cruises, face the daunting prospect of figuring out how a global organisation that operates through a series of tax havens can be brought to court in Australia. The company, which pays no tax in Australia, faces a multitude of potential legal suits and potential criminal charges as lawyers and police investigate the events that led to its final cruise from Sydney. The company is in deep financial distress due to the coronavirus pandemic, and even before the outbreak was laden with $10bn of debt that needs to be repaid or renegotiated within the year. The Ruby Princess left Sydney on 8 March and returned early on 19 March after a cruise to New Zealand. Since then there have been more than 660 Covid-19 cases and at least 13 deaths associated with Ruby Princess passengers. But lawyers are now focusing on what happened on the previous cruise, which disembarked on 8 March in Sydney. The two cruises The Australian has reported that 158 cases of sickness had been logged by the ship in a government portal used to monitor the condition of cruise ship passengers arriving in Australia, leading the Department of Health to classify the ship as \u201cmedium risk\u201d. But it has been widely reported that an email from the ship\u2019s master to the Port Authority of New South Wales on 8 March stated there were \u201cno ill passengers or crew on board\u201d and the ship was permitted to dock, and then load a further 2,700 passengers within a matter of hours. This was a month after the Ruby Princess\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, had been quarantined at Yokohama, Japan, and the world had watched horrified as Covid-19 spread like wildfire through the passengers and crew. Yet the illness on the Ruby Princess does not appear to have triggered additional safeguards or second thoughts about the next cruise. There is also heightened interest in what the Ruby Princess told the Port Authority and the ambulance service when it docked in the early hours of 19 March. According to a report in the Sunday Telegraph, there was a series of exchanges at midnight between the Port Authority, executives of Carnival Cruises and ambulance staff, which raise serious questions about whether Carnival was candid about the health of the two passengers transferred and the overall health of the passengers aboard. More than 110 passengers were ill, with 17 showing influenza-like symptoms. Three had been swabbed for Covid-19, but NSW Health and Australian Border Force allowed 2,700 passengers to disembark at 6am and travel home, some on planes interstate, before the test results came in. A corporate rabbit warren Deciding who, if anyone, can be held to account for the debacle will involve delving into Carnival\u2019s complex corporate structure. In Australia Carnival trades as Carnival Australia but its status and structure is entirely opaque. Until recently, the NAB director Ann Sherry was billed as Carnival Australia\u2019s chairman, but Carnival says she no longer holds the role. A search of the corporate registry shows there is no Australian company named Carnival Australia. Instead, the words are a business name owned by one of the companies atop Carnival\u2019s globe-spanning corporate tree, the UK-registered Carnival PLC. According to Carnival\u2019s filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the group\u2019s only Australian subsidiary is the oddly named A.C.N. 098 290 834, which has paid-up share capital of $100 and is owned by Carnival PLC. Sherry is not and has never been a director of this company, and Carnival\u2019s spokesman, David Jones, did not respond to specific questions about what it did. Nor did he respond when asked when Sherry ceased to be chairman of Carnival Australia, how she could be an officer of an entity that does not exist and how the group\u2019s local operation was structured. Attempts to contact Sherry have been unsuccessful. There is no suggestion that she played any role in the events surrounding Ruby Princess. At the top of the group sit Carnival PLC and another company called Carnival Corporation, which is registered in the Central American tax haven Panama. The two companies operate together as one entity \u2013 a structure that allows it to be listed on stock exchanges in London and New York. Most of Carnival\u2019s fleet of more than 100 ships are registered in tax havens around the world \u2013 including Panama, Bermuda and the Bahamas \u2013 although some are registered in the UK. The two companies file one set of accounts, which show that even before the Covid-19 outbreak stranded its ships around the world it was heavily indebted. Accounts filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission show Carnival lost US$770m ($1.24bn) in the three months to the end of February. It owed more than $10bn that had to be repaid within 12 months, including $4.7bn in customer deposits for cruises that now mostly appear unlikely to happen, and a further $9.7bn that has to be paid back later on. Against the $10bn in current debts, it had just $2.9bn in current assets. To help it survive, last week Carnival went to its shareholders and lenders for an emergency cash injection, raising $6.25bn. But despite its US listing, the group isn\u2019t eligible to benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s $500bn industry bailout package owing to its offshore structure. Neither Carnival PLC nor Carnival Corporation paid any Australian tax in 2017-18, the latest year for which government data is available. A.C.N. 098 290 834 is also not listed on a tax office list of large and foreign-owned corporations that paid tax that year. Jones did not respond to Guardian Australia\u2019s specific questions about Carnival\u2019s finances, including whether the group was solvent and could refund customers. \u201cCarnival Australia represents seven of the corporation\u2019s nine cruise lines that sail in this region,\u201d he said. \u201cWe comply with all listing requirements in the US and the UK including lodgement of reports, which are available for you to see and would cover questions that you have raised.\u201d The legal hurdles Whether criminal charges will be laid against Carnival or any individual executives or crew members will depend on the police investigation and whether investigators conclude that any actions amount to a deliberate breach of Australia\u2019s strict biosecurity laws. Civil claims, however, now seem certain and damages could stretch into the millions, as passengers seek reparation for the cost of cruises and damages for the distress caused by being infected with Covid-19 or living under the threat of being exposed. Shine Lawyers is preparing a class action on behalf of the 2,700 passengers who were on the Ruby Princess\u2019s final cruise. So far 30 people have signed on, while litigation funders have expressed interest in bankrolling the case. Shine\u2019s NSW practice leader for class actions, Vicky Antzoulatos, said the firm had already done considerable work on a potential class action against Carnival as it had investigated bringing a similar case in 2019 over several outbreaks of norovirus on the Sun Princess. \u201cThere are some jurisdictional issues but it is listed in the UK and this is a giant of world companies,\u201d Antzoulatos said. \u201cWe are confident that despite current events, this company has the wherewithal to pay out.\u201d Shine\u2019s case would most likely be brought in the federal court and involve claims of breaches of Australian consumer law as well as possible claims of breaches of contract and negligence. At the least, the claim is likely to seek the return of the ticket price to passengers \u2013 estimated by Shine to be an average of $3,000 a person \u2013 and damages for loss of enjoyment.

Out of people tested in New York, about 40% have tested positive. Surrounding states also have grim stats: Thirty percent of those tested in Connecticut and 47% of those tested in New Jersey were positive. Presenting this number doesn\u2019t necessarily paint an accurate picture of the spread of the disease in the United States since testing has been limited until very recently. In certain states like New York, where tests have been limited and the spread has been massive, requirements to getting tested are strict. In states that have seen a less intense outbreak, testing has been more widely available.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T23:59:13.464Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8fb3878f081a236f190ce4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T23:56:03.161Z\">12.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Experts to administration: Evidence on whether homemade masks work is &quot;inconclusive&quot;</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The CDC is now recommending that all Americans wear homemade, non-medical masks while in public.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump repeatedly played down the importance of widespread testing before reopening the country for business during the daily coronavirus briefing. Trump reportedly intends to form another task force that will work on trying to reopen the economy by the end of April. But White House health experts have cautioned against scaling back social distancing too quickly. Mike Pence said the treasury is on track to send Americans payments of up to $1,200 by the end of next week. More than 16 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the US economy. New York broke its record for the highest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s cumulative death toll to 7,067. British prime minister Boris Johnson was moved out of the intensive care unit. Downing Street said Johnson is in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d and remains in the hospital as he recovers from coronavirus. Fact check: The majority of states have less than 10% positive cases Earlier, Dr Deborah Birx, a coordinator on the coronavirus response task force, said that 63% of the states (31 states) had less than 10% of total people tested for Covid-19 be positive. A quick glance at data provided by the Covid Tracking Project, a collaborative, volunteer-run project that collects data from local health departments, shows that about 28 states plus US Samoa meet that threshold. While that\u2019s still a slight majority of states, a handful are seeing much more dire statistics. Out of people tested in New York, about 40% have tested positive. Surrounding states also have grim stats: Thirty percent of those tested in Connecticut and 47% of those tested in New Jersey were positive. Presenting this number doesn\u2019t necessarily paint an accurate picture of the spread of the disease in the United States since testing has been limited until very recently. In certain states like New York, where tests have been limited and the spread has been massive, requirements to getting tested are strict. In states that have seen a less intense outbreak, testing has been more widely available. The CDC is now recommending that all Americans wear homemade, non-medical masks while in public. But experts from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine told the White House in a letter sent yesterday that \u201cthe available evidence is inconclusive about the degree to which homemade fabric masks may suppress spread of infection from the wearer to others\u201d. Although any sort of fabric mask will block at least some of the larger respiratory droplets, \u201cthere\u2019s little evidence regarding transmission of small aerosolized particulates,\u201d the researchers wrote. Further studies will reveal what sorts of masks, and fabrics, offer the most filtration. White House health officials like Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have warned that masks are meant to supplement, not replace, other safety measures such as handwashing and keeping a 6ft distance apart from others. The coronavirus briefing has ended. Fact check: flu comparisons Mike Pence said that \u201cwe\u2019ve known from the beginning that this at least three times more contagious than the flu. And, I believe that fact alone has informed our projections and the modeling.\u201d But the president has often compared coronavirus to the flu, from the beginning. In late March, Trump complained about distancing measures on Fox News. \u201cWe\u2019ve never closed down the country for the flu,\u201d he said. On March 9, he tweeted, \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on.\u201d On February 26, he said, \u201cI mean, view this the same as the flu. When somebody sneezes \u2014 I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when they\u2019re sneezing. \u201c A moment for fashion, and recognizing the importance of the world \u201cglobal\u201d in \u201cglobal health\u201d: Fact check: Oil market Trump repeatedly said that the oil market lost 40% of demand due to the Covid-19 crisis, but multiple reports say that the drop in demand worldwide is around 25% to 30%. The drop is still massive, largely due to the global halt in flights, and has put major oil-producing countries on edge. Today, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), excluding the United States, reportedly agreed on a cut in production to stop the steepening of oil prices. The US cannot force cuts on its oil manufacturers as easily as other countries, though countries like Russia are pressuring the US to consider taking measures to cut production. Dr Fauci, on what it could mean to \u201creopen\u201d the country: \u201cOften, people say re-open the government, like it\u2019s a light switch on-and-off for the entire country. We have a very large country with really different patterns of disease and outbreaks in different parts of the country. So, it\u2019s not going to be a one size fits all.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting here that the federal government doesn\u2019t have the power to \u201cswitch on\u201d the economy all at once. States, counties and cities ultimately have a lot of authority to enforce distancing measures for as long as they deem necessary. Coronavirus testing by age: Dr Birx presented the following numbers on testing nationally. People younger than 25: 200,000 have been tested of which 11% tested positive Age 25-45: 500,000 were tested, 17% were positive Age 45-65: 500,000 were tested, 21% were positive Age 65-85: 200,000 were tested, 22% were positive People older than 85: 30,000 tested, 24% were positive Dr Anthony Fauci provided some good news with the bad. This has been a very bad week in terms of the number of deaths, he said. At the same time, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalization\u201d in New York, he said. \u201cThat means what we are doing is working, and therefore we need to continue.\u201d More women than men are getting tested for coronavirus, but more men test positive for the virus, said Dr Deborah Birx. That suggests that men may not report symptoms or get help until they\u2019re much sicker, she said. Once they finally do get to a health provider, they already have the virus. She asked men to seek help as soon as they think they needed it, rather than waiting. Pence said that White House officials are looking at whether health workers can wear reusable cloth gowns, instead of disposable ones, which are running out. Hospitals may have to \u201crecycle gowns\u201d to stretch their supplies, Pence said. More guidelines are forthcoming, he said. Mike Pence says the administration is \u201con the timetable\u201d to send out the first round of stimulus checks by the end of next week. Many Americans will receive up to $1,200. Fact check: Testing again More from Trump on testing: \u201cDo you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 325 million people and that\u2019s not going to happen, as you can imagine. And it would never happen with anyone else either.\u201d Politico recently reported on a plan developed by two former FDA commissioners, Mark McClellan and Scott Gottlieb, to reopen the economy that hinged on widespread testing and a vast expansion of the United States\u2019 public health system. Serology or antibody tests \u2013 which can help detect if a person\u2019s immune system has faced off against Covid-19 and recovered from it \u2014 could also help public health officials know when to ease back distancing and reopen businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to test for immunity,\u201d Robert Siegel, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, told the Guardian, because people who are immune could return to work without endangering themselves or others. \u201cThey could more safely work as frontline healthcare providers,\u201d Siegel said. Fact check: US stockpile of hydroxychloroquine Trump said that the US has \u201cpurchased and stockpiled millions and millions of doses\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump has been touting as a game-changer in the fight against Covid-19. Medical experts, including the US National Institute of Health\u2019s Anthony Fauci, has said there is no clinical evidence yet that the drug can effectively treat the disease. Clinical trials have only recently begun. The US does have a hefty stockpile of the drug thanks to a recent donation from drugmaker Novartis, who said early last week that Sandoz, its generic drug division, will donate 30m doses of the medicine to the federal government. Novartis said in a press release that the doses of the drug will be used for controlled clinical studies to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness against covid-19. Fact check: Ventilator shortages \u201cWe\u2019re in good shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing of people needing ventilators much.\u201d It is true that some states have ended up with more ventilators than they think they need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said hospitals there would run out of the machines this week, and the number of cases continue to grow. Asked how the country could reopen without an effective national system for coronavirus testing, Trump responded that \u201cthere are certain sections of the country that are in phenomenal shape already.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify what those areas are. Public health experts have said that widespread testing is a key precursor to easing back social distancing measures. Trump also said that the US will soon be doing \u201cmassive testing\u201d, even though it\u2019s not necessary, wihout providing any further detail on what that entails. Fact check: Temporary hospitals Trump said that Army Corps of Engineers have built 21 temporary hospitals nationwide, making up an additional 17,000 beds. But according to a government press statement released yesterday, the Army Corps of Engineers has so far constructed 17 facilities, totaling 14,579 beds. Another 23 facilities made up of 8,571 beds are pending. Donald Trump said he\u2019s going to take a few questions from reporters before returning to negotiations on oil and air travel. His conversation with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman was \u201cvery good,\u201d he said. They\u2019re \u201cgetting close to a deal\u201d and \u201cgetting along very well.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens, but it was a very good call,\u201d Trump said. Fact check: Testing \u201cOur tests are highly sophisticated,\u201d Trump said, once again repeating a line that the US has done more testing than other countries. While the US has ramped up testing, it still lags behind other countries, including South Korea and Germany. South Korea has administered 486,003 tests, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With a population of 51.5m, the country has tested about 1 in every 113 people. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 90 people. Meanwhile, the United States, with a population of 329 million, had administered at least 1,951,044 tests, according to the Atlantic\u2019s Covid Tracking Project \u2014 so the US has tested about 1 in every 168 people. Fact check: hydroxychloroquine As usual, Trump is touting hydroxychloroquine, noting that drug companies are ramping up productions and that the US has stockpiled doses. In the week beginning March 30, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. Clinical trials to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness in treating coronavirus have begun across the world, and in the US. However, experts, including US public health officials, have warned that it is too early to know if hydroxychloroquine works. So far, the evidence that it\u2019s an effective cure for coronavirus is thin. An initial French study that appeared to have launched the Trump administration\u2019s obsession with the dug has since been discredited. The drug is considered relatively safe for people without an underlying illness, but it\u2019s unclear if it is safe for severely sick Covid-19 patients, who may have incurred organ damage due to the virus. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by.

The president said he\u2019s looking into whether some parts of the economy can be reinstated sooner. Trump has taken the podium after a few delays. The president is expected to speak within the next half hour. While the press and the public has been focused on the coronavirus pandemic, Trump has pushed through his agenda, giving handouts to big business, appointing judges and rolling back regulations. My colleagues Emily Holden and David Smith report: The last time America was facing a possible economic depression, Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, observed: \u201cNever allow a good crisis go to waste. It\u2019s an opportunity to do the things you once thought were impossible.\u201d It is advice Donald Trump and his Republican allies appear to have taken to heart. Faced with not one but two crises \u2013 public health and economic \u2013 Obama\u2019s successor and his allies are advancing their agenda, whether in plain sight as a direct response to the pandemic, or under cover while the nation is deeply distracted. Trump touts his wall on the Mexican border almost daily and emphasizes national borders, even though the coronavirus paid them no heed. He has attacked voting rights, assailed federal watchdogs, shredded regulations and signed a bill that hands billions of dollars to corporations while resisting congressional oversight. CNN says that the vice president is not allowing top health officials to appear on the network, in order to pressure them to carry the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefings. From CNN: Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office reversed course on Thursday afternoon, after declining for days to allow the nation\u2019s top health officials to appear on CNN and discuss the coronavirus pandemic, in what was an attempt to pressure the network into carrying the White House\u2019s lengthy daily briefings in full. After this story was published, Pence\u2019s office allowed for the booking of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield for CNN\u2019s Thursday night coronavirus town hall. Dr. Anthony Fauci was also booked for Friday on \u201cNew Day.\u201dTrump makes 86 false claims over two weeks, including whoppers about Bloomberg, Pelosi and Social SecurityPreviously, Pence\u2019s office, which is responsible for booking the officials on networks during the pandemic, said it would only allow experts such as Fauci or Dr. Deborah Birx to appear on CNN if the network televised the portion of the White House briefings that includes the vice president and other coronavirus task force members. CNN often only broadcasts President Donald Trump\u2019s question and answer session, which sometimes includes the health care officials, live on-air. Nine civil rights groups in the South have called for regional officials to issue protective measures for people who work at or are detained at correctional and juvenile facilities. \u201cGovernment officials to implement desperately needed protections against Covid-19 infection and deaths in correctional and juvenile facilities throughout the South, which disproportionately incarcerate Black individuals,\u201d the groups wrote in a statement. \u201cWith poor health outcomes, inadequate access to health care, and elevated poverty rates, the South, which incarcerates a larger portion of its population than any other region in the nation, is exceptionally vulnerable to a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in its facilities.\u201d Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, reporting from the West Coast. Joe Biden hold a wide lead over Donald Trump, according to a new CNN poll. The former vice president leads 53% to 42% among registered voters. The poll also found that voters trusted Biden more to handle the response to the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare and helping the middle class. Of those polled, 52% said they trusted Biden, compared to 43% tho trusted Trump to handle to the coronavirus crisis. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York broke its record for the highest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s cumulative death toll to 7,067. Another 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. More than 16 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the US economy. British prime minister Boris Johnson was moved out of the intensive care unit. Downing Street said Johnson is in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d and remains in the hospital as he recovers from coronavirus. Trump reportedly intends to announce the formation of a second coronavirus task force. The task force will be working on trying to reopen the economy by the end of April, which could create tension with the White House\u2019s health experts, who have warned of a potential resurgence in coronavirus cases if social distancing restrictions are relaxed too quickly. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Senior White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the US economy may be reopened on a \u201crolling basis.\u201d \u201cThe next month or two, we should be able to restart at least on a rolling basis,\u201d Kudlowtold Fox Business. \u201cOur intent here was, is to try to relieve people of the enormous difficult hardships they are suffering through no fault of their own.\u201d Trump reportedly intends to form a second coronavirus task force with an eye on reopening the economy by the end of April, which could create tension with the White House\u2019s health experts, who have warned against easing social distancing restrictions too quickly. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: While cases in California continue to rise, data is revealing promising points. For the first time in his daily press conferences, governor Gavin Newsom said, he could report that the number of patients admitted to ICUs dropped by 1.9%. He cautioned, however, that a modest, one-day drop could be a statistical blip. Hospitalizations ticked up 4.1% over the past 24 hours, to 2,825 patients. The racial disparities in deaths and Covid-19 cases that have surfaced in other states like Louisiana have so far not played out in California. While the data remains incomplete, with just over half of cases broken down by race, the trends so far track roughly with the demographics of the state\u2019s population. While the governor offered optimism and hope, he warned that the worst may be yet to come. \u201cThe peak we projected is different from the one advertised by academics in other states,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin California, we believe the peak extends into May, not in the next week or two.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: In California, where coronavirus cases have topped 18,300, officials are offering relief to frontline workers in the form of hotel rooms for free or at \u201cdeep discount\u201d rates to provide lodging if they\u2019ve been exposed to the virus and don\u2019t want to return home, governor Gavin Newsom said at an afternoon press conference. United, Southwest, Alaska and Delta airlines have additionally promised to cover travel costs for healthcare professionals working on the front lines. \u201cThose are the four airlines that have met this moment\u201d, Newsom said. The governor also responded to fear expressed by Californians who said the state was giving away its precious stockpile of equipment to other states like New York and New Jersey. For the moment, there\u2019s enough to share, he said: California has 8,000 ventilators, about 32 percent of its stash, within its hospital system that aren\u2019t currently being used. \u201cWe thought it was the right thing to do, but also the responsible thing to do as American citizens to save lives\u201d, Newsom said of the effort to assist other states. After states use ventilators, they have agreed to send them back to California. Over the past month officials in California have cobbled together a healthy supply of ventilators, boosting its stash from 7,500 ventilators a month ago to the 11,750 it currently has. Trump lashed out against the Wall Street Journal after the newspaper published a critical editorial about his daily briefings on the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal always \u2018forgets\u2019 to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are \u2018through the roof,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet, dismissing the newspaper as \u201cFake News.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet came about an hour after Fox News ran a segment on the editorial, which expressed disappointment that the daily White House briefings had become \u201call about the President.\u201d \u201cThe briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus, how Americans should change their behavior, and what the government is doing to combat it,\u201d the Journal\u2019s editorial board wrote. \u201cBut sometime in the last three weeks Mr. Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him. Perhaps they substitute in his mind for the campaign rallies he can no longer hold because of the risks. Perhaps he resented the media adulation that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been receiving for his daily show. Whatever the reason, the briefings are now all about the President.\u201d The White House distributed a fact sheet on coronavirus to reporters, who will now be tested for the virus before attending the daily briefing. The White House also said that it would only alert reporters of their results if a test came back positive. The White House press office announced today that it would start administering rapid coronavirus tests to reporters after one journalist, who was last at the White House on Tuesday, started developing symptoms. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign will continue providing health care coverage for its employees through the end of October, even though the Vermont senator suspended his presidential bid yesterday. In comparison, former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is facing two lawsuits after he dismissed staffers eight months earlier than promised. One lawsuit accused Bloomberg of having \u201cdeprived [staffers] of promised income and health care benefits, leaving them and their families potentially uninsured in the face of a global pandemic.\u201d Joe Biden has released a new plan to \u201chelp ease the economic burden on working people\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. The presumptive Democratic nominee proposed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60 and forgive student debt from public universities for those making less than $125,000. \u201cI believe that as we are being plunged into what is likely to be one of the most volatile and difficult economic times in this country\u2019s recent history, we can take these critical steps to help make it easier for working people to make ends meet,\u201d Biden wrote in a Medium post detailing the plan. The former vice president specifically credited Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race yesterday, for helping to bring these proposals forward. \u201cSenator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I\u2019m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Biden wrote. After Sanders announced his decision to suspend his campaign yesterday, Biden made a pitch to his supporters, pledging to address their priorities in his campaign. The effort reflects Biden\u2019s need to unify the party and win over Sanders\u2019 supporters in order to defeat Trump in November. Trump celebrated the news that Boris Johnson has been moved out of the intensive care unit, wishing the British prime minister a speedy recovery. The White House said it would start administering coronavirus tests to reporters attending the daily briefing after one journalist who was recently at the White House started showing symptoms. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said the affected reporter was last at the White House on Tuesday, and the person\u2019s test results are expected later today. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the White House Medical Unit is going to conduct a COVID-19 test on all members of the press who plan to participate in today\u2019s task force briefing, including correspondents, photographers, and technicians,\u201d the White House press office said in a statement. The White House announced last week that anyone seeing Trump or Vice President Mike Pence would take a rapid coronavirus test to prevent them from catching it. Boris Johnson has been moved out of the intensive care unit, as the British prime minister continues to recover from coronavirus. Downing Street said in a statement, \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits.\u201d For more updates, follow the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus blog: The Trump administration has carried out nearly 10,000 summary deportations or \u201cexpulsions\u201d since March 21, using emergency public health measures that have given US Customs and Border Protection broad authority to bypass immigration laws, CBP officials said Thursday, the Washington Post reports. The measures have allowed the agency to turn away most unauthorized migrants, sending them back across the Mexican border. The moves have dramatically slashed the number of detainees held in border stations, where they fear the coronavirus could spread, the officials said. CBP currently has fewer than 100 detainees in custody, down from nearly 20,000 at this time last year during last year\u2019s border crisis, officials said. Since the implementation of the rapid expulsions, unlawful border crossings have dropped 56 percent, said acting CBP commissioner Mark Morgan. Morgan also acknowledged that the United States has all but closed its borders to asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution, including those who attempt to enter legally at US ports of entry. \u201cThose who are undocumented or don\u2019t have documents or authorization are turned away,\u201d Morgan said. Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of defying U.S. laws and exceeding the authority of the coronavirus public health order, but Morgan defended the emergency measures as a necessary step to stop the spread of the disease. Congressman Neal Dunn has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the second members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation to contract the virus. Dunn\u2019s office said in a statement that he was not feeling well on Monday and received a coronavirus test, which just came back positive. \u201cCongressman Dunn is feeling great and currently quarantining himself at home per CDC guidelines and working on Phase IV of the Administration\u2019s response to this pandemic,\u201d his office said in a statement. \u201cHe expects a full recovery soon.\u201d Dunn\u2019s diagnosis comes about a month after fellow Florida Republican Mario Diaz-Balart became one of the first two members of Congress to test positive for coronavirus. The first lady\u2019s office created a video urging Americans to wear face coverings in places where social distancing is difficult, such as grocery stores and pharmaries. \u201cRemember, this does not replace the importance of social distancing,\u201d Melania Trump says in the video. \u201cIt is another recommended guideline to keep us all safe.\u201d The CDC has recommended that Americans wear face coverings to help limit the spread of the virus, and some cities like Los Angeles have ordered residents to use them. The coronavirus pandemic has created some surreal scenes on Capitol Hill, reflected in these photos showing reporters questioning Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell while practicing social distancing and wearing masks: Less than three months ago, reporters were crowding around senators to question them about the impeachment trial, but those frantic huddles have become dangerous in the age of coronavirus: Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third day in a row. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died from the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. Another 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the labor department\u2019s latest report. More than 16 million Americans have filed unemployment claims in the past three weeks. Mike Pence\u2019s office is blocking health experts from appearing on CNN in an effort to pressure the network to broadcast the daily White House briefing in full. CNN has only been carrying Trump\u2019s portion of the briefing live before cutting to analysis and fact-checking of the president\u2019s comments, which have frequently included falsehoods. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Nearly 50 emergency room doctors from New York City\u2019s public hospitals have written an open letter to residents, urging people not to \u201ccut corners,\u201d when physical distancing, hand-washing and self-isolating. \u201cEvery day, our emergency departments are overflowing with patients newly infected with COVID-19, many starving for oxygen and on the brink of death,\u201d the doctors wrote. \u201cMany are older, but some are young. Many have pre-existing medical problems, but some do not. While we\u2019re constantly searching for new treatments and better ways to care for our patients, too many are dying despite our best efforts. These patients are also our friends, families, and colleagues,\u201d said the letter. The bullet point letter repeated many of the public health messages of recent days. The disease is more contagious than previously thought, mimics the flu, can be spread asymptomatically, for example. It urged people to wash their hands, to assume they have Covid-19 if they show any symptoms at all, however mild, and to isolate from family members. Millions of people are already taking these measures \u2013 but not diligently enough to stop the surge of patients coming to emergency rooms. \u201cMany of you have taken the steps above to protect yourself and others and we thank you. You are literally saving lives. But many of you have not \u2013 or continue to cut corners. This virus does not respect what we do \u2018most of the time,\u2019\u201d the doctors wrote. \u201cFellow New Yorkers, we need to do more!\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for trying to pass a coronavirus relief bill without holding a vote. In consultation with the Trump administration, McConnell tried to get the bill, which would have allocated $250 billion in additional funds, approved by unanimous consent. But Democratic senators objected to the proposal, calling for an extra $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. The bill was not able to pass, and senators won\u2019t have a chance to take it up again until the pro forma session on Monday. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy called the Democrats\u2019 objection \u201cdisgusting,\u201d but Pelosi said the fault lied with McConnell for not conferring with Democrats about the bill. Pelosi said treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin had \u201casked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours with no data,\u201d and McConnell had honored that request. The House speaker dismissed McConnell\u2019s efforts today as a political \u201cstunt\u201d and called for more bipartisan deliberations over the timing and content of the bill. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his daily briefing, just said that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the New York economy are expected to be \u201cmore devastating\u201d than the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u201cby far\u201d. New York state is bracing for a hit to its revenues of between $10 billion and $15 billion, with the focus being on the business ghost town that currently is New York City - the city that never sleeps, the crossroads of the world, etc - which is eerily still with non-essential businesses closed and folks on \u2018stay home\u2019 orders. New York governor Andrew Cuomo expressed cautious optimism about signs that the state is flattening the curve of coronavirus cases. However, the governor warned that the state\u2019s progress could be undone if social distancing practices are relaxed too quickly. \u201cRemember, the 1918 Spanish flu came in three waves,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the first wave. Everybody is assuming, well, once we get through this, we\u2019re done. I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume that. This virus has been ahead of us from day one.\u201d New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing. New York recorded 799 deaths from coronavirus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. New York has lost about the same number of people to coronavirus as the UK. Cuomo said the state would be bringing in additional funeral directors to help deal with the surge of deaths. As the state mourns the loss of several thousand New Yorkers, there are also signs that social distancing is flattening the curve. Yesterday, the state recorded the lowest number of new hospitalizations since the crisis started. The number of ICU admissions and intubations are also down. \u201cWe are saving lives by what we are doing today,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. The governor noted it has been 18 days since the state\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d order went into effect, even though it may feel like \u201ca lifetime\u201d ago. Cuomo also said hospitalizations in New York are currently lower than many projections initially predicted, applauding healthcare professionals and other first responders for their work. \u201cWe\u2019re flattening the curve so far,\u201d Cuomo said of social distancing measures, emphasizing that New Yorkers cannot get complacent now. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith and Emily Holden report: Faced with not one but two crises \u2013 public health and economic \u2013 Trump and his allies are advancing their agenda, whether in plain sight as a direct response to the pandemic, or under cover while the nation is deeply distracted. Trump touts his wall on the Mexican border almost daily and emphasizes national borders, even though the coronavirus paid them no heed. He has attacked voting rights, assailed federal watchdogs, shredded regulations and signed a bill that hands billions of dollars to corporations while resisting congressional oversight. \u201cMost Americans are not tracking these at all,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe crisis has created a blizzard condition in which information and criticism is not breaking through. It\u2019s a perfect storm for Trump to push his agenda. You can hear ideologues saying: this is our moment, do not delay.\u201d Just as George W Bush\u2019s administration exploited 9/11 to expand government powers and threaten civil liberties such as freedom of speech and due process, Trump\u2019s White House scents political opportunity in a national crisis. The office of Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House coronavirus task force, has blocked CNN from access to health experts in an effort to pressure the network to carry the full daily White House briefing. CNN reports: Pence\u2019s office has declined to allow the nation\u2019s top health officials to appear on CNN in recent days and discuss the coronavirus pandemic killing thousands of Americans, in an attempt to pressure the network into carrying the White House\u2019s lengthy daily briefings in full. Pence\u2019s office, which is responsible for booking the officials on networks during the pandemic, said it will only allow experts such as Dr. Deborah Birx or Dr. Anthony Fauci to appear on CNN if the network televises the portion of the White House briefings that includes the vice president and other coronavirus task force members. CNN often only broadcasts President Donald Trump\u2019s question and answer session, which sometimes includes the health care officials, live on-air. After Trump leaves the podium, CNN frequently cuts out of the White House briefing to discuss and fact-check what the President had said. A CNN executive said that the network usually returns to such programming because of the extensive length of the full briefing that includes Pence, which can run in excess of two hours. Many news organizations, including the Guardian, have taken to fact-checking the president\u2019s briefings in real time, after Trump repeatedly made misstatements about the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Georgia is moving its presidential primary for a second time. The state\u2019s presidential primary contest election, originally scheduled for March 24 is being pushed back from May 19 to June 9. All of the state\u2019s other statewide contests, which include partisan primaries and judicial races, are being moved to the June date, Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said in a statement. Raffensperger noted the decision came after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp extended a state of emergency in the state to May 13, which would cover almost every day of in-person voting allowed for the May 19 contest, Raffensperger noted. The secretary of state said, \u201cThis decision allows our office and county election officials to continue to put in place contingency plans to ensure that voting can be safe and secure when in-person voting begins and prioritizes the health and safety of voters, county election officials, and poll workers.\u201d Raffensperger previously began mailing applications for absentee ballots to 6.9 active registered voters in the state. He said Thursday that applications would continue to be accepted for the June 9 primary, even if the voter had requested it for the contest on May 19. Raffensperger faced criticism for his efforts to facilitate vote by mail from Georgia House Speaker David Ralston. He said efforts to make it easier to vote by mail \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia.\u201d After the comments, Raffensperger announced he was setting up a task force to watch against voter fraud with mail-in ballots. The Senate failed to pass a bill allocating an additional $250 billion to the small business loan program created by last month\u2019s stimulus package. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tried to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but Senate Democrats objected because they are calling for an extra $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. McConnell objected to Democrats\u2019 proposed amendement to the bill, making it impossible to pass the bill by unanimous consent. The Senate has now adjourned until Monday, when McConnell will have another chance to push the bill through as businessowners fear the program will soon run out of funds. Joe Biden holds a 4-point lead over Trump in a new national poll, which comes a day after Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign. According to the Monmouth University poll, Biden attracts the support of 48% of registered voters, while Trump stands at 44%. The result is similar to Biden\u2019s 3-point lead over Trump in a poll released last month. With Sanders dropping our of the race, such head-to-head polls between Trump and Biden have taken on a heightened level of significance as America looks ahead to the general election in November. However, national polls do not reflect the state-by-state nature of presidential elections. Hillary Clinton famously won the popular vote in 2016 but lost the electoral college, handing Trump a victory. Wisconsin continues to count ballots after its chaotic primary on Tuesday, which was disrupted by long lines and fears of spreading coronavirus at polling sites. More than a million absentee ballots have been returned, but the question remains whether turnout overall decreased due to people avoiding in-person voting. Some Wisconsin voters said they never received their absentee ballots, which left them with an undesirable choice between not voting at all and risking their health by voting in person. A Wisconsin state senator said yesterday that one post office found three large tubs of unsent absentee ballots the day after the primary. Senate Democrats are introducing their own coronavirus relief bill in an effort to get more funds for hospitals and state and local governments. In consultation with the Trump administration, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is trying to quickly pass a bill allocating an addition $250 billion to the small business loan program created by the stimulus package. The program was originally given $350 billion, but that money appears to be rapidly dwindling. Two Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, are now introducing their own bill to give additional funds to hospitals and state and local governments, as well as the small business loan program. But the conflict is unlikely to produce anything other than a messaging war, considering Republicans control the Senate and can push through their smaller bill, which Democrats are unlikely to oppose. When acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly traveled to Guam to criticize Captain Brett Crozier to his former crew members, it cost taxpayers approximately $243,000, according to a new report. Modly resigned earlier this week amid an uproar over his comments about Crozier, who raised concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Crozier was later removed from his post. Modly said that Crozier was either \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to command the ship if he did not think his letter expressing alarm would be made public. The acting secretary resigned a day after his comments came to light. USA Today reports: Modly flew aboard the C-37B, a Gulfstream business jet modified for military use. The per-hour cost of flying it is $6,946.19 per hour, according to the Navy official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Flight time for the Guam trip was about 35 hours for a cost of $243,116.65. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Michael Sainato report: More than 6.6 million Americans lost their jobs last week with 16 million jobs gone in the last three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic brought the US economy to a standstill, the US labor department confirmed on Thursday. Millions of Americans filed for unemployment benefits again last week as shutdowns across the US led employers to lay off workers in nearly every corner of the job market. Economists had expected 5.25 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits for the week ending 4 April. In the previous two weeks the shutdowns cost close to 10 million people their jobs. Layoffs that started in the restaurant and leisure industries have now spread to include manufacturing, construction and even healthcare. Job losses are rising in every state and economists are predicting the unemployment rate will soon reach 15% or higher, levels unseen since before the second world war. The largest increases were in California (up 871,992), New York (up 286,596), Michigan (up 176,329) and Florida (up 154,171). But while the numbers are stark, economists cautioned it was too early to say what the long-term impact of Covid-19 will be on the economy. \u201cThese figures don\u2019t reflect a lack of demand,\u201d said Dean Baker, visiting professor and senior economist at the University of Utah. During the last recession in 2008 unemployment reached close to 10% as the economy fell into recession. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t in our control. This is literally in our control,\u201d said Baker. \u201cWe are deliberately shutting down the economy.\u201d Trump is reportedly planning to form a second coronavirus task force focused on reopening the US economy. The Washington Post reports: The taskforce will be made up of a mix of private-sector and top administration officials, including chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 whose first official day on the job was last week \u2013 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and national economic adviser Larry Kudlow, a senior administration official said. Meadows is likely to lead the taskforce, though no official decision has been made, two senior administration officials said ... The economic taskforce \u2014 which will be separate from the main coronavirus taskforce, despite having some overlapping members \u2013 will focus on how to reopen the country, as well as what businesses need to rebound amid catastrophic conditions. The goal is to get as much of the country as possible open by 30 April, the current deadline Trump set for stringent social distancing measures. News of the second taskforce \u2013 and the late April deadline \u2013 comes as health experts like Dr Anthony Fauci urge caution in declaring the virus to be defeated as encouraging signs indicate the US is starting to flatten the curve of cases. Good morning, live blog readers. There have been some promising signs in recent days that the US is starting to flatten the curve of its number of coronavirus cases, even as the death toll continues to climb. New York, the state with the most coronavirus cases, is seeing a decline in the rate of hospitalizations, and a frequently cited model decreased its projected number of overall deaths in the country to 60,000. At the daily White House briefing yesterday, Donald Trump sounded bullish on the perspective of soon reopening the economy, as reports indicate that he hopes to be able to relax physical distancing restrictions by the end of April. \u201cAspirationally, I said let\u2019s see if we can do it at Easter, but I said it would be very tough, and I was criticised for that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be very far behind and some of these models are looking like Easter\u2019s going to be a very important date anyway because of the curve. It\u2019s hitting the top and it\u2019s starting to come down.\u201d But this morning, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, was hesitant to say that New York has flattened the curve, emphasizing that several days\u2019 data will be needed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to junmp the gun on that,\u201d Fauci said when asked whether New York had flattened the curve. \u201cBut I think that is the case.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m always very cautious about jumping the gun and saying, \u2018Well, we have turned the corner.\u2019 But I think we are really looking at the beginning of that, which would really be very encouraging. We need that right now.\u201d",

Many Australian GP clinics depend on rental payments from co-located pathology centres to remain viable, and the revenue source has become increasingly important during the coronavirus crisis, which has cut their patient numbers, upended their business model and left many on the brink of collapse. But Guardian Australia and the Medical Republic, a specialist health publication, have learned that some of Australia\u2019s biggest pathology companies have begun writing to GP clinics requesting they accept a 50% reduction in rent. GPs say they feel pressured to accept or face an early termination of their lease. That pressure is compounded by a decision of the federal government to block new pathology services from opening to replace any that close down in the next six months. The situation has left GPs facing an invidious choice: accept the 50% rent reduction or risk losing an existing tenant and the entirety of their rent for the next six months. The Australian General Practitioners Alliance, the peak body for GP-owned clinics, says GPs depend on pathology rents to survive, particularly at a time of significant losses in revenue. \u201cIn some cases, this may make the difference between general practices remaining open or closing,\u201d said the alliance\u2019s executive officer, Richard Hart.
