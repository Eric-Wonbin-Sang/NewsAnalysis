      "bodyText": "Peter Dutton has appeared alongside senior members of the Australian federal police in a political video spruiking the government\u2019s plan to put officers with short-barrelled rifles in airports. The video, released on the home affairs minister\u2019s Facebook page, is authorised by Dutton on behalf of the Liberal National party and consists of an interview with AFP Canberra airport police commander Simon Henry and images of the AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, and others at a press conference announcing the policy. A Labor spokesperson has called on Dutton to explain if it is \u201cacceptable for him to use AFP officers in his personally authorised videos on social media\u201d and questioned whether they might feel \u201cused for political purposes\u201d. On 6 December Dutton and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced that 135 police and protective service officers would be stationed at airports in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and the Gold Coast in 2020, followed by, Cairns, Adelaide and Darwin Airports in 2021. The officers will be armed with Mk18 short-barrel rifles. In the video, Dutton boasts of the $107m commitment \u2013 for which funding was allocated in the 2018 budget \u2013 promising Australians will see \u201cspecialist squads of police\u201d at airports and \u201ca greater presence of canines [dogs] with the capacity to detect explosive devices, bombs, et cetera\u201d. \u201cSo Australians \u2013 I really want to say \u2013 you should be reassured by the presence of these officers and know we\u2019re doing everything possible to keep people safe at our airports this Christmas but all through the year.\u201d Dutton then prompts superintendent Henry to explain the trial at Canberra airport, which he describes as an \u201cexcellent capability\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re right, it should reassure the members of the public who are travelling that we have a safe, secure aviation industry,\u201d Henry said. \u201cAnd it gives us the ability to also deter incidents from happening in the first place but if something does happen we have a much greater capability to respond to it.\u201d The video features at least five other unnamed officers who posed with the minister while they held the rifles and dogs on leads at the Canberra airport press conference. Electoral law requires political material to be authorised where it is made \u201cfor the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in a federal election\u201d \u2013 regardless of whether it is aired outside the election period. A Labor spokesperson said the opposition \u201csupports the AFP\u2019s hard work and sacrifice as well as these new measures to keep Australians safe at airports\u201d. \u201cIt is completely acceptable for the AFP to appear with relevant ministers at announcements, however Peter Dutton must ensure that AFP officers are never put in a position where they might feel they are being used for political purposes.\u201d An AFP spokesman said all officers at the event \u201cwere aware they would be filmed for material for traditional and social media\u201d. \u201cMembers have not breached the AFP code of conduct through their involvement in this event,\u201d he said. In March the Australian Federal Police Association \u2013 the union representing police \u2013 warned the AFP is losing its independence and integrity and must be separated from Dutton\u2019s Home Affairs portfolio. Police independence from the political process has been called into question during raids of construction union headquarters in 2015, the office of former senator Stephen Conroy in 2016, and the Australian Workers Union headquarters investigating historic political donations in 2017. Guardian Australia contacted Dutton for comment.",

Growth Farms Australia, a company in which the energy minister holds an interest, was the agricultural manager of the two farms for several years until 2014, sources have told Guardian Australia. It came to run the properties \u2013 Kia Ora and Clyde \u2013 as the result of an investment scheme that promised to make millions through tradable water rights \u2013 but which looked as though it might go horribly wrong until the federal government stepped in to buy its rights. Taylor has said he played no role in the 2017 water sale and was not aware of it until it was announced. He has said that neither he nor his family benefited from the water transaction. There is nothing to suggest that is untrue. A hard slog The story of the water sale begins in 2007, when Taylor, then a management consultant, teamed up with a lawyer-turned-dealmaker from New Zealand, Connor Maloney. In his parliamentary biography, Taylor describes himself as a co-founder of Eastern Australia Irrigation and, for a year in 2008 and 2009, a director of its subsidiary, Eastern Australia Agriculture, which owned two large cotton farms \u2013 Kia Ora and Clyde in Queensland, just south of the giant Cubbie Station. A group of investors were brought together, including UK company EF Realisation Fund and Pacific Alliance Group \u2013 whose chief investment officer, Chris Gradel, was a rowing buddy of Taylor\u2019s from Oxford. This was an investment for those with deep pockets looking for exposure to agriculture and the potential to make big profits when the Australian government established a trading scheme in water as part of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Their interests were held through the Caymans parent, Eastern Australia Irrigation. Taylor was a director of that company until at least the financial year 2012-13. But because the Caymans does not make company records public, its impossible to confirm Taylor\u2019s statement that he resigned before entering parliament. Soon after Eastern Australia Agriculture bought the farms, the management was taken over by Growth Farms, a company established by the Taylor family, and which offers agricultural management services, often for foreign investors. Growth Farms was responsible for hiring key personnel for Kia Ora and Clyde. For a while Geoff Daniel, a director of Growth Farms, was the key manager of the farms. Taylor\u2019s former McKinsey and Co colleague Tony Reid, who remains a director and shareholder of Growth Farms, was also a regular at the properties and made it his business to understand the water entitlements, insiders said. Taylor\u2019s brother Richard was chairman until 2015. In a 2015 media report Angus Taylor was described as a passive shareholder and he declares an interest in Growth Farms on his pecuniary interest register. But for Growth Farms, the cotton farms proved a challenge. They had been run down before Growth Farms stepped in and hired farm managers to turn them around. It was a hard slog, especially for the Growth Farm executives who were used to managing grazing land but who now found themselves attempting to run two giant irrigated properties that relied on complex infrastructure such as levies and storages to manage overland flows. Unluckily for the investors, the millennium drought was followed by record breaking floods. The Condamine-Balonne valley had four floods in two years between 2010 and 2012. Nearby St George had to be evacuated twice. The two farms were inundated and some of the cotton crop lost. Then followed another drought. The farms were forced to plough some of the crop back in as water in the storages ran short, insiders told the Guardian. Eastern Australia Agriculture accounts give an insight into the problems faced by the Growth Farm managers. Although the accounts are complicated by inter-company loans, the 2016-17 annual report for the Australian company shows accumulated losses of $41m. Frustration at failure to sell The plan to sell water rights foundered as well. According to bureaucrats answering questions on notice, Angus Taylor approached them in 2008 offering to sell some of Eastern Australia Agriculture\u2019s water entitlements, but the government rejected the offer. Another approach from the company in 2014 was also unsuccessful. The details of why the commonwealth rejected the offers has not been made public. Meanwhile Maloney and the investors were getting increasingly agitated. The investors had been promised a five- to seven-year horizon and now it was proving difficult to realise any gains. \u201cIt was like swimming with sharks,\u201d said one of the former managers. Another described the investors as trying to micromanage the properties and refusing to follow their advice on much-needed investment. Maloney and the managers of the properties clashed. Daniels left, the on-farm managers were made redundant and asked to leave with short notice, and by late 2014 the contract with Growth Farms had ended. Taylor says Growth Farms\u2019 management agreement ended earlier in 2010. By now investors were most unhappy. The farms had been put on the market in 2013, and again in 2015, with different agents. They did not sell. What happened next is still a little unclear, despite numerous requests for documents through freedom of information laws and through Senate calls for production of papers. But discussions about the federal government buying Eastern Australia Agriculture\u2019s water sprang back to life in late 2015. The idea was discussed with the environment minister, Greg Hunt, but before he could decide, the water portfolio was given to then Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce. What emerged was a deal extremely favourable to Eastern Australia Agriculture. Growth Farms had stopped managing the properties at least three years before the water was sold in 2017. But one key figure and a director of Growth Farms, Reid, remained involved and played a key role in the water sale. Reid says he acted independently of Growth Farms, did the work on the sale as an independent consultant and was paid separately from Growth Farms. The current managing director of Growth Farms, David Sackett, confirmed that Reid did the work independent of the firm in which the Taylors have interests. \u201cWe weren\u2019t at all involved in the sale of the water,\u201d Sackett said. Taylor also said it was his understanding that Growth Farms ended its contract with Eastern Australia Agriculture some years before the water sale.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s never very decorous to say I told you so. But when predictions are borne out to the letter, it would be equally smug not to mention it. Last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/05/hopes-are-again-high-but-history-says-new-zealand-will-choke-in-australia\">I questioned the talking up of the New Zealand Test team\u2019s prospects</a> in Australia, given a history of freezing on such tours. In Perth the two sides repeated the start of their 2015 series blow for blow, with Australia batting for most of two days before rattling through a feeble New Zealand response.</p> <p>While the Kiwis found their fight later in the match, they all but conceded it at the start. Lockie Ferguson was erratic on debut, Tim Southee was unthreatening, and Australia rattled along at four runs an over. Catches began going down and only four wickets fell on the first day. Holding David Warner and Steve Smith to 43 apiece was a win, but Marnus Labuschagne got a life and made a hundred while Travis Head got away with a dicey half century.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/16/tim-paine-says-australia-can-still-get-better-after-demolition-of-new-zealand\">Tim Paine says Australia 'can still get better' after demolition of New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for the batting, facing Mitchell Starc and company under lights was always going to be fiendish. But New Zealand had prepared by playing daytime Tests against England at home, without a single pink-ball match to acclimatise. They received exactly the trouble they requested.</p> <p>In the final analysis, New Zealand\u2019s bowling was impressive after losing Ferguson to injury on the first day. Left-arm quick Neil Wagner ran in to deliver 60 overs of bouncers in an astonishing display of endurance and aggression. Tim Southee bowled 51, while all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme delivered 39 on the way back from injury himself. Previously he averaged 24 overs a match.</p> <p>Between them they turned the screws through the second day of Australia\u2019s first innings, then used an evening session to help bowl out Australia for 217 in the second innings, creating a few doubts for some home players and giving the visitors something to take into the next two matches. But it couldn\u2019t affect the result given how poor the start had been.</p> <p>The real disappointment for New Zealand looking back will be that their own depleted attack was still better equipped than Australia\u2019s. Josh Hazlewood also fell to injury but only made it into his second over. Australia had no all-rounder, with only the dubious work of some specialist batsmen to fall back on. Yet facing a team of three bowlers, New Zealand couldn\u2019t extend them to the point that life got difficult, facing only 55 overs in the first innings and 65 in the second.</p> <p>As for Australia, the injury to Hazlewood was the only sore point. Though it does raise the question of whether any player has had more impact on a match when their involvement was limited to 1.2 overs. He didn\u2019t face a ball in the first innings, didn\u2019t bat in the second, and bowled eight deliveries, but one of them was his screaming inswinger to Jeet Raval that swerved as if piloted by an unseen hand into the opening batsman\u2019s middle stump. It sent a shiver through New Zealand\u2019s order and they never recovered.</p> <p>The work of Starc and Nathan Lyon in his absence will be encouraging, with the pair collectively outplaying New Zealand\u2019s key batsmen Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson in both innings among a bag of wickets. Pat Cummins also bowled outstandingly for more modest reward.</p> <p>The topic of Hazlewood\u2019s replacement for the Boxing Day Test has been a source of entertainment. Michael Neser and James Pattinson were in the Perth squad, with Pattinson best fitting the fast and furious bill that Australian selectors historically prefer. He played twice in this year\u2019s Ashes and is finally available after years of injury.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/15/peter-siddle-emerges-as-shock-option-to-cover-for-josh-hazlewood-at-mcg\">Peter Siddle emerges as shock option to cover for Josh Hazlewood at MCG</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But coach Justin Langer lobbed a cat into the coop by suggesting Peter Siddle. Plenty of commentators have written off Siddle at 35 years of age, but they\u2019ve been talking about the end of his career since the 2015 Ashes. He has been taking wickets for Victoria at the MCG this season at an average of 15, and is a steadier bowler who might be a better swap for Hazlewood while Pattinson has more in common with Starc.</p> <p>There\u2019s also the small question of the pitch, which has been dire and dull at the MCG for a number of years now, then went too far the other way when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/09/mcg-curators-went-a-bit-too-far-in-adding-life-to-sheffield-shield-pitch\">curators juiced up a pitch</a> for a state game with a lot of watering, and it bounced so erratically that the match was called off. If the curators are spooked then we could be back to a bore-draw surface.</p> <p>And if that\u2019s the case, the result in Perth will be even more significant, as will the opportunity let slip. In 2015, after being demolished in the first Test, New Zealand drew the second and narrowly lost the third. Despite competing they left with a 2-0 result. The 1985 triumph was built on Richard Hadlee and Martin Crowe delivering the first Test at the Gabba. New Zealanders know that series wins in Australia are hard to come by; that remains their only one. It\u2019s even harder for a team that has slipped behind.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s never very decorous to say I told you so. But when predictions are borne out to the letter, it would be equally smug not to mention it. Last week I questioned the talking up of the New Zealand Test team\u2019s prospects in Australia, given a history of freezing on such tours. In Perth the two sides repeated the start of their 2015 series blow for blow, with Australia batting for most of two days before rattling through a feeble New Zealand response. While the Kiwis found their fight later in the match, they all but conceded it at the start. Lockie Ferguson was erratic on debut, Tim Southee was unthreatening, and Australia rattled along at four runs an over. Catches began going down and only four wickets fell on the first day. Holding David Warner and Steve Smith to 43 apiece was a win, but Marnus Labuschagne got a life and made a hundred while Travis Head got away with a dicey half century. As for the batting, facing Mitchell Starc and company under lights was always going to be fiendish. But New Zealand had prepared by playing daytime Tests against England at home, without a single pink-ball match to acclimatise. They received exactly the trouble they requested. In the final analysis, New Zealand\u2019s bowling was impressive after losing Ferguson to injury on the first day. Left-arm quick Neil Wagner ran in to deliver 60 overs of bouncers in an astonishing display of endurance and aggression. Tim Southee bowled 51, while all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme delivered 39 on the way back from injury himself. Previously he averaged 24 overs a match. Between them they turned the screws through the second day of Australia\u2019s first innings, then used an evening session to help bowl out Australia for 217 in the second innings, creating a few doubts for some home players and giving the visitors something to take into the next two matches. But it couldn\u2019t affect the result given how poor the start had been. The real disappointment for New Zealand looking back will be that their own depleted attack was still better equipped than Australia\u2019s. Josh Hazlewood also fell to injury but only made it into his second over. Australia had no all-rounder, with only the dubious work of some specialist batsmen to fall back on. Yet facing a team of three bowlers, New Zealand couldn\u2019t extend them to the point that life got difficult, facing only 55 overs in the first innings and 65 in the second. As for Australia, the injury to Hazlewood was the only sore point. Though it does raise the question of whether any player has had more impact on a match when their involvement was limited to 1.2 overs. He didn\u2019t face a ball in the first innings, didn\u2019t bat in the second, and bowled eight deliveries, but one of them was his screaming inswinger to Jeet Raval that swerved as if piloted by an unseen hand into the opening batsman\u2019s middle stump. It sent a shiver through New Zealand\u2019s order and they never recovered. The work of Starc and Nathan Lyon in his absence will be encouraging, with the pair collectively outplaying New Zealand\u2019s key batsmen Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson in both innings among a bag of wickets. Pat Cummins also bowled outstandingly for more modest reward. The topic of Hazlewood\u2019s replacement for the Boxing Day Test has been a source of entertainment. Michael Neser and James Pattinson were in the Perth squad, with Pattinson best fitting the fast and furious bill that Australian selectors historically prefer. He played twice in this year\u2019s Ashes and is finally available after years of injury. But coach Justin Langer lobbed a cat into the coop by suggesting Peter Siddle. Plenty of commentators have written off Siddle at 35 years of age, but they\u2019ve been talking about the end of his career since the 2015 Ashes. He has been taking wickets for Victoria at the MCG this season at an average of 15, and is a steadier bowler who might be a better swap for Hazlewood while Pattinson has more in common with Starc. There\u2019s also the small question of the pitch, which has been dire and dull at the MCG for a number of years now, then went too far the other way when curators juiced up a pitch for a state game with a lot of watering, and it bounced so erratically that the match was called off. If the curators are spooked then we could be back to a bore-draw surface. And if that\u2019s the case, the result in Perth will be even more significant, as will the opportunity let slip. In 2015, after being demolished in the first Test, New Zealand drew the second and narrowly lost the third. Despite competing they left with a 2-0 result. The 1985 triumph was built on Richard Hadlee and Martin Crowe delivering the first Test at the Gabba. New Zealanders know that series wins in Australia are hard to come by; that remains their only one. It\u2019s even harder for a team that has slipped behind.",

      "bodyText": "The prudential regulator has launched a full-scale investigation into Westpac over its money-laundering and child exploitation scandal that could result in bank directors and executives being kicked out of the industry. And the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority told Westpac it must set aside an additional $500m in capital, bringing the total capital penalty imposed on the bank since the middle of the year to $1bn. Apra said it would also review Westpac\u2019s governance of risk, including executive accountability and remuneration. The investigation comes after Australia\u2019s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, launched legal action against Westpac last month alleging the bank breached anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws 23m times, including by allowing customers to transfer money to the Philippines in a manner consistent with child exploitation. It is the latest blow for the bank over a scandal which has already lopped the heads of its chief executive and chairman and earned a second \u201cstrike\u201d against its remuneration report from furious shareholders. Apra said it would cooperate with investigations being conducted by Austrac and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Separately, federal police are investigating the payments to the Philippines. John Lonsdale, the deputy chair of Apra, said Austrac\u2019s lawsuit raised \u201cserious allegations that question the prudential standing of Australia\u2019s second largest bank\u201d. \u201cWhile Westpac is financially sound, there are potentially substantial gaps in risk governance that need to be closed,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the nature of the matters raised by Austrac, the number of alleged breaches and the period of time over which they occurred, this will necessarily be an extensive and potentially lengthy investigation.\u201d Westpac\u2019s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, who has promised to resign next year as a result of the scandal, said the bank would fully cooperate with the Apra investigation. \u201cWestpac accepts the gravity of the issues presented by Austrac,\u201d he said in a statement to the stock exchange. \u201cAs previously stated, these shortcomings are unacceptable and we are determined to urgently fix these issues and lift our standards. \u201cWe will provide our full support to Apra through its investigation and review.\u201d Apra will conduct the investigation using powers that were beefed up after a money-laundering scandal at Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, in 2017. The regulator said it would investigate whether Westpac\u2019s governance and risk management framework was adequate, whether its executive pay regime was adequate to manage non-financial risks, whether the bank failed to comply with the banking executive accountability regime, whether it failed to comply with prudential standards and whether it failed to report breaches. Apra added $500m to the capital requirements of ANZ, Nab and Westpac banks in July due to the \u201chigher operational risk\u201d discovered in self-reviews ordered by the regulator. The regulator had already hit CBA with an extra $1bn capital requirement after its prudential review discovered problems including complacency and a culture that discouraged criticism.",

      "body": "<p>It is possible that you are not in the best place to deal with more bad news about Britain and its enduring commitment to moral failure. But we get not only the leaders, but also the television we deserve. Responsible Child (BBC Two) is a drama built around one extraordinary fact \u2013 that, in England and Wales, children as young as 10 can be tried for murder as if they were adults. Think for a moment of any 10-year-olds you know and imagine them in crown court being assumed to have the capacity of a grown man or woman. In fact, 7,057 of their pre-pubescent peers have been through exactly that since 1995. That is the year, incidentally, that the UN pointed out that having such a young age of criminal responsibility was incompatible with the UK\u2019s obligations, as part of said UN, on children\u2019s rights.</p> <p>Responsible Child was written by Sean Buckley (who penned Skins) and directed by the documentary-maker Nick Holt, in his first foray into drama. It draws from a variety of cases, but is perhaps most directly based on the 2014 case of Jerome Ellis, aged 14, and his 23-year-old brother, Joshua, who stabbed their abusive stepfather to death as he lay on the family sofa.</p> <p>The drama follows the story of 12-year-old Ray (Billy Barratt, an actor the same age as his character, who turns in a credible and heartbreaking performance) and his 23-year-old brother, Nathan (James Tarpey doing likewise), living under the tyranny of their mother\u2019s boyfriend, Scott. It is told in two timeframes. The preparation for Ray\u2019s trial plays out in the present. We flash back repeatedly to the events that led him there, from the \u201cordinary\u201d fear the boys live with under Scott\u2019s rule, to Scott\u2019s armed attack on Nathan, for which he is charged with attempted murder \u2013 only for charges to be dropped and Scott to return to the home more furious than ever.</p> <p>It is, to put it mildly, an untenable situation. The flashback scenes throb with misery and dread. As Scott, Shaun Dingwall perfectly captures the bitter toxicity of a certain kind of man, slashing and burning his way through a pathetic life, thriving on the terror he causes in others.</p> <p>To my mind, the alternating of this timeline with the other dissipates the emotional tension and narrative torque, especially as this film\u2019s court scenes are thin, dry things and the fine actors in them \u2013 including Michelle Fairley as the barrister Kerry and Stephen Campbell Moore as the child psychologist Dr Keaton \u2013 are given little to work with. She is there mostly to deliver snippets of legalese and look pained; he to look frustrated and avow on the stand that a child\u2019s brain is less developed than an adult\u2019s. The lack of detail (Ray\u2019s team reacts with horror, for example, when Nathan decides not to give evidence, but we are not told what it means, although it is clearly not good; the failure of social services is presented as a given) raises distracting questions about the process when we should be focusing on Ray.</p> <p>There are clunky moments scattered about, too, when the pedagogic intent overrides the dramatic. \u201cIf you were 30 years old with your mind,\u201d Kerry tells Ray at one point, \u201cyou\u2019d be judged not fit to stand trial. But you\u2019re not, Ray.\u201d It\u2019s a point made purely for the viewer\u2019s benefit \u2013 for the character to utter it in that context serves no purpose other than to burden her 12-year-old client with further appreciation of the relentless absurdity and injustice of the world.</p> <p>But if the first hour slows the pace and keeps the viewer at a slight distance, the last half-hour pulls things together \u2013 and us in. The interrogation of Ray on the stand, interspersed with memories from the night of the murder, followed by the two timelines collapsing after the trial as Ray suffers nightmares in his cell, brings everything home. Debbie Honeywood, as the boys\u2019 mother, gives a pitch-perfect portrayal of a woman numbed, her selfhood utterly corroded after years of suffering and abuse from Scott and \u2013 we suspect \u2013 Ray and Nathan\u2019s alcoholic father. The brief scene between her and Ray after the verdict is truly harrowing.</p> <p>It works, overall, as drama. Will it work as agitprop? Will it prompt movement on the enduring injustice of judging children by the same standards as adults in trials? Ray, one of his team points out, is still years away from being legally able to buy a hamster. Who is responsible for this travesty? And who will take responsibility for change?</p>",

He was recalled for the 2018 winter tour of New Zealand and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/14/ben-stokes-trial-cleared-affray-brawl-outside-bristol-nightclub-england-cricketer\" title=\"\">found not guilty</a> at Bristol crown court the following summer.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re not in [the team] that gets taken away from you,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cIf [your teammates] are taking time out of their days to keep in contact and see how you are, that\u2019s when you really know you\u2019re part of something quite special.

For me that means a huge amount.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how cricket can build on this success, Morgan said: \u201cI think you try to take advantage of the platform that the success has brought.

      "bodyText": "Ben Stokes described himself as the \u201cboy in the bubble\u201d as the BBC Sports Personality of the Year thanked his teammates and the sport of cricket for helping him through his trial for affray and into a summer of sporting glory. English cricket achieved standout success at Sunday night\u2019s ceremony in Aberdeen, taking the team of the year as well as Stokes\u2019s individual award, and winning the moment of the year for the winning run-out against New Zealand in the World Cup final. The challenge now is to capitalise on it. \u201cThat moment at Lords when we won the World Cup was a childhood dream,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cTalking about the years before that you look at it and sport has an amazing way of picking you back up. You\u2019ve got so many people around you who are able to help you \u2013 family, teammates, everybody involved in cricket is a part of that. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out there as a batsman, I just try to envisage myself as a boy in a bubble. Anything outside of that, I\u2019ll try not to let it in. I just look at what I\u2019ve got to do with the bat in hand.\u201d Stokes was dropped by England in 2017 after being involved in a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub that led him to stand trial on charges of affray. He was recalled for the 2018 winter tour of New Zealand and was found not guilty at Bristol crown court the following summer. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not in [the team] that gets taken away from you,\u201d Stokes said. \u201cIf [your teammates] are taking time out of their days to keep in contact and see how you are, that\u2019s when you really know you\u2019re part of something quite special. That wasn\u2019t just for the first days and weeks that was completely until I got back in the team. Even though I wasn\u2019t there I was made to feel like I was.\u201d For Eoin Morgan there was no surprise Stokes won the award after his performance not only in the World Cup but during the unforgettable third Ashes Test at Headingley. The collective awards, however, were a pleasant surprise for the one-day captain. \u201cThere was probably an expectation between us [of Ben] winning the big award,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cBut to scoop the other two on top of it in what was a big year for sport \u2026 It\u2019s fantastic to see that cricket is at the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind. It was incredible to be part of, we travelled up and down the country witnessing it first hand, just the incredible caring nature and the feelgood factor around the sport. For me that means a huge amount.\u201d Asked how cricket can build on this success, Morgan said: \u201cI think you try to take advantage of the platform that the success has brought. Using the opportunities to grow the game and get it to the most important people, which is young kids up and down the country. We want to be in schools getting a bat and ball in their hand and I think The Hundred couldn\u2019t come at a better time.\u201d",

But as it does this, it must not lose sight of the one thing it got right in this election. Labour was right to grasp the scale of the economic and environmental challenge the country faces and offer ambitious solutions. Against the backdrop of the longest squeeze in living standards for generations, economic growth that has passed many communities by, entrenched poverty and a climate emergency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> offered a manifesto that began to rise to the challenge. It contained flaws, but it would have undoubtedly begun the process of transforming our economy. Those eager to reject Corbyn would be wrong to abandon this ground as well.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Tom Kibasi, a commentator and thinktank boss, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/16/labour-2017-2019-corbyn-brexit-election\">in an article for the Guardian</a> that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was a problem.</strong></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As Labour members seek to make sense of what happened, they must also confront the reality that some of the people around Corbyn trampled over the ideals of Corbynism. They destroyed the moral standing of a lifelong anti-racism campaigner by choosing to interpret antisemitism as a factional issue rather than a moral one. They prevented the heir to Tony Benn fulfilling his commitment to member-led democracy by seizing control of selections for themselves. They brought bullying, threats and intimidation to the office of a man famed for being kind, gentle and polite. This is an unavoidable part of the story of Labour\u2019s failure.</p> <p>The truth is that the problems Labour faced cannot be disentangled from the question of leadership. Corbyn faced a barrage of attacks \u2013 that he tolerated antisemitism, supported the IRA and other terrorists, disliked the monarchy and didn\u2019t support the armed forces \u2013 that were more ferocious than any other party leader in living memory. But the problem with Corbyn\u2019s leadership was not the things outside his control, but those over which he had full power. While he reaffirmed the values of social justice and helped Labour to rediscover its radicalism, he was unable to rise to the challenge of one of the toughest jobs in public life.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>And Paul Mason has posted his thoughts on the defeat in a Twitter thread.

So it was a \u201cvery heartening\u201d set of discussions, he said. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Probably the most positive thing is there\u2019s going to be a number of bilateral discussions between the parties later today and tomorrow. And I would encourage that, because at the end of the day this is an issue for Northern Ireland parties to come together on. They\u2019ve heard the message on the doorsteps. I think they\u2019ve heard it loud and clear. And we need to get this done.</p> </blockquote> <p>By \u201cmessage on the doorsteps\u201d, Smith was referring to the anger about the fact that the executive has been suspended now for almost three years. This partly explains why both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, the two main parties in Northern Ireland who between them are responsible for the deadlock, saw their share of the vote go down in the election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"459821eb0610416dff435876f2f1d61305b75e0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459821eb0610416dff435876f2f1d61305b75e0b/34_0_897_538/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sky News\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Smith on Sky News.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News/Julian Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-16T14:50:58.793Z\">at 2.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5df789338f08c3972263b3cb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-16T13:57:39.667Z\">1.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Don't try bullying BBC into submission, former corporation boss Lord Grade tells government</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the World at One<strong> Lord Grade</strong>, the former BBC chairman, warned the government against trying to bully the corporation.

It went on for quite a while, but it was not hugely illuminating. We certainly did not come away with any great new insights into the agenda of the new government.</p> <p>Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the government would \u201cstart the process\u201d of passing the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas.</strong> It is understood that No 10 wants to hold the second reading debate on Friday, after the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. But it would be unusual to hold a second reading debate a day after the Queen\u2019s speech, and it is not clear yet whether the Speaker would approve this.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said Boris Johnson had now approved the intelligence and security committee\u2019s report in Russian involvement in British politics for publication.</strong> This is the report that Johnson refused to publish before the election, prompting speculation that he was suppressing it because it would be embarrassing to the Conservatives. This means the ISC is now free to publish it. But the ISC does not currently exist, because a new ISC has to be appointed when the new parliament meets, and so the report is not expected to appear until a new ISC is formed at some point in the new year. The spokesman declined to say exactly when the PM decided the report was fit for publication.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman confirmed that the government would review whether non-payment of the TV licence fee should be decriminalised.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman refused to say whether the withdrawal agreement bill due to be published this week would be exactly the same as the one given a second reading by MPs before the election. </strong>Asked about this, the spokesman said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You will have to wait for it to be published but it will reflect the agreement that we made with the EU on our withdrawal.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman said the government would be aiming for \u201ca Canada-style free trade agreement with no political alignment\u201d in its talks with the EU on a post-Brexit trade deal.</strong> But he refused to say any more about the government\u2019s strategy in those talks.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>The spokesman refused to confirm that a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period was still a possibility. </strong>Asked to confirm that this was a logical possibility if the UK and the EU failed to reach an agreement by the end of next year, the spokesman just said that it was in the interests of both the UK and the EU to get a Canada-style trade deal.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"104f17b2ce114b90dc76e13a3712342361b2ca15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/104f17b2ce114b90dc76e13a3712342361b2ca15/0_866_3356_2013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10 Downing Street \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">10 Downing Street <br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-16T13:34:18.178Z\">at 1.34pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5df757dd8f087e8308e5ed8d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-16T10:34:28.551Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Andy McDonald,</strong> the shadow transport secretary, has also given an interview to the BBC\u2019s <strong>Victoria Derbyshire</strong>. In it, he partly toned down his criticism of the BBC. He said that he was not blaming it for Labour\u2019s defeat. And he said that he treasured it. But he repeated his claim that some of its coverage was slanted against Labour. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m suggesting that we treasure our public service broadcaster, the BBC, and in my opinion they have trespassed with regularity during the course of this campaign into an area that they should not trespass into.</p> <p>We\u2019ve had endless examples from the political correspondents of the BBC that we find very difficult to accept.</p> </blockquote> <p>Derbyshire said McDonald\u2019s use of the word \u201cconsciously\u201d on the Today programme this morning (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/16/boris-johnson-new-mps-parliament-labour-arrive-at-westminster-as-boris-johnson-prepares-mini-reshuffle-live-news?page=with:block-5df74f078f085eda5c108689#block-5df74f078f085eda5c108689\">9.48am)</a> implied he thought BBC reporters were deliberately slanting coverage to increase the chances of a Conservative victory. McDonald replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, when your senior political correspondent opines about the postal ballots, and says that the postal ballots are not looking good for Labour \u2013 we don\u2019t look at postal ballots \u2013 how on earth could that opinion be expressed? And why is an interpretation on what is blind at that time being interpreted as not looking good for Labour?</p> <p>Why is it that stories sent from Tory HQ are received by the BBC and turned into a factual story when the reality is that the Labour political activist did not punch a political adviser to Matt Hancock? Yet that was put out on the airwaves.</p> </blockquote> <p>McDonald said Labour would be reviewing what went wrong with its campaign, and he said he hoped the BBC would review its coverage too.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In my view [the BBC has] been used and abused, and if we are not careful the rampant Tory party will dispense with the BBC, and sadly those who are currently in charge of it have nobody to blame for themselves.</p> <p>But I treasure the BBC. It\u2019s a bastion. And it\u2019s really, really important that we hold our public service broadcaster close and make sure that it is not undermined. I\u2019m afraid the way people have gone about their business during this election does not fill me with confidence. </p> <p>I\u2019m not saying for one minute that the BBC have caused the defeat.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Nicky Morgan was reappointed culture secretary, despite having retired from the Commons. Morgan had said she wanted to spend more time with her family when she stepped down prior to the election. Reports suggested her return to cabinet would be an interim measure ahead of a larger reshuffle early next year. Angela Rayner is likely to seek the deputy leadership of the Labour party, numerous sources suggested. The shadow education secretary is expected to give Rebecca Long-Bailey a clear run as the left-wing leadership candidate. The government must not try to bully the BBC into submission, the broadcaster\u2019s former boss said. Lord Grade, the former BBC chairman, made the comments on Radio 4\u2019s World at One programme after it emerged that the government was considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, also said the BBC was partly to blame for Labour\u2019s defeat at the election. Arlene Foster said she hopes the Northern Ireland assembly will be up and running early next year. The DUP leader accepted the election had created a \u201cmomentum\u201d towards breaking the deadlock. The shadow foreign secretary threatened to sue a former parliamentary colleague for saying she once described leave voters as \u201cstupid\u201d. Emily Thornberry said she was involving lawyers because Caroline Flint had refused to retract her comments. Downing Street held the first lobby briefing since the election. You can see a detailed summary of that here. MPs have been arriving at Westminster following last week\u2019s general election that brought a decisive Tory victory. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, addressed the new intake and undertook a mini-reshuffle of his cabinet. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason have tonight\u2019s main politics story: Boris Johnson will attempt to mark his election promise to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d by writing into law that the UK will leave the EU in 2020 and will not extend the transition period, Kate Proctor, Peter Walker and Daniel Boffey report. As MPs begin to be sworn in at Westminster on Tuesday, the prime minister\u2019s team is working on amending the withdrawal agreement bill so that the transition, also known as the implementation period, must end on 31 December 2020 and there will be no request to the EU for a further extension. A Downing Street source said: Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new withdrawal agreement bill will legally prohibit government agreeing to any extension. Here\u2019s a host more middle and junior-ranking ministerial appointments just announced by No 10: Anne-Marie Trevelyan is promoted to minister of state at the Ministry of Defence in place of Mark Lancaster. Her former role is taken by James Heappey, who becomes a parliamentary under secretary of state at the MoD. Jeremy Quin moves from his role as a government whip to become a parliamentary secretary at the Cabinet Office. David TC Davies becomes a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Wales Office and an assistant government whip. He will only be paid for the latter role. Kevin Foster is appointed a parliamentary under secretary of state at the Home Office, replacing Seema Kennedy. Robin Walker will move from being a joint parliamentary under secretary of state at the Scotland and Northern Ireland offices, to fulfilling the role solely at the latter. And Downing street has announced that the following have been removed from their government roles: Nick Hurd, who was previously a minister of state at the Northern Ireland office. Colin Clark, who was previously a parliamentary under Secretary of State at the Scotland office and a government whip. A mooted plan to merge the department for international development (DfID) and the foreign office (FCO) risks allowing British aid money to be spent on \u201cUK foreign policy, commercial and political objectives\u201d, rather than on helping the world\u2019s poorest people, more than 100 charities warn. They cited an Independent Commission for Aid Impact report (pdf) that found responsibility for the UK aid budget was increasingly being spread around Whitehall, with departments spending more and more in \u201clarge middle-income countries\u201d. The charities, which include the British Red Cross, Ocfam GB and Unicef UK, said: Merging DfID with the FCO would risk dismantling the UK\u2019s leadership on international development and humanitarian aid. It suggests we are turning our backs on the world\u2019s poorest people, as well as some of the greatest global challenges of our time: extreme poverty, climate change and conflict. UK aid risks becoming a vehicle for UK foreign policy, commercial and political objectives, when it first and foremost should be invested to alleviate poverty. By far the best way to ensure that aid continues to deliver for those who need it the most is by retaining DfID as a separate Whitehall department, with a secretary of state for international development, and by pledging to keep both independent aid scrutiny bodies: the Independent Commission for Aid Impact and the International Development Select Committee. Boris Johnson has briefly addressed the new Conservative MPs at Westminster, telling them they were \u201chere to get things done\u201d. Flick Drummond, the new MP for Meon Valley, said he was \u201cvery inspiring\u201d. He talked about how excited he was to see so many of us here. He said we are here to get things done. We are here to get Brexit done. Caroline Ansell, the MP for Eastbourne, said: There is a real energy, a real buzz. Everybody is very keen to move forward. Paul Howell, who took Tony Blair\u2019s old Sedgefield seat, said: It is a fabulous occasion. It is a new profile for the Conservative Party. We have got to deliver across the country. Morgan has joked that leaving the cabinet is more difficult than leaving the EU after it was announced she would be made a life peer to allow her to carry on as culture secretary, despite having stood down as an MP. The Labour MP, Jo Stevens, offers this criticism: Senior Scottish National party and Lib Dem figures are equally scathing of Johnson\u2019s decision to reappoint Morgan. Layla Moran is the Lib Dems\u2019 culture spokeswoman: Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant, a former shadow culture secretary, is somewhat unimpressed by Morgan\u2019s reappointment. However, as the Telegraph\u2019s Asa Bennett points out, making someone a peer in order for them to serve in the cabinet is by no means unprecedented: It also appears that Morgan may not be intending to stick around for long: Here\u2019s the letter Morgan wrote to her local party chair when she decided not to stand for election. In the letter, dated 30 October, she cited the impact serving in the Commons was having on her family life and the abuse MPs receive as reasons not to seek re-election. Morgan said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t commit to another five-year term\u201d and that \u201cnow is the time for me to stand aside and be at home far more\u201d. Now, she will serve as culture secretary as a life peer. Nicky Morgan has been confirmed as the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, despite having stood down from the Commons at last week\u2019s election. A No 10 spokesman has said: The Queen has been pleased to signify her intention of conferring a peerage of the United Kingdom for life on Nicky Morgan. The Irish foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, has held talks with the Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, at Stormont. He is meeting political leaders in Belfast over the next 24 hours before an all-party round table on Wednesday, when he said he hoped they could agree a plan to restore devolution and co-operation between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Coveney said: Now is the time to get Stormont back up and running. We have had three years without any form of devolved government in Northern Ireland. It is far too long and I think we have seen the consequences of that in terms of the polarisation of politics across Northern Ireland, not just amongst political parties but also within communities. The one clear message I have got from the general election in Northern Ireland is that people have been putting pressure on all of the parties to get back to Stormont, to get back to work, to make decisions for Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland and, of course, the job of the British and Irish governments is to work together with the parties to put a foundation in place to allow that to happen, and we are running out of time. What we have now is a very real window that all of us need to take and the meetings today, from what I hear, have gone well. Certainly, the meeting I have had with the secretary of state was very positive. Coveney said Wednesday\u2019s planned strike action by nurses represented a \u201creality check\u201d for politicians. Decisions need to be made in Stormont. It is a reminder to everybody that now is the time to get this done. We will work night and day before Christmas, and again in the new year, if necessary, to help the parties get it across the line. Hart supported Johnson\u2019s bid to be Tory leader in the summer, saying the party needed a \u201cbolder choice, not without its risks, but the sort of choice which really engages people in the debate about the country\u2026 [in a way that is] eye-catching, visible and audible\u201d. On Brexit, Hart supported remain in 2016 and was one of the co-leaders of the Brexit Delivery Group of MPs who backed Theresa May\u2019s deal over a no-deal Brexit and who were seen by many in the Tory party as moderates. Speaking during the party leadership campaign, he said: I see myself as an example of somebody who has been in a pretty different place from Boris during the whole Brexit process but who fully accepts that we must now move to a conclusion. In February, Hart said the Tory party had staked its reputation on being able to deliver a Brexit deal. Before entering the Commons, Hart served as the chief executive and chairman of the Countryside Alliance and campaigned against the hunting ban introduced by the Labour government. Simon Hart, who previously served as a parliamentary secretary at the Cabinet Office, is the new secretary of state for Wales, Downing Street announces. Hart is the MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire and he replaces Alun Cairns in the ministerial role. Here are three contributions to the debate about what Labour should learn from its election defeat from prominent commentators on the left. Miatta Fahnbulleh, head of the New Economics Foundation thinktank, says in an article for the Guardian that Labour should not ditch its entire policy programme. Whatever the final verdict, the Labour party will have to change if it is to reconnect with the broad coalition of voters it needs to win back power. But as it does this, it must not lose sight of the one thing it got right in this election. Labour was right to grasp the scale of the economic and environmental challenge the country faces and offer ambitious solutions. Against the backdrop of the longest squeeze in living standards for generations, economic growth that has passed many communities by, entrenched poverty and a climate emergency, Labour offered a manifesto that began to rise to the challenge. It contained flaws, but it would have undoubtedly begun the process of transforming our economy. Those eager to reject Corbyn would be wrong to abandon this ground as well. Tom Kibasi, a commentator and thinktank boss, says in an article for the Guardian that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was a problem. As Labour members seek to make sense of what happened, they must also confront the reality that some of the people around Corbyn trampled over the ideals of Corbynism. They destroyed the moral standing of a lifelong anti-racism campaigner by choosing to interpret antisemitism as a factional issue rather than a moral one. They prevented the heir to Tony Benn fulfilling his commitment to member-led democracy by seizing control of selections for themselves. They brought bullying, threats and intimidation to the office of a man famed for being kind, gentle and polite. This is an unavoidable part of the story of Labour\u2019s failure. The truth is that the problems Labour faced cannot be disentangled from the question of leadership. Corbyn faced a barrage of attacks \u2013 that he tolerated antisemitism, supported the IRA and other terrorists, disliked the monarchy and didn\u2019t support the armed forces \u2013 that were more ferocious than any other party leader in living memory. But the problem with Corbyn\u2019s leadership was not the things outside his control, but those over which he had full power. While he reaffirmed the values of social justice and helped Labour to rediscover its radicalism, he was unable to rise to the challenge of one of the toughest jobs in public life. And Paul Mason has posted his thoughts on the defeat in a Twitter thread. It starts here. And here are his two final posts, the last of which includes a link to his 22-page pamphlet setting out his argument in more detail. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. The Press Association photographer Yoi Mok has some more pictures from Frank Dobson\u2019s funeral. I\u2019ve now been told by three Labour MPs, and a couple of other party sources, that they expect Angela Rayner to run for the deputy leadership \u2013 though had no confirmation yet from Rayner\u2019s camp. The shadow education secretary had been widely regarded as a strong possible contender for the leadership, but has apparently decided to give her old friend and flatmate Rebecca Long-Bailey a clear run as the leftwing candidate \u2013 a gesture one colleague said was \u201csisterly\u201d. Laura Pidcock, another leftwing favourite, lost her North West Durham seat to the Conservatives last week. Tim Farron has told the BBC that he won\u2019t be standing for the Liberal Democrat leadership. He held the post between 2015 and 2017, but told the BBC that if he were asked to do it again, the answer would be a \u201cdefinite, definite no\u201d. And this is from Fay Jones, the new Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire. Jones is on the left. She is beside Virginia Crosbie (centre), the new Conservative MP for Ynys M\u00f4n, and Sarah Atherton, the new Conservative MP for Wrexham. They are the first women to be elected as Conservative MPs in Wales. From Olivia Blake, the new Labour MP for Sheffield Hallam From the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for a fairer voting system, has released figures saying 14.5 million voters are effectively \u201cunrepresented\u201d because they voted for a candidate who did not win. It says: More than 14.5m voters are effectively \u2018unrepresented\u2019 according to the Electoral Reform Society, after 45% of voters rejected their local MP. The number reflects the millions who did not vote for the local MP in their area, under Westminster\u2019s \u2018one-person-takes-all\u2019 voting system. Under proportional representation, there are far fewer votes thrown on the \u2018electoral scrapheap\u2019, the ERS say. The society are also highlighting \u2018warped\u2019 results, with a large majority won on a minority of the vote. The Conservatives\u2019 vote share rose only slightly (1.3 percentage points), while their share of seats rose 7.4 points (to 56%). Labour\u2019s vote fell by 7.9 points while their share of seats fell by slightly more than that, 9.2 points. The Liberal Democrats won 11.5% of the vote but just 1.7% of seats. The party\u2019s vote share increased significantly but had a net loss of one seat. The SNP have 7.4% of seats on 3.9% of the vote. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, says he has suffered abuse and harassment because he argued the party had to accept the result of the Brexit referendum. And the Lib Dems have also been posing for a team photograph - which, given the numbers, was probably a bit easier to coordinate. Here is the new cohort of SNP MPs. Labour\u2019s defeat is \u2018big opportunity\u2019 to move to centre ground, says Andrew Adonis An old joke in the Labour party is that, after every election defeat, the party promptly forms a circular firing squad. Labour figures never actually end up shooting at each other although, as my colleague Rowena Mason reports, today they are threatening to sue each other - or at least one of them is. To add to the spirit of comradeliness, the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock (who represents leave-voting Aberavon and who was urging the party to back a soft Brexit, not remain) told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live earlier that those in the party who backed a second referendum should apologise to pro-leave Labour supporters. And the party should choose a new leader who did not argue for a second referendum, he said. He explained: I think it\u2019s important that our next leader should be someone who didn\u2019t back a second referendum, because I think that would send a very important signal that we understand where those leave voters are coming from and how alienated they felt by those in the Labour party who tried to preach at them that they somehow did not understand what they voted for in 2016. But Andrew Adonis, the former transport secretary, Labour peer and passionate remain campaigner, told BBC News this afternoon that he thought it was not all over for the remain campaign. He said that, although the UK would now leave the EU next year, the remain cause was not \u201cgone for all time\u201d and that at some point in the future a party might campaign to rejoin the EU. I don\u2019t know about the next year or two, but because I don\u2019t believe Britain will flourish long term outside the European Union, I think the case for rejoining will come back into British politics. He said Labour should view its defeat as a \u201cbig opportunity\u201d to elect a better leader. Well, with all catastrophes come opportunities, and the big opportunity for the Labour party now is to position itself in the centre grounds of politics with a leader who is credible, who can hold the government to account, and who can do so in a way that makes people think that at the next election there will be a very real choice. Asked to say who the new leader should be, Adonis said he had not firmly decided, but he said that he had \u201calways been hugely impressed by Keir Starmer\u201d (the shadow Brexit secretary, who won\u2019t get Kinnock\u2019s vote because he backed a second referendum) and that Starmer was fit to be prime minister. From my colleague Heather Stewart President Trump has called to congratulate Boris Johnson on his election victory, No 10 has said. A Downing Street spokesman said: The prime minister spoke with President Trump, who congratulated him on the result of the general election. They discussed the huge importance of the relationship between the UK and US, and looked forward to continued close cooperation on issues such as security and trade, including the negotiation of an ambitious free trade agreement. Many senior Labour figures have been attending Frank Dobson\u2019s funeral in London. This is from Alastair Campbell, director of communications at No 10 when Dobson was health secretary. From the Sunday Times\u2019 Gabriel Pogrund Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said she hopes the Northern Ireland assembly will be up and running early next year. Speaking after a meeting with Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, she said: I listened very carefully during the election campaign and right throughout the election campaign there was a desire to get Stormont back up and running again. Therefore we are here to try to make that happen. I hope all the other parties will too. Foster accepted the election had created a new \u201cmomentum\u201d towards breaking the deadlock and reaching agreement on power-sharing. I know it\u2019s Christmas, it\u2019s that time of the year again, we have been in processes before in and around this time of the year, but I very much hope that at the beginning of the new year we will have an assembly up and running and one that can deal with all the issues we have talked about today. Foster, who said she did not believe a new assembly election was necessary before 2022, also stressed the need for an injection of money. She said reforms were required to ensure that any new executive was \u201csustainable\u201d. This is from Mark Rutte, the Dutch PM. Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, has been holding talks today with the five main parties in Northern Ireland - the DUP, Sinn F\u00e9in, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance party - about restoring power-sharing in the province. Speaking a few minutes ago after those meetings, Smith said that every party had been \u201cvery, very positive\u201d about doing what they could do to get the Northern Ireland assembly and the power-sharing executive back up and running. So it was a \u201cvery heartening\u201d set of discussions, he said. He went on: Probably the most positive thing is there\u2019s going to be a number of bilateral discussions between the parties later today and tomorrow. And I would encourage that, because at the end of the day this is an issue for Northern Ireland parties to come together on. They\u2019ve heard the message on the doorsteps. I think they\u2019ve heard it loud and clear. And we need to get this done. By \u201cmessage on the doorsteps\u201d, Smith was referring to the anger about the fact that the executive has been suspended now for almost three years. This partly explains why both the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, the two main parties in Northern Ireland who between them are responsible for the deadlock, saw their share of the vote go down in the election. On the World at One Lord Grade, the former BBC chairman, warned the government against trying to bully the corporation. Commenting on the government plan (see 1.37pm) to consider decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee (a move that could reduce the BBC\u2019s revenue), Grade said an independent report looked at this in 2015 and concluded the status quo should remain. \u201cI cannot say any new factor that would justify the government reopening that debate,\u201d he said. He went on: What worries me is any government, whether it\u2019s a Conservative government or a Labour government, using its legislative powers to threaten the independence of the BBC. I don\u2019t like that and I would always oppose that and speak out, in the Lords or wherever, against any attempt to bully the BBC through the threat of legislation. I think the British public would be up in arms about that. When asked if he thought that was what was happening, Grade said: If the reports are correct, it feels that we could be moving in that direction, and I don\u2019t like it at all. And I think any elected government should think very, very, very carefully before it attempts to bully the BBC into submission. Grade said he also thought no prime minister would want to be remembered for destroying the BBC. At the morning lobby briefing Downing Street confirmed that it would consider decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. (See 12.08pm.) There was no mention of this idea in the Conservative manifesto, but Boris Johnson disclosed it at a campaign event on a day when he was facing intense criticism for his response to questions about the boy sleeping on a hospital floor and CCHQ was anxious to find another story that might divert journalists. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, has been defending the idea in interviews this morning (although not on the Today programme, which still seems to be the subject of a No 10 boycott). He told Sky News: We are going to look at the licence fee because we do think it is an unusual arrangement that it is criminalised. That\u2019s putting a lot of pressure, which I think is unnecessary, on the criminal justice system. It doesn\u2019t seem sensible to me that many members of the public, including vulnerable people, are being taken to court. He also said that under the current system people were \u201cending up in court for something that they wouldn\u2019t in other walks of life, if they were paying bills to other companies and organisations\u201d. Turning back to the BBC, the Evening Standard says in its splash that the corporation will respond to criticism of its election coverage by expanding coverage from outside London. In their story Joe Murphy and Sophia Sleigh report: The Evening Standard understands that BBC chiefs are already discussing how they can respond to the unprecedented backlash from both sides of the political divide. It is planning an increase in reporting and outside broadcasts from the North and Midlands, which revealed critical swings of opinion in the election, and other regions. Insiders said it will not mean opening new centres or hiring a lot more staff, but will involve telling existing stars to get out of the capital city more often and put their ears to the ground in far-flung regions. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary and a potential candidate for the Labour leadership, has threatened to sue Caroline Flint, a former parliamentary colleague, for saying that Thornberry once described leave voters as \u201cstupid\u201d. Thornberry said she was involving lawyers because Flint, who lost her seat in the election, refused to retract what she told Sky News yesterday alleging Thornberry had once told a colleague: \u201cI\u2019m glad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours.\u201d Thornberry says this is a lie. At the No 10 lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman also declined an opportunity to contest today\u2019s Times splash that says the government is going to review the way the Ministry of Defence spends billions on procurement. Asked about the story, the spokesman said the government was committed to a wide-ranging review of foreign and defence policy. He said: As the PM announced during the election campaign, the government will undertake a new integrated foreign policy, security and defence review which will extend from the armed forces to the intelligence services, counter-terrorism, serious organised crime, diplomacy and development. This will ensure we are making the best use of spending to ensure all our security forces are ahead of hostile powers, terrorists and organised crime. The Times story points out that Dominic Cummings, who has resumed his role in No 10 as Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior adviser, has described current MoD procurement as a farce. In its story (paywall) it says: In a post published in March, before he joined the government, the former Vote Leave campaign director hit out at the programme to build the carriers, the second of which was commissioned last week. Calling the scheme a \u2018farce\u2019, he added that it \u2018has continued to squander billions of pounds, enriching some of the worst corporate looters and corrupting public life via the revolving door of officials/lobbyists\u2019. Scrutiny by MPs had been \u2018contemptible\u2019, he said, adding that the vessels \u2018cannot be sent to a serious war against a serious enemy\u2019. I\u2019m just back from the No 10 lobby briefing. It went on for quite a while, but it was not hugely illuminating. We certainly did not come away with any great new insights into the agenda of the new government. Here are the main points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that the government would \u201cstart the process\u201d of passing the Brexit withdrawal agreement bill before Christmas. It is understood that No 10 wants to hold the second reading debate on Friday, after the Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday. But it would be unusual to hold a second reading debate a day after the Queen\u2019s speech, and it is not clear yet whether the Speaker would approve this. The spokesman said Boris Johnson had now approved the intelligence and security committee\u2019s report in Russian involvement in British politics for publication. This is the report that Johnson refused to publish before the election, prompting speculation that he was suppressing it because it would be embarrassing to the Conservatives. This means the ISC is now free to publish it. But the ISC does not currently exist, because a new ISC has to be appointed when the new parliament meets, and so the report is not expected to appear until a new ISC is formed at some point in the new year. The spokesman declined to say exactly when the PM decided the report was fit for publication. The spokesman confirmed that the government would review whether non-payment of the TV licence fee should be decriminalised. The spokesman refused to say whether the withdrawal agreement bill due to be published this week would be exactly the same as the one given a second reading by MPs before the election. Asked about this, the spokesman said: You will have to wait for it to be published but it will reflect the agreement that we made with the EU on our withdrawal. The spokesman said the government would be aiming for \u201ca Canada-style free trade agreement with no political alignment\u201d in its talks with the EU on a post-Brexit trade deal. But he refused to say any more about the government\u2019s strategy in those talks. The spokesman refused to confirm that a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period was still a possibility. Asked to confirm that this was a logical possibility if the UK and the EU failed to reach an agreement by the end of next year, the spokesman just said that it was in the interests of both the UK and the EU to get a Canada-style trade deal. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, has also given an interview to the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire. In it, he partly toned down his criticism of the BBC. He said that he was not blaming it for Labour\u2019s defeat. And he said that he treasured it. But he repeated his claim that some of its coverage was slanted against Labour. He said: I\u2019m suggesting that we treasure our public service broadcaster, the BBC, and in my opinion they have trespassed with regularity during the course of this campaign into an area that they should not trespass into. We\u2019ve had endless examples from the political correspondents of the BBC that we find very difficult to accept. Derbyshire said McDonald\u2019s use of the word \u201cconsciously\u201d on the Today programme this morning (see 9.48am) implied he thought BBC reporters were deliberately slanting coverage to increase the chances of a Conservative victory. McDonald replied: Well, when your senior political correspondent opines about the postal ballots, and says that the postal ballots are not looking good for Labour \u2013 we don\u2019t look at postal ballots \u2013 how on earth could that opinion be expressed? And why is an interpretation on what is blind at that time being interpreted as not looking good for Labour? Why is it that stories sent from Tory HQ are received by the BBC and turned into a factual story when the reality is that the Labour political activist did not punch a political adviser to Matt Hancock? Yet that was put out on the airwaves. McDonald said Labour would be reviewing what went wrong with its campaign, and he said he hoped the BBC would review its coverage too. In my view [the BBC has] been used and abused, and if we are not careful the rampant Tory party will dispense with the BBC, and sadly those who are currently in charge of it have nobody to blame for themselves. But I treasure the BBC. It\u2019s a bastion. And it\u2019s really, really important that we hold our public service broadcaster close and make sure that it is not undermined. I\u2019m afraid the way people have gone about their business during this election does not fill me with confidence. I\u2019m not saying for one minute that the BBC have caused the defeat. They didn\u2019t. But I do want us to have some reflection about this important part of our society. The Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds has criticised his colleague Andy McDonald for part-blaming the BBC for their party\u2019s defeat. (See 9.48am.) According to the Press Association, Sajid Javid, the chancellor, declared: \u201cWelcome to the people\u2019s government,\u201d as he left 11 Downing Street this morning. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, told the Today programme this morning that he thought the BBC was partly to blame for Labour\u2019s defeat at the election. In an interview with Justin Webb, McDonald said: Don\u2019t get me started on the media, Justin. I\u2019m very worried about our public service broadcaster. When Webb asked him if he was blaming the BBC for the fact that Jeremy Corbyn did not win, McDonald replied: I am saying that they played a part. I\u2019m really worried about the drift. You\u2019ve seen the catalogue of criticisms that we\u2019re making. We\u2019ve accepted that the print media are rained against us, but my goodness me. I\u2019m going to look at us. We\u2019re the important part here. We got this wrong, but if the BBC are going to hold themselves out as somehow having conducted themselves in an impartial manner, I think they\u2019ve really got to have a look in the mirror. We\u2019ve got a lot to say about this. Asked if he was saying the BBC \u201cconsciously\u201d played a part in slanting coverage against Labour, McDonald replied: Consciously, yes. When you have a BBC presenter standing in front of a television camera saying \u2018and Boris Johnson is on his way to a richly-deserved victory\u2019. McDonald seemed to be referring to the BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth, who during one live broadcast referred to Boris Johnson winning \u201cthe majority that he so deserves.\u201d From the context it seemed obvious to many that she meant to say \u201cthe majority he so desires\u201d. Webb put it to McDonald that this was just \u201ca slip of the tongue\u201d and that it was \u201cmadness\u201d to read too much into it. McDonald replied: How many slips of the tongue are we going to make until you accept it? As my colleagues Matthew Taylor and Jim Waterson report, the BBC is also under pressure at the moment from the government, with No 10 seriously considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, while boycotting Radio 4\u2019s Today programme over the broadcaster\u2019s supposed anti-Tory bias. Good morning. Or at least it is for newly-elected members of parliament, most of whom, of course, are Conservative. There are 109 new Tory MPs, and they have started arriving at Westminster already. The Commons is not sitting today \u2013 it does not commence formally until 2.30pm tomorrow, when MPs will assemble in the chamber to re-elect the Speaker - but MPs are coming to parliament to start the business of settling in. Here are tweets from three newly-elected Tories. From Christian Wakeford, MP for Bury South: From Aaron Bell, MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme: From Jonathan Gullis, MP for Stoke-on-Trent North: Journalists are going to have to spend the next few months getting to know the new intake of MPs, because for most of us they are something of an unknown quantity. CCHQ may be keen to learn a bit more about them too. One consequence of a surprise election victory is that it results in people who were never expected to win getting into parliament. It remains to be seen whether the new Tories, particularly those elected to represent previously safe Labour seats, will end up behaving, culturally and politically, in similar ways to conventional Conservative MPs, or whether they will be noticeably different, pushing the party in a new direction. Boris Johnson reportedly wants the party to change. According to the Sunday Times (paywall), after the exit poll was announced on Thursday night he told his team: We can\u2019t go back to being the Tory party of the old days ... This is a totally different party and we\u2019ve got to make sure everyone realises that. One of the big questions in politics over the next parliament will be whether or not Johnson does transform his party in the way he is proposing. And as new Conservative MPs arrive at Westminster, Labour MPs are preoccupied with the inquest into their defeat, and the forthcoming leadership contest. Here is the agenda for the day: 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. Early evening: Boris Johnson is due to address Tory MPs at a reception in Westminster. At some point today we are also due to get announcements from No 10 about who is being appointed to the two vacant cabinet posts \u2013 culture secretary (because Nicky Morgan stood down at the election) and Welsh secretary (because Alun Cairns \u201cresigned\u201d in the early stages of the election campaign over what he knew about the role of a former aide in sabotaging a rape trial). As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Our man Ed Aarons was at Selhurst Park tonight. Here\u2019s his take. Click and enjoy. Thanks for reading this MBM! And now a word with Brighton scorer Neal Maupay. \u201cWe should have won the game. We played better than them. We had chances, we put pressure on them, they were struggling. They scored a nice goal, though. But it\u2019s a bit disappointing to just have one point tonight. I know it means a lot to the fans, and to me as well. I was happy to score but unfortunately it was not enough. We had possession, a lot of chances, a lot of movement. It is enjoyable to play like that.\u201d Wilfried Zaha, Palace\u2019s goalscoring hero, speaks to Sky. \u201cToday\u2019s obviously a big game, and I\u2019m just glad we got back in it. If you can\u2019t win it, don\u2019t lose it. So I\u2019m glad we managed to get a point at least. I was glad I managed to get the goal for the team, because we worked so hard. We\u2019ve got a good run going, and I\u2019m glad we can carry it on. We barely had the ball, props to them, they did their job. I felt like we deserved a point.\u201d The draw means Palace pass up the chance to join Manchester United and Sheffield United on 25 points. They\u2019re now ninth, with 23, one place above Arsenal. Brighton sit in 13th, on 20 points, one ahead of Bournemouth and West Ham United. They\u2019ll head home, back down the M23, thinking they should have really won by a couple of goals, a result that would have taken them into the top half above the aforementioned Arsenal. But this is where we all are. There\u2019s just enough time for Zaha to send an effort towards the bottom left from the edge of the box. Ryan claims, and that\u2019s that. The M23 derby ends all square, after a game not so much of two halves, but of seven and two ninths. Brighton were dominant for 70 minutes, Palace awful. But the hosts rallied in the latter stages, and tied it all up with a sensational goal. They\u2019ll be the happier of the two sides, given the overall balance of play. But that\u2019s derby football for you. 90 min +3: Tomkins is down with cramp. Palace have done a lot of defending this evening. 90 min +2: Some space for Montoya on the right. He clips into the box. Maupay sends an overhead kick inches wide of the top left. 90 min +1: From the corner, Tomkins sends a lame header off target. Bernardo comes on for Gross. 90 min: Zaha tricks his way past Webster on the left and tees up Meyer, who looks to have been brought down by Burn to the left of the D. But there\u2019s to be no free kick. There will, however, be three added minutes, and a corner for Palace in the first of them, the result of another Zaha probe. 89 min: Mooy tries to release Gross down the left, but the pass is too weighty. Goal kick. A sense now that Brighton, in total command for so long, just want to hear the final whistle. 87 min: Zaha sashays in from the left and sends a long pass across the pitch towards Kelly, who takes a touch and enters the box. It\u2019s a rare old chance, but Kelly, who has never scored in the Premier League, suffers a nosebleed and lashes horribly high and wide. 86 min: Propper is booked for a cynical nudge on Zaha, as the Palace goalscorer was looking to make off down the left. 85 min: Mooy hovers over a shooting opportunity from the edge of the Palace box, but Meyer challenges him at the last. The tension at Selhurst is palpable. 84 min: Brighton make a conservative double switch. Off go Trossard and Bissouma, on come Alzate and Duffy. 83 min: Montoya skips down the right and is hauled over by Zaha. A free kick and an opportunity to swing one into the box. Gross takes. It\u2019s a lovely delivery, and headed over by Dunk from the edge of the six-yard box. He was trying to guide the ball into the top left; he should have got something on target. 81 min: Ayew channels his inner Maradona and dribbles down the middle of the park, Brighton backtracking in a panic. He tries a curler towards the top right, but it\u2019s always going over. Where on earth was this Crystal Palace for the first 70 minutes? 79 min: Palace are up for this now. McCarthy goes over in the box, with Dunk at his back. The referee\u2019s not interested in giving a penalty for that one, either, though again there looked to be contact. 78 min: That\u2019s woken Selhurst up. Brighton try to respond quickly, Maupay and Mooy combining down the right, briefly opening Palace up. Mooy crosses, but to nobody in particular. This had been coming, with Brighton suddenly sitting back. And they\u2019ve been made to pay for their profligacy by Zaha, who drops a shoulder to cut in from the left, takes a touch back the other way, and whips an unstoppable effort into the top left! Brighton will wonder about this scoreline long and hard, given their dominance for most of the match. But here we are! 74 min: Yep, they\u2019ve finally risen from their slumber, an hour and ten minutes in to the match. Now Ayew races with purpose towards the Brighton box and slips a pass to Benteke on the edge of the area. Benteke can\u2019t get a shot away. Zaha tries to keep things going, coming in from the left, then McCarthy tries an overhead kick from the middle of a muddle. Ryan claims. 73 min: Hold on! Make that two. Benteke tussles with Dunk, spinning his man down the inside-right channel and slapping a shot towards the bottom right. That\u2019s a highly decent effort, and one tipped round the post by Ryan. Nothing comes of the corner, but that\u2019s so much better from Palace, who appear to have finally woken up. 72 min: That was Palace\u2019s first effort on target. Brighton have had ten. 71 min: Palace hoick one hopefully into the Brighton mixer. Benteke wins a header well, but he\u2019s too far out to seriously trouble Ryan, who claims easily. 70 min: Mooy strides into a huge hole in the midfield. Palace look knackered. Mooy slips the ball wide left for Trossard, who takes a touch inside and fizzes a low shot towards goal. Guaita claims, eventually, after nearly spilling the ball at the feet of Montoya. It would have been a tap-in from a couple of yards. 68 min: A Dann headed clearance is latched onto by Mooy, who very nearly releases Maupay into the box with a first-time pass. But the ball clips Maupay\u2019s heel, and Palace escape. The hosts go up the other end, Zaha dribbling in from the left, only to have the ball taken from him by Montoya\u2019s slide tackle. The resulting corner is a non-event, but that was much better from Palace, the new man Meyer injecting a bit of much-needed energy as he sent Zaha on his way. 66 min: Milivojevic winds Propper with a good old-fashioned barge. While the Brighton midfielder catches his breath, Palace swap Kouyate for Meyer. 64 min: Bissouma big-legs into a lot of space down the middle of the park. He whistles a daisycutter towards the bottom left from the best part of 30 yards. Guaita isn\u2019t going to be beaten from there. 63 min: Zaha curls a cross into the Brighton box from the left. Benteke competes but doesn\u2019t get any purchase on his header. Brighton clear in the insouciant style. A little better from the hosts. Not much better, admittedly, but small acorns and all that. 62 min: A short one this time, and Trossard drops a shoulder to skedaddle into the box along the byline. He can\u2019t find a team-mate from a promising position, a sorry end to a clever run. 61 min: Brighton\u2019s corner isn\u2019t all that, but Palace fail dismally to clear it anyway. Mooy and Gross combine down the left, the latter earning another corner. 60 min: Gross is clattered by Tomkins out on the left. A free kick, and a change for Brighton to load the box. Gross takes himself, and swings in a dangerous one into the mixer. Tomkins does pretty well to eyebrow out for a corner, with three Brighton players in attendance. 58 min: Palace are giving the ball away with metronomic regularity. A half-arsed Dann clearance flies straight to Propper, whose attempt to release Mooy down the right is deflected out for a corner. From the set piece, Propper spins on the penalty spot and loops a strange effort towards the top left. It should be easy pickings for Guaita, but the keeper drops it onto the crossbar and into the six-yard box. Maupay is lurking, but can\u2019t get a shot away and the keeper eventually smothers. 56 min: A deserved lead for Brighton. Palace can have no complaints. It\u2019s been all Brighton since the restart, just as it was in the first half, that strange Benteke cross-cum-shot apart. It\u2019s fair to say this had been coming. Trossard is found in acres of space down the right by a glorious Bissouma crossfield pass. Trossard cushions a first-time pass inside for Maupay, who takes a touch on the penalty spot and lashes a shot into the top right. What a beautiful goal that was. 53 min: Mooy bustles in from the left. He slips the ball wide right to Montoya, who is in acres, and should probably do better than clanging a cross off the nearest Palace player and out for a corner. The resulting set piece comes to nothing. 51 min: So having said that, Palace come close to opening the scoring! Benteke strides down the right and hooks in a vicious cross that deceives Ryan and nearly nestles in the top left, slamming off the left-hand post instead and away from danger! Not sure whether he meant that or not. If he did, hats off. It would have been some way to end his Selhurst Park drought, one that stretches back to April 2018. 49 min: Palace\u2019s passing game is shot. Ayew clips a simple ball out of play under no pressure whatsoever. They\u2019re still having trouble getting out of their own half. 47 min: Montoya makes off down the right and crosses deep. Trossard pulls the ball back from the other side. Kouyate chests down and clears. Brighton want a penalty for handball, but they\u2019re never getting it. Not sure why they went so vocal for that one, yet didn\u2019t make a sound when Riedewald clipped Montoya in the first half. People are strange. Here we go again! Palace get the second half underway. They need to get their gamefaces on, and quick. Brighton enjoyed 68 percent possession in the first half. Palace haven\u2019t had an attempt at goal yet. They\u2019ve made one change: midfielder James McCarthy on for left back Jairo Riedewald. It looks as though James McArthur will stand in at left back. Half-time entertainment. Does the Fiver count as entertainment? Probably not. Here it is anyway. An easy claim for Guaita, and that\u2019s your lot for the first half. Brighton have been dominant, and should have had a penalty, but they\u2019ll be happy enough with an impressive performance that lacks only a cutting edge. Palace need a rethink. Over to you, Roy. 45 min: Ping, ping, pass, pass, pass, ping, pass, pass, passity, pass. Eventually Trossard strides down the left and purchases a cheap corner off Kelly. A chance to load the box in the one minute that\u2019ll be added to this half. 43 min: Tomkins launches long down the right. Benteke\u2019s not there. He can\u2019t be bothered to make the run. That sums up Palace, who have been utterly bereft of attacking nous so far this evening. 41 min: It\u2019s all Brighton. Just lacking the big idea. For a goalless game, this is absurdly lop-sided. Palace really need to hear the half-time whistle. 39 min: Gross sends Trossard into a bit of space down the left. Trossard drops a shoulder to cut inside, then fizzes an inviting ball across the face of the Palace box. Montoya, coming in from the other flank, can\u2019t control or get a shot away. Brighton are well on top. 37 min: Palace are unable to get out of their own box right now. Brighton are running rings around them in the final third. But no killer final pass yet, so here we are, the game still goalless. The visitors much the better side though. 35 min: But the first booking of the game isn\u2019t long in coming, as Benteke sticks out a clumsy arm and slaps Dunk in his startled boat. 34 min: Mooy slips Bissouma in down the right. The cutback is half-cleared by Dann. Propper has a belt from 25 yards. He catches it well, but that\u2019s straight at Guaita. At the start of the move, Gross was whacked late by Kouyate. The referee waved play on, and the Palace man is fortunate not to go into the book when the game finally stops. 33 min: With Brighton dominating possession, Selhurst has fallen uncharacteristically quiet. The away fans take the opportunity to belt out a couple of stanzas of Is This A Library? It\u2019s still raining. 31 min: Trossard exchanges crisp passes with Gross down the left, and zips into space. His cross is deflected and nearly catches out Guaita at his near post, but again the keeper does well with a testing ball, adjusting and claiming in the fuss-free fashion. 29 min: A bit of space for Bissouma down the inside right. He lashes a fierce shot towards the bottom right from a very ambitious range. It nevertheless tests Guaita, who does well to gather without fuss as the ball skids across the wet turf. 28 min: A lovely spin by Ayew, turning out of trouble and throwing three Brighton players off the scent. It\u2019s on the halfway line, and the move breaks down the second he gives the ball to Benteke, but that piece of skill gave the home fans something to cheer. They\u2019ve not had too much opportunity so far. 26 min: Brighton are beginning to dominate this. They\u2019re first to every loose ball, and the only team capable of stringing a few passes together right now. Propper, Mooy, Bissouma and Montoya are linking together nicely. On the touchline, Roy Hodgson looks a little concerned, and well he might. 24 min: Brighton are encouraged by all that, though. They ping it around nicely. Then Mooy burns down the right and cuts one back for Propper, who lashes wildly over the bar from the edge of the D. 22 min: VAR says no penalty. There\u2019s no point asking why, they\u2019re just making it up on the hoof. Has someone kept the receipt? Let\u2019s go back to good old analogue football, none of this digital nonsense. Anyway, the resulting corner leads to Dunk sending a header, intended for the top right, straight into Guaita\u2019s arms. 20 min: Propper slides a lovely pass down the inside right channel. Montoya cuts in. Riedewald sticks out a leg and catches Montoya, who falls over but threads a shot towards the bottom right at the same time. Guaita tips the ball round the post for a corner. Montoya doesn\u2019t claim a penalty, but he really should. VAR will take a look. 19 min: Zaha turns on the jets and scoots down the left, Montoya very much on the back foot. He exchanges passes with McArthur, who just about executes an overly ambitious backheel, then loops a tame cross down Ryan\u2019s throat. 17 min: Montoya drives down the right and feeds Mooy, who is sent into a lot of space and should do better than battering his cross straight into Dann. 16 min: Propper clatters into Zaha, seconds after McArthur bundled Bissouma to the floor. The referee waves play on both times, and that\u2019s wound the crowd, already lively, up a little further. 14 min: Palace batter it long. Benteke cushions a header down for Ayew, who nearly sets Kouyate clear down the inside-right channel. But his pass is too strong and Webster is able to intercept. 12 min: Bissouma has a little nibble at Zaha\u2019s heel. Zaha falls, and bounces straight back up. As he rises, he has a cheeky little swing back at Bissouma\u2019s heel. Bissouma goes over but doesn\u2019t make anything of it. Still, there\u2019s a battle that might be worth keeping an eye on. 10 min: It\u2019s teeming down at Selhurst, but nothing puts a dampener on the fans, who are giving it plenty from all four corners of the atmospheric old stadium. A beautiful noise. Then a huge sarcastic cheer as Ryan, attempting to play out from the back, hoicks a simple pass into the stand. Hey, you\u2019ve got to make your own entertainment sometimes. Not a great deal going on right now. 8 min: Palace finally enjoy a little period of possession. Riedewald probes down the left, Ayew goes on a mission down the right. Eventually the ball\u2019s switched back to Zaha, who in attempting his first dribble of the evening, runs the ball out of play for a goal kick. It\u2019s not much, but that\u2019s better from the hosts. 6 min: Dunk slides a fine pass down the middle of the field, taking out half of the Palace team at a stroke and sending Mooy scampering goalwards. Mooy whistles a rising shot wide left. Not too far away from the top corner, that one. Brighton will be happy with the way they\u2019ve taken control after that hectic opening. 5 min: Brighton look the more composed in these early stages. Palace can\u2019t keep hold of the ball at all. Gross wins a corner down the left and takes it himself. He goes long, and Guaita heads clear. Burn knocks the ball back into the mixer; Kelly heads that one away. 3 min: Brighton calm themselves down a little, and put the first move of the match together. Mooy sets Montoya away on a dribble down the right. Montoya nearly gets past a dithering Riedewald, but the stand-in left back does just enough to eventually intercept and clear. 2 min: Everyone snapping into tackles. Time on the ball a pipe dream. It\u2019s frantic early doors. And we\u2019re off! Brighton get the ball rolling. Incidentally, this isn\u2019t just Roy Hodgson\u2019s 100th game in charge of Palace; it\u2019s the 100th match between these two rivals. For the record, the history is in Albion\u2019s favour: they\u2019ve racked up 39 wins compared to Palace\u2019s 35, with 25 draws. The teams are out! There\u2019s always a great atmosphere at Selhurst Park. But this is the derby, and an evening kick-off, so everyone, whether Eagle or Seagull, has had the opportunity to lubricate their lungs with a pre-match swallow. So, well, you can just imagine. A thundering sense of occasion! Palace will play in their red and blue stripes, while Brighton wear second-choice black. We\u2019ll be off before you know it. Graham Potter talks to Sky Sports. \u201cIt\u2019s same as normal, in how we attack and defend. But at the same time, we know it\u2019s a derby game, we know the rivalry, we know the importance of it for both sets of supporters. So it\u2019s about playing with the head, making good decisions and being brave.\u201d Roy\u2019s response. \u201cThis is what they regard as one of their most important derbies, or the most important derby. So that of course plays a part. But it can\u2019t affect you as a player or you as a coach in terms of preparation. But I can assure everybody that everyone is fully aware of their responsibility and fully aware of what this game means to people. That\u2019s what derbies are about, that\u2019s what these sort of matches should be bringing to the table, and we hope the fans can support their team in the right way.\u201d It\u2019s Roy Hodgson\u2019s 100th game in charge of Palace. He makes three changes to the XI that drew 0-0 with Watford. Christian Benteke starts for the first time in four months up front, while at the back Scott Dann and Jairo Riedewald get the call. Jeffrey Schlupp, Gary Cahill and Andros Townsend, all injured, are the three who miss out. It\u2019s also Graham Potter\u2019s first derby as Brighton boss. He makes two changes to the XI named for the 2-2 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Dale Stephens is suspended, so Yves Bissouma comes into midfield, while at right back Martin Montoya replaces Steven Alzate. Crystal Palace: Guaita, Kelly, Tomkins, Dann, Riedewald, Kouyate, Milivojevic, McArthur, Ayew, Benteke, Zaha. Subs: Meyer, Hennessey, Wickham, McCarthy, Victor Camarasa, Woods, Mitchell. Brighton &amp; Hove Albion: Ryan, Montoya, Webster, Dunk, Burn, Propper, Bissouma, Mooy, Gross, Maupay, Trossard. Subs: Duffy, Jahanbakhsh, Murray, Schelotto, Button, Bernardo, Alzate. Referee: Craig Pawson (South Yorkshire). The M23. A high-speed vehicular highway in the United Kingdom opened in 1974 that runs north to south from the Surrey village of Hooley to Pease Pottage in West Sussex, with a spur at junction nine for Gatwick Airport. There are more lyrical and romantic names for a football derby, if we\u2019re being honest with ourselves. Still, what a rivalry! Crystal Palace and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion have met on an irregular basis since their Southern League days in the early 20th century, though they only started truly locking horns in the 1970s, Malcolm Allison, Peter Taylor, Terry Venables, Alan Mullery, all that. There\u2019s no love lost. Brighton won this fixture last season. You may recall Anthony Knockaert\u2019s sensational winner, one that went a long way to keeping the Albion in the Premier League, or perhaps the preamble to the MBM, which looks strangely familiar. So will the result be equally identical? Brighton will be confident, having beaten Arsenal on their last visit to London a couple of weeks ago. Palace however haven\u2019t conceded a goal since Liverpool came to town four matches ago, and could join the Uniteds of Manchester and Sheffield on 25 points, four shy of the Champions League places, if they beat their arch enemies tonight. It\u2019s a big one. It\u2019s the M23 derby. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 7.45pm GMT.",

And they do: we\u2019ve had at least 60 of these in the last century. As an investigation begins into Whakaari, and whether or not its risk was measured properly, it\u2019ll become part of a wider question that New Zealand is constantly grappling with: how to approach the dangerous bits of this country? None of this lessens the pain of Whakaari\u2019s victims and their families, and the scale of the tragedy.

      "bodyText": "When I was growing up in the 1960s, December marked the onset of winter with regular falls of snow, even in the London suburbs. But recent Decembers have bucked the historical trend, being mild and wet, and none more so than December 2015. Indeed, this was not just the wettest December, but the wettest month ever recorded across the UK, with close to twice as much rain as the long-term average. This was largely due to the arrival of three Atlantic storms from the west: Desmond, Eva and Frank. These contributed to an average rainfall across the UK of 230mm (a shade over 9in), beating the previous monthly high set in November 2009. The prevailing south-westerly airstream also made December 2015 the warmest December on record, with highs of over 17C (63F) in Gravesend, Kent, warmer than Athens and Lisbon. In Dorset, holidaymakers took advantage of the unusually warm weather to bathe in the sea. More ominously, a record night-time temperature of 14.2C (58F) was logged in Devon.

The European triathlon champion, who won her 30-34 age category in June and then finished fifth overall when racing against men at the London triathlon in July, smiles in her wheelchair. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/50119011\" title=\"\">Claire has been </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/50119011\" title=\"\">paralysed</a> from the waist down since her bike was hit by a tractor while she was training on 28 August.</p> <p>She will never walk again and yet, as the remarkable 30-year-old explains, this is not her most difficult challenge. She is being tested in all kinds of ways \u2013 from basic bodily functions to psychological adversity. Claire looks up with clear eyes as complex emotions flicker across her face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still happy,\u201d she says gently. \u201cBut I find being on my own the hardest. Your brain starts to think. Before <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B32hWooBMkS/?igshid=1eueccfyuebzq\" title=\"\">the accident</a> I used to be busy all the time and I didn\u2019t have much time for thinking. Now there are times where you\u2019re lying in bed or just waiting for help. Late at night, when the hospital is quiet and dark, is the toughest time.\u201d</p> <p>A Monday afternoon is different. Claire is with me and, more importantly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/28/alex-danson-team-gb-hockey-olympic-gold-rio-2016\" title=\"\">her sister Alex</a>, who won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/19/gb-women-hockey-historic-gold-shootout-final-olympics\" title=\"\">Olympic gold</a> with the GB women\u2019s hockey team in 2016. Two years later, in September 2018, Alex suffered a freak head injury that caused mild brain trauma and meant she could not cope with bright light or noise for over nine months. She was on holiday with her boyfriend, now her husband, and she threw back her head and laughed when he told her a joke. She hit her head against a brick wall and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/hockey/48340084\" title=\"\">the damage became evident</a> as the days, weeks and months passed. The 34-year-old Alex is still recovering but she is hopeful of returning to the GB hockey squad, which she captains, next month.</p> <p>Claire helped look after her big sister when Alex was confined to bed, in a darkened room, for months. Now, after Claire\u2019s accident, Alex spends as much time as she can at her sister\u2019s side.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I waved bye to mum. Then I turned a corner, saw a vehicle, and that was it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It feels raw when I arrive early at the spinal unit, not having met Claire before, and I wonder how she must feel at the prospect of talking about her changed life. I am only due to meet Alex in half an hour but it does not take long for word to reach Claire that I am in reception. It says much about her character that she wheels her way down the corridor to find me. I like her immediately and it seems natural to ask about the 10km wheelchair race she completed around Dorney Lake, near Windsor, nine days earlier \u2013 just 12 weeks after doctors warned that she might not live. From extreme gravity to the joy of her first race in a wheelchair sums up Claire\u2019s resilience and ambition to find a new life.</p> <p>When the three of us talk later in the garden, Claire pulls an amused face when I ask if she gave herself a metaphorical pat on the back after whizzing around Dorney Lake, with the help of friends who pushed her. \u201cMy reaction was \u2018I wish I could have done more myself\u2019 or \u2018I wish I could\u2019ve been quicker,\u2019\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I\u2019m wired and will suit me in this new situation. When I achieve things I feel good but then I\u2019m automatically telling myself: \u2018OK, but what\u2019s next?\u2019 I suppose I could say: \u2018Yeah, that was really good.\u2019 But I\u2019m not really like that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6288b857a7a108ed1919d20624e542713fa49c78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6288b857a7a108ed1919d20624e542713fa49c78/164_245_1810_2262/800.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Danson says she still \u2018has to do sport\u2019 despite her accident.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Danson says she still \u2018has to do sport\u2019 despite her accident.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Danson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Claire still sounds like an athlete. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else to do, to get better. I\u2019m lucky. It would be really easy in this situation to give up if you didn\u2019t have that motivation. But that\u2019s ingrained in me as an athlete. It\u2019s a big asset now.\u201d</p> <p>Alex speaks about her own injury and her sister with spellbinding eloquence. She encourages me to be totally open and so I ask Claire if it would be all right to explain what happened on the day she was paralysed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Claire says lightly. \u201cIt was around 11 o\u2019clock. I\u2019d swum with my friend that morning and come home. It was my normal day. I\u2019d had a coffee. Then I said bye to mum and told her where I was riding, as she always asked. I waved goodbye to mum and started to ride. I remember taking a route I\u2019ve done hundreds of times before. I went around this corner, seeing a vehicle, and that was it. And then I remember saying \u2018Stuart\u2019 a lot. He was first on the scene.\u201d</p> <p>For Alex, \u201cIt was an incredible coincidence: he was our family friend. Stuart is a retired anaesthetist and the doctors think he saved Claire\u2019s life because he was very calm. He cancelled the ambulance and called the air ambulance because he understood the seriousness. When the hospital heard he was a retired anaesthetist they didn\u2019t question it. They got an air ambulance to Claire in six minutes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/15/eliud-kipchoge-bbc-overseas-sports-personality\">Eliud Kipchoge: \u2018Mo Farah did not fail in the marathon. I respect him\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stuart\u2019s daughter was Claire\u2019s best friend and Alex shakes her head in wonder. \u201cClaire was in a very rural part of Hampshire, where my family live, and it was a miracle he decided to take that route into the village.\u201d</p> <p>Claire must have been in terrible pain as her spinal cord has been completely severed, causing instant paralysis, and she had fractured all the bones in her neck, broken every one of her ribs, both wrists and shoulders, as well as suffering two punctured lungs. \u201cThe brain has a way of blocking out that kind of thing,\u201d Claire says. \u201cI remember going to the trauma department and I was conscious all through it.\u201d</p> <p>Alex was at home that day. \u201cI\u2019d been recovering at home for months and it was then that my brother called my husband,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe said: \u2018You need to get to hospital quickly. Claire\u2019s been in a terrible accident.\u2019 My husband and I got to the hospital before Claire. I\u2019ve never seen so many doctors so we knew Claire was in a very bad way. She was conscious and no one could understand it because her injuries were so significant. They said pain alone should have knocked her out. They said she only survived because she was so fit. After the London triathlon she was in the best condition she\u2019s ever been in. They let us speak to her very briefly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"334e8a3c117741801f43e1933db8444c20b3204f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334e8a3c117741801f43e1933db8444c20b3204f/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Danson (centre) and her Great Britain teammtes celebrate after Hollie Webb scores the winning goal in the shootout in the 2016 Rio Olympics hockey final which secured Great Britain\u2019s first women\u2019s hockey gold medal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Danson (centre) and her teammates celebrate after Hollie Webb scores the winning goal in the shootout at the 2016 Rio Olympics hockey final which secured Great Britain\u2019s first women\u2019s hockey gold medal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alex looks at her little sister. \u201cYou were looking awful \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Claire says.</p> <p>\u201cYou said a few words. Most of it was sorry. We were like: \u2018Don\u2019t be silly, you\u2019ll be absolutely fine.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Alex looks at me. \u201cClaire knew straight away. She spoke before she was put on to the ventilator and said: \u2018Alex I\u2019m paralysed.\u2019 She was very poorly and could hardly breathe and I just remember saying: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re still here. Stay with us, stay strong.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Claire\u2019s family were made to understand her life was in the balance. \u201cThe NHS are amazing but quite brutal as well,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWe were told very early she might not survive. They were very honest. Almost too honest. They said the family should stay close by that night. We were very scared.</p> <p>\u201cClaire was on incredibly high drugs which are dissociative. So while you know you\u2019re paralysed it\u2019s almost as though you are having this out-of-body experience. But it was still absolutely horrific for Claire. The one moment in hospital that nearly broke us was when we were round her bed with the consultant. Claire is very intelligent. She knew what was going on even though she was in and out of the [induced] coma and ventilated. The consultant said: \u2018You\u2019re going to have back surgery, then we are going to try and save that right arm. You\u2019ve got a T9 [vertebrae] complete sever and you\u2019ve broken every bone in your neck so we might have to operate on that too.\u2019 Claire started getting agitated.</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018Claire, do you want to say something?\u2019 She nodded. So she held my hand and we went through the alphabet. I would say A, B, C and she squeezed my hand when I got to the first letter in a word. You can imagine how slow the process is. Claire spelt out: \u2018I don\u2019t care when, want best surgeon.\u2019 I kept thinking: \u2018God, this is awkward.\u2019 But the consultant said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Claire, he will do the absolute best job.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Claire still insisted on getting Alex to check with her friend\u2019s mother, Sophie Wallace, an orthopaedic surgeon, that she would be operated on by the right person. \u201cBear in mind it took about 30 minutes for Claire to spell out a sentence,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThe consultant couldn\u2019t believe how sound of mind Claire was given her horrendous injuries. She then spelled out \u2013 and this got us all \u2013 \u2018para athlete\u2019. The consultant said: \u2018Claire, do you want me to check with Sophie Wallace that our surgeon is good enough because you want to become a para athlete?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Alex pauses when asked to describe her emotions in that moment. \u201cI melted inside. It\u2019s the mark of who Claire is. I can\u2019t fathom, whilst you\u2019re in that pain and that terrifying situation, how you still consider a hopeful future. Triathlon was Claire\u2019s life and she was fabulous at it. When I was unwell, and lived at my parents for a while, she\u2019d get up at four so she could do her training and be back at eight \u2013 roughly when I\u2019d wake up. She would be with me from eight until two when she\u2019d start working. That sums up Claire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de761e50f33d15f195f4a83be15ab19d1c012ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de761e50f33d15f195f4a83be15ab19d1c012ce2/10_13_944_567/500.jpg\" alt=\"Claire\u2019s Instagram after finishing the 10km wheelchair race.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire\u2019s Instagram after finishing the 10km wheelchair race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram / cdanson10</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I heard those words \u2018para athlete\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018Please give us something, please let this surgeon be good.\u2019 And he was fabulous and the human body is phenomenal. Look at Claire now, and apart from the obvious, you can\u2019t believe she was fighting for her life 12 weeks ago. Claire is such a bubbly, full-of-life human. But this is life-changing, and incredibly difficult for even the strongest person. Her life is looking very different. In another year she\u2019ll be living independently, and doing her thing again. But, at the moment, day-to-day is very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>As a way of coping with the difficulty Claire has been brave and open on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cdanson10/?hl=en\" title=\"\">her Instagram page</a>. She has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5H2AaEBSv9/\" title=\"\">written about the fact that she suffered terrible anxiety</a> before she met many of her friends at a day organised by Alex. The day went well but it was hard for Claire to imagine people seeing her in a wheelchair for the first time. She has also <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B5chmZJhuWO/\" title=\"\">written about the hidden realities of paralysis</a> and that, unable to move the muscles she needs to empty her bladder, she will eventually have to learn either to catheterise herself or have a small hole drilled next to her belly button so she can emit urine when she goes to the toilet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to teach people that there are more difficult things than what we\u2019re facing right now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI knew she was pretty extraordinary,\u201d Alex says of Claire, \u201cbut her posts are so powerful. We put something on her Instagram and overnight she had 15,000 followers supporting her. The obvious thing \u2013 that you can\u2019t walk \u2013 is the easy part in some ways. That\u2019s terrible to say but no one thinks about bowel care or the catheter. Claire was initially unsure about writing it down but she decided it\u2019s important people understand the self-care that accompanies a spinal injury. That\u2019s where I think she will help an enormous amount of people and, in her own way, change the world.\u201d</p> <p>Alex looks at Claire again. \u201cSay the first thing you said to me in the ICU.\u201d</p> <p>Claire smiles. \u201cI said: \u2018I know this is a bit morbid but will you take some photos? I want to document it.\u2019 I\u2019m so weird. But the idea of sharing the photos and emotions is to show that a lot of stuff is relatable. The feelings I face here can relate to 1,001 things in life. We all have struggles and, often, our feelings are the same. I want to teach people that actually there are many more difficult things than the problem we\u2019re facing right now. Sometimes people jump to conclusions about others without actually knowing the struggles they face. All you can do is be kind and do the best you can by everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Claire listens when I say that I admire the way in which her posts do not skirt the darkness of her situation. She <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B4hDGl2B8SX/\" title=\"\">tells people her life does sometimes feel bleak and hard</a>. She writes about her boyfriend who reassures her that nothing has changed \u2013 before she gently reminds him that everything has changed. They have found a way to talk openly, just like Claire addresses the world so honestly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important people don\u2019t just see me and think: \u2018Oh, she\u2019s having a great time,\u2019\u201d Claire says wryly. \u201cYou look at other people on social media and think: \u2018How amazing is their life? I wish I had that.\u2019 Well, you\u2019ve probably seen 1% of their life they\u2019ve chosen to share. I think it\u2019s important to see everything.\u201d</p> <p>Alex nods. \u201cYou\u2019re very good at being honest. We always say we have to talk about it. So if I\u2019m not feeling great, Claire\u2019s the first person I tell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Claire replies, \u201cbecause I want you to tell me. Sometimes people will say to me: \u2018I can\u2019t complain because I\u2019ve only hurt my finger.\u2019 Yeah you can. It\u2019s your biggest issue right now. Of course you can complain.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/13/katarina-johnson-thompson-world-champion-athletics-interview-tokyo-2020\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to be at the Rio Olympics but I\u2019m ready for Tokyo\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for her paralysis, Claire says: \u201cI think you have to accept it. I\u2019m sure some people don\u2019t. But I don\u2019t feel my life is over. So there wasn\u2019t any doubt about para sport. I have to do sport because it\u2019s so important to me and ingrained in our family. I\u2019ve just got to find out how I\u2019m going to do it, and find a way of doing it as well. I guess sport makes you more resilient.\u201d</p> <p>Alex says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet in what sport, but Claire will compete again. She\u2019ll get there, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Claire hopes to leave hospital at the end of January. When I ask her to describe a typical session of rehab she reveals that she made another breakthrough that morning while Alex and I had been chatting over a coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to build my upper body strength. In the session I\u2019ve just had I transferred myself from the physio bed to my chair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Alex exclaims.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I used the aides as I don\u2019t quite have the strength to do it on my own. There\u2019s a board, which you go on to sideways and then you slide down it into the chair, using your hands.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere you on your own?</p> <p>\u201cSarah [a physiotherapist] was there. But she didn\u2019t need to support me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClaire,\u201d Alex says, \u201cthat\u2019s unbelievable!\u201d</p> <p>I ask if she had a feeling of \u201cWow!\u201d when she did it. \u201cYeah, I did. But then I thought: \u2018We needed the board and the slide sheet.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t do three somersaults on the way down,\u201d Alex jokes.</p> <p>\u201cThe next thing will be to get enough lift so I move from the bed to the chair on my own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClaire,\u201d Alex insists, \u201cthis is massive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Claire says, \u201cbut I need to go much further.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d470485e5c1f4500ca0aabf77cc151f41c465fb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d470485e5c1f4500ca0aabf77cc151f41c465fb6/0_0_956_620/500.jpg\" alt=\"Claire\u2019s Instagram post which announced her paralysis.\" width=\"500\" height=\"324\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire\u2019s Instagram post which announced her paralysis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram / cdanson10</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I know she will and so when we talk about the question of identity \u2013 and how she once defined herself as a successful triathlete \u2013 I tell Claire how I see her.

I\u2019m now re-forming as someone who is still the same but with different aims. Maybe they are more important goals in some respects \u2013 because I\u2019m trying to help other people.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI think most of the time I\u2019m still just the same,\u201d Claire Danson says as we sit beneath a cold and darkening sky in the secluded gardens attached to the spinal unit at Salisbury hospital. The European triathlon champion, who won her 30-34 age category in June and then finished fifth overall when racing against men at the London triathlon in July, smiles in her wheelchair. Claire has been paralysed from the waist down since her bike was hit by a tractor while she was training on 28 August. She will never walk again and yet, as the remarkable 30-year-old explains, this is not her most difficult challenge. She is being tested in all kinds of ways \u2013 from basic bodily functions to psychological adversity. Claire looks up with clear eyes as complex emotions flicker across her face. \u201cI\u2019m still happy,\u201d she says gently. \u201cBut I find being on my own the hardest. Your brain starts to think. Before the accident I used to be busy all the time and I didn\u2019t have much time for thinking. Now there are times where you\u2019re lying in bed or just waiting for help. Late at night, when the hospital is quiet and dark, is the toughest time.\u201d A Monday afternoon is different. Claire is with me and, more importantly, her sister Alex, who won Olympic gold with the GB women\u2019s hockey team in 2016. Two years later, in September 2018, Alex suffered a freak head injury that caused mild brain trauma and meant she could not cope with bright light or noise for over nine months. She was on holiday with her boyfriend, now her husband, and she threw back her head and laughed when he told her a joke. She hit her head against a brick wall and the damage became evident as the days, weeks and months passed. The 34-year-old Alex is still recovering but she is hopeful of returning to the GB hockey squad, which she captains, next month. Claire helped look after her big sister when Alex was confined to bed, in a darkened room, for months. Now, after Claire\u2019s accident, Alex spends as much time as she can at her sister\u2019s side. It feels raw when I arrive early at the spinal unit, not having met Claire before, and I wonder how she must feel at the prospect of talking about her changed life. I am only due to meet Alex in half an hour but it does not take long for word to reach Claire that I am in reception. It says much about her character that she wheels her way down the corridor to find me. I like her immediately and it seems natural to ask about the 10km wheelchair race she completed around Dorney Lake, near Windsor, nine days earlier \u2013 just 12 weeks after doctors warned that she might not live. From extreme gravity to the joy of her first race in a wheelchair sums up Claire\u2019s resilience and ambition to find a new life. When the three of us talk later in the garden, Claire pulls an amused face when I ask if she gave herself a metaphorical pat on the back after whizzing around Dorney Lake, with the help of friends who pushed her. \u201cMy reaction was \u2018I wish I could have done more myself\u2019 or \u2018I wish I could\u2019ve been quicker,\u2019\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I\u2019m wired and will suit me in this new situation. When I achieve things I feel good but then I\u2019m automatically telling myself: \u2018OK, but what\u2019s next?\u2019 I suppose I could say: \u2018Yeah, that was really good.\u2019 But I\u2019m not really like that.\u201d Claire still sounds like an athlete. \u201cThere\u2019s always something else to do, to get better. I\u2019m lucky. It would be really easy in this situation to give up if you didn\u2019t have that motivation. But that\u2019s ingrained in me as an athlete. It\u2019s a big asset now.\u201d Alex speaks about her own injury and her sister with spellbinding eloquence. She encourages me to be totally open and so I ask Claire if it would be all right to explain what happened on the day she was paralysed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d Claire says lightly. \u201cIt was around 11 o\u2019clock. I\u2019d swum with my friend that morning and come home. It was my normal day. I\u2019d had a coffee. Then I said bye to mum and told her where I was riding, as she always asked. I waved goodbye to mum and started to ride. I remember taking a route I\u2019ve done hundreds of times before. I went around this corner, seeing a vehicle, and that was it. And then I remember saying \u2018Stuart\u2019 a lot. He was first on the scene.\u201d For Alex, \u201cIt was an incredible coincidence: he was our family friend. Stuart is a retired anaesthetist and the doctors think he saved Claire\u2019s life because he was very calm. He cancelled the ambulance and called the air ambulance because he understood the seriousness. When the hospital heard he was a retired anaesthetist they didn\u2019t question it. They got an air ambulance to Claire in six minutes.\u201d Stuart\u2019s daughter was Claire\u2019s best friend and Alex shakes her head in wonder. \u201cClaire was in a very rural part of Hampshire, where my family live, and it was a miracle he decided to take that route into the village.\u201d Claire must have been in terrible pain as her spinal cord has been completely severed, causing instant paralysis, and she had fractured all the bones in her neck, broken every one of her ribs, both wrists and shoulders, as well as suffering two punctured lungs. \u201cThe brain has a way of blocking out that kind of thing,\u201d Claire says. \u201cI remember going to the trauma department and I was conscious all through it.\u201d Alex was at home that day. \u201cI\u2019d been recovering at home for months and it was then that my brother called my husband,\u201d she remembers. \u201cHe said: \u2018You need to get to hospital quickly. Claire\u2019s been in a terrible accident.\u2019 My husband and I got to the hospital before Claire. I\u2019ve never seen so many doctors so we knew Claire was in a very bad way. She was conscious and no one could understand it because her injuries were so significant. They said pain alone should have knocked her out. They said she only survived because she was so fit. After the London triathlon she was in the best condition she\u2019s ever been in. They let us speak to her very briefly.\u201d Alex looks at her little sister. \u201cYou were looking awful \u2026\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d Claire says. \u201cYou said a few words. Most of it was sorry. We were like: \u2018Don\u2019t be silly, you\u2019ll be absolutely fine.\u2019\u201d Alex looks at me. \u201cClaire knew straight away. She spoke before she was put on to the ventilator and said: \u2018Alex I\u2019m paralysed.\u2019 She was very poorly and could hardly breathe and I just remember saying: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re still here. Stay with us, stay strong.\u2019\u201d Claire\u2019s family were made to understand her life was in the balance. \u201cThe NHS are amazing but quite brutal as well,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWe were told very early she might not survive. They were very honest. Almost too honest. They said the family should stay close by that night. We were very scared. \u201cClaire was on incredibly high drugs which are dissociative. So while you know you\u2019re paralysed it\u2019s almost as though you are having this out-of-body experience. But it was still absolutely horrific for Claire. The one moment in hospital that nearly broke us was when we were round her bed with the consultant. Claire is very intelligent. She knew what was going on even though she was in and out of the [induced] coma and ventilated. The consultant said: \u2018You\u2019re going to have back surgery, then we are going to try and save that right arm. You\u2019ve got a T9 [vertebrae] complete sever and you\u2019ve broken every bone in your neck so we might have to operate on that too.\u2019 Claire started getting agitated. \u201cI said: \u2018Claire, do you want to say something?\u2019 She nodded. So she held my hand and we went through the alphabet. I would say A, B, C and she squeezed my hand when I got to the first letter in a word. You can imagine how slow the process is. Claire spelt out: \u2018I don\u2019t care when, want best surgeon.\u2019 I kept thinking: \u2018God, this is awkward.\u2019 But the consultant said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Claire, he will do the absolute best job.\u2019\u201d Claire still insisted on getting Alex to check with her friend\u2019s mother, Sophie Wallace, an orthopaedic surgeon, that she would be operated on by the right person. \u201cBear in mind it took about 30 minutes for Claire to spell out a sentence,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThe consultant couldn\u2019t believe how sound of mind Claire was given her horrendous injuries. She then spelled out \u2013 and this got us all \u2013 \u2018para athlete\u2019. The consultant said: \u2018Claire, do you want me to check with Sophie Wallace that our surgeon is good enough because you want to become a para athlete?\u2019\u201d Alex pauses when asked to describe her emotions in that moment. \u201cI melted inside. It\u2019s the mark of who Claire is. I can\u2019t fathom, whilst you\u2019re in that pain and that terrifying situation, how you still consider a hopeful future. Triathlon was Claire\u2019s life and she was fabulous at it. When I was unwell, and lived at my parents for a while, she\u2019d get up at four so she could do her training and be back at eight \u2013 roughly when I\u2019d wake up. She would be with me from eight until two when she\u2019d start working. That sums up Claire. \u201cWhen I heard those words \u2018para athlete\u2019 I remember thinking: \u2018Please give us something, please let this surgeon be good.\u2019 And he was fabulous and the human body is phenomenal. Look at Claire now, and apart from the obvious, you can\u2019t believe she was fighting for her life 12 weeks ago. Claire is such a bubbly, full-of-life human. But this is life-changing, and incredibly difficult for even the strongest person. Her life is looking very different. In another year she\u2019ll be living independently, and doing her thing again. But, at the moment, day-to-day is very difficult.\u201d As a way of coping with the difficulty Claire has been brave and open on her Instagram page. She has written about the fact that she suffered terrible anxiety before she met many of her friends at a day organised by Alex. The day went well but it was hard for Claire to imagine people seeing her in a wheelchair for the first time. She has also written about the hidden realities of paralysis and that, unable to move the muscles she needs to empty her bladder, she will eventually have to learn either to catheterise herself or have a small hole drilled next to her belly button so she can emit urine when she goes to the toilet. \u201cI knew she was pretty extraordinary,\u201d Alex says of Claire, \u201cbut her posts are so powerful. We put something on her Instagram and overnight she had 15,000 followers supporting her. The obvious thing \u2013 that you can\u2019t walk \u2013 is the easy part in some ways. That\u2019s terrible to say but no one thinks about bowel care or the catheter. Claire was initially unsure about writing it down but she decided it\u2019s important people understand the self-care that accompanies a spinal injury. That\u2019s where I think she will help an enormous amount of people and, in her own way, change the world.\u201d Alex looks at Claire again. \u201cSay the first thing you said to me in the ICU.\u201d Claire smiles. \u201cI said: \u2018I know this is a bit morbid but will you take some photos? I want to document it.\u2019 I\u2019m so weird. But the idea of sharing the photos and emotions is to show that a lot of stuff is relatable. The feelings I face here can relate to 1,001 things in life. We all have struggles and, often, our feelings are the same. I want to teach people that actually there are many more difficult things than the problem we\u2019re facing right now. Sometimes people jump to conclusions about others without actually knowing the struggles they face. All you can do is be kind and do the best you can by everyone.\u201d Claire listens when I say that I admire the way in which her posts do not skirt the darkness of her situation. She tells people her life does sometimes feel bleak and hard. She writes about her boyfriend who reassures her that nothing has changed \u2013 before she gently reminds him that everything has changed. They have found a way to talk openly, just like Claire addresses the world so honestly. \u201cIt\u2019s important people don\u2019t just see me and think: \u2018Oh, she\u2019s having a great time,\u2019\u201d Claire says wryly. \u201cYou look at other people on social media and think: \u2018How amazing is their life? I wish I had that.\u2019 Well, you\u2019ve probably seen 1% of their life they\u2019ve chosen to share. I think it\u2019s important to see everything.\u201d Alex nods. \u201cYou\u2019re very good at being honest. We always say we have to talk about it. So if I\u2019m not feeling great, Claire\u2019s the first person I tell.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Claire replies, \u201cbecause I want you to tell me. Sometimes people will say to me: \u2018I can\u2019t complain because I\u2019ve only hurt my finger.\u2019 Yeah you can. It\u2019s your biggest issue right now. Of course you can complain.\u201d As for her paralysis, Claire says: \u201cI think you have to accept it. I\u2019m sure some people don\u2019t. But I don\u2019t feel my life is over. So there wasn\u2019t any doubt about para sport. I have to do sport because it\u2019s so important to me and ingrained in our family. I\u2019ve just got to find out how I\u2019m going to do it, and find a way of doing it as well. I guess sport makes you more resilient.\u201d Alex says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet in what sport, but Claire will compete again. She\u2019ll get there, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d Claire hopes to leave hospital at the end of January. When I ask her to describe a typical session of rehab she reveals that she made another breakthrough that morning while Alex and I had been chatting over a coffee. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to build my upper body strength. In the session I\u2019ve just had I transferred myself from the physio bed to my chair.\u201d \u201cDid you?\u201d Alex exclaims. \u201cYes, but I used the aides as I don\u2019t quite have the strength to do it on my own. There\u2019s a board, which you go on to sideways and then you slide down it into the chair, using your hands.\u201d \u201cWere you on your own? \u201cSarah [a physiotherapist] was there. But she didn\u2019t need to support me.\u201d \u201cClaire,\u201d Alex says, \u201cthat\u2019s unbelievable!\u201d I ask if she had a feeling of \u201cWow!\u201d when she did it. \u201cYeah, I did. But then I thought: \u2018We needed the board and the slide sheet.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t do three somersaults on the way down,\u201d Alex jokes. \u201cThe next thing will be to get enough lift so I move from the bed to the chair on my own.\u201d \u201cClaire,\u201d Alex insists, \u201cthis is massive.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Claire says, \u201cbut I need to go much further.\u201d I know she will and so when we talk about the question of identity \u2013 and how she once defined herself as a successful triathlete \u2013 I tell Claire how I see her. I\u2019ve known her for only a couple of hours but I don\u2019t see her as someone who had a terrible accident and ended up in a wheelchair. I see a young woman who seems certain to do extraordinary things. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Claire says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve got to get my mind around. I\u2019m now re-forming as someone who is still the same but with different aims. Maybe they are more important goals in some respects \u2013 because I\u2019m trying to help other people. In the past I achieved the things I wanted but it would\u2019ve just been about me. It wouldn\u2019t have helped anyone else. So maybe what I will do from now on is more important.\u201d Alex looks up. \u201cRemember what we always say, Dobbie,\u201d she murmurs, using the nickname she gave her sister when Claire helped her get over her head injury. Alex and Claire, the recovering hockey player and the new para athlete, clasp hands. Amid that love and support, there is suddenly so much light and hope around them. \u201cYeah,\u201d Claire says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same but different \u2026\u201d",

They\u2019re not the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Describing how she felt when she had her own first child at 16, she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to feel ashamed. I wanted to be the best mum I could be. I just wanted the means to be able to help myself.\u201d </p> <p>She is likely to face candidates including Dawn Butler and Richard Burgon in the contest to be deputy leader.</p> <p>Friends of Burgon say he believes Labour is a \u201cbroad church\u201d, and the race for deputy leader should include a candidate from the leftwing Campaign Group of MPs, of which he is secretary.</p> <p>Recriminations continue to fly after the election result, with Thornberry threatening to sue her former colleague Caroline Flint.</p> <p>Thornberry said she had consulted lawyers after Flint, who lost her Don Valley seat last week, claimed on live television that Thornberry had once said to a fellow MP in a leave-voting seat that she was \u201cglad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours\u201d.</p> <p>Thornberry told Sky News: \u201cI\u2019ve contacted her and I\u2019ve said to her: \u2018Please withdraw, I\u2019ll give you until the end of the day.\u2019 And she hasn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, has cleared the way for her friend Rebecca Long-Bailey to run as the leftwing successor to Jeremy Corbyn, deciding instead to focus on becoming deputy leader. After Labour\u2019s catastrophic performance in last week\u2019s general election, Corbyn said he would remain in place until March, while a leadership contest takes place. Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, had long been regarded as the leadership\u2019s pick for the top job. She is expected to win the backing of the party\u2019s largest donor, Unite, and of key Corbyn allies including elections chief Karie Murphy. Long-Bailey, who is the MP for Salford, was given a prominent role during the election campaign, including as Labour\u2019s spokeswoman in TV debates, and has stood in for Corbyn at PMQs. But Rayner has built up a significant public profile, and was regarded as a strong potential leadership contender. However, in a move one colleague described as \u201csisterly\u201d she is now expected to run for deputy leader instead \u2013 smoothing the path for Long-Bailey. Allies of Rayner said she had yet not made a final decision but that discussions with colleagues were focused on the deputy position. Other Labour MPs expected to run for the leadership include shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, Wigan MP Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and high-profile backbencher Jess Phillips. The leadership race, which will be held during the next three months, will determine whether Labour maintains the leftwing policy platform espoused by Corbyn and his supporters \u2013 or abandons some of these elements. Phillips said on Sunday that Labour must \u201cdiscover the courage to ask the difficult questions about the future of our party and the future of the working-class communities who need a Labour government\u201d. Starmer and Thornberry have been blamed by some on the left of the party, including Unite\u2019s general secretary Len McCluskey, for dragging Labour towards supporting a second Brexit referendum, which they claim is what lost the party support in scores of leave-voting seats. McCluskey claimed last week\u2019s defeat resulted from, \u201ca slow-motion collapse into the arms of the People\u2019s Vote movement\u201d. However, key Labour figures including shadow chancellor John McDonnell believe that without a shift towards remain, the party\u2019s activists would desert it, and anti-Brexit voters would switch to the Lib Dems. The post of deputy leader was vacated by Tom Watson at the outset of the general election campaign, when he opted not to run as a Labour candidate. His West Bromwich East seat was one of those Labour lost to the Conservatives. Rayner, 39, a former care worker and union rep, attacked Boris Johnson during the campaign, after a 1995 article emerged in which he condemned single mothers as raising a generation of \u201cill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children\u201d. She said: \u201cPeople like him make women who are already vulnerable feel that they\u2019re the problem. They\u2019re not the problem.\u201d Describing how she felt when she had her own first child at 16, she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to feel ashamed. I wanted to be the best mum I could be. I just wanted the means to be able to help myself.\u201d She is likely to face candidates including Dawn Butler and Richard Burgon in the contest to be deputy leader. Friends of Burgon say he believes Labour is a \u201cbroad church\u201d, and the race for deputy leader should include a candidate from the leftwing Campaign Group of MPs, of which he is secretary. Recriminations continue to fly after the election result, with Thornberry threatening to sue her former colleague Caroline Flint. Thornberry said she had consulted lawyers after Flint, who lost her Don Valley seat last week, claimed on live television that Thornberry had once said to a fellow MP in a leave-voting seat that she was \u201cglad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours\u201d. Thornberry told Sky News: \u201cI\u2019ve contacted her and I\u2019ve said to her: \u2018Please withdraw, I\u2019ll give you until the end of the day.\u2019 And she hasn\u2019t. So I\u2019ve had to go to solicitors. People can slag me off as long as it\u2019s true, I can take it on the chin. But they can\u2019t make up shit about me \u2013 and if they do, I have to take it to the courts.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. I have better things to think about than people going on television and making up shit.\u201d Flint made the comments in an interview with Sky on Sunday, in which she claimed that the next Labour leader should be someone who had not pushed the party towards a pro-remain position, as Thornberry and Keir Starmer had. Sadiq Khan joined the criticism of Corbyn\u2019s handling of the election and its aftermath on Monday. The mayor of London wrote in the i paper: \u201cIf we are truly honest with ourselves, Labour simply did not put forward a credible candidate for prime minister or a believable set of priorities for governing. All the evidence \u2013 not least from the doorstep and the results \u2013 backs this up.\u201d In an apparent criticism of Corbyn\u2019s article in Sunday\u2019s Observer, in which the Labour leader claimed his party had \u201cwon the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate,\u201d Khan said, \u201cit is ludicrous to say we won the argument at this election \u2013 because we lost.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 17 December. Top stories The US House of Representatives judiciary committee has released its 658-page impeachment report alleging \u201clittle doubt\u201d of bribery, ahead of scheduled vote on impeachment on Wednesday. In the report, Democrats accuse Trump of committing constitutional and criminal bribery by trying to press Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election as the country\u2019s military aid was held up. Follow the liveblog for the latest. Democrats are also pressing for John Bolton to be called to testify in the impeachment trial expected to be held in the Senate next month. The former national security adviser fired by Donald Trump in September joins the president\u2019s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney in being in the Democrats\u2019 sights. Former emergency leaders say they will convene their own summit on the bushfire crisis, after pushing the Morrison government to take action on the climate. The Emergency Leaders for Climate Action say they will hold the summit after the current bushfire season because of their \u201chuge disappointment in the lack of national leadership during a bushfire crisis\u201d. It comes as fires raged across New South Wales and Western Australia on Monday; extreme heat is forecast for much of Australia this week; and as Australia was named as one of a handful of countries responsible for thwarting a global deal on the rulebook of the Paris climate agreement. Julian Assange\u2019s fight against extradition to the US could last years, and his argument could hinge on reports he has been illegally spied upon and his sensitive information given to the CIA. Meanwhile, more than 100 doctors from across the world have written to the Australian government, urging it to act and \u201cprotect the life of its citizen\u201d, in a letter to be delivered to the foreign affairs minister on Tuesday, amid warnings Assange\u2019s health continues to deteriorate. Assange is currently being held in London\u2019s Belmarsh prison, ahead of an extradition hearing that will begin in February. Australia The Australian Medical Association has joined a Law Council of Australia push to raise the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 14 to prevent the jailing of children as young as 10. The feral horse population in Australia\u2019s alpine national parks has more than doubled in the past five years, with conservationists blaming what they have called a disgraceful lack of management by the New South Wales government. Human rights commissioner Ed Santow says people need to be held accountable for the mistakes AI and algorithms make such as that seen in the government\u2019s robodebt scandal. Australia\u2019s biggest defence projects have suffered another $1.2bn budget blowout in 2018-19, with the cost of the 26 projects rising by a total of $24bn compared with what was originally announced, the auditor general has found. The world Intense protests against an Indian citizenship law that excludes Muslims have spread to university campuses nationwide, fuelled by a brutal police crackdown on a demonstration in Delhi at the weekend. A high-profile UN whistleblower, who made claims of sexual assault at UNAids, has been sacked for alleged sexual and financial misconduct, along with another colleague.

Proposals put forward by City regulators will put the investment sector back in the spotlight after the gating of one of the UK\u2019s largest property funds this month and the high-profile collapse of Neil Woodford\u2019s investment empire. The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority are considering new rules for the industry after an initial review found problems in the way funds measure and communicate their liquidity \u2013 or how easy it is to sell and redistribute funds to investors. Woodford\u2019s flagship fund was initially suspended in June because of a surge in redemptions that he could not not keep up with as investors rushed to pull out their money after a series of poor market bets.

      "body": "<p>In a parallel political universe, Ofwat\u2019s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/dec/16/uk-water-bills-cut-services-leaks\">announced on Monday</a>. Incoming Labour ministers would instead be inspecting their soon-to-be nationalised assets.</p> <p>None of that will now happen, so the key issue in a still-privatised world is different. Will any of the companies that have bleated behind the scenes about a \u201cpoliticised\u201d regulatory process dare to allege unreasonable harshness on the part of Ofwat? Will any appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)?</p> <p>We\u2019ll have to wait eight weeks \u2013 the permitted period for an appeal \u2013 to find out, but the likely suspects would be well advised to swallow their medicine.</p> <p>First, Ofwat\u2019s review is pitched as the \u201ctoughest ever\u201d, but so it had to be. Shareholders since privatisation in 1989 have enjoyed a dividend bonanza so this was always going to be a moment to lean in the opposite direction. That\u2019s not evidence of politicisation; it\u2019s just a recognition that regulation has been too lax. Ofwat\u2019s new demands will strike most bill-payers as reasonable: lower returns on capital; a reduction in bills by \u00a350 on average, ignoring inflation, over the next five years; and a 16% cut in leaks.</p> <p>Second, Ofwat has given some ground between its \u201cdraft\u201d and \u201cfinal\u201d calculations.

      "bodyText": "In a parallel political universe, Ofwat\u2019s pricing framework for the English and Welsh water companies for the next five years would have been redundant before it was announced on Monday. Incoming Labour ministers would instead be inspecting their soon-to-be nationalised assets. None of that will now happen, so the key issue in a still-privatised world is different. Will any of the companies that have bleated behind the scenes about a \u201cpoliticised\u201d regulatory process dare to allege unreasonable harshness on the part of Ofwat? Will any appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)? We\u2019ll have to wait eight weeks \u2013 the permitted period for an appeal \u2013 to find out, but the likely suspects would be well advised to swallow their medicine. First, Ofwat\u2019s review is pitched as the \u201ctoughest ever\u201d, but so it had to be. Shareholders since privatisation in 1989 have enjoyed a dividend bonanza so this was always going to be a moment to lean in the opposite direction. That\u2019s not evidence of politicisation; it\u2019s just a recognition that regulation has been too lax. Ofwat\u2019s new demands will strike most bill-payers as reasonable: lower returns on capital; a reduction in bills by \u00a350 on average, ignoring inflation, over the next five years; and a 16% cut in leaks. Second, Ofwat has given some ground between its \u201cdraft\u201d and \u201cfinal\u201d calculations. Companies, in aggregate, will be allowed about \u00a31.5bn of extra expenditure to meet performance targets. The concession is not huge in the context of a \u00a351bn spending programme, but it\u2019s a softening. Third, the new regime will only look \u201ctough\u201d to the laggards, judged by efficiency.

Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters had complete command of the NEC and party structures, the manifesto, the election strategy and even the timing given he voted for an election at this time despite deep misgivings among many MPs.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo one got in the way. No one stopped them. This was the platform they had been dreaming of fighting an election on for decades. And it led to the worst Labour result since 1935.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stephen Kinnock, the Aberavon MP, blamed \u201cweak and incompetent leadership\u201d for the result, as well as the decision to back a second referendum and a \u201cmanifesto that turned into a Christmas wish list\u201d.</p> \n<p>One MP suggested Tuesday\u2019s PLP would be \u201cawful\u201d for Corbyn and another said the party leader would be pressed for an acknowledgement that he should not have agreed to an election when it was clear it would be dominated by the Brexit issue.</p> \n<p>A third said: \u201cI think he needs to apologise. He was so clearly the biggest issue.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn is likely to face calls to apologise for last week\u2019s disastrous election results when he attends what is likely to be an angry parliamentary Labour party (PLP) meeting on Tuesday evening. Many Corbyn-sceptic MPs are incensed that the leader has not said sorry for the loss of 60 MPs across the north, Midlands, Scotland and Wales, although he has said he takes \u201cfull responsibility\u201d and was \u201cvery sad\u201d. There is particular anger among losing candidates that they have had no direct communication \u2013 neither an apology nor a note of thanks \u2013 from the leadership after losing their seats. Ahead of the meeting, several expressed frustration at the tone Corbyn has taken since Thursday\u2019s result, which has included defending the party\u2019s platform and stating that \u201cour time will come\u201d. Pat McFadden, a former Labour minister whose majority in Wolverhampton South East fell from 8,500 two years ago to 1,235, said: \u201cThursday night was a disastrous result of historic proportions and the only thing that would make it worse is to refuse to learn from it. \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a Labour leader to have such unchallenged command over a campaign. Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters had complete command of the NEC and party structures, the manifesto, the election strategy and even the timing given he voted for an election at this time despite deep misgivings among many MPs. \u201cNo one got in the way. No one stopped them. This was the platform they had been dreaming of fighting an election on for decades. And it led to the worst Labour result since 1935.\u201d Stephen Kinnock, the Aberavon MP, blamed \u201cweak and incompetent leadership\u201d for the result, as well as the decision to back a second referendum and a \u201cmanifesto that turned into a Christmas wish list\u201d. One MP suggested Tuesday\u2019s PLP would be \u201cawful\u201d for Corbyn and another said the party leader would be pressed for an acknowledgement that he should not have agreed to an election when it was clear it would be dominated by the Brexit issue. A third said: \u201cI think he needs to apologise. He was so clearly the biggest issue. MPs have lost their seats, staff have lost their jobs in the run-up to Christmas and we\u2019ve let down the British people by giving them five years of a Boris Johnson majority government. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t what he intended but that\u2019s where we are and I do think an apology would be appropriate. However, Corbyn\u2019s supporters in the party are likely to rally to his defence, blaming Brexit for the result and highlighting his greater success with a similar manifesto but no second referendum policy in 2017. There was also a move among some Corbyn allies to blame the media. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, claimed on Monday that the BBC was partly responsibility for Labour\u2019s losses and that it was insufficiently impartial. A Labour spokesman confirmed that Corbyn would attend the meeting of his parliamentary party, which has seen the number of its MPs shrink to 202, down from 261 two years ago. Corbyn has said he will step down by the end of March, triggering a leadership contest among MPs. But he will still have to make appearances in parliament opposite Boris Johnson at the despatch box for prime minister\u2019s questions and make Labour\u2019s case during debates on key pieces of legislation for the next three months. The Labour leader will also have to make a decision on how to whip the party for Johnson\u2019s EU withdrawal bill and on the Queen\u2019s speech, which are both due to come to the House of Commons this week.",

A president can be impeached if they are judged to have committed \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2013 although the US Constitution does not specify what \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d are.<br></p>\n    <p>The formal process starts with the House of Representatives passing articles of impeachment, the equivalent of congressional charges.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>According to arcane&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CDOC-106sdoc2/pdf/CDOC-106sdoc2.pdf\">Senate rules</a>, after the House notifies the Senate that impeachment managers have been selected, the secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, tells the House that the Senate is ready to receive the articles. Then impeachment managers appear before the Senate to \u201cexhibit\u201d the articles, and the Senate confirms it will consider the case.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer of the Senate notifies the supreme court chief justice,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/trump-impeachment-john-roberts-chief-justice-trial\">John Roberts</a>, of the impending trial. Roberts arrives in the Senate to administer an oath to members.</p>\n    <p>The presiding officer will then administer this oath to senators: \u201cI solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the constitution and laws, so help me God.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The Senate must vote on a resolution laying out ground rules for the trial including who the key players will be, how long they will get to present their cases and other matters.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After the Senate is \u201corganized\u201d, the rules decree, \u201ca writ of summons shall issue to the person impeached, reciting said articles, and notifying him to appear before the Senate upon a day and at a place to be fixed by the Senate\u201d. A president has never appeared at his own impeachment trial. Trump will be represented by the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, among others.</p>\n    <p>After the oath, the trial proper will begin. Senators may not speak during the proceedings but may submit written questions. The question of witnesses and other matters would be decided on the fly by majority vote. A time limit for the proceedings will be established in the initial Senate vote.</p>\n    <p>The senators will then deliberate on the case. In the past this has happened behind closed doors and out of public view.</p>\n    <p>The senators vote separately on the two articles of impeachment \u2013 the first charging Trump with abuse of power, the second charging him with obstruction of Congress. A two-thirds majority of present senators \u2013 67 ayes if everyone votes \u2013 on either article would be enough to convict Trump and remove him from office. But that would require about 20 Republicans defections and is unlikely. The more likely outcome is a Trump acquittal, at which point the process is concluded.</p>\n    <p>Two presidents have previously been impeached, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868, though neither was removed from office as a result.

It\u2019s a ride many Americans are truly sick of. Is this just one more whirl around Washington\u2019s partisan merry-go-round? The thing is, so long as Republicans in Congress don\u2019t contradict Trump, he has a lot of power to make it seem so. But just because Trump is out there ranting and crying BULLSHIT \u2013 just because the president is throwing a fit about the allegation that he violated his oath of office or commited a crime does not mean he did not violate his oath or commit a crime. Did Trump violate his oath or commit a crime? A lot of people \u2013 from the whistleblower, to career government officials swept up in the affair, to legal scholars, to Democrats and Republicans who have not drunk the Trump \u201cKool-Aid\u201d \u2013 believe it\u2019s plausible that the president has committed an impeachable offense. What about the other foreign countries and people involved? In at least five countries, Trump or Trump administration officials have been active on two fronts: urging attacks on Biden and rewriting the story of the 2016 US election. Trump has conscripted the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who listened in on the July Ukraine call and the attorney general, William Barr, who has met with government contacts in Italy and London and sought Australian contacts to review special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation. That investigation had prompted much impeachment talk but the Ukraine scandal quickly sparked a formal impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has pressured Ukraine to smear Biden, and the whistleblower said White House officials had caused records of Trump\u2019s Ukraine call to be moved into a specially restricted computer system. And the vice-president, Mike Pence, has acknowledged contacts with Ukrainian officials while claiming to have no knowledge of Trump\u2019s Biden agenda. On 3 October, Trump even suggested that: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d That\u2019s an abuse of power in plain sight, critics say. Trump, foreign election tampering \u2013 is this just a replay of Mueller? No. Unlike when he was a candidate, Trump\u2019s invitations for foreign powers to attack his domestic political opponents now have all the power of the White House behind them. Critics say this is a plain abuse of that power and stinks of despotism.And it undermines US national security because it places Trump\u2019s personal agenda first. Trump is also accused of undermining the integrity of US elections, violating the civil rights of the US citizens he is calling out for foreign attack, and violating campaign finance laws by soliciting foreign help. The Trump administration also stands accused of obstruction of Congress for resisting congressional subpoenas for documents and testimony relating to the crisis. What\u2019s next? After a series of sensational public hearings in front of the House intelligence and judiciary committees, the House of Representatives is set to vote on two articles of impeachment drawn up by the judiciary committee \u2013 abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. If a simple majority votes to impeach Trump he faces trial in the Republican-dominated US Senate, expected in January 2020, just as Democratic primary voting is about to get under way to pick the party\u2019s nominee to fight Trump in the election. tl;dr: can you give that to me in tweet length?",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser should consult civil servants before embarking upon a wholesale programme of Whitehall reform, the head of the senior civil servants\u2019 union has said. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said a major shake-up of the government machine drawn up by Dominic Cummings without his members\u2019 input could be \u201creform for reform\u2019s sake\u201d and damage ministers\u2019 ability to implement policy. Government sources have confirmed reports that Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, is expected to oversee a powerful new business department as part of a slew of expected departmental changes after the UK leaves the EU on 31 January. The Foreign Office is expected to absorb the Department for International Development to align overseas aid with diplomatic goals. Officials say they could set up a new energy and climate change department. Stephen Barclay\u2019s Department for Exiting the European Union is expected to be closed down, with responsibility for negotiations over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU being led by the Cabinet Office. Penman said Johnson\u2019s advisers should not get carried away with reforms, which can be expensive and damaging. \u201cWhilst those around the prime minister may relish in their reputations as revolutionaries sweeping away alleged civil service orthodoxy, reform for reform\u2019s sake is an orthodoxy in itself. \u201cThe civil service is far for perfect, but neither is it dysfunctional. Civil servants will be keen for reform, embracing the challenges the new government faces: that\u2019s why they chose to work in government in the first place. \u201cSpeaking to civil servants to understand what does work and what needs reform is often the biggest challenge for government. The prime minister must now rise to it,\u201d he said. Cummings, credited with devising the Conservatives\u2019 election strategy that swept Johnson to victory, has been a long-term critic of Whitehall. In a 2014 lecture, he complained that \u201calmost no one is ever fired\u201d in Whitehall and set out a \u201cto-do list\u201d he had drawn up in case \u201cI ever manage to get control of No 10.\u201d Sources said Cummings had redrawn those plans during the six weeks of the general election campaign. The plans have been signed off by Johnson with the backing of the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove. Another possible change includes splitting responsibility for the UK\u2019s borders and immigration system off from the Home Office into a standalone department. Penman, whose members include most departmental permanent secretaries, said that the government should ensure that any potential reforms do not get in the way of policy objectives. \u201cUltimately, it is policy that will transform the country, not changing departmental infrastructure. Clarity over objectives and the policies that will deliver them should lead to conclusions on the structures needed to support them, not the other way around,\u201d he said. The leaders of 115 charities \u2013 including Oxfam GB, Unicef UK, WaterAid and World Vision UK \u2013 signed a statement amid speculation that Johnson was planning to merge DfID with the FCO. The sector warned that such a move could lead to less aid reaching those who need it, less transparency about how funds are spent and less efficient use of resources. Around 30% of the official development assistance budget is now spent outside DfID by other departments and cross-government funds, including the FCO and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The charities said a recent report by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact showed this had resulted in less UK aid getting to the world\u2019s poorest people. The statement reads: \u201cMerging DfID with the Foreign Office would risk dismantling the UK\u2019s leadership on international development and humanitarian aid. \u201cIt suggests we are turning our backs on the world\u2019s poorest people, as well as some of the greatest global challenges of our time: extreme poverty, climate change and conflict.\u201d",

The updated population figures come from an aerial survey of the alpine national parks and surrounding state forests in NSW and Victoria conducted in April and May of this year. It mimicked a survey of the same area in 2014. The survey data, released on Monday, showed the feral horse population had grown an estimated 23% a year over the past five years, from 9,187 in 2014 to 25,318 in 2019. The population growth was strongest in the northern section of Kosciuszko national park, which showed a five-fold increase. Andrew Cox, chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, said that if feral horse numbers continued to increase at the current rate, horses would become the most-sighted animal in the park. \u201cIt is a disgrace to see how much the population has grown out of control,\u201d Cox said. Cox said the exponential growth meant that authorities would have to remove thousands of horses a year just to keep the population stable. He said all humane and effective forms of population control \u2013 including aerial culling, which has been explicitly ruled out by the NSW government \u2013 should be back on the table. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do it, horses will be the main animal you see there,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralia\u2019s most iconic park is being lost to horses.\u201d NSW last year introduced laws to protect the Snowy Mountains brumbies for their \u201cheritage value\u201d, scrapping a recommendation from the state\u2019s environment department that feral horse numbers in the alps be reduced by 90%. Victoria, meanwhile, has committed to removing 1,200 horses from its side of the border. The driving force behind the change in the NSW policy was deputy premier John Barilaro, whose electorate of Monaro includes the Snowy Mountains. Barilaro said he remained opposed to aerial culling.

They will starve themselves out.\u201d Barilaro said brumbies had been part of the Australian alps for almost 200 years, since they were released by or escaped from European settlers. \u201cI have always maintained that it is important we find a balance between the cultural significance of the brumbies and managing the environmental impact on the Kosciuszko national park,\u201d he said.

With European Professional Club Rugby looking to put in place a range of commercial and broadcasting deals beyond 2022, Premiership Rugby\u2019s new relationship with the private equity firm CVC has also led to some speculation about the potential implications for the supposed jewel in Europe\u2019s club crown, particularly given only three teams \u2013 Leinster, Toulon and Saracens \u2013 have won the trophy since 2010. The EPCR\u2019s director general, Vincent Gaillard, confirmed his organisation has not yet been approached by CVC and has called on stakeholders to underline their commitment to Europe early in the new year. \u201cWe need to have some certainty for the direction of the tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have received a very clear mandate from the board for the process to be concluded shortly. We are discussing whether there might be potential for change or improvement but if the desire is to stay with a 20-team Champions Cup that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019re not in a bad place, we just need to project ourselves into the future.\u201d With CVC also considering investing in the Top 14 and the Six Nations, however, Gaillard accepts there is an increasing need for clarity in a fast-changing sporting landscape. \u201cWill others come up with plans of their own? Possibly but I just don\u2019t see weakening Europe as a desirable scenario for anyone, not even CVC. From a sporting and commercial standpoint it is a very profitable venture for everyone. \u201cThe most important thing for me is that the financial world should not negatively affect player welfare or sporting calendars. We\u2019re keeping a watchful eye but there is nothing so far that suggests that will be the case.\u201d EPCR is also optimistic Brexit will not undermine sporting cross-border relationships. \u201cOn the basic logistical level there is no immediate concern because a transition period will be involved,\u201dGaillard said. \u201cOn a political level does it change anything? I don\u2019t think it does. I think Britain is part of the future of European rugby. I can hardly see, say, England disappearing from the rugby map any time soon. I think European rugby is part of their future and vice versa, no matter what the politics around it might be.\u201d",

To allow for the surprise move, Morgan has been made a life peer. The decision followed speculation over a range of mooted candidates for the role, from Morgan\u2019s predecessor John Whittingdale to former Sky executive Andrew Griffith, newly elected MP for Arundel and South Downs. Morgan said she had agreed to remain in post for a few weeks, until the prime minister could carry out a full-blown reshuffle, expected after Britain has left the European Union at the end of January. The former representative for Loughborough announced she would stand down as an MP in October in a letter in which she cited \u201cthe clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job of a modern MP\u201d as part of the reason for her decision. But she was highly visible during the election campaign while other senior ministers, including Andrea Leadsom and Victoria Atkins, were hardly seen. Morgan appeared on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme twice and was memorably quizzed by Piers Morgan on Good Morning Britain over the government\u2019s pledge to recruit 50,000 more nurses, 19,000 of whom were just being retained. At the time, senior Tory sources said she had been offered a job and a peerage, but she denied it. Quizzed by the Guardian on 25 November over whether she had communicated with anyone connected to No 10 or Boris Johnson about a possible job in government or peerage, she replied with a single word: \u201cNo.\u201d The Conservatives took a swath of Labour seats in Thursday\u2019s poll to secure an unexpectedly large majority of 80, liberating Johnson from the internecine parliamentary struggles that marred Theresa May\u2019s premiership. Johnson also appointed Simon Hart, the MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, as Welsh secretary to replace Alun Cairns, who resigned early in the campaign after backing a former aide who had been accused of deliberately collapsing a rape trial. Morgan told the Guardian she had handed in her departmental pass and bid her staff and government driver goodbye \u2013 but that Johnson had called her on Monday morning and asked her to stay on. \u201cHe wanted to keep changes to a minimum; the plan is to focus on what he wants to get done immediately,\u201d she said.",

Matthew Feargrieve was found guilty in London of punching Ulrich Engler at least once while attending a performance of Wagner at the Royal Opera House on 7 October last year. Feargrieve, 43, attacked Ulrich Engler, who had climbed into an empty seat next to him and moved Feargrieve\u2019s partner\u2019s coat at the Royal Opera House in central London. Engler was attending a performance of the Ring Cycle by Wagner last year when he moved into the vacant seat, next to Feargrieve and his partner, Catherine Chandler, before the beginning of the performance. The fashion designer told City of London magistrates court he had moved into the chair in row A from his seat in row B at the opera three days earlier before the second instalment of Wagner\u2019s four-part epic, and did so again on 7 October. Engler said he asked Chandler if he could sit in the vacant seat next to her. When she said he could not, he asked whether she had purchased the extra seat. Chandler said she had not, so Engler moved into the seat with a better view than his own, moving her coat and putting it on her lap.

While Mr Feargrieve was hitting me he said, \u2018How dare you talk to my wife like this?\u2019 \u201cThe only three things I said to this woman was, would you mind if I sat next to you again, have you paid for the seat, and that I was sorry.\u201d The court heard Chandler tried to calm Feargrieve and the couple left. Engler was subsequently arrested at the opera house on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm but he was not charged. Engler was banned from the Royal Opera House after the incident. Elaine McMaster, a former physiotherapist who was attending the opera, told the court Engler \u201cneatly\u201d and quietly climbed over without causing a disturbance to Feargrieve or Chandler. However, she criticised the couple for their conduct at a previous performance. \u201cThey spoiled the whole evening for me, I couldn\u2019t see the stage at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t seem at all concerned by the fact they were annoying everyone in their area.\u201d McMaster said the couple were distracting other patrons by swaying side to side to the music as Chandler was flicking her hair and being noisy. \u201cPeople don\u2019t behave like that in their local cinema, let alone in the Royal Opera House,\u201d she added. Giving evidence, Feargrieve said he only pushed Engler and did so in self-defence after Engler \u201cattacked\u201d Chandler, his partner of 13 years. He claimed that his shoulder was dislocated as a result of Chandler being shoved into him by Engler. District Judge John Zani did not accept Feargrieve\u2019s evidence or argument of self-defence and, after a one-day trial, the lawyer was found guilty of common assault. Zani said: \u201cI was not in the Royal Opera House on the day in question so I have to decide from the evidence I have heard and read. \u201cThe events that unfolded occurred in the way Mr Engler recalled. I am entirely satisfied that the prosecution have dismantled the defence you have put forward. This is not a case of one\u2019s man punch is another man\u2019s shove.\u201d Zani added: \u201cYour evidence has been consistently that maybe fingertips touched. I accept the evidence of the prosecution witnesses where they say you punched Mr Engler at least once maybe twice or three times. I am entirely satisfied that you are guilty.\u201d The court heard Engler was diagnosed with PTSD after the incident. Feargrieve, of Barnes, south-west London, will be sentenced on 22 January at Westminster magistrates court. Zani said he was unlikely to face a custodial sentence.",

However, the suspects had already left the scene when the call to police was made.\u201d \u201cAt this time we are investigating this as an isolated burglary and we are retaining an open mind around other lines of enquiry. \u201cPolice were called by security within the building to three males who had been present inside the property and a fast-paced investigation is underway to locate the suspects and missing items.\u201d",

All the votes were added together to give a raw score. \u2022 To minimise the influence of outliers in the list, the highest score awarded to a player was then deducted to give a final score. \u2022 A player needed to receive votes from at least five judges to qualify for the list. \u2022 If players are level on points in the scoring, the number of individual votes cast is used as a tie-breaker. \u2022 The individual voting breakdown will be published when the full list has been revealed. Voting disclosure \u2022 We are very grateful to our judges for taking part, and none have been paid for participating in this project. \u2022 To allow our judges the freedom to express their opinions without fear or favour, individual voting records will be anonymised in the full breakdown of scores. \u2022 Voters are identified only by their category and a number chosen at random. The judges\u2019 numbers bear no relation whatsoever to the alphabetical list of judges\u2019 names presented above.",

      "body": "<p>On Tuesday the Commons will resume following the general election. Here is a brief guide to what will happen over the rest of the week \u2013 and a few new MPs to look out for.</p> \n<h2>Re-election of the Speaker</h2> \n<p>Lindsay Hoyle was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/sir-lindsay-hoyle-promises-calm-after-being-elected-speaker\">chosen as Speaker</a> in November to replace John Bercow, in a secret ballot in which he saw off six other candidates. The Speaker is also re-elected following every general election, although this is usually a formality.</p> \n<p>After parliament begins at 2.30pm on Tuesday the father (or mother) of the house \u2013 the title given to the longest-serving MP \u2013 takes the chair of the clerk of the Commons to oversee the re-election. With Ken Clarke having stepped down and Dennis Skinner having lost his seat, the role will be taken by the Tory MP Peter Bottomley, first elected in 1975. Hoyle will be asked whether he wants to remain as Speaker, and then MPs will vote on a motion approving this.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d91f3d9a-314a-46f5-81f2-615e17877426\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Lindsay Hoyle was born in Adlington, Lancashire, in 1957. The son of the former Labour MP Doug Hoyle, before entering politics he ran his own textile and screen printing business. Hoyle has been married twice, and had two daughters. One of them, Natalie Lewis-Hoyle,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/12/deputy-speaker-daughter-natalie-lewis-hoyle-inquest-toxic-relationship\">died in 2017 aged 28</a>.</p>\n    <p>Hoyle was elected Labour MP for Chorley in 1997, and was elevated to deputy speaker of the House of Commons under John Bercow in 2010. He was elected Speaker in November 2019, succeeding Bercow.</p>\n    <p>As deputy speaker it was his job to chair the government\u2019s budget speeches, and he also was in the chair in 2017 when he ordered the SNP to stop singing the European Union anthem Ode To Joy in the chamber.</p>\n    <p>As Speaker, Hoyle is obliged to renounce his former political affiliation, and remain strictly neutral. In hustings to take the role as Speaker, Hoyle said parliament needed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/09/speaker-candidate-lindsay-hoyle-says-parliament-has-drink-and-drugs-problem\">crack down on a drink and drugs culture</a>.

This will take the rest of Tuesday and all of Wednesday. There is a strict order for swearing in: the father (or mother) of the house, cabinet ministers, shadow cabinet ministers, other privy councillors, other ministers then other MPs in order of how long they have served.</p> \n<p>If MPs entered the Commons at the same time, their seniority is decided by when they took their oath \u2013 something which can become important many years down the line. Clarke and Skinner both entered the Commons in June 1970, but as Clarke was sworn in earlier he eventually became father of the house.</p> \n<p>The oath involves swearing allegiance to the Queen \u2013 which is why MPs elected for Sinn F\u00e9in, the Northern Irish republican party, do not take their seats. MPs do, however, get a choice of a religious oath or an affirmation, and it can be said in English, Welsh, Gaelic or Cornish.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0063c28fe12527af1142ed4b364606bbb4d7fe4d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0063c28fe12527af1142ed4b364606bbb4d7fe4d/17_243_3483_2090/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Queen will attend the state opening of parliament, just two months after the last one.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Queen will attend the state opening of parliament, just two months after the last one.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pool/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Queen\u2019s speech</h2> \n<p>On Thursday, the Queen will be required to don her ceremonial finery for the state opening of parliament \u2013 just two months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/14/jeremy-corbyn-hits-out-at-farcical-queens-speech\">after the last one</a> \u2013 and the government will table the Queen\u2019s speech, giving its legislative plans for the parliamentary session.</p> \n<p>As well as Brexit-related legislation, the programme is set to include a symbolic bill guaranteeing a certain amount of spending on the NHS.</p> \n<h2>Who are some new MPs to keep an eye on?</h2> \n<p>There were 140 new MPs elected last week. Here\u2019s a small selection:</p> \n<p><strong>Conservatives</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Dehenna Davison</strong>: Aged 25, Davison is not the youngest MP \u2013 two other newly elected Tories are just 24 \u2013 but is a prominent member of the party\u2019s new contingent of northern representatives. She took Bishop Auckland from Labour. The former business analyst stood in the Sedgefield constituency in the 2017 election. Much of the pre-election coverage of Davison centred on her previous brush with reality TV, when she appeared on a programme about relationships with her then fianc\u00e9, who was 35 years older than her.</p> \n<p><strong>Nicola Richards</strong>: One of the youngest MPs, Richards, 24, took the West Bromwich East seat formerly held by Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson, the first time the constituency had changed hands since it was created in 1974. A politics graduate, she has worked for several different MPs and for the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, and is a councillor in Dudley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8924c2cfc39b453d2f59d33578514ae19a5be3c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8924c2cfc39b453d2f59d33578514ae19a5be3c7/0_110_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Imran Ahmad Khan speaks after he was declared the winner in Wakefield.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imran Ahmad Khan speaks after he was declared the winner in Wakefield.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Imran Ahmad Khan</strong>: Taking the Wakefield seat from Mary Creagh, one Labour had held since 1932, he has run businesses in several countries and worked with the UN. Put into the seat after the original candidate, Antony Calvert, was removed over comments about food banks, Khan \u2013 who was born in Wakefield \u2013 sought to counter the criticism he had been \u201cparachuted\u201d into the seat by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as5qFGywf0I\">literally parachuting</a> into the town.</p> \n<p><strong>Kate Griffiths</strong>: The new MP for Burton is notable largely due to the circumstances of her selection. She is the estranged wife of Andrew Griffiths, who represented the constituency from 2010 until the election. The pair separated after it emerged he had sent thousands of explicit text messages to two young women in his constituency just weeks after the birth of their daughter. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/kate-griffiths-wife-of-disgraced-mp-andrew-griffiths-stands-in-his-former-seat-with-pledge-to-fight-domestic-abuse\">challenged </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/13/kate-griffiths-wife-of-disgraced-mp-andrew-griffiths-stands-in-his-former-seat-with-pledge-to-fight-domestic-abuse\">her husband for the seat</a>, prompting him to step aside. A former corporate hospitality coordinator, she has said she will campaign on behalf of abuse survivors.</p> \n<p><strong>Danny Kruger</strong>: A more traditional sort of new Tory MP, now installed in the safe seat of Devizes, Kruger \u2013 the son of TV chef Prue Leith \u2013 is an Eton-educated former adviser to Boris Johnson, and previously to David Cameron, and is very well connected in Tory circles.</p> \n<p><strong>Labour</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a1477c3ff7fd271662d1f351f1866e536f93516\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a1477c3ff7fd271662d1f351f1866e536f93516/0_280_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florence Eshalomi at a general election hustings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Eshalomi at a general election hustings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kerrison/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Florence Eshalomi</strong>: Replacing Kate Hoey in the ultra-safe south London seat of Vauxhall, Eshalomi is a former councillor and London assembly member, and has worked for charities among others.

He later apologised for them.</p> \n<p><strong>Sam Tarry</strong>: Tarry was director of both Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaigns, and is an integral part of the Momentum left wing of the party.

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday the Commons will resume following the general election. Here is a brief guide to what will happen over the rest of the week \u2013 and a few new MPs to look out for. Re-election of the Speaker Lindsay Hoyle was chosen as Speaker in November to replace John Bercow, in a secret ballot in which he saw off six other candidates. The Speaker is also re-elected following every general election, although this is usually a formality. After parliament begins at 2.30pm on Tuesday the father (or mother) of the house \u2013 the title given to the longest-serving MP \u2013 takes the chair of the clerk of the Commons to oversee the re-election. With Ken Clarke having stepped down and Dennis Skinner having lost his seat, the role will be taken by the Tory MP Peter Bottomley, first elected in 1975. Hoyle will be asked whether he wants to remain as Speaker, and then MPs will vote on a motion approving this. Swearing in of MPs Once the Speaker is in his chair, all MPs are sworn in, whether they are new or returning. This will take the rest of Tuesday and all of Wednesday. There is a strict order for swearing in: the father (or mother) of the house, cabinet ministers, shadow cabinet ministers, other privy councillors, other ministers then other MPs in order of how long they have served. If MPs entered the Commons at the same time, their seniority is decided by when they took their oath \u2013 something which can become important many years down the line. Clarke and Skinner both entered the Commons in June 1970, but as Clarke was sworn in earlier he eventually became father of the house. The oath involves swearing allegiance to the Queen \u2013 which is why MPs elected for Sinn F\u00e9in, the Northern Irish republican party, do not take their seats. MPs do, however, get a choice of a religious oath or an affirmation, and it can be said in English, Welsh, Gaelic or Cornish. Queen\u2019s speech On Thursday, the Queen will be required to don her ceremonial finery for the state opening of parliament \u2013 just two months after the last one \u2013 and the government will table the Queen\u2019s speech, giving its legislative plans for the parliamentary session. As well as Brexit-related legislation, the programme is set to include a symbolic bill guaranteeing a certain amount of spending on the NHS. Who are some new MPs to keep an eye on? There were 140 new MPs elected last week. Here\u2019s a small selection: Conservatives Dehenna Davison: Aged 25, Davison is not the youngest MP \u2013 two other newly elected Tories are just 24 \u2013 but is a prominent member of the party\u2019s new contingent of northern representatives. She took Bishop Auckland from Labour. The former business analyst stood in the Sedgefield constituency in the 2017 election. Much of the pre-election coverage of Davison centred on her previous brush with reality TV, when she appeared on a programme about relationships with her then fianc\u00e9, who was 35 years older than her. Nicola Richards: One of the youngest MPs, Richards, 24, took the West Bromwich East seat formerly held by Labour\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson, the first time the constituency had changed hands since it was created in 1974. A politics graduate, she has worked for several different MPs and for the mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, and is a councillor in Dudley. Imran Ahmad Khan: Taking the Wakefield seat from Mary Creagh, one Labour had held since 1932, he has run businesses in several countries and worked with the UN. Put into the seat after the original candidate, Antony Calvert, was removed over comments about food banks, Khan \u2013 who was born in Wakefield \u2013 sought to counter the criticism he had been \u201cparachuted\u201d into the seat by literally parachuting into the town. Kate Griffiths: The new MP for Burton is notable largely due to the circumstances of her selection. She is the estranged wife of Andrew Griffiths, who represented the constituency from 2010 until the election. The pair separated after it emerged he had sent thousands of explicit text messages to two young women in his constituency just weeks after the birth of their daughter. She challenged her husband for the seat, prompting him to step aside. A former corporate hospitality coordinator, she has said she will campaign on behalf of abuse survivors. Danny Kruger: A more traditional sort of new Tory MP, now installed in the safe seat of Devizes, Kruger \u2013 the son of TV chef Prue Leith \u2013 is an Eton-educated former adviser to Boris Johnson, and previously to David Cameron, and is very well connected in Tory circles. Labour Florence Eshalomi: Replacing Kate Hoey in the ultra-safe south London seat of Vauxhall, Eshalomi is a former councillor and London assembly member, and has worked for charities among others. Having started her working life for a supermarket aged 16 as she took care of her mother, who had sickle cell anaemia, she saw off competition from the Momentum wing of the party to secure the seat. Ian Byrne: Another new MP who had tough competition to be placed in a safe seat \u2013 West Derby in Liverpool, where he now has a near-30,000 majority \u2013 Byrne was closely supported by the Labour leadership, speaking alongside Corbyn at a pre-election rally in Manchester. A former printer, he came under pressure after the emergence of sexist and other offensive comments he formerly made on social media. He later apologised for them. Sam Tarry: Tarry was director of both Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaigns, and is an integral part of the Momentum left wing of the party. Already well known in Labour circles, he won selection for the safe seat of Ilford South, formerly held by Mike Gapes, who defected to the Independent Group for Change. Liberal Democrats Daisy Cooper: A newcomer to parliament \u2013 she won St Albans after contesting the same seat in 2017 \u2013 Cooper is nonetheless a Lib Dem insider, having headed Jo Swinson\u2019s party leadership campaign. In her resignation speech, Swinson highlighted Cooper as an MP to watch. A diehard remainer, Cooper formerly worked for the press regulation campaign Hacked Off, and for the cross-party group More United. SNP Kenny MacAskill: A particularly veteran newcomer, the new MP for East Lothian, an SNP gain from Labour, spent 17 years in the Scottish parliament until 2016, and held the Scottish government\u2019s justice brief for seven years. In this role, he approved the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, convicted for the Lockerbie bombing, on compassionate grounds due to terminal illness.",

Yorgen Fenech, a Maltese businessman who has been charged in connection with the killing, has told a court that he received regular information about the investigation from Schembri, as well as counsel on how to respond when questioned by police. Fenech has plead not guilty to a charge of complicity in the murder and four other charges, including membership of a criminal gang. A man given immunity from prosecution has confessed to being a middleman in the murder. Muscat has said he will leave his post in January once a replacement for him has been found. Caruana Galizia\u2019s family have accused the Maltese government of a cover-up. Muscat denies any wrongdoing.",

Yes, leave voters appear to have swarmed to the Conservatives, notably in the north, and are thus probably short-term. But the Lib Dem vote soared by 1.3m or 4.1 percentage points, while Corbyn\u2019s fell by 2.6m. Johnson\u2019s rose by only 304,000. The reality is that the left-of-centre vote was calamitously split. Polling during the campaign saw Labour surge only when the Lib Dems appeared to collapse. With the exception of the Tony Blair era, Labour has been persistently vulnerable to moderate leftwing sentiment defecting to the Liberals. Somehow such voters feel they can exonerate themselves from guilt by association with socialism without overtly siding with conservatives. They can comfort themselves that they voted \u201ca curse on both houses\u201d. In reality they did not. They effectively voted Conservative, or in a very few Lib Dem seats, they voted \u201chung parliament\u201d. With the Lib Dems leaderless and in disarray, it must be time for them to do the honest thing and disband. They should reverse the old 1983 SDP marriage, and merge with a revivalist Labour. It would galvanise Labour\u2019s moderate wing and dilute the influence of the Corbynites. The Liberals have never looked like winning an election since Lloyd George\u2019s day. They have offered an electoral dustbin between political polarities, a media-cosseted Westminster club with a peerage auction for richer donors on the side. Liberals failed to capitalise on regionalism or nationalism. They were never truly radical, and in coalition were a broken reed. For the past year, the party has been a convalescent home for wounded warriors from the major parties, a gesture voters have treated with derision. This party is an anachronistic political spoiler. Its time is surely over. Liberal Democrats should disperse and confer their moderating influence on two bigger parties, who badly need it. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "A campaign to get Jarvis Cocker\u2019s 2006 single Running the World to the Christmas No 1 spot in light of the Conservative election victory has started with aplomb. \u201cIn light of so much recent election horror, let\u2019s do this, eh?\u201d wrote instigator Darcie Shoenman Molina on Facebook. \u201cBit of fun to focus on for the next week.\u201d The song, now a staple of Cocker\u2019s live sets, is a satire of upper-class behaviours that features the chorus: \u201cIf you thought things had changed, friend, you\u2019d better think again / Bluntly put, in the fewest of words, cunts are still running the world.\u201d Cocker has said that all proceeds from sales of the track will go to the charity Shelter. Representatives for the musician told the Guardian that he was unavailable for comment. In 2011, Cocker told the Observer that he would have loved the track \u201cto have been an international No 1, but radio play was quite difficult for that one\u201d. While he looks unlikely to beat LadBaby\u2019s I Love Sausage Rolls to the Christmas No 1 spot, he may come close to realising his dream: at the time of writing, iTunes UK ranks the song at No 3 on its streaming and download charts. It is No 2 on Amazon Music and No 1 on 7digital. A selection of songs that make the charts are played in full as part of the BBC\u2019s UK Top 40 rundown on Friday afternoons. A BBC spokesperson told the Guardian that they could not comment on whether this song will be played prior to the confirmation of this week\u2019s chart placings. The spokesperson said: \u201cThe Official Chart Show and the Christmas No 1 are historical and factual accounts of what the British public have been listening to, and we make decisions about which songs are played when the final chart positions are clear.\u201d A similar politically motivated campaign pushed a recording of Ding, Dong! The Witch Is Dead from the Wizard of Oz to the No 2 spot in the wake of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s death in 2013. Radio 1 censored the song in that week\u2019s chart rundown, a decision station controller Ben Cooper said was a \u201cdifficult compromise\u201d regarding the balance of respect for a person who had died with issues around freedom of speech. In September, Cocker said that Running the World \u201cfeels even more relevant now\u201d. He told the Guardian: \u201cA strangely common aspect of people that get in power at the moment is that they\u2019re these weird characters \u2013 ridiculous people in a way \u2013 but people seem to find entertainment in that.

      "bodyText": "Julian Assange\u2019s fight against extradition to the US could last years, and his argument could hinge on reports he has been illegally spied upon and his sensitive information given to the CIA. Meanwhile, more than 100 doctors from across the world have written to the Australian government, urging it to act and \u201cprotect the life of its citizen\u201d, in a letter to be delivered to the foreign affairs minister on Tuesday, amid warnings Assange\u2019s health continues to deteriorate. A judicial investigation by the Audiencia Nacional in Spain, the country\u2019s national court, is acting on allegations that while Assange held asylum inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, the Wikileaks founder was spied on, listened to and had his computer data scraped and that this information was sold to US intelligence agencies. Speaking to the International Law Association in Sydney, Guy Goodwin-Gill, a professor of law at the University of New South Wales who has provided advice on asylum issues to the Assange legal team, said Assange\u2019s fight against extradition would be a long contest and that allegations he was being spied on would likely form part of legal arguments he could not receive a fair trial in the US. Assange is currently being held in London\u2019s Belmarsh prison, ahead of an extradition hearing that will begin in February. A US grand jury has indicted him on 18 charges \u2013 17 of which fall under the Espionage Act \u2013 around conspiracy to receive, obtaining and disclosing classified diplomatic and military documents. If convicted, Assange faces a prison term of up to 175 years. Assange\u2019s European arrest warrant on allegations of sexual assault in Sweden has been cancelled, with prosecutors arguing there was little chance of a conviction being obtained. But medical doctors have banded together to urge authorities to halt any extradition plans, as well as urgently release him for medical care outside of the prison. \u201cThat we, as doctors, feel ethically compelled to hold governments to account on medical grounds speaks volumes about the gravity of the medical, ethical and human rights travesties that are taking place,\u201d their letter, seen by the Guardian, states. \u201cIt is an extremely serious matter for an Australian citizen\u2019s survival to be endangered by a foreign government obstructing his human right to health. It is an even more serious matter for that citizen\u2019s own government to refuse to intervene, against historical precedent and numerous converging lines of medical advice.\u201d A group of Australian MPs from across party lines have gathered to discuss what can be done for Assange, with hopes of meeting with him in Belmarsh ahead of his extradition hearing. In allegations first reported by El Pais, a Spanish defence and private security company, Undercover Global SL, provided security for the Ecuadorian embassy, where Assange lived for seven years until April this year. According to a complaint lodged with the court by Assange, Undercover Global handed over audio and video of meetings Assange held with his lawyers and supporters inside the embassy to the CIA, breaching privacy laws and legal privilege. Goodwin-Gill, the acting director of UNSW\u2019s Kaldor centre for international refugee law, told the International Law Association: \u201cUC Global set up a surveillance operation inside the Ecuadorian embassy: microphone, video cameras and eventually live-streaming, and it seems that everything was monitored, including lawyer-client meetings, and including the personal technical equipment of individuals who might be visiting Julian Assange at the embassy. \u201cIt appears documents videos and audio recordings have been supplied to the US authorities, probably the CIA,\u201d he said. Included in sworn witness testimony provided to the Spanish court, Goodwin-Gill said, was evidence that a seven-hour meeting held between Assange and his legal team on Sunday 19 June 2016 was recorded. Goodwin-Gill\u2019s name has been mentioned in testimony, alleging that the contents of his iPad, which had to be left outside the room during that meeting, were downloaded and the information passed to the US authorities. Goodwin-Gill said the UK Extradition Act \u2013 criticised often because it imposes unequal probable-cause standards for US and UK extraditions \u2013 had a number of barriers to extradition that may be pursued by Assange\u2019s legal team. The \u201cpurported exception\u201d would see extradition refused if the court found that while the indictment purported to be made for an offence under the US Espionage Act, it was in fact made for the purpose of \u201cprosecuting or punishing the individual concerned on account of race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation or political opinions\u201d. The \u201cprejudice exception\u201d, similarly, says extradition can be refused if the court concludes that Assange \u201cmight be prejudiced at his trial or punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty by reason of his race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual orientation or political opinions\u201d. Goodwin-Gill said European human rights law \u2013 binding on the UK \u2013 would also likely form part of Assange\u2019s argument to resist extradition.

In a joint policy statement, to be released on Tuesday, the country\u2019s peak medical and legal bodies argue that increasing the age to 14 will help reduce Indigenous incarceration rates and fulfil international law obligations. The reform is being considered by a working group of the Council of Attorneys General but is opposed by the federal attorney general, Christian Porter. Under the current law, children aged between 10 and 14 are presumed to be incapable of the intent to commit a criminal act, but prosecutors can push for a criminal conviction if they can show a child knew his or her actions were morally wrong.

      "body": "<p>A certain amount of catharsis can accompany goals scored the nearer the clock ticks to the 90-minute mark. The first installment of the Melbourne derby this season was a tightly fought affair, the deadlock broken only in the 89th minute as Yukari Kinga met Steph Catley\u2019s cross to cannon the ball into Casey Dumont\u2019s net. The sucker punch was perhaps fair reward for the sky blue side of Melbourne, the narrowness of the scoreline perhaps a fair reflection of the contest.</p> <p>Fast forward to Saturday, and this time it was Brisbane Roar\u2019s turn to take a late win, with Hayley Raso finishing clinically for a form- and confidence-confirming goal against Adelaide to make up ground for points dropped earlier this season. Again, catharsis descends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/10/set-up-to-fail-why-the-w-leagues-popularity-problem-is-not-on-the-pitch\">Set up to fail: why the W-League\u2019s popularity problem is not on the pitch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But compare and contrast with the similarly timed match-turning moment in Perth a day earlier as Kim Carroll leapt to meet Leticia McKenna\u2019s corner in the 90th minute, the equaliser her first goal for the club and snare her club\u2019s first point of the season.</p> <p>The defender and her club\u2019s moment of catharsis, this time came courtesy of the ball squirming over the goal line, beyond the scrabble of the penalty box rabble. The effusive celebrations from the West Australians were tinged with relief given the urgent need for something, <em>anything</em>, so that the Glory might have something to show for their efforts this season, as they continue to adjust to life in the post-Kerr era. There\u2019s something slightly symbolic in the ball not hitting the back of the net, instead tantalisingly squirming over the goal line <em>just</em> far enough to secure Perth the point.</p> <p>For Perth Glory, it\u2019s not their first notable draw with Canberra. Who can forget that eye-catching eight-goal stalemate early last season? But the fact that this season the spoils have been shared in a markedly more quotidian scoreline than last season suggests a continuation of wider trends in the W-League.</p> <p>At just over a third of the way into the 2019-20 campaign, W-League teams have been more averse to scoring goals than in seasons gone by.</p> <p>Looking at the past few W-League seasons cumulatively, the PFA\u2019s <a href=\"http://pfa.net.au/pfa-research/\">end of season W-League reports</a> have shown a gradual downward trend of goals scored per game. In the 2016-17 W-League season, there were an average of 3.49 goals scored per game, which dipped slightly to 3.43 in 2017-18 and further to 3.22 in 2018-19. After five rounds of the 2019-20 edition, we\u2019re on 2.75 goals per game.</p> <p>Comparing this point in this season to the fifth round of seasons gone by, the dip is even more marked. In 2015-16 - which happened to be Melbourne City\u2019s inaugural W-League campaign - the average number of goals scored per game at this stage was 2.9, the lowest until now.

      "bodyText": "A certain amount of catharsis can accompany goals scored the nearer the clock ticks to the 90-minute mark. The first installment of the Melbourne derby this season was a tightly fought affair, the deadlock broken only in the 89th minute as Yukari Kinga met Steph Catley\u2019s cross to cannon the ball into Casey Dumont\u2019s net. The sucker punch was perhaps fair reward for the sky blue side of Melbourne, the narrowness of the scoreline perhaps a fair reflection of the contest. Fast forward to Saturday, and this time it was Brisbane Roar\u2019s turn to take a late win, with Hayley Raso finishing clinically for a form- and confidence-confirming goal against Adelaide to make up ground for points dropped earlier this season. Again, catharsis descends. But compare and contrast with the similarly timed match-turning moment in Perth a day earlier as Kim Carroll leapt to meet Leticia McKenna\u2019s corner in the 90th minute, the equaliser her first goal for the club and snare her club\u2019s first point of the season. The defender and her club\u2019s moment of catharsis, this time came courtesy of the ball squirming over the goal line, beyond the scrabble of the penalty box rabble. The effusive celebrations from the West Australians were tinged with relief given the urgent need for something, anything, so that the Glory might have something to show for their efforts this season, as they continue to adjust to life in the post-Kerr era. There\u2019s something slightly symbolic in the ball not hitting the back of the net, instead tantalisingly squirming over the goal line just far enough to secure Perth the point. For Perth Glory, it\u2019s not their first notable draw with Canberra. Who can forget that eye-catching eight-goal stalemate early last season? But the fact that this season the spoils have been shared in a markedly more quotidian scoreline than last season suggests a continuation of wider trends in the W-League. At just over a third of the way into the 2019-20 campaign, W-League teams have been more averse to scoring goals than in seasons gone by. Looking at the past few W-League seasons cumulatively, the PFA\u2019s end of season W-League reports have shown a gradual downward trend of goals scored per game. In the 2016-17 W-League season, there were an average of 3.49 goals scored per game, which dipped slightly to 3.43 in 2017-18 and further to 3.22 in 2018-19. After five rounds of the 2019-20 edition, we\u2019re on 2.75 goals per game. Comparing this point in this season to the fifth round of seasons gone by, the dip is even more marked. In 2015-16 - which happened to be Melbourne City\u2019s inaugural W-League campaign - the average number of goals scored per game at this stage was 2.9, the lowest until now. By round five in the 2016-17 season, the W-League had seen an average of 2.95 goals scored per game. The same juncture of the 2017-18 season saw an average of 3.46 goals scored a game, and last season 3.31. With the exception of Brisbane Roar\u2019s initial flurry against Adelaide this weekend, and Remy Siemsen\u2019s early brace for Sydney FC against Melbourne Victory in round one, no game to date has seemed likely to blow out. Three-nil has been the most comprehensive victory so far, yet by this stage last season Perth Glory had demolished City 5-2. In part this is due to some stellar goalkeeping and defensive moments. But it is also a curious response to the closeness of last season\u2019s final standings, with goal difference the factor keeping teams out of the playoffs. One of the questions coming into this season was how Melbourne City would respond to missing out on the playoffs, for the first time, by this metric. Avoiding early blowouts has been one such approach, as they\u2019ve consistently, yet conservatively, clawed their way to this season\u2019s summit via an almost exclusive set of wins by a single-goal margin. The exception to this rule, of course, is their opening day one-all draw with Newcastle Jets. Just enough is being done to acquire the necessary points - no more, no less. This is echoed in the table\u2019s lower half. It\u2019s worth noting that Adelaide United mirror the fortunes of City in that they are bottom of the table by a single point, having lost each game by a single goal. As this W-League season moves from its early days stage and its patterns become established, the margins of error and victory are narrowing - and the cathartic potential in games which of late hinge on late finishes, ever brewing.",

      "bodyText": "Former emergency leaders who have been pushing the Morrison government to take action on the climate say they will \u201cgo it alone\u201d and convene their own summit on the bushfire crisis. The Emergency Leaders for Climate Action say they will hold the summit after the current bushfire season because of their \u201chuge disappointment in the lack of national leadership during a bushfire crisis\u201d. It comes as fires raged across New South Wales and Western Australia on Monday and as Australia was named as one of a handful of countries responsible for thwarting a global deal on the rulebook of the Paris climate agreement. A week ago, former fire chiefs Greg Mullins, from NSW, and Lee Johnson, from Queensland, called for a national summit on how the country should prepare for and resource bushfire emergencies in a changed climate. Both men are part of Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, a group of former fire and emergency chiefs who had warned the government that Australia faced a disastrous fire season. The group\u2019s ranks have expanded from 23 to 29 members since it first warned the government earlier this year that Australia was unprepared for the escalating climate threat. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Late last week the prime minister, Scott Morrison, moved to reassure voters he understood the fires were a national emergency and said climate change was one of many contributing factors to the current fire season. But Mullins said those \u201cmany factors are all related to climate change\u201d. \u201cWhat we feel is that there\u2019s just still this denial of the problem and where we have denial of the problem, there\u2019s not going to be any action,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll go it alone. We\u2019ll arrange a national summit that will look at building standards, fuel management practices, response capability and national coordination arrangements. \u201cWe\u2019ll invite the prime minister and we hope that he comes too.\u201d The Emergency Leaders for Climate Action said Australia had \u201cembarrassed\u201d itself through its performance at the United Nations climate conference in Madrid at a time when people around the world were watching reports about the country burning. Mike Brown, a former chief officer for the Tasmanian Fire Service, said the outlook for the next three months was for drier and hotter than average conditions for much of the country. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t stand well for how things develop into the summer,\u201d he said. Brown said the eastern half of Tasmania, including all of the east coast and the Derwent Valley, was particularly dry. It follows the summer of 2018-19, when huge fires hit world heritage forest. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of fuel reduction but the weather window in which to do fuel reduction is becoming narrower due to hotter and windier weather due to climate change,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou also can\u2019t do fuel reduction in wet forest types. We think that due to the changing climate there needs to be a fresh approach to manage fires and just how people in communities are going to be managed into the future when we\u2019re facing increased fire weather.\u201d The proposed summit would include fire service workers, Indigenous landowners, the military, the insurance industry and local governments.

      "bodyText": "BOOM! Almost \u00a350bn has been added to the value of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, as the City continues to celebrate Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory. The FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip companies has just closed 165 points higher at 7519 points, which is a four month high. That lifts its value by around \u00a341.5bn, and is the biggest points rally since the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016. The smaller FTSE 250 index also had another good day, closing 1.9% higher. That lifts its market capitalisation by around \u00a37.5bn. So in total, the 350 largest listed companies in London have risen by \u00a349bn today, on top of the \u00a333bn rally on Friday. Nearly every share on the FTSE rose today, with the banking sector up 3%, industrial stocks up 2.7%, and consumer non-cyclical firms up 2.5%. Relief that we finally have clarity about Brexit is the main factor. Stocks had also been depressed by concerns that a Labour government would have nationalised utilities and BT\u2019s broadband network. Plus, global markets are on a tear after the US and China hammered out a Phase One trade deal, despite some scepticism about whether the trade war is really over. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says the US election result has put City traders in the festive spirits. With clarity on Brexit and a first phase trade deal agreed investors are more than ready to jump aboard the Santa rally. This is the last full week of trading prior to the Christmas break, which means that volumes will be starting to thin out and any moves in the market could be exaggerated. With just a few minutes to go, the Footsie is firmly on track for its best day in three years... It\u2019s currently up 195 points, or 2.66%, at 7548. Still time for a late collapse, though.... #unlikely Upbeat economic data from America is also pushing shares higher. US business activity grew at its fastest pace in five months, IHS Markit reported. Its Flash US composite output index has risen to 52.2, from 52.0 in November, further above the 50-point mark showing growth. Company bosses reported a rise in new business, encouraging them to take on more staff. That suggests the US economy is in decent health.... ....as does a separate survey showing that US housebuilders are the most optimistic in 20 years. The FT explains: The National Association of Home Builders\u2019 Housing Market Index rose by 5 points to 76 \u2014 the highest reading since June 1999 \u2014 exceeding economists\u2019 forecasts for a reading of 70, according to a Reuters survey. The Dow Jones industrial average is also joining the party, hitting a record high a moment ago. The Dow is up 195 points, or 0.7%, at 28,330. Tech stocks are among the risers, after Donald Trump cancelled plans for new tariffs on Chinese-manufacturer products on Sunday. Telecoms equipment maker Cisco is up 2.8%, and Apple up 1.65%. Retail chain Sports Direct continues to lead the London Stock Market. It\u2019s up a staggering 30% today after reporting a 160% surge in profits for the last six months, with revenues up 14% following its acquisition of House of Fraser (leading to the company\u2019s name change to Frasers today) Today\u2019s rallies in Europe, the UK and Wall Street has driven global stock markets to their highest ever levels. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which measures stocks around the globe, has risen by 0.7% today to record levels. Wall Street has also opened at a record high, as trade war optimism ripples through New York. Both the broad S&amp;P 500 index and the tech-focused Nasdaq indices hit new peaks. Boom! The FTSE 250 index has hit a new record high. The index of medium-sized companies is up 385 points today, or 1.8%, at 21893. The FTSE 250 index contains firms who are too small for the FTSE 100, and is more domestically focused. Today\u2019s rally means its members are now worth \u00a37bn more than Friday night. The FTSE 100 index is firmly on track for its biggest one-day bounce since the aftermath of the EU referendum. The blue-chip index is currently up 2.6%, or 190 points, at 7543, as investors continue to drive stock prices higher. That means almost \u00a350bn has been added to the index\u2019s value so far today, on top of \u00a320bn added on Friday. This is its Footsie\u2019s biggest points gain, and percentage gain, since 29th June 2016 -- when the market was rebounding from the shock of the Brexit vote. \u201cThe \u2018Boris bounce\u2019 is providing a late turbocharge\u201d, says Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor. Classified car advertising business Autotrader is now the top gainer, up 5.6%, followed by Barclays (+5.2%) and financial marketplace Hargreaves Lansdown (+5.1%). There\u2019s another factor behind the market rally -- central bankers are maintaining easy monetary policy, and unlikely to raise interest rates anytime soon. Here\u2019s our news story on the UK\u201ds higher borrowing forecasts, and the deterioration in the UK economy this month: America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices are expected to hit fresh record highs when trading begins in just over an hour\u2019s time. Relief that the US and China have agreed a preliminary trade deal (although it\u2019s not signed and sealed yet) is lifting the mood on Wall Street. UK house prices are also expected to benefit from Boris Johnson\u2019s return to power. Property website Rightmove has predicted average prices will rise by 2% in 2020, with stronger prices in the North of England. Every sector that makes up the FTSE 100 is up today, in a broad-based rally. By my maths, around \u00a343bn has been added to the value of the Footsie today, on top of \u00a320bn on Friday as the Conservative Party won Thursday\u2019s election. Healthcare companies, industrial stocks, miners, telecoms companies, banks, tech firms and consumer-focused firms are all in demand. Indeed, academic publishing firm Pearson is the only faller, after being downgraded by City analysts. The smaller FTSE 250 is still up 1.3%, which adds another \u00a34bn to the combined value of its constituents. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, reckons the FTSE 100 index could climb to 8,000 points in a year\u2019s time, from around 7,500 today. He argues that the UK stock market has been \u201cunloved\u201d for some time, and arguably undervalued compared to likely corporate earnings. \u201cGranted, the issue of Brexit must still be resolved and doubts continue to hover over the health of the global economy. However, were the UK to strike a trade deal with the EU, Washington and Beijing to settle their differences once and for all and governments around the world abandon austerity and launch looser fiscal policies then the world could look very different. \u201cEven if the FTSE 100 fails to challenge the 8,000 mark, investors may still be able to prosper through careful stock selection, as the index is packed with companies which either look cheap on an earnings basis, offer a fat dividend yield, or both. This chart from AJ Bell shows how the UK market has lagged behind European rivals, and Wall Street, this year (although it\u2019s now closing the gap!) This is from Ben Chu of Newsnight about today\u2019s weak UK business data, and strong market rally: Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies is also having a strong day. It\u2019s up 1.2% or 258 points at 21766, back towards the record high touched on Friday. Sports Direct is the top riser, surging 27% after reporting a big jump in underlying profits. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Mike Ashley\u2019s retail empire forecasts profits of up to \u00a3390.3m for the year to April 2020 after underlying pretax profits increased 58% to \u00a3101.8m in the first half. Losses almost halved to \u00a315.9m at its premium lifestyle business, which includes House of Fraser, although the group plans to close more branches in the coming year. Sales for the half year to 27 October rose 14% to \u00a32bn, largely as a result of the inclusion of House of Fraser and growth at Flannels, the group\u2019s designer fashion chain. Excluding acquisitions, revenue at the core sports business fell 8.6%. David Daly, the chairman of the group, said he believed its strategy of \u201celevating\u201d, or moving towards more upmarket products and improved stores, was working. Sports Direct has also just won shareholder approval to change its name to Frasers. Rupert Harrison of BlackRock (a former top Treasury official) predicts better times ahead for the UK economy: In another blow, Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog has revised up its forecasts for government borrowing. The deficit will be roughly \u00a320bn higher per annum over the next five years, the Office for Budget Responsibility has calculated. This is largely due to \u201ca new accounting treatment for student loans and a material correction to corporation tax receipts,\u201d and is meant to give a better picture of the UK public finances. The OBR says: We have restated our March 2019 borrowing forecast to include recent ONS statistical changes but have not incorporated any other new data, new judgements nor include an update to the economy forecast. After incorporating these changes, borrowing has increased materially by around \u00a320bn each year. This means the 2019-20 deficit is now expected to hit \u00a347bn, not \u00a328.7bn expected. In 2020-21 it is seen at \u00a3 37.9bn, not \u00a318.9bn. So effectively, an extra \u00a3100bn of borrowing over the next five years! Although this is a mechanistic change (rather than being based on new economic policies or data), it suggests that the new government may have less firepower at its fingertips to increase spending, without breaking deficit targets. Britain\u2019s economic weakness could prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates soon, suggests Capital Economics. They told clients that borrowing costs could be lowered, from 0.75%, early in 2020 if the PMIs don\u2019t improve. The weak flash PMIs for the UK are another piece of evidence that suggests growth flat-lined in Q4. And if there isn\u2019t a pick-up in the surveys in the next few months, then the MPC may respond by cutting interest rates. By then, the BoE could have a new governor, with Mark Carney due to depart on 31 January. A decision is expected imminently. Former deputy governor Minouche Shafik is seen as a front-runner, with former US Federal Reserve official Kevin Warsh emerging as a surprise late contender... Howard Archer of EY Item Club suspects that the UK\u2019s PMI readings may improve, now the election is over. UK businesses have been pleading for some political certainty for months. Boris Johnson\u2019s election triumph certainly provides some (although it\u2019s far from clear how he\u2019ll secure a new EU trade deal by December 2020). Markit\u2019s PMI surveys are based on interviews with managers at companies across the world economy. This makes them more timely than official GDP data, and a handy gauge to sentiment in the economy. However, they don\u2019t always match up with the growth statistics, and can be more negative if bosses are most anxious. There\u2019s quite a contrast between UK economic activity in December (down down down), and the UK stock market (up up up) The City has responded to the grim PMI survey by..... driving shares even higher. The FTSE 100 is now up 157 points, or 2.1%, and on track for its best day since June 29 2016. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, blames anxiety over Brexit and the general election for the slump in business activity this month. \u201cThe continuing Brexit-related aversion to investment and a pre-election lack of consumer confidence led to the fastest fall in business activity in December since July 2016.... The biggest shock came in the form of the worst output performance from the manufacturing sector since July 2012. A lack of new orders and the unravelling of pre-Brexit inventories hampered progress and supply chain managers\u2019 purchasing dropped at the fastest pace since 2009 in the absence of a pipeline of work ready and waiting. Service companies had challenges of their own in the form of another modest rise in costs for food and fuel. Today\u2019s PMI survey was conducted before the general election -- so firms should now benefit from clarity over the UK\u2019s future. Brock, though, warns the Brexit won\u2019t be a picnic: The Brexit path is still littered with obstacles and the need for strong negotiation skills for a future EU agreement will be paramount to avoid this downward slide becoming the economic landscape for an extended period.\u201d Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, fears that the UK economy may contract in the final three months of 2019, given today\u2019s weak PMI report. That would put Britain back on the brink of recession - having also contracted in April-June, but grown in July-September. Williamson explains: \u201cDecember\u2019s PMI survey data sadly lacked festive cheer, indicating that the economy contracted for the third time in the past four months. The latest decline was the second- largest recorded over the past decade, and increases the likelihood that the economy contracted slightly in the fourth quarter as Brexit-related uncertainty intensified in the lead up to the general election. \u201cNew orders fell for a fifth straight month, causing jobs to be cut for a fourth successive month as firms scaled back operating capacity in line with weakened demand. \u201cThe principal drag on order books was falling export sales, with overseas demand for UK-produced goods and services slumping in the past two months to an extent not seen since at least 2014. \u201cManufacturing production is falling at a rate exceeded only once since the height of the global financial crisis in early- 2009, but output of the vast service sector has now also fallen in each of the past two months, representing the first back-to- back declines since 2009. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s private sector is continuing to shrink this month, raising fresh feats that the economy. Data firm Markit\u2019s \u201cFlash UK Composite Output Index\u201d, which tracks activity across the sector, has dropped to just 48.5 for December. That\u2019s the worst reading in over three and a half years, down from November\u2019s 49.3. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, so this suggests the UK economy is shrinking this month - and possibly over the last quarter. Company bossed blamed \u201cdomestic political uncertainty, a lack of clarity in relation to Brexit and subdued global economic conditions\u201d (so at least two of those problems are now resolved!) Factories are suffering a particularly bad month, with output shrinking at the fastest rate since 2012. Services companies, which make up the bulk of the economy, also reporting falling output. Here\u2019s the details: Flash UK Composite Output Index: 48.5, 41-month low (Nov final: 49.3) Flash UK Services Business Activity Index Dec: 49.0, 9-month low (Nov final: 49.3) Flash UK Manufacturing Output Index Dec: 45.8, 89-month low (Nov final: 49.1) Flash UK Manufacturing PMI: Dec: 47.4, 4-month low (Nov final: 48.9) Reaction to follow.... Shares are climbing steadily higher in London, lifting the FTSE 100 index to a four-month high. The Footsie is now 130 points up, or 1.77%, at 7483, its highest level since early August. British American Tobacco (+3.8%) and distribution firm Bunzl (3.5%) have forced their way to the top of a particularly crowded list of risers. Mining giant Glencore (+3.2%), Barclays bank (+3.2) and fashion chain Burberry (3.2%) are also battling for a spot on the podium. Just in: European companies have just posted their weakest growth in five years That\u2019s according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at eurozone companies, which contrast sharply with the sizzling mood in the markets. IHS Markit\u2019s eurozone composite PMI, just released, has stuck at 50.6 for December - unchanged from November. While the service sector expanded (with a PMI over 50), manufacturing continued to struggle. Markit says: The eurozone economy failed to pick up momentum in December, according to the flash PMI, rounding off a fourth quarter in which output rose at the weakest pace since the economy pulled out of its downturn in the second half of 2013. Employment growth slowed to a five-year low and price pressures moderated further. However, while the manufacturing recession deepened, the service sector showed welcome signs of resilience in the face of the headwinds from the factory downturn. By country, France continued to provide a key support to growth in the single currency area, but Germany remained in a mild downturn, fueled by a steepening manufacturing recession. Growth in the rest of the region continued to run at the slowest for six years. NEWSFLASH: European stock markets have hit an all-time high. The STOXX 600, which tracks companies across Europe, has gained 0.5% this morning. The rally is being driven by post-election gains in London. Nearly every stock on the FTSE 100 is higher this morning (banks and miners still leading the way). Optimism over the US-China trade talks is a key factor, of course, despite scepticism that Friday\u2019s Phase One deal is really a concrete breakthrough. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The US agreed to one of China\u2019s key red lines, i.e. rolling back pre-existing tariffs. However, that reversal has been described as \u2018minimal\u2019 \u2013 25% tariffs will be maintained on around $250 billion in goods, while only $120 billion will see the charges reduced to 7.5%. As for Trump\u2019s key demands, China will now reportedly purchase an extra $16 billion in agricultural goods per year, on top of the $24 billion already pencilled in, taking the total in 2020 and 2021 to at least $40 billion. The President himself said he thinks \u2018they\u2019ll hit $50 billion\u2019, and that they\u2019ve \u2018already stepped it up\u2019. However these figures have been greeted with scepticism, if just because of how steep that increase would need to be on historical purchases. In total, including agricultural, manufactured and energy products, the deal would dictate China buys an additional $200 billion in American goods. Another potential sticking point down the road could be the requirement for China to make \u2018structural reforms and other changes to its economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property, technology transfer, agriculture, financial services, and currency and foreign exchange\u2019 \u2013 a vast swathe of significant adjustments in exchange for a relatively minor reduction in tariffs. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts stock markets could keep rallying in the coming months. We think it is significant that the announcement represents the first time that trade negotiations have successfully led to an actual reduction in tariffs, rather than a mere delay. We may have reached the point of \u201cpeak tariffs\u201d and this deal could be the start of a series of phased rollbacks, which could unlock further upside for equity markets, driven by an improvement in business confidence and a recovery in investment. Attractive valuations for stocks relative to high grade bonds should lead to outperformance over a six- to 12-month investment horizon. The post-election rally has pushed the pound to its strongest point against the euro since the EU referendum. One euro now buys 83p, the least in over three years, as the City welcomes the end of that \u2018political paralysis\u2019. The pound has also risen in early trading. Against the US dollar, sterling is up half a cent at $1.3375. It\u2019s also picked up against the euro, back over \u20ac1.20. Holger Schmieding of German bank Berenberg has told clients that Boris Johnson\u2019s win ends the \u201cpolitical paralysis\u201d in the UK - good news for the markets. First, the political clarity will allow both sides to move on. That the key political question, Brexit or no Brexit, has now been settled unequivocally takes some of the venom out of the debate within the UK and between the UK and the EU27. That will leave more room for pragmatic compromises, especially on the UK side. Second...Johnson\u2019s solid majority in parliament will allow him to sideline the Brexit hardliners in his Conservative Party and conclude a sensible free-trade deal with the EU and/or extend the transition period during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union beyond the end of 2020 if need be. Third, companies and markets get used to risks over time. They have repeatedly faced the risk of a no-deal Brexit in the last twelve months and guarded themselves against it at least to some extent. The prospect that it might still happen at the end of 2020 will be less disruptive than a hard Brexit would have been the first or second time around. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of blue-chip stocks has jumped by 58 points, or 0.8%, at the start of trading. That takes the Footsie up to 7413 points, close to a two-week high. Financial stocks are among the risers, with Royal Bank of Scotland rising 3% and Barclays up 1.5%. That suggests increased optimism over the UK\u2019s economic outlook. Trade optimism is lifting mining stocks, with Glencore gaining 1.8% and BHP Group up 1.5%. China\u2019s stock market has risen by 0.5% this morning, as traders welcome news of the Phase One trade deal with the US. But the big action is in Australia, which has posted its biggest one-day rise in seven months. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 index gained 1.6% towards a record high, with mining stocks benefitting from trade optimism. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a little early for the fabled Santa Rally. But relief that the US and China have reached a preliminary trade deal is pushing markets higher as the final full trading week of 2019 begins. On Friday, China and the US both held separate press conferences to announce that they reached a so-called phase one trade deal. This ends months of conflict, which has weighed on the global economy.. Under the plan, China has agreed to significantly increase its purchases of US products such as soybeans, factory foods and oil. In return. America has dropped a plan to impose more tariffs on Chinese imports yesterday, and has lowered other tariffs instead. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer insists it\u2019s a significant breakthrough, telling CBS last night that \u201cthis is totally done, absolutely.\u201d But also revealed the text needs to be translated and revised, so there\u2019s still the danger of a last-minute hitch. Economist are looking for details about what\u2019s been agreed, and whether a more comprehensive trade deal will follow in 2002. As ING puts it: What the market needs now, though, is clarity around exactly what the deal entails. The longer we have to wait for this detail, the more likely market participants will start to question how good a deal it actually is.\u201d But at least we have some certainty on trade, as we do on UK politics. The Conservative Party\u2019s hefty election win last week is lifting sentiment in the City, and likely to drive shares higher in London. That would add to Friday\u2019s surge, which saw \u00a333bn wiped onto shares in a rally led by housebuilders, utility companies and banks. Also coming up today The latest\u2019 flash surveys of purchasing managers from the UK, Europe and the US are released; they may show that the recent economic slowdown is bottoming out. Britain\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility is releasing new forecasts for tax, spending and borrowing. These fiscal forecasts were delayed because of the election, and now arrive as Boris Johnson plans a new multi-billion spending spree for those Northern constituencies who turned blue last week. After the markets close, the Bank of England will release its latest healthcheck on Britain\u2019s banks. The stress tests examine: ..the resilience of the UK banking system to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies, a financial market stress, and an independent stress of misconduct costs. Overall, the stress is more severe than the financial crisis. The agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone flash PMIs for December; expecte to rise to 50.7 from 50.6 9.30am GMT: UK flash PMIs for December; expected to rise to 49.5 from 49.3 9.30am GMT: UK\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility to publish fiscal forecasts 2.45pm GMT: US flash PMI for December 5pm GMT: Bank of England to publish UK bank stress tests",

On the physical high street, though, Boxing Day promotions could arrive even earlier. The operational challenges that sales present in-store mean some retailers could be offering Boxing Day sale prices on Christmas Eve, for those willing to hit the shops early.\u201d",

For supporters of independence there is now an inescapable sense of momentum, and of an opportunity greater than in 2014 when they fought and lost the first referendum.</p> <p>Sturgeon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/nicola-sturgeon-to-publish-independence-referendum-blueprint\">sketched out her case</a> six hours after the last Scottish seat was declared. Her party had seized 80% of Scotland\u2019s seats. In every recent election, she said, Scotland had voted differently from the rest of the UK. It was a question of accountability and democracy, a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d.</p> <p>On Sunday Sturgeon intensified the rhetoric, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/nicola-sturgeon-scotland-cannot-be-imprisoned-in-uk\">declaring</a> on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that Scotland could not be \u201cimprisoned in the UK against its will\u201d.</p> <p>Alongside publishing her referendum paper, Sturgeon will write formally to Boris Johnson asking his government to give Holyrood the legal powers to stage an independence vote. Johnson told Sturgeon on Friday he would refuse, setting up a constitutional standoff that could end in the courts.</p> <p>For the independence movement, last week\u2019s election reinforced its frustration with the UK\u2019s constitutional arrangements. A rightwing Conservative government led by an old Etonian won a landslide victory gifted by English voters. In Scotland the Tory vote fell by 3.5 percentage points and the party lost seven seats.</p> <p>With an 80-seat majority, Johnson is now able to force through Brexit, a policy rejected by Scottish voters in 2016, when 62% backed remain, and last week, when 75% of the Scottish vote went to parties opposing his plans.</p> <p>Like Johnson, Sturgeon gambled that the snap general election would bolster her party\u2019s position. Alongside the Liberal Democrats, the SNP at Westminster pushed Jeremy Corbyn into supporting it. The gamble paid off, delivering her a better result than expected. In a repeat of 2015, Labour was left with one Scottish seat. In 2010, when Gordon Brown was Labour leader, it won 41.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6b3fee486077276cf19cf7e45a00473ba259107\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6b3fee486077276cf19cf7e45a00473ba259107/0_0_4507_2704/1000.jpg\" alt=\"SNP MPs in Westminster\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, with the party\u2019s MPs outside parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some Scottish Labour figures, badly bruised by yet another humiliating election result, endorse Sturgeon\u2019s arguments about Scotland\u2019s right to choose. </p> <p>Kezia Dugdale, who quit as Scottish Labour leader largely due to Corbyn\u2019s ambivalence on Brexit, tweeted that pro-UK campaigners were \u201cwasting precious time\u201d arguing about Sturgeon\u2019s mandate. Their arguments in 2014 that Scotland could be assured of a progressive Labour government and continued EU membership through the UK had \u201cmelted away\u201d on Friday, she said. \u201cYou need a new argument for the union which isn\u2019t rooted in Queen and country unionism,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kezdugdale/status/1206145018127405056?s=11\">she said</a>.</p> <p>Sturgeon has been choosing her language carefully, framing the case for a referendum around choice. To her frustration, Westminster\u2019s chaotic handling of Brexit and Johnson\u2019s subsequent election as Tory leader has not led to a surge in support for independence.</p> <p>The polls show support averaging around 48%. The latest poll by YouGov for the Times the week before the election found a five-point fall in the yes vote, down to 44% excluding don\u2019t knows.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s election arguably produced a majority of votes for anti-independence parties: the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems won 54% of the vote. (The pro-independence Scottish Greens took 1%.) Sturgeon acknowledges that many votes the SNP attracted last week were pro-EU, including from former Labour voters disillusioned by Corbyn\u2019s record on Brexit. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/snp_elex-zip/giv-39028spK5RX0aSrP/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/snp_elex-zip/giv-39028spK5RX0aSrP/\">Graph</a> </figure>  <p>The intersecting issues at stake in this election mean it is impossible to read the SNP\u2019s success as an unambiguous endorsement of independence. Some voters may have backed the party without sharing its commitment to going it alone in the end. Sturgeon told Marr on Sunday: \u201cI don\u2019t presume everyone who voted SNP on Thursday is yet prepared to back independence \u2026 but it\u2019s for the people of Scotland to decide.\u201d</p> <p>But the polls also show evidence of a potential yes vote ready to be tapped. Several this year have said the combination of a Johnson government and Brexit could nudge the yes vote above 50%. There is higher support for holding a referendum, and polls that ask the question show a majority of Scots expect independence to take place over the next decade. Thanks to the new referendum bill, EU citizens in Scotland would be able to vote too, which is expected to boost the yes vote.</p> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s challenge is converting that potential into concrete support. The largest reservoir to tap is pro-EU voters \u2013 most likely Labour or Lib Dem supporters \u2013 who voted no in 2014.</p> <p>The first minister believes that a Johnson government pushing through illiberal policies that challenge centrist norms valued by Scottish voters \u2013 in areas such such as the welfare system, redistributive taxation and the BBC \u2013 will help her case. Johnson will continue investing in a new nuclear weapons system to replace Trident, which the UK government assumes will be based, like Trident, at Faslane submarine base near Glasgow. That policy drives up the yes vote.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s Brexit model will be another strong card. Sturgeon will focus on his decision to give Northern Ireland special protections, keeping it within the EU\u2019s customs union and retaining an open border with Ireland, and will ask why Scotland does not get similar privileges. She will focus on any moves by the UK to dilute EU environmental, social or food standards rules.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a46172c0ee5c8f91db723e3f9ded4440b938f89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a46172c0ee5c8f91db723e3f9ded4440b938f89e/743_295_3301_1981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-Brexit protesters in Glasgow in August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anti-Brexit protesters in Glasgow in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Buchanan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She will continue pressing the case for Scotland to have much greater say in UK immigration policy post-Brexit, and extra privileges tailored to Scottish needs, pointing at Scotland\u2019s ageing population and workforce shortages. Scotland\u2019s latest GDP figures are due to be published this week: if they again show a weakening economy, Brexit will be blamed.</p> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s opponents argue this is much trickier territory for the yes campaign than she will concede. The Scottish government is heavily dependent on Treasury subsidies for its spending, with public spending nearly \u00a32,000 per head higher than the UK average, leaving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/21/scotland-2018-deficit-higher-than-uk-as-a-whole-last-year\">an overall deficit</a> in day-to-day spending equal to 7% of GDP, the highest in the EU.</p> <p>Sturgeon will face searching questions about how an independent Scotland could maintain public services while driving down that deficit; whether there would be a customs border at Berwick and Gretna Green, with tariffs inhibiting trade with the rest of the UK; whether Scotland could continue using sterling as its currency and still apply for EU membership; and how Scotland could continue to afford to fund pensions without the <a href=\"https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/Exports/ESSPublication\">UK\u2019s financial support</a>.</p> <p>Sturgeon\u2019s view is that it is all up for negotiation, and that much could be dealt with during a transitional period or by treaty. She has her own cards to play: she could trade the UK\u2019s continued use of Faslane for preferential arrangements on debt and pensions, and the UK will still need Scotland\u2019s significant renewal electricity output.</p> <p>For now her strategists focus on building momentum. That will involve getting endorsements: lists of celebrities, well-known politicians and industrialists who have converted to independence or who simply endorse the right to choose are being prepared. Grassroots independence campaigns have marches planned.</p> <p>Perhaps Sturgeon\u2019s greatest asset is her enemies\u2019 weakness. Who speaks for the union? There is no prospect now of a joint effort involving Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems replicating the Better Together campaign of 2014. With Johnson toxic in Scotland, the pro-UK campaign has no obvious message carrier. As Dugdale points out, the Labour party has failed to table a credible counter-offer.</p> <p>Dugdale\u2019s successor as Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, had hoped there was time for the party to join the Lib Dems in embracing federalism across the UK. His timetable was ruined by the snap election, and Labour\u2019s heavy defeat makes it far harder to persuade voters it can ever deliver an alternative.</p>",

With an 80-seat majority, Johnson is now able to force through Brexit, a policy rejected by Scottish voters in 2016, when 62% backed remain, and last week, when 75% of the Scottish vote went to parties opposing his plans. Like Johnson, Sturgeon gambled that the snap general election would bolster her party\u2019s position. Alongside the Liberal Democrats, the SNP at Westminster pushed Jeremy Corbyn into supporting it. The gamble paid off, delivering her a better result than expected. In a repeat of 2015, Labour was left with one Scottish seat. In 2010, when Gordon Brown was Labour leader, it won 41. Some Scottish Labour figures, badly bruised by yet another humiliating election result, endorse Sturgeon\u2019s arguments about Scotland\u2019s right to choose. Kezia Dugdale, who quit as Scottish Labour leader largely due to Corbyn\u2019s ambivalence on Brexit, tweeted that pro-UK campaigners were \u201cwasting precious time\u201d arguing about Sturgeon\u2019s mandate. Their arguments in 2014 that Scotland could be assured of a progressive Labour government and continued EU membership through the UK had \u201cmelted away\u201d on Friday, she said. \u201cYou need a new argument for the union which isn\u2019t rooted in Queen and country unionism,\u201d she said. Sturgeon has been choosing her language carefully, framing the case for a referendum around choice. To her frustration, Westminster\u2019s chaotic handling of Brexit and Johnson\u2019s subsequent election as Tory leader has not led to a surge in support for independence. The polls show support averaging around 48%. The latest poll by YouGov for the Times the week before the election found a five-point fall in the yes vote, down to 44% excluding don\u2019t knows. Last week\u2019s election arguably produced a majority of votes for anti-independence parties: the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems won 54% of the vote. (The pro-independence Scottish Greens took 1%.) Sturgeon acknowledges that many votes the SNP attracted last week were pro-EU, including from former Labour voters disillusioned by Corbyn\u2019s record on Brexit. The intersecting issues at stake in this election mean it is impossible to read the SNP\u2019s success as an unambiguous endorsement of independence. Some voters may have backed the party without sharing its commitment to going it alone in the end. Sturgeon told Marr on Sunday: \u201cI don\u2019t presume everyone who voted SNP on Thursday is yet prepared to back independence \u2026 but it\u2019s for the people of Scotland to decide.\u201d But the polls also show evidence of a potential yes vote ready to be tapped. Several this year have said the combination of a Johnson government and Brexit could nudge the yes vote above 50%. There is higher support for holding a referendum, and polls that ask the question show a majority of Scots expect independence to take place over the next decade. Thanks to the new referendum bill, EU citizens in Scotland would be able to vote too, which is expected to boost the yes vote. Sturgeon\u2019s challenge is converting that potential into concrete support. The largest reservoir to tap is pro-EU voters \u2013 most likely Labour or Lib Dem supporters \u2013 who voted no in 2014. The first minister believes that a Johnson government pushing through illiberal policies that challenge centrist norms valued by Scottish voters \u2013 in areas such such as the welfare system, redistributive taxation and the BBC \u2013 will help her case. Johnson will continue investing in a new nuclear weapons system to replace Trident, which the UK government assumes will be based, like Trident, at Faslane submarine base near Glasgow. That policy drives up the yes vote. Johnson\u2019s Brexit model will be another strong card. Sturgeon will focus on his decision to give Northern Ireland special protections, keeping it within the EU\u2019s customs union and retaining an open border with Ireland, and will ask why Scotland does not get similar privileges. She will focus on any moves by the UK to dilute EU environmental, social or food standards rules. She will continue pressing the case for Scotland to have much greater say in UK immigration policy post-Brexit, and extra privileges tailored to Scottish needs, pointing at Scotland\u2019s ageing population and workforce shortages. Scotland\u2019s latest GDP figures are due to be published this week: if they again show a weakening economy, Brexit will be blamed. Sturgeon\u2019s opponents argue this is much trickier territory for the yes campaign than she will concede. The Scottish government is heavily dependent on Treasury subsidies for its spending, with public spending nearly \u00a32,000 per head higher than the UK average, leaving an overall deficit in day-to-day spending equal to 7% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Sturgeon will face searching questions about how an independent Scotland could maintain public services while driving down that deficit; whether there would be a customs border at Berwick and Gretna Green, with tariffs inhibiting trade with the rest of the UK; whether Scotland could continue using sterling as its currency and still apply for EU membership; and how Scotland could continue to afford to fund pensions without the UK\u2019s financial support. Sturgeon\u2019s view is that it is all up for negotiation, and that much could be dealt with during a transitional period or by treaty. She has her own cards to play: she could trade the UK\u2019s continued use of Faslane for preferential arrangements on debt and pensions, and the UK will still need Scotland\u2019s significant renewal electricity output. For now her strategists focus on building momentum. That will involve getting endorsements: lists of celebrities, well-known politicians and industrialists who have converted to independence or who simply endorse the right to choose are being prepared. Grassroots independence campaigns have marches planned. Perhaps Sturgeon\u2019s greatest asset is her enemies\u2019 weakness. Who speaks for the union? There is no prospect now of a joint effort involving Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems replicating the Better Together campaign of 2014. With Johnson toxic in Scotland, the pro-UK campaign has no obvious message carrier. As Dugdale points out, the Labour party has failed to table a credible counter-offer. Dugdale\u2019s successor as Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, had hoped there was time for the party to join the Lib Dems in embracing federalism across the UK. His timetable was ruined by the snap election, and Labour\u2019s heavy defeat makes it far harder to persuade voters it can ever deliver an alternative.",

A Spanish second division match was abandoned at half-time on Sunday after Albacete forward Roman Zozulya was subjected to offensive chanting from Rayo Vallecano supporters, who accused him of being a Nazi. Completely normal behaviour in China. And Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r admitted Manchester United lacked the \u201cideas\u201d required to beat Big Dunc\u2019s Toffees, momentarily forgetting that he was the person that was paid to provide them.

One of the English Big Cup representatives will not be with us by the time the quarter-finals rolls around \u2013 that\u2019s your tie-by-tie clickbait from floating-football-brain-in-a-jar Jonathan Wilson.

Even after all the years since, it wasn\u2019t OK for women to be amazing.\u201d</p> <p>So began an energetic campaign to right that wrong, initiated by Evie\u2019s mother, Anya Pearson, and using the slogan \u201c<a href=\"https://www.maryanningrocks.co.uk/\">Mary Anning Rocks</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In a little more than a year it has attracted the support of thousands of people online, raised thousands of pounds and recruited an impressive roster of <a href=\"https://www.maryanningrocks.co.uk/patrons\">patrons</a> including Sir David Attenborough, Prof Alice Roberts and the novelist Tracy Chevalier .</p> <p>This week they are hoping for another boost to the campaign. In a happy coincidence, Ammonite, a film about Anning <a href=\"https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/17523228.excitement-in-lyme-regis-as-kate-winslet-and-saoirse-ronan-film-ammonite/\">starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan</a>, was filmed in Lyme Regis this year, after which the filmmakers made a donation of \u00a315,000 to the town. On Tuesday Lyme Regis town council is due to decide how that money should be spent, and many local people have argued <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/groups/2101191606810326?view=permalink&amp;id=2255689548027197\">in favour of the statue</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d58234b6bac6dd0bf51c33f3ff9fa92eb4c5c931\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d58234b6bac6dd0bf51c33f3ff9fa92eb4c5c931/538_151_3320_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Winslet on the set of Ammonite in Lyme Regis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Winslet on the set of Ammonite in Lyme Regis earlier this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Hunt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pearson said she started the campaign because \u201cto be honest I felt ashamed about it.

The campaigners plan to start crowdfunding in earnest in the new year and hope the film\u2019s expected release in 2020 will turbo-charge their efforts.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for<a href=\"http://www.see-saw-films.com/\"> See-Saw Films</a>, the company behind Ammonite, said it had made the donation \u201cbecause it was very important to us to shoot in Lyme Regis where Mary Anning lived and we had such great support from the residents of Lyme\u201d.</p> <p>How would Evie feel if she succeeds in getting a statue of her heroine installed? \u201cI am going to be really happy,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause finally Mary [will have] the statue that she deserves.\u201d </p>",

And I thought it wasn\u2019t right. Even after all the years since, it wasn\u2019t OK for women to be amazing.\u201d So began an energetic campaign to right that wrong, initiated by Evie\u2019s mother, Anya Pearson, and using the slogan \u201cMary Anning Rocks\u201d. In a little more than a year it has attracted the support of thousands of people online, raised thousands of pounds and recruited an impressive roster of patrons including Sir David Attenborough, Prof Alice Roberts and the novelist Tracy Chevalier . This week they are hoping for another boost to the campaign. In a happy coincidence, Ammonite, a film about Anning starring Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, was filmed in Lyme Regis this year, after which the filmmakers made a donation of \u00a315,000 to the town. On Tuesday Lyme Regis town council is due to decide how that money should be spent, and many local people have argued in favour of the statue. Pearson said she started the campaign because \u201cto be honest I felt ashamed about it. I saw my daughter get really angry that this incredible woman had not got recognition in her home town. I just couldn\u2019t get my head around it. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to sit back and just accept these things, but sometimes it just needs somebody to take up the mantle.\u201d Her motto was \u201cGo big or go to bed\u201d \u2013 and go big she did. The Natural History Museum has thrown its weight behind the campaign, with its head of Earth sciences, Prof Richard Herrington, declaring that a statue in Lyme Regis \u201cwould be a fitting tribute to a woman who changed the face of geology\u201d. Despite so far having raised only a fraction of what they will need, Pearson is already talking to a number of leading sculptors, insisting there is one point on which the team will not compromise. \u201cWe want a female sculptor. End of.\u201d Mary Anning Rocks is not the only good cause hoping for a slice of the filmmakers\u2019 cash: seven other groups have put in bids, including a local cancer charity that wants to erect a respite beach hut, and a scholarship fund in Anning\u2019s name to help disadvantaged local young people study Earth sciences. Even if the statue campaign\u2019s bid is successful on Tuesday, it will still have some way to go in funding a project expected to cost a high five-figure sum at least. The campaigners plan to start crowdfunding in earnest in the new year and hope the film\u2019s expected release in 2020 will turbo-charge their efforts. A spokeswoman for See-Saw Films, the company behind Ammonite, said it had made the donation \u201cbecause it was very important to us to shoot in Lyme Regis where Mary Anning lived and we had such great support from the residents of Lyme\u201d. How would Evie feel if she succeeds in getting a statue of her heroine installed? \u201cI am going to be really happy,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause finally Mary [will have] the statue that she deserves.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The wife of Zimbabwe\u2019s vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, has been accused of attempting to kill him by disconnecting his life support while he was undergoing treatment in hospital this year. Marry Chiwenga, n\u00e9e Mubaiwa, was arrested at the weekend and appeared at Harare\u2019s magistrates court on Monday where she was remanded in custody. She is accused of illegally transferring almost US$1m (\u00a3740,000) overseas to purchase luxury cars and property, and faces additional charges of attempted murder. Constantino Chiwenga, who played a leading role in ousting Robert Mugabe in a military takeover in 2017, has a serious disease of the oesophagus, which has made eating difficult and has required months of hospital treatment. The 63-year-old former army chief is a controversial figure, blamed by many for recent waves of repression in the former British colony. The court case and accusations will focus attention once more on Zimbabwe\u2019s opaque political elite, which is frequently accused of graft and incompetent economic management, and on the significant wealth of some individuals. Police documents allege that Merry Chiwenga travelled to South Africa with her seriously ill husband in June and attempted to prevent him from seeking medical attention until his security detail intervened. In July she went to the private hospital in Pretoria where he was being treated and told staff to leave her alone with him before disconnecting vital equipment, police allege. When security personnel and medical staff intervened, she left the hospital, the documents claim. The vice-president was later treated in China and has since returned to Zimbabwe. His wife has said she is innocent of any wrongdoing. Local media reported that the marriage of the former beauty queen and the former head of the armed forces had collapsed. Zimbabwe\u2019s anti-corruption commission brought the fraud and money laundering charges against Merry Chiwenga. The commission has pursued a series of high-profile figures in the last year, jailing several of them. Critics say the commission is highly politicised and its targets are all enemies of senior officials in the government of the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa. Zimbabwe faces a profound economic crisis exacerbated by drought. Millions of people there are reliant on food aid. Many of the problems are a legacy of decades of mismanagement under Mugabe, who died in September. The rising prices have reminded many of the economic collapse just over a decade ago, when hyperinflation emptied shelves of basic foodstuffs and led the country to abandon its currency. The situation in rural areas is particularly bad, aid workers in Zimbabwe say, though there is growing evidence of widespread malnutrition in cities too.",

Whittington hospital NHS trust in north London has admitted negligently failing to detect signs of cervical cancer for more than four years. That oversight led to the woman, identified only as XX, developing highly invasive malignancy, which required chemo-radiotherapy treatment and left her infertile at the age of 29. She was awarded \u00a3580,000 in damages but the high court refused to make further payments to cover the costs of four surrogacies in California because such commercial arrangements are illegal in the UK. XX, now 36, has said one of her \u201ccentral ambitions in life\u201d is to have a family and that, despite the \u201cprofound, distressing and life-altering injuries\u201d caused by her treatment, her loss of fertility is her \u201cmajor concern\u201d. Her lawyers have argued that she should be granted the costs of surrogacy in California, where the practice is legal and binding, saying that \u201cin 2019, the civil courts should no longer have any role in censuring a woman\u2019s reproductive choice\u201d. Last December, the court of appeal overturned the high court ruling declaring that the patient was entitled to an additional \u00a3560,000 to cover the cost of having children with commercial surrogates in the US. At the supreme court on Monday, the Whittington trust appealed against that decision, maintaining that commercial surrogacy is \u201ccontrary to public policy\u201d. The case is the last that Lady Hale, the president of the supreme court, will hear before her retirement next month. Opening the trust\u2019s appeal, Lord Faulks QC said: \u201cThis is a very sad case.\u201d XX should not be entitled to \u201cthe cost of obtaining a child through surrogacy, whether that should be by way of altruistic or commercial surrogacy in the UK or abroad. \u201cWhatever the view the court takes about altruistic surrogacy, there should be no award of damages for commercial surrogacy since an award would be contrary to public policy.\u201d Faulks said there had not been a significant move towards commercial surrogacy in the UK and that the parliamentary process [as opposed to the courts] was much better suited to any change in the law. In written submissions, XX\u2019s barrister, Christopher Johnston QC, said both his client and anyone involved in the proposed commercial surrogacies would not be transgressing any laws in the UK or California. There had been a significant shift in favour of surrogacy in the approach of parliament, government and society in the past 20 years, he said, and it was almost certain the family courts would facilitate any such surrogacy by granting an order confirming that XX and her partner were the surrogate children\u2019s parents. In those circumstances, Johnston added, \u201cconsistency in the application of the law strongly supports rejecting this attempt to censure Ms XX\u2019s reproductive choices and bar her from the full compensation to which she would otherwise be entitled\u201d. She had very limited opportunities to have a baby from her own eggs, with each attempt facing \u201ca significant risk of failure\u201d, he added. Johnston also said that \u201cin the UK, where surrogacy arrangements are unenforceable, there is the additional risk that the surrogate mother would keep Ms XX\u2019s baby\u201d. The supreme court is hearing the case on Monday and Tuesday. It is is expected to reserve judgment until the new year.",

The former miner and Labour councillor had previously been reprimanded by the party for sexist comments. He was also caught on camera asking a friend to pose as an anti-Labour swing voter to impress journalist Michael Crick. The Guardian disclosed that he was warned about his conduct by the Tories after posting a sexist comment on Facebook in July 2018. The posting showed a photo of Anderson looking at the chest of a female canvasser in a vest top.

Hart, who holds the seat of the former Tory minister Amber Rudd, posted a link to a YouTube video in 2017 about the EU, which used Soros\u2019s image. The businessman has been the victim of antisemitic slurs in which he is portrayed as pulling strings in the EU. She then liked a comment left underneath the video that said \u201cEin Reich\u201d, a Nazi slogan. The Conservative party has launched an inquiry into the posting which was later expanded after Hart endorsed a blog post by an anti-Islam activist claiming Muslim organisations were trying to brainwash young Americans. Hart had already caused controversy this election when it was revealed at a hustings that she had claimed some people with learning disabilities should be paid less than the minimum wage because they \u201cdon\u2019t understand money\u201d. She said her comments had been taken out of context but apologised for causing offence. Anthony Browne A former aide to Boris Johnson and an ex-journalist, Browne faced calls to stand down as a candidate during the campaign after Labour accused him of \u201cdisgusting racism\u201d. It related to some of his writings from 2002 and 2003 that blamed immigrants for bringing germs and HIV to the UK and accused Muslims of having divided loyalties.

However, no action was taken against Browne, a former policy chief to Johnson at City Hall, as the party said the allegations were made over 15 years ago and he had apologised for the remarks in the past. Karl McCartney The MP for Lincoln apologised during the election campaign for sharing several posts from the far-right activist Tommy Robinson including alleged \u201canti-Muslim material\u201d.

What did you think we were going to do? Die in a ditch? Hide in a fridge? Civil servants don\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t \u2013 have that option. No, you don\u2019t have to be a true believer to be a good civil servant: I\u2019m living proof. But you do need to be committed to implementing the policies of the government \u2013 of whatever colour.

More on him in a bit.</p> \n<p>Naturally, we\u2019re all champing at the bit to find out exactly what the government plans to do with its shiny new majority. Will the Department for Exiting the European Union <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/johnson-urged-abolish-dexeu-1-february\" title=\"\">vanish</a>, Marty McFly-style, after the UK successfully travels back to 1973?

Will the Department for International Trade be absorbed into a mega-business department headed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/10/three-ministers-make-top-10-in-list-of-most-influential-uk-asians\" title=\"\">Rishi Sunak</a>? Of course, not all of these predictions will turn out to be true \u2013 common sense suggests that the amount of time and money involved in making wholesale changes to government institutions requires caution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6e4923da-fd05-4190-b5ac-0cb4efa3bf7e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/97bug1-rttM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Thing is, there\u2019s more than a whiff of change in the wind, and it\u2019s likely that this \u201cwho dares wins\u201d prime minister may throw caution to it. The slightly chilling new lexicon that\u2019s emerging to describe the \u201cgovernment of the people\u201d may well be how that change is branded.</p> \n<p>Which brings us back to Dominic Cummings, who according to the Telegraph and the Times \u2013 and as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/01/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-whitehall-democracy-civil-servants\" title=\"\">I predicted</a> in August \u2013 will spearhead this radicalist overhaul of the civil service.</p> \n<p>We won\u2019t find out too much more about this until after the new parliament boots Brexit over the line at the end of January. But right now \u2013 while the government is still assembling itself, Avengers-style \u2013 is an excellent time to ask what\u2019s going to happen to a civil service still catching its breath after three brutal years of wrestling with the contradictions of Brexit.</p> \n<p>I have three predictions. First, we can expect an initial honeymoon period for the civil service. For example, it\u2019s likely that as soon as Brexit stops being a political front-page issue and starts becoming a technical page-six issue, you can expect to start hearing cabinet ministers talk again about the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-brilliant-civil-service-vision-statement/civil-service-vision-2015-to-2020\" title=\"\">brilliant civil service</a>\u201d. As long as we behave ourselves, that is: the increased frequency of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/06/leaked-brexit-paper-unstitches-pms-northern-ireland-claims-says-corbyn\" title=\"\">policy leaks</a> to the Sunday Times and the Financial Times in the months up to the general election will very likely continue in 2020. But all honeymoons come to an end. And given what Cummings <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prime-ministers-cummings-plan-for-civil-service-zv85vxd8z\" title=\"\">has just said</a> about wanting to make the hiring and firing of civil servants easier, unbelievers of all stripes should expect some very tough love. </p> \n<p>Second, Boris Johnson will continue to impregnate the civil service with new policy challenges, like the idea that getting Brexit done will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/08/will-getting-brexit-done-create-another-baby-boom-in-the-uk-factcheck\" title=\"\">trigger</a> a baby boom. The prime minister may have a point \u2013 with a stagnant economy and the high cost of contraceptives, unprotected sex will soon be the only entertainment post-Brexit Britain can afford. We are all children of Boris now.</p> \n<p>Number three might expose me to accusations of wide-eyed naivete \u2013 but a civil service damaged by Brexit will only strengthen its commitment to the UK public.

      "bodyText": "Those who work for the government clearly are no better at predicting the future than any other group of ringside spectators at the UK\u2019s political circus. Last Friday\u2019s electoral earthquake was as remarkable to us as it was to you. But we\u2019re professionals: sure, many on the civil service payroll will have voted for or against a Conservative majority. Some of us rather naughtily may even have taken part in election campaign activity. But back at our Whitehall offices we prepared for this blue tsunami no less than we prepared for the possibilities of Labour or coalition governments. As it turned out, those of a remain persuasion have had to compress our K\u00fcbler-Ross grief cycle into a couple of days so that we can crack on with helping the new government get its feet under the desk. Sorry, folks. What did you think we were going to do? Die in a ditch? Hide in a fridge? Civil servants don\u2019t \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t \u2013 have that option. No, you don\u2019t have to be a true believer to be a good civil servant: I\u2019m living proof. But you do need to be committed to implementing the policies of the government \u2013 of whatever colour. Like many voters, sometimes you just have to hold your nose. In fact, today our boss Mark Sedwill \u2013 aided by senior civil servants across several departments \u2013 will be preparing to brief a few incoming new ministers following the mini-reshuffle that is under way this week. Sedwill is also tipped to take a central role in driving the far deeper government shake-up in February \u2013 along with a certain D Cummings. More on him in a bit. Naturally, we\u2019re all champing at the bit to find out exactly what the government plans to do with its shiny new majority. Will the Department for Exiting the European Union vanish, Marty McFly-style, after the UK successfully travels back to 1973? Will the Department for International Development \u2013 with its tempting multibillion aid budget \u2013 be tucked into the Foreign Office like a Faberg\u00e9 egg into a dusty satchel? Will the Department for International Trade be absorbed into a mega-business department headed by Rishi Sunak? Of course, not all of these predictions will turn out to be true \u2013 common sense suggests that the amount of time and money involved in making wholesale changes to government institutions requires caution. Thing is, there\u2019s more than a whiff of change in the wind, and it\u2019s likely that this \u201cwho dares wins\u201d prime minister may throw caution to it. The slightly chilling new lexicon that\u2019s emerging to describe the \u201cgovernment of the people\u201d may well be how that change is branded. Which brings us back to Dominic Cummings, who according to the Telegraph and the Times \u2013 and as I predicted in August \u2013 will spearhead this radicalist overhaul of the civil service. We won\u2019t find out too much more about this until after the new parliament boots Brexit over the line at the end of January. But right now \u2013 while the government is still assembling itself, Avengers-style \u2013 is an excellent time to ask what\u2019s going to happen to a civil service still catching its breath after three brutal years of wrestling with the contradictions of Brexit. I have three predictions. First, we can expect an initial honeymoon period for the civil service. For example, it\u2019s likely that as soon as Brexit stops being a political front-page issue and starts becoming a technical page-six issue, you can expect to start hearing cabinet ministers talk again about the \u201cbrilliant civil service\u201d. As long as we behave ourselves, that is: the increased frequency of policy leaks to the Sunday Times and the Financial Times in the months up to the general election will very likely continue in 2020. But all honeymoons come to an end. And given what Cummings has just said about wanting to make the hiring and firing of civil servants easier, unbelievers of all stripes should expect some very tough love. Second, Boris Johnson will continue to impregnate the civil service with new policy challenges, like the idea that getting Brexit done will trigger a baby boom. The prime minister may have a point \u2013 with a stagnant economy and the high cost of contraceptives, unprotected sex will soon be the only entertainment post-Brexit Britain can afford. We are all children of Boris now. Number three might expose me to accusations of wide-eyed naivete \u2013 but a civil service damaged by Brexit will only strengthen its commitment to the UK public. I believe that the vast majority of civil servants will agree with their union boss Dave Penman\u2019s warning that any ideological shake-up of government is likely to have a major impact on the delivery of public services. I don\u2019t speak for 400,000 civil servants, but I believe we will always fight that. Last month Ipsos Mori data suggested that medics and civil servants are increasingly the most trusted professionals in the UK, while faith in politicians has sunk to an all-time low. And no matter what Johnson actually wants, civil servants feel a strong obligation to repay that trust. Since it\u2019s Christmas, I\u2019ll go one step further. Kindness and empathy, as ex-civil servant Kit Collingwood suggested last week, are at the heart of what it means to be a civil servant. Well-known incurable romantics such as ex-civil service boss Gus O\u2019Donnell have even said that wellbeing \u2013 not economic growth \u2013 should be the main goal of government.

A computer analysis of the sermons\u2019 content found that the word \u201cJesus\u201d was used in 99% in all four traditions. The most commonly used words were simple, broadly applicable terms, such as \u201cpeople, \u201ccome\u201d, \u201cknow\u201d, \u201clife\u201d and \u201clike\u201d. But some words and phrases were used more frequently in the sermons of some traditions. Congregations at historically black Protestant churches were eight times more likely than others to hear a phrase including the word \u201challelujah\u201d. \u201cAlthough the word \u2018hallelujah\u2019 is by no means unique to historically black Protestant services, this analysis indicates that it is a hallmark of black Protestant churches,\u201d the report said. Evangelical sermons contained \u201ca number of distinctive words and phrases relating to sin, punishment and redemption\u201d and evangelical clergy were \u201cthree times more likely than those from other traditions to include the phrase \u2018eternal hell\u2019 (or variations such as \u2018eternity in hell\u2019)\u201d. But, the report added, \u201ca congregant who attended every service at a given evangelical church in the dataset had a roughly one-in-10 chance of hearing one of those terms at least once during the study period. By comparison, that same congregant had a 99% chance of hearing the word \u2018love\u2019.\u201d Sermons across the four traditions were \u201cheavily laced with scripture: 95% reference at least one book, Gospel or epistle of the Bible by name, and more than half (56%) cite particular books from both the Old Testament (also known as the Hebrew scriptures) and the New Testament (which includes the Christian Gospels) in the same sermon\u201d. Evangelical churches were most likely to reference a book, Gospel or epistle of the Bible by name, doing so in 97% of all sermons. The report acknowledged that the number of churches included in the analysis was a small proportion of the 350,000 religious congregations in the US, not all of which have an online presence.",

      "body": "<h2>Borussia Dortmund v Paris Saint-Germain</h2> \n<p>Could this, finally, be Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s year? Although their domestic form has been indifferent (they lead Ligue 1 by just seven points), the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/18/paris-saint-germain-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\">3-0 evisceration of Real Madrid</a> in their opening group match suggested the balance of the midfield \u2013 with Idrissa Gana Gueye joining Marquinhos and Marco Verratti \u2013 may at last be right. The big question is whether that cohesiveness can be maintained as Neymar returns. The PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel, has the advantage of knowing numerous Dortmund players from his time at the club. The form of Lucien Favre\u2019s side, meanwhile, remains oddly patchy although the fact they ousted Inter in the group stage suggests they shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.<br><strong>Prediction: PSG</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/16/real-madrid-v-manchester-city-atletico-v-liverpool-in-champions-league-last-16\">Real Madrid v Manchester City, Atl\u00e9tico v Liverpool in Champions League last-16</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Real Madrid v Manchester City</h2> \n<p>Real Madrid paid a heavy price for finishing as runners-up in their group, although the sense is that both sides may look rather different come February. Madrid have slowly improved after a difficult start to the season, following the familiar pattern of Zinedine Zidane sides, but the reconstruction of their midfield will be severely tested by a City side who, with Liverpool 14 points clear of them in the Premier League, will presumably devote their attentions fully to Europe. Their recent stutter has been rooted in two issues: problems at the back and a lack of attacking ruthlessness, but they may melt away when Aymeric Laporte and Sergio Ag\u00fcero return. City, anyway, should be a far stiffer test than they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">against Madrid in the 2016</a> semi-final.<br><strong>Prediction: Manchester City</strong></p> \n<h2>Atalanta v Valencia</h2> \n<p>These were the sides every other club probably wanted to face in the last 16 and, if there is any romance left in European football, it is represented by Atalanta. They squeaked through with an enormous amount of luck, with just seven points from their six group games. Nonetheless, the hard pressing practised by Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s side can unsettle any opponent, while Valencia have been far from convincing this season. They progressed largely because of slightly fortuitous 1-0 away wins against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/sep/17/chelsea-valencia-champions-league-match-report\">Chelsea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/10/champions-league-roundup-ajax-and-inter-crash-out-after-home-defeats\">Ajax</a> and while they have won four of their last six league games, and drawn with Real Madrid in that run, there is a reason they still lie seventh in the Spanish table.<br><strong>Prediction: Atalanta</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58fd5578af735ff4e7d854025bb9c00948496cb0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58fd5578af735ff4e7d854025bb9c00948496cb0/0_19_2923_1754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Atalanta\u2019s Timothy Castagne celebrates his against Shakhtar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atalanta\u2019s Timothy Castagne celebrates his against Shakhtar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Liverpool</h2> \n<p>What was most impressive about Liverpool\u2019s qualification was the way, having gone 2-0 up against Salzburg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/10/rb-salzburg-liverpool-champions-league-match-report\">in their final group game</a>, they were able to hold vibrant opponents at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s a side of their game that hasn\u2019t been much in evidence as they have surged clear at the top of the Premier League, but a useful attribute to have in two-legged ties. Atl\u00e9tico are in the middle of a major rebuild, the foremost result of which appears to have been a lack of fluency: they have drawn eight of their 17 league games so far this season. An inability to finish sides off, though, is less of a drawback in knockout football than in the league.<br><strong>Prediction: Liverpool</strong></p> \n<h2>Chelsea v Bayern Munich</h2> \n<p>In 2012, Chelsea went to Munich for the Champions League final and pulled off a major shock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/19/bayern-munich-chelsea-champions-league-final\">beating Bayern on penalties</a>. Frank Lampard may not enjoy this trip quite as much. Chelsea were extremely fortunate to draw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/05/chelsea-ajax-champions-league-match-report\">against Ajax</a> (4-4) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/27/valencia-chelsea-champions-league-match-report\">and Valencia</a> (2-2) in the group stage, two games in which their defensive limitations were badly exposed. And as Tottenham found, Bayern, only the seventh side ever to win all six group games, have in Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry two in-form forwards ideally suited to take advantage. That said, Bayern remain fifth in the Bundesliga and it\u2019s far from clear whether the interim manager, Hansi Flick, will still be in charge come February.<br><strong>Prediction: Bayern</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca84c2c434561981277440c7d1fc52f341874064\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca84c2c434561981277440c7d1fc52f341874064/0_52_4141_2484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serge Gnabry completes his hat-trick against Tottenham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serge Gnabry completes his hat-trick against Tottenham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Lyon v Juventus</h2> \n<p>Perhaps no side in the last 16 is under such pressure as Juventus. Their decision to sign Cristiano Ronaldo in summer 2018, based on the belief his goals were the final ingredient that would bring them a third European crown, represented a huge financial gamble. A quarter-final <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/16/juventus-ajax-champions-league-match-report\">exit to Ajax</a> last season represented a major disappointment. Ronaldo will be 35 by the time this year\u2019s last-16 tie comes round. The clock is ticking. And Juve have not been at their best domestically since Maurizio Sarri replaced Max Allegri, currently standing level on points at the top of Serie A with Inter. They still, though, should have far too much for Lyon who are eighth in France and have, in Rudi Garcia, a coach who has not been accepted by the fanbase because of his previous association with Lyon\u2019s great rivals Saint-\u00c9tienne.<br><strong>Prediction: Juventus</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c2a40029-217f-4c9f-85d2-51bc114923f0\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Atalanta v Valencia<br>Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Liverpool<br>Borussia Dortmund v Paris Saint-Germain<br>Chelsea v Bayern Munich<br>Lyon v Juventus<br>Napoli v Barcelona<br>Real Madrid v Manchester City<br>Tottenham v RB Leipzig</p>\n    <p><em>The first legs are scheduled for 18/19/25 or 26 February<br>Second legs will be 10/11/17 or 18 March</em></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Tottenham v RB Leipzig</h2> \n<p>Tottenham represent a dangerous wild card this season.

      "bodyText": "Borussia Dortmund v Paris Saint-Germain Could this, finally, be Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s year? Although their domestic form has been indifferent (they lead Ligue 1 by just seven points), the 3-0 evisceration of Real Madrid in their opening group match suggested the balance of the midfield \u2013 with Idrissa Gana Gueye joining Marquinhos and Marco Verratti \u2013 may at last be right. The big question is whether that cohesiveness can be maintained as Neymar returns. The PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel, has the advantage of knowing numerous Dortmund players from his time at the club. The form of Lucien Favre\u2019s side, meanwhile, remains oddly patchy although the fact they ousted Inter in the group stage suggests they shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Prediction: PSG Real Madrid v Manchester City Real Madrid paid a heavy price for finishing as runners-up in their group, although the sense is that both sides may look rather different come February. Madrid have slowly improved after a difficult start to the season, following the familiar pattern of Zinedine Zidane sides, but the reconstruction of their midfield will be severely tested by a City side who, with Liverpool 14 points clear of them in the Premier League, will presumably devote their attentions fully to Europe. Their recent stutter has been rooted in two issues: problems at the back and a lack of attacking ruthlessness, but they may melt away when Aymeric Laporte and Sergio Ag\u00fcero return. City, anyway, should be a far stiffer test than they were against Madrid in the 2016 semi-final. Prediction: Manchester City Atalanta v Valencia These were the sides every other club probably wanted to face in the last 16 and, if there is any romance left in European football, it is represented by Atalanta. They squeaked through with an enormous amount of luck, with just seven points from their six group games. Nonetheless, the hard pressing practised by Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s side can unsettle any opponent, while Valencia have been far from convincing this season. They progressed largely because of slightly fortuitous 1-0 away wins against Chelsea and Ajax and while they have won four of their last six league games, and drawn with Real Madrid in that run, there is a reason they still lie seventh in the Spanish table. Prediction: Atalanta Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Liverpool What was most impressive about Liverpool\u2019s qualification was the way, having gone 2-0 up against Salzburg in their final group game, they were able to hold vibrant opponents at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s a side of their game that hasn\u2019t been much in evidence as they have surged clear at the top of the Premier League, but a useful attribute to have in two-legged ties. Atl\u00e9tico are in the middle of a major rebuild, the foremost result of which appears to have been a lack of fluency: they have drawn eight of their 17 league games so far this season. An inability to finish sides off, though, is less of a drawback in knockout football than in the league. Prediction: Liverpool Chelsea v Bayern Munich In 2012, Chelsea went to Munich for the Champions League final and pulled off a major shock, beating Bayern on penalties. Frank Lampard may not enjoy this trip quite as much. Chelsea were extremely fortunate to draw against Ajax (4-4) and Valencia (2-2) in the group stage, two games in which their defensive limitations were badly exposed. And as Tottenham found, Bayern, only the seventh side ever to win all six group games, have in Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry two in-form forwards ideally suited to take advantage. That said, Bayern remain fifth in the Bundesliga and it\u2019s far from clear whether the interim manager, Hansi Flick, will still be in charge come February. Prediction: Bayern Lyon v Juventus Perhaps no side in the last 16 is under such pressure as Juventus. Their decision to sign Cristiano Ronaldo in summer 2018, based on the belief his goals were the final ingredient that would bring them a third European crown, represented a huge financial gamble. A quarter-final exit to Ajax last season represented a major disappointment. Ronaldo will be 35 by the time this year\u2019s last-16 tie comes round. The clock is ticking. And Juve have not been at their best domestically since Maurizio Sarri replaced Max Allegri, currently standing level on points at the top of Serie A with Inter. They still, though, should have far too much for Lyon who are eighth in France and have, in Rudi Garcia, a coach who has not been accepted by the fanbase because of his previous association with Lyon\u2019s great rivals Saint-\u00c9tienne. Prediction: Juventus Tottenham v RB Leipzig Tottenham represent a dangerous wild card this season. Five wins out of seven under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho suggest a corner has been turned since the departure of Mauricio Pochettino, but the defence is still extremely vulnerable, as was seen in the way Bayern picked them apart. There must be doubts as well as to whether Mourinho\u2019s happy-and-relaxed shtick will endure another two months and what impact a more familiar grumpy Jos\u00e9 may have on players who at the moment seem enthused by their new boss. Either way, this represents a great clash of approaches: Julian Nagelsmann is at the forefront of the modern breed of hard-pressing young managers and, while Tottenham were used to that style under Pochettino, Mourinho\u2019s instincts are to a more reactive approach. Prediction: Tottenham Napoli v Barcelona Barcelona are top of the league in Spain and finished top of their Champions League group for a 13th time, yet the feeling around them is one of vague dissatisfaction.

In the 1840s, the tribe fought alongside Texans against Mexico, in an ill-fated attempt to establish the border a hundred or so miles south of the Rio Grande. The Comecrudean language remains alive only through traditional songs.</p> <p>But for the government, which has used varying criteria and conditions to officially recognize 573 Indian nations, this is not enough.</p> <p>\u201cIt can take a million dollars to hire consultants to find the physical documents for federal recognition, which, given the historical violence and displacement, is an almost impossible burden,\u201d said Gussie Lord, tribal affairs lawyer, from the legal not-for-profit EarthJustice.</p> <p>Without federal recognition, the tribe has no official land base and few legal protections, even before the wall and the waiver.</p> <p>This matters little to Mancias, who says his people\u2019s history and spiritual identity are rooted across the valley.

The deed is currently held by Martin\u2019s great grandson, Dr Ramiro Ramirez, a plaintiff, who grew up attending the church and learning about the family history from his grandmother.</p> <p>The enforcement zone around the wall would extend to the third row of pews in the chapel, which is still used for funerals. This could mean the chapel is marooned in the no-go patrol area \u2013 or bulldozed.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up believing this would be where I am buried with my ancestors, and my children and grandchildren too. Now what will happen to us? It will be devastating,\u201d said Ramirez, 72, unable to stop the tears as he pointed to his future tombstone.</p> <p>Ramirez added: \u201cI come here every week to be with my <em>abuelos</em>, and pray for a miracle, that the president shows a little compassion and understanding.

The historic graveyard is next door to the Jackson Ranch chapel, the oldest Protestant church still standing in the valley. Both sites are only a mile or so from Mexico, on a long and dusty road flanked by sturdy mesquites. This is where, amid local protest and national condemnation, Donald Trump is pushing to start construction of a new border wall, with potentially disastrous consequences. The wall will be built on top of a levee just north of the 145-year-old Methodist chapel and cemetery, placing them within the 150ft enforcement zone which the government has said it plans to raze. The church and cemetery, which are designated Texas Historical Markers, would be marooned between Trump\u2019s wall and the actual border, just to the south along the Rio Grande. In an effort to stop the wall, leaders of the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe and activists live in a makeshift tent village within the shady cemetery. For almost a year, they have burned a sacred log fire, ringed by tribal flags. On Monday, the Washington DC district court will consider the government\u2019s motion to dismiss a case brought by the tribe and six other plaintiffs, challenging the constitutionality of Trump\u2019s executive orders which diverted billions of defense dollars to build a wall on the southern border by declaring a national emergency in February. The plaintiffs say the wall would disturb unmarked native burial and sacred sites across the river delta where tribal clans lived, traded and buried their dead for centuries before colonization. The last stronghold of the Carrizo/Comecrudo nation \u2013 an original Texas tribe whose ancestors have inhabited the Rio Grande Valley for at least hundreds of years \u2013 was in Hidalgo county, where the cemeteries are situated. \u201cThe border with Mexico divided our people and now, this new wall shows no regard for our ancestors, beliefs or culture which are tied to these lands,\u201d Juan Mancias, 65, tribal chairman, told the Guardian at Yalui (Butterfly) Village campsite, which is monitored by border patrol agents who frequently drive past. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to erase who we are, and that\u2019s genocide. \u201cThese Indian wars aren\u2019t over, only the battlegrounds have changed.

Lawsuit The lawsuit alleges that a national emergency was fabricated \u201c\u2026 to seize emergency powers in an attempt to accomplish a longstanding campaign promise \u2013 a \u2018big beautiful wall\u2019 \u2013 that Congress, since President Trump\u2019s inauguration, has repeatedly and explicitly refused to fund\u201d. The government claims the constitutional challenge has no merit. The justice department declined to comment. Just last week, a federal court in Oakland, California, ruled in a similar lawsuit that the president acted unlawfully by using emergency powers to divert $3.6bn in military construction funds for the wall. The damning ruling, which the government will appeal, will be considered by the judge in Washington when deciding whether to dismiss the Texas case, or let it proceed, and therefore force the administration to provide the plaintiffs with confidential documents pertaining to the massive project. Details about the planned wall are sparse as the government suspended 28 laws mandating protections and oversight, relating to clean air and water, endangered species, public lands and the rights of American Indians, in order to expedite construction. The waiver includes the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act and Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Amid growing clamour about the plans, local CBP chiefs in Texas have said the cemeteries will be spared. But in the past few months, surveyors and other technicians have been observed working around the Eli Jackson cemetery, which is manned 24/7 by the tribe and their supporters camped out in the village. The tribe has filed cease and desist orders to government agencies and private contractors, which stated: \u201cWe do not want any more division being caused, any more digging of our ancestors. We don\u2019t own the land, the land owns us, that\u2019s why we lay claim to it. It identifies us.\u201d Yet in what it considers the ultimate injustice, in the eyes of the US government, the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe does not even exist. The first documented contact with Carrizo/Comecrudo clans by colonial explorers dates back to the early 1500s. In the 1840s, the tribe fought alongside Texans against Mexico, in an ill-fated attempt to establish the border a hundred or so miles south of the Rio Grande. The Comecrudean language remains alive only through traditional songs. But for the government, which has used varying criteria and conditions to officially recognize 573 Indian nations, this is not enough. \u201cIt can take a million dollars to hire consultants to find the physical documents for federal recognition, which, given the historical violence and displacement, is an almost impossible burden,\u201d said Gussie Lord, tribal affairs lawyer, from the legal not-for-profit EarthJustice. Without federal recognition, the tribe has no official land base and few legal protections, even before the wall and the waiver. This matters little to Mancias, who says his people\u2019s history and spiritual identity are rooted across the valley. That\u2019s why he has participated in protests and lawsuits to stop environmentally destructive natural gas pipelines, oil production and fracking. \u201cThe colonizers cut off our hands and feet, killed us, and took our land, and now the burden is on us to prove we are a tribe. It\u2019s the constant connection with our land and ancestors that sustains and strengthens our identity and culture, not what the US federal government decides, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re struggling to save.\u201d No-go area Eli Jackson, after whom the cemetery was named, was the eldest son of Nathaniel Jackson, a farmer and devout Protestant, and Matilda Hicks, an emancipated slave, who arrived in 1857 from Alabama as part of a caravan of mixed-race families escaping mounting hostilities against African Americans in the deep south as civil war edged closer. The Jackson family established a ranch on the river bank, which became an important stop on the Underground Railroad \u2013 a network of secret routes and safehouses used to help enslaved Americans escape to the free north and Canada. Nathaniel built a small house of worship on the ranch, which was replaced in 1874 by the existing Jackson Ranch chapel, built by another son, Martin Jackson. The deed is currently held by Martin\u2019s great grandson, Dr Ramiro Ramirez, a plaintiff, who grew up attending the church and learning about the family history from his grandmother. The enforcement zone around the wall would extend to the third row of pews in the chapel, which is still used for funerals. This could mean the chapel is marooned in the no-go patrol area \u2013 or bulldozed. \u201cI grew up believing this would be where I am buried with my ancestors, and my children and grandchildren too. Now what will happen to us? It will be devastating,\u201d said Ramirez, 72, unable to stop the tears as he pointed to his future tombstone. Ramirez added: \u201cI come here every week to be with my abuelos, and pray for a miracle, that the president shows a little compassion and understanding. I\u2019ve lived next to the river my whole life, this is not a dangerous place, the wall is not needed.\u201d Ecological destruction Environmentalists warn of potentially devastating consequences along the Rio Grande \u2013 a 1,900-mile long international river that divides the US and Mexico, providing drinking water to about 6 million people, and habitat for hundreds of diverse species of birds, mammals, fish and insects. Another of the plaintiffs, Elsa Hull, 51, lives with her daughters on a three-acre lot a stone\u2019s throw from the river, 140 miles north-west of Mission in Zacapa county. The planned wall would cut off their access to the river which they use for leisure activities like kayaking, stargazing and birdwatching, disrupt wildlife, create light pollution, exacerbate flooding and reduce the value of her property. \u201cThe wall would affect every single aspect of our lives,\u201d said Hull, an environmental protection officer. \u201cAn entire river will be walled off, it will cause ecological destruction, disrupt communities and wildlife \u2026 this is a beautiful safe place, people have to stop buying into the hype and do something.\u201d After months of campaigning by the plaintiffs, next year\u2019s homeland security budget proposed in the House of Representatives includes a clause blocking the use of funds for border wall construction in several areas, including historic cemeteries and the nearby National Butterfly Centre, which is trying to stop a separate, privately funded three-and-a-half-mile barrier on the riverbank. So far, the Senate version doesn\u2019t include the cemeteries. The deadline to agree a compromise is 20 December. Regardless of the bill, if the wall is built on the levee as planned, it is unclear how the cemeteries could be spared from inclusion in the enforcement zone. As the sun rose over the Yalui Village, Mancias was sleep-deprived and livid about the noisy industrial groundwater pump left running in a grassy plot over the road. \u201cThey\u2019re destroying everything native and natural,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to educate people, and stand our ground \u2026 we\u2019re still here and not going anywhere, and have a right to speak out. This is our land.\u201d",

A familiar criticism from previous stops on Ancelotti\u2019s coaching journey \u2013 that he does not push players hard enough in training \u2013 has resurfaced in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>Yet the overbearing influence of De Laurentiis is impossible to ignore. Two weeks before imposing his <em>ritiro</em>, the owner had given an interview to Sky Sports in which he criticised Insigne\u2019s attitude, suggested that Koulibaly would be sold and accused Dries Mertens and Jos\u00e9 Callejon \u2013 both in the last year of their contracts \u2013 of being less interested in football than the possibility of getting rich in China.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1205933409962536961\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udea8 PARMA WIN IT IN STOPPAGE TIME!<br><br>\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99 The Crociati deliver a deadly, trademark counter, and Gervinho and Kulusevski combine to get the winner for the away team! <a href=\"https://t.co/DL0UindE7C\">pic.twitter.com/DL0UindE7C</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1205933409962536961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 14, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Gattuso is under no illusions on the challenge before him.

      "bodyText": "Gennaro Gattuso\u2019s debut as Napoli manager had to be delayed by half an hour on Saturday after pieces of the Stadio San Paolo\u2019s roof broke off amid a heavy rainstorm. When the game against Parma finally began, it took only four more minutes for his team to start to come apart A throw-in for the visitors inside their own half looked innocuous enough. The ball was launched towards Parma\u2019s target man, Andreas Cornelius, but sailed clean over his head. It ought to have been straightforward for the Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly to bring it under control. But he misjudged the bounce, leaving space for Parma\u2019s teenage winger Dejan Kulusevski to sprint inside and steal possession. Koulibaly chased to the edge of the penalty area before falling face-first onto wet turf. Kulusevski finished coolly. Injury was added to insult as the defender limped off with a thigh strain. So much for the new-manager bounce. It was hard to imagine a worse start than this for Gattuso, who had taken over from Carlo Ancelotti four days earlier. Napoli thrashed Genk 4-0 in their final Champions League match before the switch, but remained without a win in Serie A for almost two months. How could this team fall so far, so fast? The mood had been buoyant in the summer, Ancelotti adamant that Napoli were ready to compete for the Scudetto. Hirving Lozano became the club\u2019s record signing as he joined from PSV in a \u20ac42m deal. Kostas Manolas arrived from Roma to partner Koulibaly \u2013 voted Serie A\u2019s best defender in 2018-19 \u2013 at centre-back. Ancelotti was popular. He might not have led Napoli to 91 points like his predecessor, Maurizio Sarri, but he had kept them in second place domestically while delivering some thrilling nights in Europe. Besides, how could anyone not fall for the sort of manager who stops to help a fan fix his bike outside the training ground, or hides in the crowd at a player Q&amp;A session to deliver questions in his not-very-undercover persona, \u201cCarlo from Reggiolo\u201d? By October, however, the mood was starting to change. Ancelotti dropped Lorenzo Insigne for his team\u2019s first game against Genk. Local media claimed that he was sending a message to his captain regarding a lack of application in training. But the player was frustrated, too, with the manager\u2019s insistence on a 4-4-2 formation, having always done his best work on the left of the attack in Sarri\u2019s 4-3-3.

This wouldn\u2019t be no deal; the withdrawal agreement, including citizens\u2019 rights, our continuing financial obligations and the special arrangements for Northern Ireland, would still bind both sides. But it would be the hardest of hard Brexits for British business, with tariffs, customs controls and a cliff-edge exit from the single market.

So I\u2019m willing to make a bet \u2013 with the aforementioned Rogers, no less \u2013 that come January 2021, one way or another, the UK will \u2013 more than four years after the referendum \u2013 still be in the single market. In little over a year, we\u2019ll find out who was right. \u2022 Jonathan Portes is a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe",

The German guest, named in court documents as Thomas K, had posted critical reviews on Booking.com and TripAdvisor about a week after his visit to the Ferienhof Gerlos hotel in the Tyrolean Alps in August 2018. After check-in, K and his wife noticed two framed pictures on a wall near the hotel\u2019s entrance, hung above a flower arrangement. One showed a young man wearing a uniform with an eagle and swastika badge, the other an older man. In his online review K said he had felt disgusted to see a National Socialist publicly venerated at the hotel, using the subject header \u201cAt the entrance they display a picture of a Nazi grandpa\u201d. The owners of the hotel asked the travel websites to remove reviews and took K to court, on the grounds that the description \u201cNazi grandpa\u201d was libellous and defamatory because the people in the pictures \u2013 one a grandfather, the other an uncle of one of the owners \u2013 had only been members of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. They succeeded in July in obtaining a gagging order against K after the regional court in Innsbruck ruled that their interest in protecting their reputation took precedence over the guest\u2019s right to freedom of expression. However, by researching the identity of the two men in the photographs at the German National Archives in Berlin in May this year, K found proof that both of the men had in fact joined the Nazi party, in 1941 and 1943 respectively. Last month, the Innsbruck court decided to lift the gagging order. The two men\u2019s party membership and the clearly visible swastika, the court said, amounted to sufficient proof to back up the guest\u2019s complaint that the hotel had \u201cuncritically venerated a former Nazi family member\u201d. The hotel\u2019s owners, who say they had not been aware of their relatives\u2019 party membership, will likely have to pay their former guests\u2019 legal costs of about \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,350).",

      "body": "<p>Fortune favours the brave, they say. Maybe FC K\u00f6ln had little option this weekend after six matches without a win, leaving them stuck in the relegation mud. In a city where the fortunes of <em>Effzeh</em> are felt so intensely, it hasn\u2019t just been the shortcomings but the mood. After sweeping to the 2. Bundesliga title last season on the back of 84 goals scored, the 12 in 14 scored before this weekend meant that all the air had seeped out of the club\u2019s post-promotion bounce. Something had to change.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/european-roundup-lionel-messi-hat-trick-sends-barcelona-top-as-real-chase\">European roundup: Lionel Messi hat-trick sends Barcelona top as Real chase</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet thinking and doing in a derby are two totally different things. Bayer Leverkusen made the short hop south into the city on the cusp of the top four and having won their last Bundesliga away game \u2013 at Bayern, of all places. Granted, it wasn\u2019t like facing Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, with whom K\u00f6ln have an even more intense rivalry and who, of course, have played with the sort of style during this season\u2019s success which they would love to have for their own side, but nevertheless, it remained daunting. \u201cLeverkusen have the better team and they are capable of a lot,\u201d admitted sporting director Horst Heldt after the game, \u201cbut we had to resist.</p> \n<p>Was Markus Gisdol the man to author an exploit? For many underwhelmed by the former Hoffenheim and Hamburg coach\u2019s appointment, it felt not. Yet the 50-year-old rose to the occasion, sensing it was the moment to take a chance. Out of his squad went the experience of Florian Kainz, with Birgir Verstraete and even K\u00f6ln-born Marco H\u00f6ger left out of the XI too.

The real test, however, comes with the visit of leaders Leipzig to Westfalen on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u2022 That\u2019s right, leaders Leipzig, who swept past flagging Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf with some comfort. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s side are becoming known for their ferocious starts to games against weaker teams, which manifested itself here in the revitalised Patrick Schick\u2019s goal after 64 seconds, an advantage that they never looked like letting slip. \u201cWe were able to hold something back with Tuesday in mind,\u201d Nagelsmann said.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach missed the chance to retake the lead at the top as they fell to a second stoppage-time defeat in four days; after being eliminated from the Europa League by Enzo Crivelli\u2019s late goal for Basaksehir on Thursday, they went down to Max Arnold\u2019s crisp strike at the end of Sunday\u2019s trip to Wolfsburg. Despite the lateness of the moment that sealed the result Oliver Glasner\u2019s side richly deserved it, with Gladbach having looked flat at both the start and finish of the match.</p> \n<p>\u2022 There was a first win too for J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann as the head of Hertha, as they edged out Freiburg thanks to Vladimir Darida\u2019s superbly-struck winner against his former club. \u201cWith every

      "bodyText": "Fortune favours the brave, they say. Maybe FC K\u00f6ln had little option this weekend after six matches without a win, leaving them stuck in the relegation mud. In a city where the fortunes of Effzeh are felt so intensely, it hasn\u2019t just been the shortcomings but the mood. After sweeping to the 2. Bundesliga title last season on the back of 84 goals scored, the 12 in 14 scored before this weekend meant that all the air had seeped out of the club\u2019s post-promotion bounce. Something had to change. Yet thinking and doing in a derby are two totally different things. Bayer Leverkusen made the short hop south into the city on the cusp of the top four and having won their last Bundesliga away game \u2013 at Bayern, of all places. Granted, it wasn\u2019t like facing Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, with whom K\u00f6ln have an even more intense rivalry and who, of course, have played with the sort of style during this season\u2019s success which they would love to have for their own side, but nevertheless, it remained daunting. \u201cLeverkusen have the better team and they are capable of a lot,\u201d admitted sporting director Horst Heldt after the game, \u201cbut we had to resist. Was Markus Gisdol the man to author an exploit? For many underwhelmed by the former Hoffenheim and Hamburg coach\u2019s appointment, it felt not. Yet the 50-year-old rose to the occasion, sensing it was the moment to take a chance. Out of his squad went the experience of Florian Kainz, with Birgir Verstraete and even K\u00f6ln-born Marco H\u00f6ger left out of the XI too. In came Jan Thielmann, at 17 Germany\u2019s first top-flight player born in 2002, who had impressed staff with his performances for the under-19s but had never even been included in the senior squad before.

Gisdol\u2019s plan worked. And it seemed like it was a plan, not just a desperate coach throwing a Hail Mary pass into the ether.

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m two metres tall; that frightens people,\u201d Thibaut Courtois said. It was late, it was loud and he had nothing to lose, so there he was: Real Madrid\u2019s goalkeeper, up the other end, running into the Valencia penalty area for one last shot at saving this, the fear he said his opponents felt about to become real. \u201cIt was his idea,\u201d Zinedine Zidane admitted, and it was an idea that had been going around his head since the moment Carlos Soler had given Valencia the lead with 12 minutes left on Sunday night. \u201cI thought: shit, the game\u2019s escaping us, I have to stop everything until the 94th minute, then maybe there will be a corner,\u201d Courtois explained. He\u2019d just stopped Valencia getting a second. Now the clock said 94:23 and there was a corner.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/16/gisdol-rolls-the-dice-as-koln-kickstart-survival-bid-with-derby-win\">Gisdol rolls the dice as K\u00f6ln's kids kickstart survival bid with derby win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The next thing they knew, Courtois was jumping through a crowd heading goalwards, the ball rebounding into the six-yard box, hearts stopping, and Karim Benzema was sprinting off, teammates running after him laughing, the ball in the net. \u201cThat\u2019s Real Madrid,\u201d Zidane said but this was silly, even for them. Courtois chased too, a long black latex finger raised. \u201cWhat a header!\u201d they kept telling him. Federico Valverde slipped to his knees, pumped his fists and beat the floor. On the touchline, Zidane shouted then got lost in his own smile as the world went wild around him. When the Belgian got back to his own goal, a hundred metres away, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vamos/status/1206341662139703296?s=20\">he cupped his hands to his ears and blew Valencia\u2019s fans a kiss</a>. Like their team, they had been broken. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Soler said moments later.</p> \n<p>What happened? Pretty much everything happened. There had been a yellow card given and taken away and shown to someone else instead, another minute going by as they watched it back in the VAR room in Las Rozas; a wonderful chance for Valencia to win it, Courtois saving from Manu Vallejo barely three yards out; a Madrid equaliser from Luka Jovic, ruled out for offside, and another VAR check. There had been another opportunity; a possible penalty, not given because Benzema decided to stay on his feet and play instead; and what seemed like one, last desperate shot. Then another, and then another. And then, with the penultimate touch of the entire match, there was an equaliser thanks to a goalkeeper on the attack. All that just in the five minutes added on at the end.</p> \n<p>In the 90 minutes before, there had been 34 shots, a superb start from Madrid met by an impressive reaction from Valencia, Benzema and Dani Parejo the embodiment of each team\u2019s moment, the noise rising by the minute. Valencia led and were close, Daniel Wass pulling back for Soler to score. They might have ended it too, more chances following. But it was still alive.</p> \n<p>On 92.21, exhausted now, barely able to move, Rodrigo scrambled the ball to Vallejo but Courtois stopped him. Seconds later, Mestalla fell silent when Jovic scored, then broke into a huge roar when it was ruled out \u2013 and another when VAR confirmed it. They roared again on 93:27 when Madrid\u2019s last chance had gone, but it wasn\u2019t the last chance. On 93:59, Dani Carvajal thumped the ball up the right wing and Benzema slipped away. Turning inside, he could have forced a penalty; instead forced a shot, deflected wide. All that, and it came to this: a corner, Courtois sprinting up the other end. \u201cIt\u2019s good that he did; it shows we never give up,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cI looked to the bench, but there were only seconds left so I went,\u201d Courtois said. \u201cYou have to go convinced you can score.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1206331572904960002\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udea8 UNBELIEVABLE SCENES AT THE MESTALLA!<br><br>\u26aa Real Madrid equalise with the last kick of the game!<br><br>\ud83d\ude31 Thibaut Courtois almost scores a header, and then Karim Benzema scrambles the rebound home! <a href=\"https://t.co/RMFUyVjAb0\">pic.twitter.com/RMFUyVjAb0</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1206331572904960002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 15, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>He didn\u2019t, but he did make it. There were 20 players inside the area, but none were on him; no one plans for this. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a marker of course,\u201d Soler said.

Down on the pitch, the players embraced. The talk would be of penalties \u2013 the one Real Sociedad got and the one that Barcelona didn\u2019t \u2013 and it would get increasingly petty, pretty pathetic in fact, but right then, right there, the feeling was different. <br><br>No one had won, either of them could have, and everyone enjoyed this. Goals from Mikel Oyarzabal, Antoine Griezmann, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Alexander Isak had seen it finish 2-2. It had been fun while it lasted, and it had lasted until the very end, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 diving for the final opportunity deep in added time. That was when he appealed that he had been pulled back by Diego Llorente, although the Real Sociedad defender approached him, repeating: \u201cYou pulled me on to you\u201d. <br><br>Asked what he thought, Ernesto Valverde said: \u201cWhat am I going to say? We have our team shirts on: I\u2019ll say theirs wasn\u2019t and ours was and their manager will come here and say the opposite.\u201d That though, didn\u2019t set the tone, and so on it ran. Which was a pity, because the game had been so much fun. Martin \u00d8degaard in particular was wonderful, while Griezmann dinked in a lovely goal against the former club where they still like him \u2013 and he didn\u2019t celebrate. \u201cIt had a bit of everything,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cIt was a great game,\u201d Imanol Alguacil said.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m two metres tall; that frightens people,\u201d Thibaut Courtois said. It was late, it was loud and he had nothing to lose, so there he was: Real Madrid\u2019s goalkeeper, up the other end, running into the Valencia penalty area for one last shot at saving this, the fear he said his opponents felt about to become real. \u201cIt was his idea,\u201d Zinedine Zidane admitted, and it was an idea that had been going around his head since the moment Carlos Soler had given Valencia the lead with 12 minutes left on Sunday night. \u201cI thought: shit, the game\u2019s escaping us, I have to stop everything until the 94th minute, then maybe there will be a corner,\u201d Courtois explained. He\u2019d just stopped Valencia getting a second. Now the clock said 94:23 and there was a corner. The next thing they knew, Courtois was jumping through a crowd heading goalwards, the ball rebounding into the six-yard box, hearts stopping, and Karim Benzema was sprinting off, teammates running after him laughing, the ball in the net. \u201cThat\u2019s Real Madrid,\u201d Zidane said but this was silly, even for them. Courtois chased too, a long black latex finger raised. \u201cWhat a header!\u201d they kept telling him. Federico Valverde slipped to his knees, pumped his fists and beat the floor. On the touchline, Zidane shouted then got lost in his own smile as the world went wild around him. When the Belgian got back to his own goal, a hundred metres away, he cupped his hands to his ears and blew Valencia\u2019s fans a kiss. Like their team, they had been broken. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Soler said moments later. What happened? Pretty much everything happened. There had been a yellow card given and taken away and shown to someone else instead, another minute going by as they watched it back in the VAR room in Las Rozas; a wonderful chance for Valencia to win it, Courtois saving from Manu Vallejo barely three yards out; a Madrid equaliser from Luka Jovic, ruled out for offside, and another VAR check. There had been another opportunity; a possible penalty, not given because Benzema decided to stay on his feet and play instead; and what seemed like one, last desperate shot. Then another, and then another. And then, with the penultimate touch of the entire match, there was an equaliser thanks to a goalkeeper on the attack. All that just in the five minutes added on at the end. In the 90 minutes before, there had been 34 shots, a superb start from Madrid met by an impressive reaction from Valencia, Benzema and Dani Parejo the embodiment of each team\u2019s moment, the noise rising by the minute. Valencia led and were close, Daniel Wass pulling back for Soler to score. They might have ended it too, more chances following. But it was still alive. On 92.21, exhausted now, barely able to move, Rodrigo scrambled the ball to Vallejo but Courtois stopped him. Seconds later, Mestalla fell silent when Jovic scored, then broke into a huge roar when it was ruled out \u2013 and another when VAR confirmed it. They roared again on 93:27 when Madrid\u2019s last chance had gone, but it wasn\u2019t the last chance. On 93:59, Dani Carvajal thumped the ball up the right wing and Benzema slipped away. Turning inside, he could have forced a penalty; instead forced a shot, deflected wide. All that, and it came to this: a corner, Courtois sprinting up the other end. \u201cIt\u2019s good that he did; it shows we never give up,\u201d Zidane said. \u201cI looked to the bench, but there were only seconds left so I went,\u201d Courtois said. \u201cYou have to go convinced you can score.\u201d He didn\u2019t, but he did make it. There were 20 players inside the area, but none were on him; no one plans for this. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a marker of course,\u201d Soler said. Courtois jumped above Geoffrey Kondogbia, a late substitute, and thudded the header towards goal. He has more headers on target this season than Lionel Messi, as many as Antoine Griezmann or Gareth Bale. Jaume Dom\u00e9nech pushed it away \u2013 he might have held it \u2013 and for a moment, the world stopped spinning. It fell between Ezequiel Garay\u2019s feet. There was a second\u2019s stillness, panic pouring into it. Surrounded, Garay knew the ball was there somewhere, but not exactly where, and knew he wanted rid of it. His leg moved, almost an involuntary spasm that turned into a backheel to Benzema. Up it went into the net and off they went. There wasn\u2019t even time to take the kick-off properly: one touch, and the whistle went. \u201cThe classic before the cl\u00e1sico,\u201d AS had called it and it ended 1-1, just as Barcelona\u2019s visit to San Sebasti\u00e1n the day before had ended 2-2. Madrid had matched Barcelona again following their draw at Real Sociedad, a huge weekend leaving the two teams level three days before they meet at the Camp Nou, the final hurdle overcome. \u201cWith everything we had done, it looked like we had lost it all,\u201d Zidane said. Instead, the run continues: Madrid have not lost in 11 matches now. And if their manager felt like they deserved more, Carvajal insisted: \u201cthis gives us a fantastic push for the Camp Nou; this Madrid never give up and hopefully this point can help us win the league.\u201d \u201cDrawing like this gives us a huge boost,\u201d Courtois said. For Valencia, it was a blow, Soler\u2019s face was as eloquent as his words. \u201cWe had it in our hand, but there was a deflection and football\u2019s like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can you say after that?\u201d manager Albert Celades was asked. For a moment there was silence. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a pity,\u201d he said eventually. \u201cIn a few days we\u2019ll look back on this and see it differently, but right now, they way it happened .\u201d He was right. When Celades took over at Valencia after Marcelino was sacked in September, he walked into a crisis not of his own making and few expected him to be the man to fix it. He had no senior managerial experience and a dressing room that was close to the previous manager, unlikely to embrace his arrival: it was easy to imagine him as an unwanted intruder, the owners\u2019 puppet, and most did. At his first press conference he sat alone, the players still furious and refusing to talk. And yet quietly, slowly, he won them over and last night it took a scary, two-metre tall goalkeeper with a prodigious leap coming up in the last second to prevent his team from beating Madrid and climbing to within a point of the Champions League places. In the last two weeks, hit by seemingly endless injuries, Valencia have played two derbies, Chelsea, Ajax and Madrid and lost none of them.

No wonder they\u2019re serenading him. \u201cI love them too,\u201d he said, \u201cvery much.\u201d When the final whistle went on Real Sociedad v Barcelona on Saturday evening, everyone inside Anoeta stood to applaud, clapping so loud that it sounded like they would make their hands bleed. Down on the pitch, the players embraced. The talk would be of penalties \u2013 the one Real Sociedad got and the one that Barcelona didn\u2019t \u2013 and it would get increasingly petty, pretty pathetic in fact, but right then, right there, the feeling was different. No one had won, either of them could have, and everyone enjoyed this. Goals from Mikel Oyarzabal, Antoine Griezmann, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Alexander Isak had seen it finish 2-2. It had been fun while it lasted, and it had lasted until the very end, Gerard Piqu\u00e9 diving for the final opportunity deep in added time. That was when he appealed that he had been pulled back by Diego Llorente, although the Real Sociedad defender approached him, repeating: \u201cYou pulled me on to you\u201d. Asked what he thought, Ernesto Valverde said: \u201cWhat am I going to say? We have our team shirts on: I\u2019ll say theirs wasn\u2019t and ours was and their manager will come here and say the opposite.\u201d That though, didn\u2019t set the tone, and so on it ran. Which was a pity, because the game had been so much fun. Martin \u00d8degaard in particular was wonderful, while Griezmann dinked in a lovely goal against the former club where they still like him \u2013 and he didn\u2019t celebrate. \u201cIt had a bit of everything,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cIt was a great game,\u201d Imanol Alguacil said. He looked exhausted and he wasn\u2019t the only one.",

And at the same time, customers\u2019 bills will fall by an average of \u00a350 before inflation.\u201d </p> <p>The changes, part of a price review conducted by the regulator every five years, will take effect on 1 April 2020. Ofwat tightened the screws on the companies\u2019 business plans by cutting the expected cost of raising capital to its lowest since privatisation. Ofwat expects the weighted average cost of capital to fall to 1.92%, from about 3.6% in the current regulatory cycle. </p> <p>The water and sewage companies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/10/watchdog-tells-water-companies-england-clean-up-act\">which have had a series of serious pollution incidents</a>, will also have to reduce pollution of sewage into rivers and streams by a nearly a third.

      "bodyText": "Ofwat, the water regulator, has ordered water companies in England and Wales to cut bills for customers by \u00a350 over five years and spend \u00a351bn on improving services and investment in infrastructure. The toughest ever crackdown on water industry profits could put Ofwat on a collision course with companies that are considering whether to take the regulator to the Competition and Markets Authority. Water companies fear that Ofwat may stifle foreign investment into the sector by expecting better service and new infrastructure while charging \u201cunreasonably\u201d low bills. The sector had planned to spend \u00a356bn over the next five years to meet Ofwat\u2019s standards but the regulator has told companies to make do with \u00a35bn less. A spokesman for Thames Water, the UK\u2019s biggest water supplier, said: \u201cThere are eight weeks to decide whether to accept \u2013 or challenge \u2013 the determination. We will carefully consider our options and announce our decision in the new year.\u201d Ofwat told the water companies to cut the amount of water lost to leaks by 16%, which it said would save enough water to meet the needs of everyone in Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield. Companies have also been told to identify and help an additional 2 million customers who need extra support and to invest more than \u00a31bn to protect communities at risk of flooding. Rachel Fletcher, the Ofwat chief executive, said: \u201cToday we\u2019re firing the starting gun on the transformation of the water industry backed by a major investment programme to deliver new, improved services for customers and the environment and resilience for generations to come. \u201cThey will be investing the equivalent of an extra \u00a36m each and every day to overhaul services, strengthen their infrastructure and improve our natural environment. And at the same time, customers\u2019 bills will fall by an average of \u00a350 before inflation.\u201d The changes, part of a price review conducted by the regulator every five years, will take effect on 1 April 2020. Ofwat tightened the screws on the companies\u2019 business plans by cutting the expected cost of raising capital to its lowest since privatisation. Ofwat expects the weighted average cost of capital to fall to 1.92%, from about 3.6% in the current regulatory cycle. The water and sewage companies, which have had a series of serious pollution incidents, will also have to reduce pollution of sewage into rivers and streams by a nearly a third. They have also been told to prepare for drier weather by spending \u00a3450m on exploring new water resources such as reservoirs. \u201cWe\u2019ve said all along this was going to be a tough review,\u201d Fletcher told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. We think this is the greenest package ever for water companies.\u201d Tony Smith, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said water companies \u201chave had it too good for too long\u201d. He said: \u201cMost customers will see this as a good deal but more must be done to make sure everyone can afford their bill and ensure there is sufficient investment in safeguarding these essential services long into the future. \u201cAt first glance it appears Ofwat has listened to our repeated calls for it to get tougher and tip the balance back in favour of customers. But we\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on the performance of companies to make sure customers are not short-changed.\u201d",

Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/revised-withdrawal-agreement-including-protocol-ireland-and-northern-ireland_en\">link to the full text</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The backstop is replaced</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Consent</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.</p>\n    <p>The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a \u201cbackstop\u201d but with a permanent tinge.</p>\n    <p>That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.</p>\n    <p>Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Checks on border, ports and airports</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Under the deal, the UK and the EU are \u201cunderlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Future trade deals</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that \u201cthe United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas\u201d in any future trade talks has been ditched.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Customs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.</p>\n    <p>No customs duties will be payable on \u201cpersonal property\u201d being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.</p>\n    <p>Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.</p>\n    <p>A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>West/east trade</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Single electricity market</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Level playing field</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lisaocarroll\"><b>Lisa O'Carroll</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Brexit correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe plan to start the process before Christmas and will do so in the proper, constitutional way, in discussion with the Speaker.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is understood the plan for Friday is to give the bill its first reading, a formality not involving a debate, and then the second reading, which involves a debate as well as a vote.

      "bodyText": "The newly elected House of Commons is likely to have its first vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan on Friday, Downing Street has said, in the first stage of the Conservative-majority government\u2019s plan to get the UK out of the EU on 31 January. The news comes as No 10 also said the prime minister had finally approved for publication a report examining Russian infiltration in British politics, which was controversially held up before the election. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC) report had been cleared by the PM, but would not be published until the new incarnation of the committee was assembled to formally approve this. Under the Brexit plans, the withdrawal agreement bill, which sets out the legal framework for the deal, will be submitted to MPs on Friday. While the Commons resumes on Tuesday, the timetable will initially be taken up with two days of swearing-in MPs, followed by the state opening of parliament and the Queen\u2019s speech. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe plan to start the process before Christmas and will do so in the proper, constitutional way, in discussion with the Speaker.\u201d It is understood the plan for Friday is to give the bill its first reading, a formality not involving a debate, and then the second reading, which involves a debate as well as a vote. However, having both on the same day will need the formal approval of the new Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. Johnson\u2019s spokesman declined to give any details on what the bill might involve, and how it might differ from the version published in October. The bill will be published before Friday, but it is not clear when. \u201cWe will present a bill which will ensure we get Brexit done before the end of January. It will reflect the agreement made with the EU on our withdrawal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe PM made clear during the general election campaign that he would be aiming for a Canada-style free trade agreement with no political alignment.\u201d Pressed for details, the spokesman said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss the precise nature of the negotiations on the free trade agreement. The prime minister has just won a very clear mandate to deliver Brexit. We\u2019re focused on getting the withdrawal agreement bill though the House of Commons and leaving the EU on 31 January.\u201d The rapid approval for publication of the report into Russian interference is likely to increase speculation that No 10 sought to suppress it before the election.

The problem is not that Trumka was involved in a trade deal; nor is it that Democrats did not get every last thing they wanted in the trade deal; the problem is that we are living in a time of incipient fascism and grotesque inequality when the millions of working people who most desperately need the protection of unions are being everywhere underpaid, disempowered and deported, and the person who represents the movement that should be kicking down doors and rushing to their rescue is, instead, focused on cutting a trade deal with Donald Trump.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t need clever little bureaucrats pursuing minor policy tweaks in an effort to recapture the good old days</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perspective: it is important to have it.</p> <p>The Democratic establishment\u2019s wrongest and most dearly held <a href=\"https://splinternews.com/the-racist-fixation-on-the-white-working-class-1825296124\">belief</a> about the 2016 election is that all we need to do is to win back some of those mythical White Working Class Voters who defected to Trump, and all will be well again.

      "bodyText": "On the evening of 18 November 1987, a lit match fell between the cracks of an old wooden escalator in Kings Cross underground station, landing on decades of accumulated grease, grime and dust. The resulting fire killed 31 passengers below ground. Until Grenfell Tower it was the most serious fire in London since the Blitz, but the catastrophe was also a wake-up call for the city\u2019s mass transit system. After an investigation, the top two senior London Underground and London Regional Transport officials resigned. Across the pond in New York City, meanwhile, the subway system was in rude shape. Government investment was flooding in. Stations were being renovated; subways cleaned of graffiti and decay; and years of deferred work finally being addressed. Ridership responded in kind, rising by 7.4% between 1984 and 1994. Today, the fates of the two networks have reversed. The London Underground has become one of the world\u2019s most reliable and innovative metro systems, while in New York a state of emergency was declared in 2017 as the subway system achieved the dubious distinction of the worst on-time performance rates of any major metropolis in the world. Videos of ceilings collapsing and stations flooding went viral. The story of how the two most important metros in the western world, serving cities with such similar pressures of population (between 8 and 9 million, and growing) and hyper-development, diverged so drastically is a story of many things \u2013 but chiefly, says Nicole Badstuber, an expert who studies transport governance at University College London and once worked for Transport for London (TfL), it is \u201ca story of maintenance\u201d. \u201cBasically since the end of the second world war, there was no investment\u201d in the London transit system, she says. The fire was an explicit message that new cash was needed immediately. So, too, was image: the Thatcher era saw London\u2019s new role as global banking capital find its home in the London Docklands, where the towers of Canary Wharf were rising. The new pressure resulted in two new high-tech arteries to serve Canary Wharf: the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and the Jubilee Line tube extension. Suddenly British developers were convinced of transport\u2019s role in expanding wealth generation. \u201cThere was no way [developers] could get this amount of workers without having mass transit,\u201d says Badstuber. \u201cThat is important because you not only had a business lobby and a developer lobby starting to say, \u2018We need to invest in transport,\u2019 but also, you now have a separate level of clientele that\u2019s using the network, and has certain expectations.\u201d That same lobby also endorsed the idea that transit should be governed by the city, not the national government, an idea that was overwhelmingly passed by referendum in 1998. Transport for London (TfL) was born, and the newly elected mayor, Ken Livingstone, whose fierce advocacy for public transport and equity was crucial in getting the agency created, put a majority of his office\u2019s budget into transport. With main arterial roads under its jurisdiction, TfL successfully revamped the city\u2019s long-ignored bus system: it created bus-only lanes, introduced flat fares and increased service. It also poached the head of the New York subway, Bob Kiley, and by the late 2000s it had taken control of all London Underground lines \u2013 previously controlled by companies through public-private partnerships. \u201cThese companies were not bringing the investment that was expected, particularly to infrastructure,\u201d Badstuber says. \u201cTo me, this is all leading up to a realisation that, actually, you need a large amount of capital investment in the system. That\u2019s what TfL got, and that\u2019s what TfL needed \u2013 and to me that\u2019s what any large system needs.\u201d Crucially, central government also committed to new funding.

In 2008, TfL won an award for best metro in Europe, and the 2012 Olympics saw the culmination of an entire new set of plans for transit-oriented development at Stratford. Nearly two-thirds of all trips in London are now made on foot, bicycle or public transit.

In 2019, only two of New York\u2019s 27 lines have modern signal systems; in London, half of the system is online, with the rest expected by 2023. But it\u2019s also an issue of governance.

The longstanding blame-game between the mayor, Bill de Blasio, the governor, Andrew Cuomo, over who\u2019s responsible is a testament to this dysfunction. Moreover, the federal government\u2019s financial contribution, says Mitchell Moss of the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation, is \u201cmodest\u201d, and usually goes to huge capital projects such as East Side Access, which will link commuter rail to Grand Central Terminal. \u201cMass transit is not a priority for the federal government,\u201d Moss says. \u201cThe federal government is very involved in airport construction and highway finance, but not mass transit.

Immediate issues of capacity, staffing cuts, and dangers to public health are also making headlines. A decline in bus ridership since 2014 has led to service cuts, which largely fall on low-income riders and students who can\u2019t afford the Tube, undercutting mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s equity initiatives like the Hopper fare (a single fare regardless of how many buses you take in a trip) or fare freezes, Badstuber argues. Nor, with an uncertain political future, can TfL be as reliant on Westminster for help. \u201cI think London is potentially at the cusp of losing its way a bit,\u201d says Badstuber. In other words, the lines may be converging again, and the metro systems of London and New York may soon find themselves at a crossroads much like the 1980s: a time when the decisions taken now will be felt for a generation. This article was amended on 16 December 2019 to correct a sentence which referred to the DLR as a monorail. It is, of course, a largely automated light metro system.

      "bodyText": "The scope for significant tax cuts in the new government\u2019s budget has been reduced after gloomier predictions for the public finances from the Treasury watchdog showed higher levels of public borrowing and a deterioration in the British economy. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that government borrowing was on course to be about \u00a320bn higher than previously expected in each year to 2023-24, dramatically cutting the government\u2019s room for manoeuvre after Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory. Closely watched business surveys suggested the British economy is on the brink of its second quarterly contraction this year after the private sector recorded its worst downturn in three years in December. Presenting Johnson with an early economic challenge to handle at the outset of his renewed term in office, the OBR said weaker economic growth at home and abroad was having an effect on the public purse.

      "body": "<p>A man has been jailed for life for the murder of two pensioners in their own homes more than 20 years ago under the double jeopardy law.</p> <p>Michael Weir killed Leonard Harris, 78, and Rose Seferian, 83, during the robberies in 1998, leaving them both for dead.</p> <p>Weir stole a signet ring and gold watch from Harris\u2019s property in east Finchley, north London, and nearly two months later ripped diamond rings from Seferian\u2019s fingers at her flat in Kensington, west London.</p> <p>The case is believed to be a legal first of a defendant convicted twice for the same offence after an acquittal in the court of appeal. It is also unique because he faced a second murder charge in addition to the original murder.</p> <p>The two deaths were not linked at the time after police failed to match Weir\u2019s palm print to one recovered from the Harris home in 1998.</p> <p>Weir was convicted of Harris\u2019s murder, burglary and the attack on Harris in 1999 but his conviction was quashed on a technicality in 2000. He was tried for Seferian\u2019s killing after new forensic evidence emerged and was retried for Harris\u2019 murder after a change to the double jeopardy law.</p> <p>Jailing Weir for life with a minimum term of 30 years, Mrs Justice McGowan said: \u201cFor the families, it\u2019s impossible to understand the extent of their grief but it is not difficult to understand their sense of loss and outrage. You killed their parents, they died terrified - killed for items of jewellery.\u201d</p> <p>A jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty of both murders last month.</p> <p>On 28 January 1998, Weir broke into Harris\u2019s north London flat. The victim was found by an estate agent calling for help from the communal landing and his widow, Gertrude, also sustained head injuries. She died several years later in a care home.</p> <p>An 18-carat gold Zenith watch that Harris had taken from a German soldier during the second world war and his gold ring were missing.</p> <p>Three days after the attack, police found a palm print on the bedroom door but missed the match to the defendant at the time because a comparative print was not the best quality, the jury heard.</p> <p>Prosecutor Tom Little QC said the evidence of the print definitely put Weir in the victim\u2019s flat, right by the scene of the attack on Harris. </p> <p>DNA testing, not available in 1998, later also linked Weir to the crime scene.

      "bodyText": "A man has been jailed for life for the murder of two pensioners in their own homes more than 20 years ago under the double jeopardy law. Michael Weir killed Leonard Harris, 78, and Rose Seferian, 83, during the robberies in 1998, leaving them both for dead. Weir stole a signet ring and gold watch from Harris\u2019s property in east Finchley, north London, and nearly two months later ripped diamond rings from Seferian\u2019s fingers at her flat in Kensington, west London. The case is believed to be a legal first of a defendant convicted twice for the same offence after an acquittal in the court of appeal. It is also unique because he faced a second murder charge in addition to the original murder. The two deaths were not linked at the time after police failed to match Weir\u2019s palm print to one recovered from the Harris home in 1998. Weir was convicted of Harris\u2019s murder, burglary and the attack on Harris in 1999 but his conviction was quashed on a technicality in 2000. He was tried for Seferian\u2019s killing after new forensic evidence emerged and was retried for Harris\u2019 murder after a change to the double jeopardy law. Jailing Weir for life with a minimum term of 30 years, Mrs Justice McGowan said: \u201cFor the families, it\u2019s impossible to understand the extent of their grief but it is not difficult to understand their sense of loss and outrage. You killed their parents, they died terrified - killed for items of jewellery.\u201d A jury at the Old Bailey found him guilty of both murders last month. On 28 January 1998, Weir broke into Harris\u2019s north London flat. The victim was found by an estate agent calling for help from the communal landing and his widow, Gertrude, also sustained head injuries. She died several years later in a care home. An 18-carat gold Zenith watch that Harris had taken from a German soldier during the second world war and his gold ring were missing. Three days after the attack, police found a palm print on the bedroom door but missed the match to the defendant at the time because a comparative print was not the best quality, the jury heard. Prosecutor Tom Little QC said the evidence of the print definitely put Weir in the victim\u2019s flat, right by the scene of the attack on Harris. DNA testing, not available in 1998, later also linked Weir to the crime scene. A blood scraping from the internal hallway revealed DNA belonging to both Harris and the defendant. A glove stained with blood was found on a grass verge outside the flat and also found to have the defendant\u2019s DNA on it. On 5 March 1998, Weir assaulted Seferian in her bedroom when she was home alone and stole rings and cash. The jewellery included a gold wedding ring with her husband\u2019s initials and the date of their marriage engraved on it, a diamond solitaire gold ring, and a silver diamond ring. Seferian managed to raise the alarm and her son found her covered in blood and \u201calmost unrecognisable\u201d from her injuries. A palm print was recovered from inside Seferian\u2019s flat on a window frame where Weir broke in but it was not matched to the defendant until 2017. By 2018, the new DNA evidence in the Harris murder had been obtained and the palm prints from both scenes had been matched to the defendant. In his evidence, Weir denied ever being at Harris\u2019s flat or Seferian\u2019s home and provided no explanation for the forensic evidence. After the verdict, Justice McGowan told jurors they had \u201cmade legal history\u201d. They were told the first case against Weir for Harris\u2019s murder was built on DNA erroneously kept on the police database. The original trial judge had ruled it was admissible but that decision was overturned by appeal judges and Weir\u2019s conviction was quashed. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) missed a deadline to appeal to the House of Lords by a day. But the Lords later found that, in a similar case as well as Weir\u2019s, the original decision to admit the DNA was correct. Weir was charged again over Harris\u2019s death due to a change in the double jeopardy law in 2005. Jill Harris, Harris daughter-in-law, said the family felt \u201clet down by the criminal justice system\u201d for the errors that led to Weir\u2019s first conviction being quashed and the CPS\u2019s failure to make an appeal in time. She said her husband, Frank, had suffered a stroke that doctors believed was linked to the stress of the retrial process. Seferian\u2019s daughter, Sona, said in a statement: \u201cThe defendant has been allowed to get on with his life for 21 years. Our wound is still sore and it has never healed. We all know death will strike at some point but not in such a horrific and senseless way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s both draws sorted, then. Extremely tough conditions for the English sides in the Champions League, and a rather easier ride for the British teams in the Europa League draw: Rangers v Braga is arguably the toughest of the British bunch in the second-tier competition \u2013 you would expect Celtic to beat Copenhagen, Manchester United to beat Club Brugge, Arsenal to beat Olympiakos and Wolves to give Espanyol a good game. Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Park Ji-sung, who is at the draw as a Manchester United ambassador: There is no easy team. These days, the team is doing so well. Hopefully we can get a good result. A couple of years ago, we won the trophy, and we know how important that it. But we don\u2019t just want to focus on one competition. Here are some selected odds for winning the Europa League, now that the draw has taken place. Wolves and Roma with the same odds! Man Utd \u2013 11/2 Arsenal \u2013 7/1 Ajax -7/1 Inter Milan \u2013 9/1 Wolves \u2013 17/1 Roma \u2013 17/1 Celtic \u2013 66/1 Rangers - 150/1 David Miles, Arsenal General Secretary, speaks about the draw with Olympiakos: We\u2019re not doing too well in the Premier League do the Europa League does offer a route into the Champions League, so this will be a big priority. Asked about the management position, he says: \u201cWe hope for some stability soon.\u201d With the ties involving British teams highlighted in bold. Wolves v Espanyol Sporting Lisbon v Istanbul Basaksehir Getafe v Ajax Bayer Leverkusen v Porto FC Copenhagen v Celtic Apoel FC v FC Basel FC Cluj v Sevilla Olympiakos v Arsenal AZ Alkmaar v LASK Club Brugge v Manchester United Ludogorets v Internazionale Eintracht Frankfurt v FC Salzburg Shakhtar Donetsk v Benfica Wolfsburg v Malmo Roma v Gent Rangers v Braga Braga topped the group that Wolves were in, in the group stage. Tough draw for the Belgians. Josephine Henning smiles a little as she draws her old team. Two huge teams. Frankfurt got to the semi-finals last season, remember, where they were knocked out by Chelsea over two legs. Antonio Conte\u2019s side will go to Bulgaria. Park Ji-sung looks non-plussed in the plush Uefa seats. LASK topped their Europa League group, beating Sporting into second place. The Joel Campbell derby No club has won this competition more times than the Spanish side. Basel reached the semi-finals in 2013, where they went out to Chelsea. Celtic fans, how do you feel about that one? That\u2019s a tasty draw. Ajax dropped into the Europa League this season after finishing third in their Champions League group. No club has played more times in the Uefa Cup/Europa League than Sporting Lisbon: 33. This is the first time in the round of 32 for Istanbul Basaksehir. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s side will host the Spanish side first. Here we go, then. The draw is about to begin. Josephine Henning, who retired from football in 2018 at the age of 27, comes on stage. She won 42 caps for Germany, won gold at the 2016 Olympics and played for some of Europe\u2019s biggest clubs inclusing Wolfsburg, PSG, Lyon and Arsenal. She comes out with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, who won this competition twice with Sevilla in 2006 and 2007, scoring in both finals against Middlesbrough and Espanyol. A Uefa suit comes on stage to tell us we are \u201cgetting closer\u201d to the Europa League draw, which is undeniably a positive thing. Is the Europa League trophy the best looking bit of silverware in club football? Yes. Keep your emails and tweets coming in to michael.butler@theguardian.com and @michaelbutler18, but we are moving now to the Europa League draw. Here\u2019s how it works: the round of 32 draw consists of the top two from each group, plus eight teams dropping from the Champions League: A reminder of the qualifiers from each group: Group A Sevilla, Apoel Group B Malm\u00f6, Copenhagen Group C Basel, Getafe Group D LASK, Sporting Group E Celtic, Cluj Group F Arsenal, Eintracht Frankfurt Group G Porto, Rangers Group H Espanyol, Ludogorets Group I Gent, Wolfsburg Group J Istanbul Basaksehir, Roma Group K Braga, Wolves Group L Manchester United, AZ Alkmaar Dropping from Champions League Ajax, Bayer Leverkusen, Benfica, Brugge, Internazionale, Olympiakos, Salzburg, Shakhtar Donetsk A reminder of the ground rules: group winners will be drawn against group runners up, but cannot be drawn against teams from the group that they qualified from, or teams from their own nation. First legs take place 20 Feb, second legs 27 Feb Ledley King of Tottenham Hotspur reacts to the draw with RB Leipzig: It\u2019s a tough task. They play with a lot of pace and intensity and have proved a surprise package. It\u2019s a challenge we won\u2019t be taking lightly. I hope that our experience of being in the Champions League will be important. The manager [Mourinho] has been there and done it. His experience will rub off on the players. RB Leipzig are currently leading the Bundesliga, so while they are arguably the easiest opponents for English opponents, they could easily do the business on Spurs. Personally, I can\u2019t see Chelsea beating Bayern over two legs. Would be interesting to see Callum Hudson-Odoi run riot against the German side that looked certain to sign him last season. Chelsea, meanwhile, have reacted to drawing old foes Bayern Munich. Personally, would have gone for Drogba and 2012, but whatevs. Txiki Begiristain, Manchester City\u2019s director of football, speaks! It\u2019s a difficult one. Real Madrid are the best. We want to be the best so we have to try and beat them. It\u2019s always a pleasure to play against Real Madrid. We know them very well. They know our manager. Accurate of exactly five minutes ago (following the draw), here are the live odds for teams to win the Champions League outright. Manchester City remain favourites to win their first-ever Champions League, despite drawing Real Madrid. Man City - 7/2 Liverpool - 4/1 Barcelona - 5/1 PSG - 13/2 Bayern Munich - 15/2 Juventus - 12/1 Real Madrid - 16/1 Tottenham - 22/1 Atletico Madrid - 28/1 Chelsea - 40/1 RB Leipzig - 40/1 Borussia Dortmund - 66/1 Napoli - 80/1 Valencia - 100/1 That is a horrendous draw for the English sides, save for Tottenham. Of the sides that Liverpool (Atalanta, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon, Real Madrid) and Manchester City (Real Madrid, Napoli, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon) could have drawn, theirs are arguably the hardest. Borussia Dortmund v PSG Real Madrid v Manchester City Atalanta v Valencia Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Liverpool Chelsea v Bayern Munich Lyon v Juventus Tottenham v RB Leipzig Napoli v Barcelona Should be an easy one for Gattuso and co. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is going to win the whole thing, isn\u2019t he. Cristiano will be pleased with that. Bayern were the only team to win all six matches in the group stage. Tough ties for the English sides! Liverpool go back to the Wanda Metropolitano, where they were crowned champions of Europe just a few months ago. A relatively soft tie. Atalanta are the first debutants to reach the last 16 since Leicester. An easy one for the favourites, Manchester City, then. That\u2019s if they are still favourites. A whopper to get us started. Thomas Tuchel will return to Dortmund. Here we go! The draw starts now. Kelly Smith, England legend, is invited onto the stage to help with the draw. She talks of how great it is that the Women\u2019s Champions League will be expanded to include a last-16 group stage for the 2021-22 season. Hamit Alt\u0131ntop, formerly of Bayern, Schalke and Galatasaray, is another to join the ceremony. This year\u2019s Champions League final, of course, is in Istanbul, Altintop\u2019s home country. He also won the Puskas Award in 2010 for this thunderbastard. Woof. The last time we had a Champions League draw, back in the summer, Slavia Prague were drawn into the \u2018Group of Death\u2019 with Barcelona, Dortmund and Inter. Ah. Here we go: Pedro Pinto, formerly of CNN, will host the draw. Ledley King, Tottenham\u2019s representative at the draw, looks nervous. \u201cCOYS\u201d, emails Thomas Simmons. This is a fun story: Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen leads second-placed Nick Tanner, the former Liverpool and Bristol Rovers defender, and his team \u201cwinorloseonthebooze\u201d. There are over seven million people playing that game. A friendly reminder that the Europa League last-32 draw will follow this one. The same rules apply there, but we could easily see Rangers play Arsenal or Manchester United or Celtic face Wolves. Based upon their past performances in this competition, it is perhaps surprising to see Manchester City as the clear favourites before the draw. Here are the current odds for all the teams. Man City - 13/4 Liverpool - 5/1 Barcelona - 8/1 PSG - 15/2 Bayern Munich - 8/1 Juventus - 14/1 Real Madrid - 16/1 Tottenham - 25/1 Atletico Madrid - 25/1 Chelsea - 40/1 Borussia Dortmund - 66/1 RB Leipzig - 66/1 Napoli - 66/1 Valencia - 150/1 This is the first ever season in the Champions League where all 16 teams have come from the top five leagues in Europe. Shakhtar, Ajax, Benfica and Zenit all came close to qualifying, but ultimately it was only the teams from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain that qualified. Atalanta are perhaps the team that most teams will be hoping to face. They gained just one point from their first four games, before two wins saw them qualify as runners up with seven points, behind Manchester City in Group C. Their dance here is, of course, a tribute to their captain, Papu G\u00f3mez. So it\u2019s about 30 minutes until the actual draw, which takes place at Uefa\u2019s HQ in Nyon, Switzerland. Here are some red-hot pictures of the stage to get your juices flowing. Hello world! It is 64 days until the next Champions League action, but don\u2019t let that stop you getting excited! Glory awaits! Or at least a lucrative payout when your team falls at the first hurdle! Exciting! Here are the 16 teams that are left in the competition with eight group winners and eight group runners up making the cut. Group winners PSG Bayern Munich Manchester City Juventus Liverpool Barcelona RB Leipzig Valencia Group runners up Real Madrid Tottenham Hotspur Atalanta Atl\u00e9tico Madrid Napoli Borussia Dortmund Lyon Chelsea Some basic ground rules: group winners will be drawn against group runners up, but cannot be drawn against other teams from their own nation, or from the group that they qualified from. E.g. Liverpool (Group E winners) cannot be drawn against Napoli Chelsea or Tottenham Hotspur. Liverpool can therefore draw: Atalanta, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon, Real Madrid. Manchester City can therefore draw: Real Madrid, Napoli, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Lyon. Spurs can therefore draw: PSG, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig, Valencia. Chelsea can therefore draw: PSG, Bayern, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig. Got it? To work out the non-English teams\u2019 potential draw, you can view all of the Champions League groups right here. The first legs are scheduled for 18/19/25 or 26 February and the second legs are set for 10/11/17 or 18.",

      "body": "<p>One Christmas, Steve Lazarides and Banksy decided to kill Santa. \u201cReject false icons,\u201d read the slogan hastily spray painted across their shopfront, behind a highly festive effigy they had created of Father Christmas dangling from a noose. Dotted around were signs intended to lure passersby into their shop, in the hope that they would join in the party and buy some artworks. The signs, however, may have had the opposite effect. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2004/nov/18/1\">Santa\u2019s Ghetto</a>,\u201d read one. \u201cStinking art piss,\u201d read another.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a few complaints about what we did to Santa,\u201d says Lazarides, once Banksy\u2019s right-hand man. \u201cAnd about the noise. We didn\u2019t care. It was a group show we did every year, so artists could make a little dough and punters could pick up some affordable art for Christmas stockings.\u201d</p> <p>Lazarides worked with Banksy for 11 rollercoaster years, initially documenting the artist at work back in 1997, then becoming his agent, strategist and even minder. The Christmas art shop had been rented from one of Soho\u2019s last porn barons \u2013 but disaster struck. Liquid leaked through from the floor above, soaking an impromptu chandelier made of traffic cones. \u201cI went to investigate,\u201d says Lazarides. \u201cIt was a toilet overflowing. The crowd at the party thought it was part of the show. It wasn\u2019t.

Lazarides recalls carrying armfuls of original Banksy prints to the shop, where they\u2019d shift for \u00a325. \u201cAt today\u2019s rates,\u201d he says, \u201cI reckon each armful would be worth about half a million quid.\u201d</p> <p>One work, called <a href=\"http://www.banksyeditions.com/project/bomb-middle-england-signed/\">Bomb Middle England</a>, depicted three elderly women playing bowls with balls that had lit fuses coming out of them. In 2007, Sotheby\u2019s sold a version of this image for \u00a3102,000, at the time the most ever fetched for a Banksy. It has since been eclipsed, with the title now held by the 2009 painting Devolved Parliament, which went for \u00a38.5m earlier this year.</p> <p>While Lazarides is happily reminiscing about the Santas of Christmases past, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/10/banksy-birmingham-reindeer-homeless-art-christmas\">Banksy is </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/10/banksy-birmingham-reindeer-homeless-art-christmas\">on the streets of Birmingham</a> making art about the scandals of Christmas present \u2013 in the form of his mural and video of two reindeer pulling, not Santa in his sleigh, but a homeless man called Ryan lying on a bench in the city\u2019s jewellery quarter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had the time of my life.

      "bodyText": "One Christmas, Steve Lazarides and Banksy decided to kill Santa. \u201cReject false icons,\u201d read the slogan hastily spray painted across their shopfront, behind a highly festive effigy they had created of Father Christmas dangling from a noose. Dotted around were signs intended to lure passersby into their shop, in the hope that they would join in the party and buy some artworks. The signs, however, may have had the opposite effect. \u201cSanta\u2019s Ghetto,\u201d read one. \u201cStinking art piss,\u201d read another. \u201cThere were a few complaints about what we did to Santa,\u201d says Lazarides, once Banksy\u2019s right-hand man. \u201cAnd about the noise. We didn\u2019t care. It was a group show we did every year, so artists could make a little dough and punters could pick up some affordable art for Christmas stockings.\u201d Lazarides worked with Banksy for 11 rollercoaster years, initially documenting the artist at work back in 1997, then becoming his agent, strategist and even minder. The Christmas art shop had been rented from one of Soho\u2019s last porn barons \u2013 but disaster struck. Liquid leaked through from the floor above, soaking an impromptu chandelier made of traffic cones. \u201cI went to investigate,\u201d says Lazarides. \u201cIt was a toilet overflowing. The crowd at the party thought it was part of the show. It wasn\u2019t. It was literally stinking art piss.\u201d The art he and Banksy sold at Santa\u2019s Ghetto was certainly affordable back in the noughties \u2013 but it could not be classified as such today. Lazarides recalls carrying armfuls of original Banksy prints to the shop, where they\u2019d shift for \u00a325. \u201cAt today\u2019s rates,\u201d he says, \u201cI reckon each armful would be worth about half a million quid.\u201d One work, called Bomb Middle England, depicted three elderly women playing bowls with balls that had lit fuses coming out of them. In 2007, Sotheby\u2019s sold a version of this image for \u00a3102,000, at the time the most ever fetched for a Banksy. It has since been eclipsed, with the title now held by the 2009 painting Devolved Parliament, which went for \u00a38.5m earlier this year. While Lazarides is happily reminiscing about the Santas of Christmases past, Banksy is on the streets of Birmingham making art about the scandals of Christmas present \u2013 in the form of his mural and video of two reindeer pulling, not Santa in his sleigh, but a homeless man called Ryan lying on a bench in the city\u2019s jewellery quarter. \u201cHow do you define greatest?\u201d says Lazarides. \u201cBy money? No, by recognisability. And by that criterion, he is the greatest. Forget Warhol, forget everybody except Rembrandt and Van Gogh. He\u2019s a genius.\u201d As proof, he cites Girl With Balloon, the painting that shredded itself moments after being sold for more than \u00a31m at Sotheby\u2019s last year. (\u201cPerformance art of the highest order.\u201d) And then there\u2019s the union jack stab vest Banksy designed for Stormzy\u2019s showstopping Glastonbury performance last summer. Lazarides has now self-published a book of his photographs from the time he travelled the world tasked with making sure Banksy didn\u2019t get arrested or duffed up and didn\u2019t run out of spray paint. \u201cI had the time of my life,\u201d he says as he sits on the roof of his London office, talking about the man he calls Matey Boy. \u201cWe were lawless and did just what we wanted. Matey Boy had a political agenda that you can see very clearly in everything he does, but I just had a fucking blast.\u201d He met Banksy on an assignment for Sleaze Nation magazine, where Lazarides was a photographer. \u201cI was from Bristol like him and loved graffiti art \u2013 it was for the dispossessed, those of us who didn\u2019t go to galleries or have private educations. So it was a meeting of minds from day one.\u201d How come you two were never arrested? \u201cThe secret,\u201d he says, \u201cis hi-vis jackets and traffic cones. Nobody stops you if you have them.\u201d However, there was a morning in New York\u2019s Meatpacking District (\u201cbefore it was gentrified\u201d) when a few transgender sex workers took exception to Banksy painting a wall. \u201cSome of them misconstrued what he was writing as homophobic and called the cops. That\u2019s about as close to getting arrested as we got.\u201d He and Banksy had various scams to help them get away with things. \u201cOnce I gave him a letter saying he had permission from a film producer to paint a wall. And I would be the film producer, armed with a burner phone. If I got a call, I was primed to say, \u2018Sorry mate, I meant him to do the other side of the street.\u2019\u201d The book is called Banksy Captured and consists of Lazarides\u2019 photographs of the art world\u2019s favourite enigma at work, whittled down from his collection of 12,000.

      "body": "<p>York, where I grew up, is picturesque at any time, but at Christmas it\u2019s stupidly charming: a Dickensian vision of twinkling lights strung across narrow paved streets. There\u2019s the soaring gothic minster, pale and intricate as a prize-winning ice sculpture, bells ringing and choristers singing, and there are six homemade mince pies for \u00a31 in the market. What could be nicer than to wander through the bustle, ending up in one of the city\u2019s cosy pubs next to a crackling fire as the winter sun fades and the afternoon blue deepens into inky dusk punctuated with the first stars? It\u2019s magical. Unless your first love is awkwardly, slowly, but surely, dumping you.</p> <p>With hindsight, there had been warning signs, but I had chosen to ignore them. He was my first proper boyfriend and it had been a breathtaking courtship, heightened by a thrilling frisson of transgression: I was a 17-year-old student and he was in his early 20s, helping out at my school. We stopped short of having sex (just), but even so, as the mother of a 17-year-old myself now, I can see it was grimly inappropriate. At the time, though, it was the most romantic thing that had ever happened to me.</p> <p>Admittedly, there wasn\u2019t much competition. Until him, my love life had been limited to intense crushes from a distance and elaborate daydreams about French film stars. Having a real (illicit) boyfriend unlocked an unexpected level in my well-behaved teenage life, and it was better than any of my Nouvelle Vague-fuelled daydreaming. He was no Greek god, but he was older, confident and, more importantly, he liked me. We snuck around and met in secret. He hid snippets of Yeats poems, typed out on an actual typewriter, in my textbooks for me to find. He bought me flowers and talked to me like an actual adult about films I should watch and music I should listen to (yes, mansplaining was also rife in 1992). That summer, he had driven us to country pubs where I sat, drunk with infatuation and the pints he liked me to neck, entwined around him and buzzing with happiness.</p> <p>Then autumn came, he moved away and contact became \u2026 sporadic. In an era of landlines, he was hard to track down and evasive when I suggested visiting. He never replied to my effusive letters and I would call his shared house and get fobbed off by strangers to a background soundtrack of grownup carousing. I pined, but I was also busy with A-levels and Oxford entrance preparation, and doing all the busy, good-girl stuff that was expected of me. But then the Christmas holidays came and I got the call I had been waiting for: he was coming to see me.</p> <p>I combed the packed shops, trying to find a Christmas present that would convey my ineffable coolness and desirability. I finally found a rare, and extremely expensive, import cassette from the post-punk girl band Shonen Knife that I rather coveted myself. Then one afternoon, in the frenetic fortnight before Christmas, I wove my way through the hordes of shoppers and tourists to meet him in the Kings Arms, a half-timbered and beamed riverfront pub. He didn\u2019t exactly look thrilled to see me, but I threw myself into his arms anyway. I found myself swiftly disentangled and a pint shoved into my hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea7c6fef3103e2c6b7d78ed4ba998107bb6a2ac9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea7c6fef3103e2c6b7d78ed4ba998107bb6a2ac9/0_376_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"York at Christmas \u2026 \u2018A Dickensian vision of twinkling lights strung across narrow paved streets.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">York at Christmas \u2026 \u2018A Dickensian vision of twinkling lights strung across narrow paved streets.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Potter/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We sat down (on the left-hand side, a table against the wall \u2013 yes, I remember it precisely), and he started to talk. I couldn\u2019t quite grasp what he was saying, at first: blah, blah, it wasn\u2019t practical; I was very young. Why was he telling me this? None of that stuff mattered! We were perfect! We both loved Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine! (I preferred Crowded House, but was trying to go with the flow.) It took ages \u2013 and several more pints in several other pubs \u2013 for the penny to drop. When I did get the message, I refused to accept it. It is to his credit (on this point if in almost no other respect) that he dumped me in person, quite kindly, and did it repeatedly over several hours as I tried to argue, increasingly intoxicated and inarticulate, against my own dumping.</p> <p>We headed back towards my house, through the merry crowds. By this point the Dickensian York street scenes had degenerated into something closer to Hogarth\u2019s Gin Lane: all pretence of Christmas shopping had been abandoned in favour of heavy drinking, Santa hats were askew and the odd halfhearted punch-up was breaking out. He walked me to my front door, then turned to leave. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got you a present!\u201d I whimpered.

      "bodyText": "York, where I grew up, is picturesque at any time, but at Christmas it\u2019s stupidly charming: a Dickensian vision of twinkling lights strung across narrow paved streets. There\u2019s the soaring gothic minster, pale and intricate as a prize-winning ice sculpture, bells ringing and choristers singing, and there are six homemade mince pies for \u00a31 in the market. What could be nicer than to wander through the bustle, ending up in one of the city\u2019s cosy pubs next to a crackling fire as the winter sun fades and the afternoon blue deepens into inky dusk punctuated with the first stars? It\u2019s magical. Unless your first love is awkwardly, slowly, but surely, dumping you. With hindsight, there had been warning signs, but I had chosen to ignore them. He was my first proper boyfriend and it had been a breathtaking courtship, heightened by a thrilling frisson of transgression: I was a 17-year-old student and he was in his early 20s, helping out at my school. We stopped short of having sex (just), but even so, as the mother of a 17-year-old myself now, I can see it was grimly inappropriate. At the time, though, it was the most romantic thing that had ever happened to me. Admittedly, there wasn\u2019t much competition. Until him, my love life had been limited to intense crushes from a distance and elaborate daydreams about French film stars. Having a real (illicit) boyfriend unlocked an unexpected level in my well-behaved teenage life, and it was better than any of my Nouvelle Vague-fuelled daydreaming. He was no Greek god, but he was older, confident and, more importantly, he liked me. We snuck around and met in secret. He hid snippets of Yeats poems, typed out on an actual typewriter, in my textbooks for me to find. He bought me flowers and talked to me like an actual adult about films I should watch and music I should listen to (yes, mansplaining was also rife in 1992). That summer, he had driven us to country pubs where I sat, drunk with infatuation and the pints he liked me to neck, entwined around him and buzzing with happiness. Then autumn came, he moved away and contact became \u2026 sporadic. In an era of landlines, he was hard to track down and evasive when I suggested visiting. He never replied to my effusive letters and I would call his shared house and get fobbed off by strangers to a background soundtrack of grownup carousing. I pined, but I was also busy with A-levels and Oxford entrance preparation, and doing all the busy, good-girl stuff that was expected of me. But then the Christmas holidays came and I got the call I had been waiting for: he was coming to see me. I combed the packed shops, trying to find a Christmas present that would convey my ineffable coolness and desirability. I finally found a rare, and extremely expensive, import cassette from the post-punk girl band Shonen Knife that I rather coveted myself. Then one afternoon, in the frenetic fortnight before Christmas, I wove my way through the hordes of shoppers and tourists to meet him in the Kings Arms, a half-timbered and beamed riverfront pub. He didn\u2019t exactly look thrilled to see me, but I threw myself into his arms anyway. I found myself swiftly disentangled and a pint shoved into my hand. We sat down (on the left-hand side, a table against the wall \u2013 yes, I remember it precisely), and he started to talk. I couldn\u2019t quite grasp what he was saying, at first: blah, blah, it wasn\u2019t practical; I was very young. Why was he telling me this? None of that stuff mattered! We were perfect! We both loved Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine! (I preferred Crowded House, but was trying to go with the flow.) It took ages \u2013 and several more pints in several other pubs \u2013 for the penny to drop. When I did get the message, I refused to accept it. It is to his credit (on this point if in almost no other respect) that he dumped me in person, quite kindly, and did it repeatedly over several hours as I tried to argue, increasingly intoxicated and inarticulate, against my own dumping. We headed back towards my house, through the merry crowds. By this point the Dickensian York street scenes had degenerated into something closer to Hogarth\u2019s Gin Lane: all pretence of Christmas shopping had been abandoned in favour of heavy drinking, Santa hats were askew and the odd halfhearted punch-up was breaking out. He walked me to my front door, then turned to leave. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got you a present!\u201d I whimpered. So he waited while I fetched the Shonen Knife album and handed it over (I regretted this bitterly later). I stared into his shifty, already absent eyes, my own swimming with tears, mascara and the deluded hope that my fantastic gift would make him change his mind. It didn\u2019t. Christmas was mulled misery, a bleak midwinter that nothing relieved. I had never really imagined it would be possible not to have a reasonably merry one before that, but that one was entirely devoid of sparkle.

The details of the charge read: \u201cDuring the period of 13 November 2015 and 7 September 2019, as the Welsh Rugby Union national squad assistant coach, you placed 364 bets on rugby union, featuring 1,163 matches in total, using accounts held with Betway, William Hill and Ladbrokes, registered in your name, and received the proceeds [or part of the proceeds] of the successful bets.\u201d</p> <p>The number of bets was reduced by one before the start of the hearing which took place at the Principality Stadium, scene of so many triumphs as a player and as a coach for Howley, not least the final match of the 2013 Six Nations when he was in charge with Warren Gatland on a Lions sabbatical and Wales thrashed England to secure the title.</p> <p>The panel noted that Howley was honest about his activities.

If I was being evasive, I would not have used my works mobile phone and email account.\u201d</p> <p>Paterson submitted her report at the end of November. It noted that Howley admitted placing a bet before Wales\u2019s grand slam match against Ireland in Cardiff last March on a Welsh player being the first try scorer. \u201cHe was at pains to point out that it was part of a treble bet, part and parcel of his normal recreational betting activity. He admitted he knew he was in breach of the regulations to bet on matches involving Wales as well as other rugby matches.\u201d</p> <p>The panel noted: \u201cMr Howley answered every question which was put to him. He did not seek to avoid responsibility for what he had done. He was clearly remorseful and very anxious about the effect his actions was having on his family.\u201d</p> <p>The investigation found that Howley placed 200 bets with William Hill, 150 with Betway and 13 with Ladbrokes. \u201cThese bets were sometimes placed as single bets (168 occasions) but on the other occasions they were placed as parts of \u2018doubles\u2019, \u2018trebles\u2019 and \u2018accumulators\u2019. Of the 363 bets, 24 were placed on \u201cconnected events\u201d as defined in the regulations.</p> <p>\u201cSome of those bets involved matches in which Wales was participating and two of the bets were placed upon two individuals representing Wales.

The ban is backdated to the date of his suspension and he will be able to resume his career on 16 June, although the panel noted the affair had put a \u201cvery significant strain on his health\u201d and that a punitive punishment \u201cwould likely impact adversely on his well-being\u201d.</p>",

The panel, which received \u201cpowerful\u201d letters from leading figures in the game who had worked with Howley, Sir Ian McGeechan, Gatland and the Wales centre Jonathan Davies, decided that Howley\u2019s actions merited more than the minimum six-month suspension and gave him 18 months, with half of it suspended. The ban is backdated to the date of his suspension and he will be able to resume his career on 16 June, although the panel noted the affair had put a \u201cvery significant strain on his health\u201d and that a punitive punishment \u201cwould likely impact adversely on his well-being\u201d.",

This is how I felt on reading The Big Sleep. It was chosen for my bookclub and as I\u2019d never read any Raymond Chandler I was excited at the prospect of finding out more. This story follows private investigator, Philip Marlowe, as he gets embroiled in a world of murder, racketeering, seedy photos and people who drink Champagne with Brandy. A good read with a host of unlikeable characters. It left me feeling a little unsatisfied but that could be the genius of the storytelling as life can be that way. #thebigsleep #raymondchandler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/thehalcyondaysofsummer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; A Literary Life \u2661 Siobhan&lt;/a&gt; (@thehalcyondaysofsummer) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-12-14T18:22:15+00:00&quot;&gt;Dec 14, 2019 at 10:22am PST&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Big Sleep</figcaption> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/dec/09/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> your comments and photos </a>from last week.</p> <p>Ah yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/victory-boris-johnson-election-jeremy-corbyn\">last week</a>. The recent unfortunateness, along with reading Clear Waters Rising, by Nicholas Crane has prompted a good question from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3712670\">tiojo</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A tale of his long walk along the watershed of Europe from northern Spain, along the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Carpathians to Istanbul. A trek that took place in the early 90s not long after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. As he approaches the end of his journey he dodges and criss-crosses boundaries in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia. The last named a country that did not yet exist. He talks to a shopkeeper who says, \u2018The only people who gain from nationalism are the politicians and the chauvinists.\u2019</p> <p>I wonder what he might find and what he might have to say if, 25 years later, he walked the length of the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>Broken Ghost by Niall Griffiths also seems \u201cvery appropriate indeed\u201d to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a Bukowski/Vlautin style, Griffiths presents his pessimistic vision of the effect of austerity and discontent by emphasising a malaise in society. The book is a richly textured evocation of a small town living with a gritty concoction of depravity, sex, drugs, alcohol, and violence\u2026 The novel\u2019s fascination with squalor might be too much for some, but if you can bear it, Griffiths\u2019 unflinching approach succeeds. It\u2019s an explosive journey of rot and recovery all the way up to the repression of its harrowing finish.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4548062\">BaddHamster</a> has just started The Devil I Know by Claire Kilroy and :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So far so absolutely excellently written. This is a satire of the excesses, greed and ugliness of the Celtic Tiger years in Ireland and, so far at least, it\u2019s funny and moving in equal measure and the prose is so good it\u2019s provoking extremes of admiration and jealousy in me. The bottom line is that whenever I put it down, I can\u2019t wait to get back to it to see what happens next. Can\u2019t be a bad sign.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Sandra Ireland is well worth reading,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13340763\">storm46</a>, who has just finished her first book:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Beneath the Skin sounds quirky, even off-putting to some, but stick with it. Walt takes a job at an Edinburgh taxidermist which is described in the blurb as not his wisest move since, \u2018already suffering from combat stress, and struggling to outrun the horrors of his time on the front line, he finds himself confronted by the undead on a daily basis.\u2019</p> <p>I am not going to say much more as it is the development of the story and the characters which draws you in and keep you gripped and not knowing too much will make it more enjoyable. Her writing is brilliant, pithy, with heart, compassion and humour.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been immersed in Elizabeth Jane Howard\u2019s Cazalet Chronicles,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15227882\">UndercoverOps</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve rushed through the first two (up to December 1941) and feel I should now have a break to read something else, but I can\u2019t because I so want to know what the characters are going to do next. I keep thinking about them all! Howard writes her characters with empathy so it is hard not to care about them, despite their flaws and weaknesses. She seems to have a very humane kindness and understanding of people\u2019s complexities. It\u2019s particularly satisfying to see how the children develop as the years pass.</p> </blockquote> <p>In The Distance by Hernan Diaz seems unusual to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100544865\">jimitron5000</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I find this a difficult book to describe and it doesn\u2019t necessarily fit any genre that I can think of. It\u2019s a book of existence I suppose, a young boy from Sweden arriving in the US in the 1840s or 50s or thereabouts and learning about his environment and responding to it. He lives a solitary life for the most part and yet his deeds take on a near mythical status leading him becoming a wanted man.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Ah yes, last week. The recent unfortunateness, along with reading Clear Waters Rising, by Nicholas Crane has prompted a good question from tiojo: A tale of his long walk along the watershed of Europe from northern Spain, along the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Carpathians to Istanbul. A trek that took place in the early 90s not long after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. As he approaches the end of his journey he dodges and criss-crosses boundaries in Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia. The last named a country that did not yet exist. He talks to a shopkeeper who says, \u2018The only people who gain from nationalism are the politicians and the chauvinists.\u2019 I wonder what he might find and what he might have to say if, 25 years later, he walked the length of the UK. Broken Ghost by Niall Griffiths also seems \u201cvery appropriate indeed\u201d to safereturndoubtful: In a Bukowski/Vlautin style, Griffiths presents his pessimistic vision of the effect of austerity and discontent by emphasising a malaise in society. The book is a richly textured evocation of a small town living with a gritty concoction of depravity, sex, drugs, alcohol, and violence\u2026 The novel\u2019s fascination with squalor might be too much for some, but if you can bear it, Griffiths\u2019 unflinching approach succeeds. It\u2019s an explosive journey of rot and recovery all the way up to the repression of its harrowing finish. BaddHamster has just started The Devil I Know by Claire Kilroy and : So far so absolutely excellently written. This is a satire of the excesses, greed and ugliness of the Celtic Tiger years in Ireland and, so far at least, it\u2019s funny and moving in equal measure and the prose is so good it\u2019s provoking extremes of admiration and jealousy in me. The bottom line is that whenever I put it down, I can\u2019t wait to get back to it to see what happens next. Can\u2019t be a bad sign. \u201cSandra Ireland is well worth reading,\u201d says storm46, who has just finished her first book: Beneath the Skin sounds quirky, even off-putting to some, but stick with it. Walt takes a job at an Edinburgh taxidermist which is described in the blurb as not his wisest move since, \u2018already suffering from combat stress, and struggling to outrun the horrors of his time on the front line, he finds himself confronted by the undead on a daily basis.\u2019 I am not going to say much more as it is the development of the story and the characters which draws you in and keep you gripped and not knowing too much will make it more enjoyable. Her writing is brilliant, pithy, with heart, compassion and humour. \u201cI\u2019ve been immersed in Elizabeth Jane Howard\u2019s Cazalet Chronicles,\u201d says UndercoverOps: I\u2019ve rushed through the first two (up to December 1941) and feel I should now have a break to read something else, but I can\u2019t because I so want to know what the characters are going to do next. I keep thinking about them all! Howard writes her characters with empathy so it is hard not to care about them, despite their flaws and weaknesses. She seems to have a very humane kindness and understanding of people\u2019s complexities. It\u2019s particularly satisfying to see how the children develop as the years pass. In The Distance by Hernan Diaz seems unusual to jimitron5000: I find this a difficult book to describe and it doesn\u2019t necessarily fit any genre that I can think of. It\u2019s a book of existence I suppose, a young boy from Sweden arriving in the US in the 1840s or 50s or thereabouts and learning about his environment and responding to it. He lives a solitary life for the most part and yet his deeds take on a near mythical status leading him becoming a wanted man. So much of what we might consider needed or essential is rendered as irrelevant in this story. It\u2019s a bit different, but well worth a read. Finally, Picnic at Hanging Rock by Joan Lindsay has impressed Empsk: It seemed to me to be a sort of statement about the uselessness of \u2018Englishness\u2019 - rosebushes and poetry and soft pale skin - when contrasted with white Australian-ness, which is rougher, more practical. I enjoyed the sense of menace that ran through the book, and the idea that the wilderness is no place for people. I have a feeling that we\u2019ll be hearing plenty more about the uselessness of Englishness in the not too distant future\u2026 Interesting links about books and reading \u201cEnglish majors, cast off your Starbucks aprons: A desperate nation finally needs you!\u201d Why good readers might help stave off the collapse of American democracy. Erica Wagner on how reading has changed in the 2010s. Mexico recalls Argentina ambassador for alleged book theft. Deborah Levy would like to drink with Virgina Woolf.

The wind was cold as I came out and there were dark clouds in the sky, but despite this a dozen people, adults and children, had gathered to demonstrate outside, Greta Thunberg among them. We talked a little about what she thought about the future, I took some pictures, and walked away. When I looked back at her a few seconds later, she was being interviewed by another journalist. I remember thinking, \u201cThis is the beginning of something big.\u201d</p> <p>Greta\u2019s message is extremely important. She wants to take care of the Earth and the resources that are left to us. I am very proud of my own efforts in spreading her message \u2013 my picture has been in an exhibition in Canada, on a book cover, made into postcards, stickers and published all over the world. Girl power. <em>As told to Imogen Tilden</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e06b81625fdef947e13f87b9d47c1308812a228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e06b81625fdef947e13f87b9d47c1308812a228/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samburu warriors touch Kilifi, an orphaned black rhino, in Kenya, 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samburu warriors touch Kilifi, an orphaned black rhino, in Kenya, 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ami Vitale/National Geographic/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ami Vitale</h2> <p>With only about 5,500 black rhinos left in the world, each one is so precious that conservationists, such as those at Lewa wildlife conservancy, have to work hard to ensure their survival. Since the conservancy\u2019s founding in 1983, Lewa\u2019s rhino population has grown from 15 to 169. Yet if poaching continues at its current level, rhinos and elephants will be functionally extinct in our lifetimes.</p> <p>We often forget, however, that the best protectors of landscapes are local communities \u2013 who often live on the frontlines of poaching wars. These Samburu warriors had never seen a rhino before; some had never even seen a photo of one. They had visited Lewa to learn about conservation.</p> <p>Without rhinos, elephants and other wildlife we suffer more than loss of ecosystem health. We suffer a loss of imagination, a loss of wonder, a loss of beautiful possibilities. When we see ourselves as part of nature, we understand that saving nature is really about saving ourselves. <em>As told to Imogen Tilden</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eb0f8efe8607941bdc03c06f36d129c1d21f1b2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb0f8efe8607941bdc03c06f36d129c1d21f1b2a/0_0_5100_3400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sandy Ramos (on left, looking up) visits her brother\u2019s grave in Rowland Heights, 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandy Ramos (on left, looking up) visits her brother\u2019s grave in Rowland Heights, 2017</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Kashinsky/Panos Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ivan Kashinsky</h2> <p>Sandy is 22 and lives in the heart of gang territory in East Los Angeles. There\u2019s a bullet hole in her front window, and there are helicopters so often overhead they call them ghetto birds. At the time of this photo, October 2017, her brother Edgar was in jail, and her other brother, Marco, had been killed in gang violence the previous year.</p> <p>Kids are introduced to a gang lifestyle from a very young age, but Sandy refused to be sucked in by the cycle of drugs and violence. She graduated from high school and at the time was studying in college alongside volunteering at a local boxing club and helping to raise Edgar\u2019s kids. She\u2019s a miracle! Such a positive force, a symbol of hope.</p> <p>She and her family visit Marco\u2019s grave every Sunday; that\u2019s her mum and her niece also in the picture.

I was in Lesbos, the Greek island that marks the end of many refugees\u2019 journeys to Europe. But it also marks the beginning of a whole new journey and set of difficulties.</p> <p>The boats usually arrived under the cover of darkness. During the days you could see them slowly approaching, and we would track their progress and try to calculate where they would come in.</p> <p>The minute the boats landed, most passengers would set off up the beach towards the reception centre, but some would pause briefly to unpack their cellphones or dry off a little, and that would give me a chance to talk to them. These men had started this leg of their voyage in Turkey, but they were mostly from Afghanistan originally.</p> <p>I have covered refugee crises all over the world for the past decade and I continue to be struck by the desperation that drives people to leave everything they own and set out into the unknown on extremely dangerous journeys. When crowded and barely seaworthy boats actually make it to Europe, like this one had, you see such joy and hope on their faces.</p> <p>For one brief moment, these young men knew that they had taken charge of their lives and they felt empowered, and hopeful that they had a future. <em>As told to Imogen Tilden</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"db24e5642c6fad39b6fb7c47c467ec8978434d54\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db24e5642c6fad39b6fb7c47c467ec8978434d54/0_0_3776_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fatema shows off her new dress, from Still She Smiles, 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fatema shows off her new dress, from Still She Smiles, 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shahidul Alam/Majority World</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Shahidul Alam</h2> <p>I was doing a story on HIV and Aids in Bangladesh when I met Hazera Beagum. This was 1996, when she was a sex worker. We became friends. Later, around 2008, I found out that she had set up this orphanage on the edge of Dhaka for children like her.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very special place. She doesn\u2019t take a salary. I asked how she survives and she said: \u201cWe share the food that we have and there is a roof over our heads. Thirty-five kids call me mum \u2026 what more can I ask for?\u201d</p> <p>I spent one night with them. The kids were all singing and dancing. I was sitting down talking to one of the other kids when I saw this girl doing the twirl \u2026 I didn\u2019t have the time to get my camera, but luckily I had a little Panasonic with me so I was able to record the moment.</p> <p>Hazera is a very loving mother, but she\u2019s also strict \u2013 she makes sure the kids do their homework, pray and clean up. They all adore her. And they have ambition \u2013 the girl in the photo wants to be a model when she grows up.</p> <p>Hazera has had a very, very difficult life \u2013 she was abused, gang-raped and forced into pickpocketing and later, prostitution. But rather than be bitter about it, she has turned her life around to create dreams for other people. <em>As told to Tim Jonze</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ddf1e689e88083d6ef134591a04aa9be851e609\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ddf1e689e88083d6ef134591a04aa9be851e609/0_0_1280_853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young girl in a refugee camp in Cameroon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Urban refugees \u2013 stories at the margin of existence, 2018: a young girl in a refugee camp in Cameroon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominique Catton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Dominique Catton</h2> <p>The picture was taken in Yaound\u00e9, the political capital of Cameroon. Cameroon shelters around 400,000 refugees, the vast majority from Nigeria and the Central African Republic.</p> <p>I spent six months last year following two families who had fled from war in CAR more than a decade ago. They had chosen to live in the city in the hope that they would have a better chance of making a new life, but the reality is that refugees often find themselves exploited, vulnerable and paid far less than the legal wage. Merveille is eight and she\u2019s throwing a ball in her family\u2019s tiny backyard where she and her brothers play and where the family wash clothes, cook, and throw their garbage.</p> <p>Her father had an accident at work and because he was unable to afford medical care he is now disabled and can only sit at home on the couch. Her mother works for less than $1 a day in a restaurant. I asked Merveille about her dreams. She told me she dreamed her mum would stop worrying, and that her father could go out of the house.</p> <p>She wants to become a school teacher. During the months I spent with the family, no matter how difficult things were, the children were always playing and laughing. As long as kids can be kids there\u2019s hope. These children are our future and we must trust in them and give them the opportunities they deserve.</p> <p>This picture wants to show that there are hopes, dreams and poetry under the corrugated iron. <em>As told to Imogen Tilden</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3048d8585ab01f80508a173b907121b4c7002c47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3048d8585ab01f80508a173b907121b4c7002c47/0_0_3600_2698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esme swims in a balcony pool at the Parkroyal on Pickering in Singapore, 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Esme swims in a balcony pool at the Park Royal on Pickering in Singapore, 2014</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Foglia/Courtesy of Michael Hoppen Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lucas Foglia</h2> <p>Singapore is an island city-state with a 100% urban population. There are hardly any wild green spaces left, but they\u2019re trying to reintegrate them into the city. The Singapore Green Plan promotes conservation of the nation\u2019s natural resources and the use of green technology to conserve the environment. The Park Royal on Pickering contains more than 15,000 sq metres of greenery, amounting to twice its land area.</p> <p>I was staying at the hotel and asked if I could photograph the balcony gardens. I went up to the roof for a more complete view: to get this shot I had to lean out over the edge, holding a fire escape ladder. The morning rush hour was just beginning and the traffic was starting to build. Below me, a swimmer was doing laps in the balcony pool, and there was one exact moment when she was positioned in the middle so I could see the whole form of her body, and the colours of cars on the street and that of the plants matched up perfectly.</p> <p>Green spaces improve both air quality and happiness. Plants absorb heat and make buildings cooler. Flooding risks during heavy rains are lowered, because soil absorbs water. They also allow other species to reside or migrate safely. Most countries have not yet made the reforms needed to curb climate change. But there are examples of green buildings all across the world, and schemes such as Singapore\u2019s can make a difference. Hope is the fuel we need to fix the world. <em>As told to Imogen Tilden</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd653dc1c6476671f6c30d60f27e657bb8ebfa95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd653dc1c6476671f6c30d60f27e657bb8ebfa95/0_0_4587_3514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie, Wicklow Mountains 2017\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie, Wicklow Mountains 2017</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Olivia Harris</h2> <p>I\u2019d been in Ireland shooting a series on the Repeal the Eighth campaign [on abortion rights] and I decided to look out for other ways in which women\u2019s lives were restricted. I met Katie when I went to photograph her family on their farm in the Wicklow Mountains. She was one of six kids from a classically Irish family full of national pride. I remember she was very enthusiastic about being an altar server at a local church. She said that she wanted to be a priest when she was older, but that she\u2019d never seen a woman giving mass on telly. I didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell her that she couldn\u2019t be a priest.</p> <p>We went out to a field near her house full of buttercups. She was almost totally unaware of the fact she was being photographed, not self-conscious at all. That\u2019s what\u2019s hopeful to me about the image. I felt confident she would find other ways to achieve her life goals, even if the Catholic church won\u2019t have her. <em>As told to Tim Jonze</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ee50b7111cd7ae38a061626ae0d9be53d2f59b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ee50b7111cd7ae38a061626ae0d9be53d2f59b8/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young couples at a theme park on the banks of the Tigris in Mosul, Iraq, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young couples at a theme park on the banks of the Tigris in Mosul, Iraq, 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivor Prickett/ Panos Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ivor Prickett</h2> <p>I spent time in Mosul in early 2018, six months after the battle to retake it from Islamic State. The theme park on the banks of the river Tigris had been completely destroyed by heavy fighting.

      "bodyText": "Hanna Franz\u00e9n I had been photographing a press conference at the Swedish parliament in November last year. The wind was cold as I came out and there were dark clouds in the sky, but despite this a dozen people, adults and children, had gathered to demonstrate outside, Greta Thunberg among them. We talked a little about what she thought about the future, I took some pictures, and walked away. When I looked back at her a few seconds later, she was being interviewed by another journalist. I remember thinking, \u201cThis is the beginning of something big.\u201d Greta\u2019s message is extremely important. She wants to take care of the Earth and the resources that are left to us. I am very proud of my own efforts in spreading her message \u2013 my picture has been in an exhibition in Canada, on a book cover, made into postcards, stickers and published all over the world. Girl power. As told to Imogen Tilden Ami Vitale With only about 5,500 black rhinos left in the world, each one is so precious that conservationists, such as those at Lewa wildlife conservancy, have to work hard to ensure their survival. Since the conservancy\u2019s founding in 1983, Lewa\u2019s rhino population has grown from 15 to 169. Yet if poaching continues at its current level, rhinos and elephants will be functionally extinct in our lifetimes. We often forget, however, that the best protectors of landscapes are local communities \u2013 who often live on the frontlines of poaching wars. These Samburu warriors had never seen a rhino before; some had never even seen a photo of one. They had visited Lewa to learn about conservation. Without rhinos, elephants and other wildlife we suffer more than loss of ecosystem health. We suffer a loss of imagination, a loss of wonder, a loss of beautiful possibilities. When we see ourselves as part of nature, we understand that saving nature is really about saving ourselves. As told to Imogen Tilden Ivan Kashinsky Sandy is 22 and lives in the heart of gang territory in East Los Angeles. There\u2019s a bullet hole in her front window, and there are helicopters so often overhead they call them ghetto birds. At the time of this photo, October 2017, her brother Edgar was in jail, and her other brother, Marco, had been killed in gang violence the previous year. Kids are introduced to a gang lifestyle from a very young age, but Sandy refused to be sucked in by the cycle of drugs and violence. She graduated from high school and at the time was studying in college alongside volunteering at a local boxing club and helping to raise Edgar\u2019s kids. She\u2019s a miracle! Such a positive force, a symbol of hope. She and her family visit Marco\u2019s grave every Sunday; that\u2019s her mum and her niece also in the picture. The whole family hang out there for an hour or two each week, they picnic, the kids play and they remember the good times they had with Marco. As told to Imogen Tilden Moises Saman It was early morning, maybe 6am. I was in Lesbos, the Greek island that marks the end of many refugees\u2019 journeys to Europe. But it also marks the beginning of a whole new journey and set of difficulties. The boats usually arrived under the cover of darkness. During the days you could see them slowly approaching, and we would track their progress and try to calculate where they would come in. The minute the boats landed, most passengers would set off up the beach towards the reception centre, but some would pause briefly to unpack their cellphones or dry off a little, and that would give me a chance to talk to them. These men had started this leg of their voyage in Turkey, but they were mostly from Afghanistan originally. I have covered refugee crises all over the world for the past decade and I continue to be struck by the desperation that drives people to leave everything they own and set out into the unknown on extremely dangerous journeys. When crowded and barely seaworthy boats actually make it to Europe, like this one had, you see such joy and hope on their faces. For one brief moment, these young men knew that they had taken charge of their lives and they felt empowered, and hopeful that they had a future. As told to Imogen Tilden Shahidul Alam I was doing a story on HIV and Aids in Bangladesh when I met Hazera Beagum. This was 1996, when she was a sex worker. We became friends. Later, around 2008, I found out that she had set up this orphanage on the edge of Dhaka for children like her. It\u2019s a very special place. She doesn\u2019t take a salary. I asked how she survives and she said: \u201cWe share the food that we have and there is a roof over our heads. Thirty-five kids call me mum \u2026 what more can I ask for?\u201d I spent one night with them. The kids were all singing and dancing. I was sitting down talking to one of the other kids when I saw this girl doing the twirl \u2026 I didn\u2019t have the time to get my camera, but luckily I had a little Panasonic with me so I was able to record the moment. Hazera is a very loving mother, but she\u2019s also strict \u2013 she makes sure the kids do their homework, pray and clean up. They all adore her. And they have ambition \u2013 the girl in the photo wants to be a model when she grows up. Hazera has had a very, very difficult life \u2013 she was abused, gang-raped and forced into pickpocketing and later, prostitution. But rather than be bitter about it, she has turned her life around to create dreams for other people. As told to Tim Jonze Dominique Catton The picture was taken in Yaound\u00e9, the political capital of Cameroon. Cameroon shelters around 400,000 refugees, the vast majority from Nigeria and the Central African Republic. I spent six months last year following two families who had fled from war in CAR more than a decade ago. They had chosen to live in the city in the hope that they would have a better chance of making a new life, but the reality is that refugees often find themselves exploited, vulnerable and paid far less than the legal wage. Merveille is eight and she\u2019s throwing a ball in her family\u2019s tiny backyard where she and her brothers play and where the family wash clothes, cook, and throw their garbage. Her father had an accident at work and because he was unable to afford medical care he is now disabled and can only sit at home on the couch. Her mother works for less than $1 a day in a restaurant. I asked Merveille about her dreams. She told me she dreamed her mum would stop worrying, and that her father could go out of the house. She wants to become a school teacher. During the months I spent with the family, no matter how difficult things were, the children were always playing and laughing. As long as kids can be kids there\u2019s hope. These children are our future and we must trust in them and give them the opportunities they deserve. This picture wants to show that there are hopes, dreams and poetry under the corrugated iron. As told to Imogen Tilden Lucas Foglia Singapore is an island city-state with a 100% urban population. There are hardly any wild green spaces left, but they\u2019re trying to reintegrate them into the city. The Singapore Green Plan promotes conservation of the nation\u2019s natural resources and the use of green technology to conserve the environment. The Park Royal on Pickering contains more than 15,000 sq metres of greenery, amounting to twice its land area. I was staying at the hotel and asked if I could photograph the balcony gardens. I went up to the roof for a more complete view: to get this shot I had to lean out over the edge, holding a fire escape ladder. The morning rush hour was just beginning and the traffic was starting to build. Below me, a swimmer was doing laps in the balcony pool, and there was one exact moment when she was positioned in the middle so I could see the whole form of her body, and the colours of cars on the street and that of the plants matched up perfectly. Green spaces improve both air quality and happiness. Plants absorb heat and make buildings cooler. Flooding risks during heavy rains are lowered, because soil absorbs water. They also allow other species to reside or migrate safely. Most countries have not yet made the reforms needed to curb climate change. But there are examples of green buildings all across the world, and schemes such as Singapore\u2019s can make a difference. Hope is the fuel we need to fix the world. As told to Imogen Tilden Olivia Harris I\u2019d been in Ireland shooting a series on the Repeal the Eighth campaign [on abortion rights] and I decided to look out for other ways in which women\u2019s lives were restricted. I met Katie when I went to photograph her family on their farm in the Wicklow Mountains. She was one of six kids from a classically Irish family full of national pride. I remember she was very enthusiastic about being an altar server at a local church. She said that she wanted to be a priest when she was older, but that she\u2019d never seen a woman giving mass on telly. I didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell her that she couldn\u2019t be a priest. We went out to a field near her house full of buttercups. She was almost totally unaware of the fact she was being photographed, not self-conscious at all. That\u2019s what\u2019s hopeful to me about the image. I felt confident she would find other ways to achieve her life goals, even if the Catholic church won\u2019t have her. As told to Tim Jonze Ivor Prickett I spent time in Mosul in early 2018, six months after the battle to retake it from Islamic State. The theme park on the banks of the river Tigris had been completely destroyed by heavy fighting. But only a matter of months later it was up and running again and families and young couples were visiting. I remember the booming Iraqi pop music blaring out of the loudspeakers on this ride, the Crazy Dance, and finding it very poignant, especially to see women there, smiling, wearing colourful headscarves. Under Isis, women had been largely kept inside, but now they were able to move freely around the city again, attend the university, enjoy leisure time. There\u2019s a risk that when a part of the world is only seen through images of conflict and destruction people can get compassion fatigue. The way the news cycle works makes it difficult to stick around after the guns have fallen silent, but it\u2019s so important to also see the aftermath of these terrible situations and seek out the more hopeful stories about returning to life. You can\u2019t whitewash over what\u2019s happened \u2013 you are in the midst of people looking for or mourning their loved ones, but you need to find balance and show images people can relate to. These stories and pictures can be a form of catharsis for the people you\u2019re portraying and the viewer as well. As told to Imogen Tilden",

It gained momentum in the early 2000s. At the time, the MRC estimated that its four member states \u2013 Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand \u2013 could expect benefits of $30bn (\u00a323bn).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91583cd9472f01b576cfbdd3c15e571554ce3e1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91583cd9472f01b576cfbdd3c15e571554ce3e1c/0_289_3304_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A satellite image of the Mekong Delta in Cambodia, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"786\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mekong Delta in Cambodia, pictured in January 2016.

      "bodyText": "Tbong sits in the shade of a makeshift stilt hut over the edge of Tonl\u00e9 Sap lake, surrounded by curious children. \u201cSnake, catfish, elephant fish \u2026\u201d he says, his eyes crinkled against the sun. \u201cBefore, a long time ago \u2026 the lake had a lot of catfish.\u201d But in just one generation, everything has changed. Fish species are dwindling, plant life is dying and the entire Mekong system is breaking apart. For the children gathered around Tbong, a plentiful Tonl\u00e9 Sap is nothing but a story. Situated in the heart of the lower Mekong basin, Tonl\u00e9 Sap is the largest freshwater lake in south-east Asia. The lake and its surrounding floodplains were designated a Unesco biosphere reserve in 1997 and the lake supports the breeding, feeding and harvesting of hundreds of species of fish and other freshwater produce. But this year the waters have fallen to a record low. \u201cNot only have the water levels across the lower Mekong River never been so low since the creation of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) in 1995, but the water is also unusually blue [due to the loss of suspended sediments],\u201d says Marc Goichot, senior adviser for the WWF\u2019s greater Mekong programme. \u201cBlue may be good for the Caribbean Sea, but for the Mekong it is not natural and bad news, [it\u2019s] a big change in the ecosystem that will have a wide range of impacts including exposing vulnerable aquatic species to predators, weakening riverbanks [and] starving rice fields, mangroves and fish of the rich nutrients they need.\u201d While the climate crisis has exacerbated the problem \u2013 prompting even Jeremy Clarkson, host of the Grand Tour, to acknowledge the effects of the climate crisis for the first time \u2013 scientists have been warning of changes in the Mekong basin for decades. The idea of damming the lower Mekong dates back to the cold war when the US, Soviet Union and China began to look at hydropower as a potential strategy for economic development. It gained momentum in the early 2000s. At the time, the MRC estimated that its four member states \u2013 Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand \u2013 could expect benefits of $30bn (\u00a323bn). But years later, the commission revised its projections, stating that the environmental losses associated with these dams outweighed any potential profit. Despite these warnings, China now operates eight megadams and lower Mekong states are persisting with plans for their own hydropower plants. In Laos and Cambodia alone, more than 140 dams are planned on the main river and its tributaries. In dividing the Mekong River into reservoirs, hydropower dams block the flow of nutrient-rich sediment downstream, changing the shape and depth of the riverbed and riverbanks. Between 1992 and 2014, suspended sediment load in the Mekong basin was more than halved, according to the WWF. As the sediment has become blocked, seawater has begun to intrude farther up the river, threatening its delicate freshwater ecosystem. The river eats into its own riverbanks and riverbed to replace the sediment, exacerbating the problem, and sand dredgers dig out whatever is left. The dams also block the movements of about 160 species of fish in the Mekong basin that rely on long distance migration. \u201c[They] need to travel far upstream (northern Laos) to spawn, and the juveniles need to travel back to the large floodplains of the Mekong delta and Tonl\u00e9 Sap lake to feed,\u201d says Goichot. \u201cAny obstacle to this migration would have a very high chance of leading to their extinction.\u201d Larger species have a longer migration route and so have been hit the hardest. In 2010, populations of the Mekong giant catfish had dropped 90% in the last decade. \u201cThe Siamese flat-barbelled catfish, which was present in the region, was declared extinct in 2013. Of the 692 extant freshwater fish species known to occur in the lower Mekong basin, 68 (10%) are globally threatened with extinction and a further 22 (3%) are near threatened,\u201d the MRC noted in its State of the Basin report in 2018.

They played in the same venues as Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie, were considered some of the most talented musicians of their day and toured France and Germany as a USO act in 1945.</p> <p>Unfortunately, racism and sexism largely swept them from the public record; they became footnotes in other people\u2019s stories. Second-wave feminism brought them back into the conversation, and the Sweethearts were later recognized by the Kansas City Women\u2019s Jazz Festival in 1980, and again by the Smithsonian in 2011.

After a few stints playing with Ada Leonard\u2019s All-American Girl Orchestra, she was recruited to join the Sweethearts. Still a teenager, she joined the band in New Britain, Connecticut, after arguing with a taxi driver who refused to drive her to \u201cthe black side of town\u201d.</p> <p>Even though the band was largely composed of orphaned young women of color from the Piney Woods school outside of Jackson, Mississippi, Cron, a white Jewish teenager with a Boston accent, felt immediate synergy. \u201cI knew I was home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe loved each other.\u201d</p> <p>I asked if it was a leap of faith for her parents to let her leave home for a life on the road. \u201cMy father was the first feminist I knew,\u201d she said, smiling.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>The Sweethearts\u2019 beginnings were remarkable.

The Sweethearts took up residence in a house in Arlington, Virginia, and welcomed several high-profile members: bandleader Anna Mae Winburn, larger-than-life trumpeter Tiny Davis, saxophonist Vi Burnside and Cron, who stayed with the band for three years. \u201cThe money <em>rarely</em> got back to the Sweethearts,\u201d Cron said.</p> <p>Cron lived and performed with the girls in the deep south during the Jim Crow era, a time when it was illegal for women of color to eat, sleep and share the stage with white people. The Sweethearts kept the shades down on their bus when passing through small towns, and Cron was often the only one who could walk into a restaurant and purchase food for the band. She was arrested in South Carolina and Texas for offences such as walking with a black soldier in uniform and claiming mixed-race parentage. Winburn occasionally used her exceptional stage management skills to block a curious policeman\u2019s view of the mixed-race band on stage.</p> <p>The band was invited to join the Third and Seventh Armies abroad in 1945, landing in Le Havre, France, to entertain the troops. The Sweethearts were issued USO uniforms that included caps, slacks and jackets \u2013 and the women would have frozen if it weren\u2019t for the generosity of the black soldiers who offered them wool caps and long johns. They drove through the bombed-out ruins of Europe, performed for three weeks in Paris, showered in latrines when necessary and occasionally stayed in posh army-acquired villas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"75df1813b3eef7e539da9a435eb20d1be7522d3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75df1813b3eef7e539da9a435eb20d1be7522d3f/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Roz at 95.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosalind Cron at 95.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Meyhew Bergman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tiny Davis even smuggled a dog from Paris to New York. \u201cShe did what she wanted,\u201d Cron said, a gleam in her eye.</p> <p> Cron remembered one particular party with GIs. \u201cI walked in and there were all these white balloons,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one told me they were prophylactics!

      "bodyText": "Rosalind Cron is a vibrant 95-year-old in red lipstick. She stands 4ft 8in tall, and is the keeper of a beautiful, under-told story about America\u2019s first racially integrated, all-girl swing band, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. She is one of two surviving Sweethearts in their 90s, and a lucid, bright storyteller. She greeted me on an early December afternoon in her assisted living facility outside of Los Angeles, where she had made room for a piano and memorabilia. The International Sweethearts broke attendance records at places such as Washington DC\u2019s Howard Theatre, Harlem\u2019s Apollo Theater, Cincinnati\u2019s Cotton Club and the Riviera in St Louis. They played in the same venues as Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie, were considered some of the most talented musicians of their day and toured France and Germany as a USO act in 1945. Unfortunately, racism and sexism largely swept them from the public record; they became footnotes in other people\u2019s stories. Second-wave feminism brought them back into the conversation, and the Sweethearts were later recognized by the Kansas City Women\u2019s Jazz Festival in 1980, and again by the Smithsonian in 2011. However, few videos and recordings survive from the Sweethearts\u2019 time together. A short film (That Man of Mine, with Ruby Dee), two numbers for Leonard Feather and a few pieces for Guild Records remain. I asked Cron why the Sweethearts weren\u2019t better known. \u201cWe were very well known in the black press,\u201d she clarified. \u201cIt was the white press that ignored us. And women were under-recorded in the 40s, especially black women.\u201d Cron, an alto saxophonist, flautist and clarinetist, began playing music at age nine in Newton, Massachusetts, after listening to big band music on her family\u2019s Atwater Kent radio. After a few stints playing with Ada Leonard\u2019s All-American Girl Orchestra, she was recruited to join the Sweethearts. Still a teenager, she joined the band in New Britain, Connecticut, after arguing with a taxi driver who refused to drive her to \u201cthe black side of town\u201d. Even though the band was largely composed of orphaned young women of color from the Piney Woods school outside of Jackson, Mississippi, Cron, a white Jewish teenager with a Boston accent, felt immediate synergy. \u201cI knew I was home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe loved each other.\u201d I asked if it was a leap of faith for her parents to let her leave home for a life on the road. \u201cMy father was the first feminist I knew,\u201d she said, smiling. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The Sweethearts\u2019 beginnings were remarkable. Cron emphasized how close the girls were, many having been brought up together as orphans and sisters at the Piney Woods school. \u201cThey were loyal to each other,\u201d she told me. \u201cDeeply loyal.\u201d Many original Sweethearts were taught how to play their instruments by Consuela Carter and sent out on the road to earn money for Piney Woods, which was the brainchild of education pioneer Dr Laurence Clifton Jones (also the adoptive father of trombonist Helen Jones, who began playing with the band at age 11).

Exhausted, and convinced they were being exploited, the Sweethearts escaped the grip of the school on the very bus Piney Woods students had built by hand for them.

Two businessmen, Al Dade and Dan Gary, partnered with the band\u2019s manager, Rae Lee Jones, to reboot the band. The Sweethearts took up residence in a house in Arlington, Virginia, and welcomed several high-profile members: bandleader Anna Mae Winburn, larger-than-life trumpeter Tiny Davis, saxophonist Vi Burnside and Cron, who stayed with the band for three years. \u201cThe money rarely got back to the Sweethearts,\u201d Cron said.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Full House impeachment vote expected on Wednesday Democrats spent the weekend venting their frustration as the GOP closes ranks over Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment, with Adam Schiff \u2013 chairman of the House intelligence committee \u2013 asking aloud why Republicans were \u201cplacing this president above their oath of office\u201d. Trump\u2019s allies are waging a fact-free counter-offensive as the House prepares for its impeachment vote on Wednesday, expected to pass by simple majority. But Senate Republicans have already said the president\u2019s trial will end with a swift acquittal. Switching parties. Jeff Van Drew, a Democratic congressman from New Jersey who opposes impeachment, reportedly saw several of his staffers quit in protest this weekend over his decision to switch parties and join the Republicans. James Comey. Trump has suggested \u201cyears in jail\u201d for James Comey, after the former FBI director took responsibility for \u201creal sloppiness\u201d in the bureau\u2019s handling of the surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser. Greta Thunberg in Twitter pic spat with German rail firm Greta Thunberg has been drawn into an online back-and-forth with German rail firm Deutsche Bahn after the environmental campaigner tweeted an image of herself sitting on the floor of an \u201covercrowded\u201d train, surrounded by her bags, as she returned home to Sweden following the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid. The train company then chided her for not mentioning \u201chow friendly and competently\u201d she had been \u201clooked after\u201d at her seat in first class. \u2018No problem\u2019. Thunberg responded that she had only been able to take a seat four hours into her journey, but that she was in fact pleased to see the trains overcrowded, \u201cbecause it means the demand for train travel is high!\u201d Weinstein: my \u2018pioneering\u2019 promotion of women is \u2018forgotten\u2019 Harvey Weinstein has complained that his \u201cpioneering\u201d work as a champion of women filmmakers has been \u201ceviscerated\u201d and \u201cforgotten\u201d amid the dozens of sexual assault accusations being made against the disgraced movie producer. In an interview with the New York Post before his forthcoming rape trial, Weinstein claimed: \u201cI made more movies directed by women and about women than any film-maker, and I\u2019m talking about 30 years ago. I\u2019m not talking about now when it\u2019s vogue. I did it first. I pioneered it.\u201d Civil settlement. Weinstein last week reached a $25m deal to settle almost all the civil suits against him before his criminal trial. The agreement still requires court approval, which is unlikely to come until the spring. Goldman Sachs to cease financing Arctic oil exploration The US investment bank Goldman Sachs has said it will no longer finance fresh oil drilling or exploration in the Arctic, and will cease to invest in new thermal coal mines anywhere in the world. Goldman\u2019s statement, in which the bank also \u201cacknowledged\u201d the scientific consensus on the climate crisis, has been welcomed by environmentalists, who urged other financial institutions to make similar pledges that could render the coal industry \u201cunbankable\u201d. Biomass risks. Campaigners have warned that plans to convert 10 of Europe\u2019s largest coal plants to burn wood pellets could accelerate climate change rather than slowing it as intended, by laying waste to the continent\u2019s remaining forests. Cheat sheet Six people have died in north-east India during violent protests over a controversial new law allowing the government to grant citizenship to millions of recent migrants from three neighbouring countries \u2013 but only to those who are not Muslim. An investigation into whether anyone was at fault for the deaths of at least 16 people in last week\u2019s volcanic eruption on New Zealand\u2019s White Island could take up to a year, the country\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said. The US special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, has dismissed Pyongyang\u2019s end-of-year-deadline for concessions in the two countries\u2019 nuclear talks, calling it \u201chostile and negative and so unnecessary\u201d. Boeing is considering whether to temporarily halt production of its grounded 737 Max aircraft after the Federal Aviation Administration said it would not approve the plane\u2019s return to service before 2020. Must-reads Poetry, stage and screen: the nine lives of Cats When TS Eliot published Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats in 1939, it outsold his masterpiece The Waste Land.

Poet, novelist and playwright, Dunbar was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1872, to ex-slaves freed after the civil war. His mother struggled hard to finance his early years at school, and, the only African American in his high school, Dunbar was an outstanding student.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f021dc27c0fb9ffa6b3ef9414ba89eac59b15b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f021dc27c0fb9ffa6b3ef9414ba89eac59b15b8/403_238_3348_4185/800.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Laurence Dunbar.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Laurence Dunbar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Barboza/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though subsequently his routes to higher education and solid employment were obstructed by poverty and prejudice, Dunbar found early fame as a poet, and an enthusiastic readership.

      "bodyText": "The Corn-Stalk Fiddle When the corn\u2019s all cut and the bright stalks shine Like the burnished spears of a field of gold; When the field-mice rich on the nubbins dine, And the frost comes white and the wind blows cold; Then its heigho fellows and hi-diddle-diddle, For the time is ripe for the corn-stalk fiddle. And you take a stalk that is straight and long, With an expert eye to its worthy points, And you think of the bubbling strains of song That are bound between its pithy joints \u2013 Then you cut out strings, with a bridge in the middle, With a corn-stalk bow for a corn-stalk fiddle. Then the strains that grow as you draw the bow O\u2019er the yielding strings with a practiced hand! And the music\u2019s flow never loud but low Is the concert note of a fairy band. Oh, your dainty songs are a misty riddle To the simple sweets of the corn-stalk fiddle. When the eve comes on and our work is done And the sun drops down with a tender glance, With their hearts all prime for the harmless fun, Come the neighbor girls for the evening\u2019s dance, And they wait for the well-known twist and twiddle, More time than tune \u2013 from the corn-stalk fiddle. Then brother Jabez takes the bow, While Ned stands off with Susan Bland, Then Henry stops by Milly Snow And John takes Nellie Jones\u2019s hand, While I pair off with Mandy Biddle, And scrape, scrape, scrape goes the corn-stalk fiddle. \u201cSalute your partners,\u201d comes the call, \u201cAll join hands and circle round,\u201d \u201cGrand train back,\u201d and \u201cBalance all,\u201d Footsteps lightly spurn the ground, \u201cTake your lady and balance down the middle\u201d To the merry strains of the corn-stalk fiddle. So the night goes on and the dance is o\u2019er, And the merry girls are homeward gone, But I see it all in my sleep once more, And I dream till the very break of dawn Of an impish dance on a red-hot griddle To the screech and scrape of a corn-stalk fiddle. This week we revisit the work of one of the great black American writers, Paul Laurence Dunbar. Poet, novelist and playwright, Dunbar was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1872, to ex-slaves freed after the civil war. His mother struggled hard to finance his early years at school, and, the only African American in his high school, Dunbar was an outstanding student. Though subsequently his routes to higher education and solid employment were obstructed by poverty and prejudice, Dunbar found early fame as a poet, and an enthusiastic readership. But the success had a bitter edge for him, and he complained to his friend, James Weldon Johnson: \u201cI\u2019ve got to write dialect poetry, It is the only way I can get them to listen to me.\u201d Dunbar thought his poetry fell into two categories \u2013 the \u201cmajor\u201d poetry in standard English, underestimated by his readers, and the \u201cminor\u201d dialect poems. His frustration is understandable, but that labelling shouldn\u2019t distract contemporary readers from the quality and importance of his dialect writing. Dunbar is a pioneer in this respect. If we were to trace the story of dialect in anglophone literature from his period to the present day, we\u2019d see how vital a part it has played in revitalising and energising the language of poetry. The use of the vernacular has helped shape many of our current criteria for strong, memorable writing. As well as the poetic writer and the dialect speaker, there is a third voice in Dunbar, in which the \u201cplantation idiom\u201d, as early commentators called it, is ploughed back into verse written primarily in standard English. The Corn-Stalk Fiddle is a terrific example. The idiom is rich and varied. It\u2019s not only that of the celebrating field hands. Dunbar uses the language of the dance call with great effect in his penultimate stanza. Throughout, the vernacular and poetic pair up and give energy and succinctness to this brilliantly realised square dance of a poem. Especially effective is the vividly detailed account of the building of the corn-stalk fiddle. I wasn\u2019t aware such fiddles existed, and, at a first reading, I wondered if that was an underlying message of the poem: for the celebrants, there was access to joy only through fantasy.

      "body": "<p>Lanisha Bratcher was finishing breakfast at home one morning at the end of July when there was a knock on her door. She had been discharged from the hospital the night before following a miscarriage that left her mourning the loss of her child.</p> <p>Her partner opened the door \u2013 it was the police. They burst into their North Carolina home \u201clike the Dukes of Hazzard\u201d, Bratcher said. There was a warrant out for her arrest, they told her. Bratcher had no idea what for.</p> <p>Her crime? Voting in the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>Bratcher faces up to 19 months in prison because she did not realize she had actually been stripped of the right to vote. Her lawyer says she\u2019s being punished based on a Jim Crow-era law that was intended to disenfranchise African Americans.</p> <p>Bratcher was on probation after being convicted of assault and North Carolina law mandates that people convicted of felonies can only vote once they complete their criminal sentences, including probation and parole, entirely.</p> <p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aZlP2BFb7kg-Q0mfMZQlRtNb_EWXFW3N/view?usp=sharing\">Documents obtained</a> by the Guardian show that a prosecutor brought charges against Bratcher even though state officials said she may have illegally voted unintentionally. The decision also came after <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/Post-Election%20Audit%20Report_2016%20General%20Election/Post-Election_Audit_Report.pdf\">a report</a> in which state officials recognized there were serious problems in the system in place to inform convicted felons of their voting rights.</p> <p>The state\u2019s policy of banning people convicted of felonies from voting is rooted in a late 19th century effort by North Carolina Democrats to limit voting power of newly-enfranchised African Americans as whole. In 1898, the North Carolina Democratic <a href=\"https://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/dem1898/dem1898.html\">party spoke of the need</a> \u201cto rescue the white people of the east from the curse of negro domination\u201d.</p> <p>Since then, North Carolina lawmakers have tweaked the law, but its core \u2013 stripping felons of their voting rights while they serve criminal sentences \u2013 remains in place.</p> <p>John Carella, Bratcher\u2019s lawyer, noted the vast majority of the people caught up in the law are African American. \u201cA law that is intended to racially discriminate against a group is unconstitutional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also know it continues to work that way in its modern application to the 2016 election.\u201d</p> <p>Carella argues that the goal is to dissuade black voters from going to the polls. That could make a big difference in North Carolina, a fiercely politically competitive state expected to play a key role in the 2020 election.</p> <p>In Bratcher\u2019s case, it seems to have worked. She\u2019s not sure if she\u2019ll ever vote again, even once she\u2019s legally allowed to.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems really dangerous,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>\u2018Strict liability\u2019</h2> <p>Bratcher grew up in Hoke county, where she readily acknowledges she had a rocky past, sometimes getting in trouble with law enforcement. In 2013, she and her sister got into a fight with some other people and Bratcher was charged with assault with a deadly weapon.</p> <p>She had since been working hard to turn a page \u2013 moving to Wake county with her husband and two daughters and trying to get a promotion at work.</p> <p>During the March 2016 primary, Bratcher registered to vote, according to election records.

      "bodyText": "Lanisha Bratcher was finishing breakfast at home one morning at the end of July when there was a knock on her door. She had been discharged from the hospital the night before following a miscarriage that left her mourning the loss of her child. Her partner opened the door \u2013 it was the police. They burst into their North Carolina home \u201clike the Dukes of Hazzard\u201d, Bratcher said. There was a warrant out for her arrest, they told her. Bratcher had no idea what for. Her crime? Voting in the 2016 presidential election. Bratcher faces up to 19 months in prison because she did not realize she had actually been stripped of the right to vote. Her lawyer says she\u2019s being punished based on a Jim Crow-era law that was intended to disenfranchise African Americans. Bratcher was on probation after being convicted of assault and North Carolina law mandates that people convicted of felonies can only vote once they complete their criminal sentences, including probation and parole, entirely. Documents obtained by the Guardian show that a prosecutor brought charges against Bratcher even though state officials said she may have illegally voted unintentionally. The decision also came after a report in which state officials recognized there were serious problems in the system in place to inform convicted felons of their voting rights. The state\u2019s policy of banning people convicted of felonies from voting is rooted in a late 19th century effort by North Carolina Democrats to limit voting power of newly-enfranchised African Americans as whole. In 1898, the North Carolina Democratic party spoke of the need \u201cto rescue the white people of the east from the curse of negro domination\u201d. Since then, North Carolina lawmakers have tweaked the law, but its core \u2013 stripping felons of their voting rights while they serve criminal sentences \u2013 remains in place. John Carella, Bratcher\u2019s lawyer, noted the vast majority of the people caught up in the law are African American. \u201cA law that is intended to racially discriminate against a group is unconstitutional,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also know it continues to work that way in its modern application to the 2016 election.\u201d Carella argues that the goal is to dissuade black voters from going to the polls. That could make a big difference in North Carolina, a fiercely politically competitive state expected to play a key role in the 2020 election. In Bratcher\u2019s case, it seems to have worked. She\u2019s not sure if she\u2019ll ever vote again, even once she\u2019s legally allowed to. \u201cIt seems really dangerous,\u201d she said. \u2018Strict liability\u2019 Bratcher grew up in Hoke county, where she readily acknowledges she had a rocky past, sometimes getting in trouble with law enforcement. In 2013, she and her sister got into a fight with some other people and Bratcher was charged with assault with a deadly weapon. She had since been working hard to turn a page \u2013 moving to Wake county with her husband and two daughters and trying to get a promotion at work. During the March 2016 primary, Bratcher registered to vote, according to election records. She said that at that time, nobody had told her she couldn\u2019t vote. Later that year, her church had an event where they hosted a dinner and took people to the polls. So Bratcher went with her mother to vote during the early voting period before election day. \u201cI had no intention to trick anybody or be malicious or any kind of way,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you expect us to know that we should know we should not do something, then we should not be on the list or even allowed to do it.\u201d Americans lose the right to vote if they are convicted of a felony in 48 of the 50 states. But each of those states has widely different policies on when and if felons can vote again. If someone votes while they are serving a criminal sentence, it is a so-called \u201cstrict liability\u201d felony in North Carolina. That means that prosecutors don\u2019t have to prove Bratcher and other people convicted of felonies intended to vote illegally in order to convict them. This statute was designed after the civil war as a reaction to growing African American political power in the state, said Gary Freeze, a history and American studies professor at Catawba College in North Carolina. \u201cWhite supremacists did not want [another] reform effort \u2013 hence the severe penalty for those who could be proven to be voting with a criminal background,\u201d he wrote in an email. When lawmakers passed the felon-voting law, they were open about their racial intent. The 1898 Democratic handbook in the state talked about voting restrictions necessary \u201cto protect the white voters of the State against having their honest votes off-set by illegally and fraudulently registered negro votes\u201d.

It is, first, as far as possible, under the fifteenth amendment, to disfranchise him; after that, let him alone; quit writing about him; quit talking about him,\u201d he said. Carella argues the discriminatory law is still at work \u2013 of 441 people investigated for possibly voting with a felony in the 2016 election, 68% were black. That high number exceeds both the percentage of African Americans registered to vote and the proportion on probation and parole. At the end of 2016, African Americans made up about 46% of convicted felons on parole or probation in the state. They made up about 22% of all registered voters.

Bratcher is among four people with felonies in her county \u2013 all of whom are black \u2013 who have been indicted for illegally voting in 2016. Kristy Newton, the district attorney in Hoke county, declined to comment on the case because it was still pending. Life upended Bratcher\u2019s case isn\u2019t the first time a voter fraud case like this has come under scrutiny in North Carolina. In 2018, 12 people with felony convictions in the state were prosecuted for illegal voting. The decision to prosecute the group \u2013 which came to be known as the Alamance 12 \u2013 drew national outrage because they also said they didn\u2019t know they were ineligible.

But after she was arrested, the Hoke county sheriff\u2019s office announced the voter fraud charges on Facebook and mugshots of Bratcher and her co-defendants appeared in the local news. Family and friends and people from her church began calling her asking what she had done. \u201cI was at a better place in my life. I had a different mindset. I don\u2019t have any barriers, I don\u2019t have any borders, I don\u2019t have any walls up.

They didn\u2019t have commercial success, but they were admired by their peers: according to the liner notes of a reissued version of the Flamin\u2019 Groovies 1971 album Teenage Head, Mick Jagger thought of it as a better version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 Sticky Fingers; the Loney-penned song Headin\u2019 for the Texas Border has been covered by Jack White\u2019s band the Raconteurs. Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band was among those paying tribute to Loney, writing on Twitter: \u201cHe will live forever in the Underground Garage.\u201d Loney left the band in 1971. He went on to record solo material while the Flamin\u2019 Groovies continued with Chris Wilson as frontman, recording power-pop hits such as Shake Some Action. Loney reunited with the group after they released their 2017 album Fantastic Plastic, performing at live shows, including playing Teenage Head in full. He had been due to tour Europe with them earlier in 2019, but was injured in a fall and forced to cancel.",

      "bodyText": "A landmark legal case has been launched against the world\u2019s largest tech companies by Congolese families who say their children were killed or maimed while mining for cobalt used to power smartphones, laptops and electric cars, the Guardian can reveal. Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft and Tesla have been named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in Washington DC by human rights firm International Rights Advocates on behalf of 14 parents and children from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The lawsuit, which is the result of field research conducted by anti-slavery economist Siddharth Kara, accuses the companies of aiding and abetting in the death and serious injury of children who they claim were working in cobalt mines in their supply chain. The families and injured children are seeking damages for forced labour and further compensation for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It is the first time that any of the tech companies have faced such a legal challenge. Cobalt is essential to power the rechargeable lithium batteries used in millions of products sold by Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft and Tesla every year. The insatiable demand for cobalt, driven by desire for cheap handheld technology, has tripled in the past five years and is expected to double again by the end of 2020. More than 60% of cobalt originates in DRC, one of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world. The extraction of cobalt from DRC has been linked to human rights abuses, corruption, environmental destruction and child labour. The lawsuit argues that Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft and Tesla all aided and abetted the mining companies that profited from the labour of children who were forced to work in dangerous conditions \u2013 conditions that ultimately led to death and serious injury. The families argue in the claim that their children were working illegally at mines owned by UK mining company Glencore. The court papers allege that cobalt from the Glencore-owned mines is sold to Umicore, a Brussels-based metal and mining trader, which then sells battery-grade cobalt to Apple, Google, Tesla, Microsoft and Dell. Other plaintiffs in the court documents say they worked at mines owned by Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, a major Chinese cobalt firm, which the lawsuit claims supplies Apple, Dell, and Microsoft and is likely to supply the other defendants. In the court documents, the Congolese families describe how their children were driven by extreme poverty to seek work in large mining sites, where they claim they were paid as little as $2 (\u00a31.50) a day for backbreaking and dangerous work digging for cobalt rocks with primitive tools in dark, underground tunnels. The families claim that some of the children were killed in tunnel collapses while others were paralysed or suffered life-changing injuries from accidents. One plaintiff \u2013 named Jane Doe 1 \u2013 says in the court papers that her nephew was forced to seek work in the cobalt mines when he was a small child after the family could not continue to pay his $6 monthly school fee. The lawsuit claims that in April last year he was working in a mine operated by Kamoto Copper Company, which is owned and controlled by Glencore. He was working underground in a tunnel, digging for cobalt rocks, when the tunnel collapsed and he was buried alive. His family say they have never recovered his body. Another child, referred to as John Doe 1, says that he started working in the mines when he was nine. The lawsuit claims that earlier this year, he was working as a human mule for Kamoto Copper Company, carrying bags of cobalt rocks for $0.75 a day, when he fell into a tunnel. After he was dragged out of the tunnel by fellow workers, he says he was left alone on the ground at the mining site until his parents heard about the accident and arrived to help him. He is now paralysed from the chest down and will never walk again. Other families included in the claim say that their children were killed in tunnel collapses or suffered serious injuries such as smashed limbs and broken spines while crawling through tunnels or carrying heavy loads. The families say that none were paid any compensation for the deaths and injuries. One of the central allegations in the lawsuit is that Apple, Google, Dell, Microsoft and Tesla were aware and had \u201cspecific knowledge\u201d that the cobalt they use in their products is linked to child labour performed in hazardous conditions, and were complicit in the forced labour of the children. The families argue in the court papers that all companies named as defendants entered into commercial \u201cventures\u201d with the mining companies operating in DRC, and all gained significant financial advantages from the widespread illegal mining of cobalt by children, which continues to enter global supply chains. The court papers claim that Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Google and Tesla all have the authority and resources to supervise and regulate their cobalt supply chains and that their inability to do so contributed to the deaths and injuries suffered by their clients. \u201cIn field trips to mines in the DRC I witnessed staggering inequality, pain and misery at the bottom of a supply chain that we are all connected to through the devices we use every day,\u201d says Kara. \u201cRegardless of the outcome of this legal action, the voices of the children who lost their lives in these mines will be heard for the first time in a court of law.\u201d A spokesperson for Glencore said: \u201cGlencore notes the allegations contained in a US lawsuit filed on 15th December 2019. \u201cGlencore supports and respects human rights in a manner consistent with the universal declaration of human rights. \u201cGlencore\u2019s production of cobalt in the DRC is a by-product of our industrial copper production. Glencore\u2019s operations in the DRC do not purchase or process any artisanally mined ore. \u201cGlencore does not tolerate any form of child, forced, or compulsory labour.\u201d Apple said: \u201cApple is deeply committed to the responsible sourcing of materials that go into our products.

Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, who was one of the most interviewed Labour frontbenchers in the media during the campaign, said the unfairness of the BBC and other broadcasters should make people \u201cworry about our democratic processes\u201d. The argument over how central Corbyn was to the election loss is set to play a crucial role in the race to become the next Labour leader, a process the party has already begun with a new incumbent set to be elected by the end of March. In a sometimes angry interview on BBC Radio 5, McDonald said that in Corbyn\u2019s treatment by the media he had \u201cnever in my lifetime known any single individual so demonised and vilified, so grotesquely and so unfairly\u201d. Saying the Labour leader had been \u201cvilified as an antisemite\u201d and compared to Stalin, McDonald said the scale of the attacks had been broader than normal. \u201cWe know we\u2019ve got the forces of the establishment, the elite, against us. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the print media, which is page after page after page of press barons absolutely destroying and vilifying Labour leaders from time immemorial. What\u2019s changed in this election is the way the broadcast media have joined in with that battle. \u201cAnd you know that we have a catalogue of complaints against our public service broadcaster, our precious BBC, which I\u2019m afraid has been brought into the fray.\u201d Insisting the Labour manifesto and position on Brexit had gone down well with voters when he had been able to explain them in person, McDonald said he had \u201cnever, ever seen such a stacked deck in British politics\u201d. He said: \u201cI think it causes us to worry about our democratic processes. We know how powerful the Tory elite is, and they have flexed their muscles to great effect during this election.\u201d Referring to rows within Labour, such as disagreement over Brexit between the ex-MP Caroline Flint and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, McDonald called for \u201ca period of calm\u201d. He said: \u201cWe need some real reflection, we need to examine what we have done, and be open to internal discussion and criticism, based in fact, not in this business we\u2019ve had to deal with over the past several years.\u201d Also speaking on Monday, two leading backbenchers, Alison McGovern and Stephen Kinnock, both said they believed the next Labour leader should be a woman. In a separate interview, the Conservative MP Nigel Evans said Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, seen as the chosen pick of the Corbyn wing of the party, would be the candidate the Tories would most like to see take over. McGovern, the Wirral South MP, said the leadership debate \u201ccan\u2019t just be about how bad the Tories are\u201d. She told BBC One\u2019s Breakfast programme: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the right question. For me that\u2019s about who has got the right ideas.\u201d She added: \u201cI would like the Labour party to elect a woman as its leader. I think we need to show that we understand that women have every capacity to lead our country.\u201d Appearing on the same programme, Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, said it would be \u201cexcellent if the next leader were to be a woman\u201d. He said the priorities should be credibility on national security, a commitment to localism and a credible economic plan. He said: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a manifesto which is a Christmas wishlist.\u201d A series of female Labour MPs are deciding whether to seek the leadership, including Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper and Thornberry. Although she has not formally said she will enter, Long-Bailey is the favourite due to the endorsement from the Corbynite wing of the party. Speaking on Sky News, Evans, the veteran Tory backbencher, said Long-Bailey would be the Labour leader his party would worry about the least. \u201cShe would be seen as cast as the same sort of person as Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell. Anyone from the Momentum wing or the extreme left wing of the Labour party would be a big mistake for them,\u201d he said.",

EPCR has confirmed it will be investigating the incident in which one of Munster\u2019s medical staff is said to have made unsavoury comments about Jamie George\u2019s weight, which incensed the normally equable hooker. From that, all hell broke loose as most of the players on the field \u2013 and a few off \u2013 joined in a brawl that spilled dangerously close to some heavy, sharp-looking camera equipment beyond the hoardings. From out of the melee, the referee decided to penalise Owen Farrell \u2013 because he was captain and had come in from 10 metres to join the fray \u2013 which gave Munster the chance, owing to the intervention of one of their own staff, to extend their lead. As it happens, they missed, and it was Saracens, instead, who took inspiration from the incident. Bystanders influencing events on the field? It shouldn\u2019t happen for any number of reasons.

The race is for second place, a position currently held by Gloucester even though they have won just one of their four matches while Connacht, their conquerors in Galway on Saturday, have secured two victories. Gloucester left Ireland with two bonus points, but a club that won their opening two Premiership matches have lost their way with six defeats in seven matches in the league and Europe since then. They are fashioning different ways to lose and were 24-13 ahead in Connacht with four minutes to go before conceding two tries. As things stand, pools three and four should supply two of the three runners-up in the quarter-finals. Gloucester and Connacht are vying with Northampton and Glasgow for the other and it may be that the one who goes through secures 15 points or fewer, showing the domination of the five group leaders. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p>",

EPCR has confirmed it will be investigating the incident in which one of Munster\u2019s medical staff is said to have made unsavoury comments about Jamie George\u2019s weight, which incensed the normally equable hooker. From that, all hell broke loose as most of the players on the field \u2013 and a few off \u2013 joined in a brawl that spilled dangerously close to some heavy, sharp-looking camera equipment beyond the hoardings. From out of the melee, the referee decided to penalise Owen Farrell \u2013 because he was captain and had come in from 10 metres to join the fray \u2013 which gave Munster the chance, owing to the intervention of one of their own staff, to extend their lead. As it happens, they missed, and it was Saracens, instead, who took inspiration from the incident. Bystanders influencing events on the field? It shouldn\u2019t happen for any number of reasons. The case, as they say, continues. Michael Aylwin Match report: Saracens 15-6 Munster Pool 5: Anyone for seconds Toulouse are all but through to the quarter-finals after coming from behind to secure a bonus-point victory at Montpellier. The race is for second place, a position currently held by Gloucester even though they have won just one of their four matches while Connacht, their conquerors in Galway on Saturday, have secured two victories. Gloucester left Ireland with two bonus points, but a club that won their opening two Premiership matches have lost their way with six defeats in seven matches in the league and Europe since then. They are fashioning different ways to lose and were 24-13 ahead in Connacht with four minutes to go before conceding two tries. As things stand, pools three and four should supply two of the three runners-up in the quarter-finals. Gloucester and Connacht are vying with Northampton and Glasgow for the other and it may be that the one who goes through secures 15 points or fewer, showing the domination of the five group leaders.

She was working in a lowly job that she didn\u2019t like, one of a string of jobs since she\u2019d graduated, and she wasn\u2019t really sure what she wanted to do.

After a childhood of evasion and \u201cpassing-for-white\u201d, this light-skinned young English woman of Caribbean heritage realised not only that she was black but just what that meant in terms of British history, British society, and her strangely unrepresented place in it.</p> <p>Thomas Kinsman, one of the characters in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/07/the-long-song-andrea-levy\" title=\"\">The Long Song</a></em>, the last novel that Andrea wrote, describes at the beginning of the book how his mama, a Jamaican woman called July, \u201c\u2026 had a story \u2013 a story that lay so fat within her breast that she felt impelled, by some force that was mightier than her own will, to relay this tale\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a description that fits the author herself rather well.

Just little scenes, memories from her childhood. She joined an afternoon-a-week writing course. I guess I would have said nice things whatever she read to me, but I soon found I didn\u2019t need to flatter her. I remember her reading out an early story, just a snippet, where I laughed out loud and then welled up with tears within the space of a single paragraph. Wow, I thought, how did she do that?</p> <p>Since her death earlier this year one of my difficult but strangely uplifting tasks has been to assemble and go through her archive of written material \u2013 all her early notes, ideas for novels, research material, tape recordings, character sketches, handwritten drafts, annotated printouts, reworkings, letters, notes to herself. There are crates and crates of material all labelled and box-filed in her careful, slightly cautious manner. Although I know it was done over a long time, 20 years or so, I\u2019m still staggered by the sheer amount of work she did. I was with her all this time but I still can\u2019t quite grasp how, and when, she managed to do it all. We had a full life with friends and family and fun, and problems and crises and heartaches. But in among it all was this fat, fat story that, in a suite of beautiful, powerful novels, she patiently worked through. It was a courageous achievement that in the words of July\u2019s son, Thomas, she clearly felt impelled to do.</p> <p>When I think about Andrea, of all the rich, complex and loving feelings I have for her memory \u2013 her humour, her talent, her humanity \u2013 one thing keeps coming to my mind. She was quite simply the most intelligent person I have ever met. Not in the way we sometimes misuse the word, not clever-clever, or self confident, or good at general knowledge (she was none of those), but just a sure-footed thoughtfulness that had such depth, breadth and insight. She was a wise and wonderful woman. At a personal level to say that I miss her doesn\u2019t even come near. At a public, cultural level I know that she is missed by very many people. Through her body of work she has made a small but real difference to Britain\u2019s view of itself. Right to the end of her life her down-to-earth modesty meant I was never sure if she quite understood or totally accepted that fact. I just hope that she did.</p>",

Since her death earlier this year one of my difficult but strangely uplifting tasks has been to assemble and go through her archive of written material \u2013 all her early notes, ideas for novels, research material, tape recordings, character sketches, handwritten drafts, annotated printouts, reworkings, letters, notes to herself. There are crates and crates of material all labelled and box-filed in her careful, slightly cautious manner. Although I know it was done over a long time, 20 years or so, I\u2019m still staggered by the sheer amount of work she did. I was with her all this time but I still can\u2019t quite grasp how, and when, she managed to do it all. We had a full life with friends and family and fun, and problems and crises and heartaches. But in among it all was this fat, fat story that, in a suite of beautiful, powerful novels, she patiently worked through. It was a courageous achievement that in the words of July\u2019s son, Thomas, she clearly felt impelled to do. When I think about Andrea, of all the rich, complex and loving feelings I have for her memory \u2013 her humour, her talent, her humanity \u2013 one thing keeps coming to my mind. She was quite simply the most intelligent person I have ever met. Not in the way we sometimes misuse the word, not clever-clever, or self confident, or good at general knowledge (she was none of those), but just a sure-footed thoughtfulness that had such depth, breadth and insight. She was a wise and wonderful woman. At a personal level to say that I miss her doesn\u2019t even come near. At a public, cultural level I know that she is missed by very many people. Through her body of work she has made a small but real difference to Britain\u2019s view of itself. Right to the end of her life her down-to-earth modesty meant I was never sure if she quite understood or totally accepted that fact. I just hope that she did.",

Yet can you blame sportspeople for staying quiet when they see \u00d6zil bravely raising his head above the parapet only to be shot down by his own club? As for Arsenal not involving themselves in politics, what did the club think they were doing when they agreed a \u00a330m deal with the Rwandan government to promote tourism? Yes, the same Rwandan government that Human Rights Watch warns is guilty of \u201carbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture\u201d \u2013 and is one of 38 countries worldwide where human rights defenders face reprisals for cooperating with the UN.</p> \n<p>Of course in trying to be apolitical, Arsenal were desperately trying to put a lid on the problem before the top blew off it. They would have seen the fate of the Houston Rockets, who plunged from being one of China\u2019s most popular NBA teams to being blacklisted after its general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for protesters in Hong Kong, flashing before their eyes.</p> \n<p>The Rockets are already a textbook study of what happens when you upset the Chinese government, who according to the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, also made the extraordinary demand that Morey be sacked. The NBA has also suffered blowback, with CCTV-5, the country\u2019s state-controlled broadcaster, replacing coverage of US games with highlights of the Chinese league.</p> \n<p>The decision by CCTV not to show Arsenal\u2019s match against Manchester City is another reminder that there is no middle ground here. No way to stick up for human rights and free speech without angering China. You are either for such values or against them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/mesut-ozil-china-uighur-muslims-arsenal-manchester-city\">Chinese state broadcaster pulls Arsenal v Man City after Mesut \u00d6zil criticism</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports enterprise at Salford University who specialises in China, puts it: \u201cThe world is in the midst of an ideological battle: western liberalism versus eastern authoritarianism.

It also reveals how far the balance of power has tipped away from Europe and towards China.\u201d</p> \n<p>So what should Arsenal have done? Of course, the club were placed in an invidious position. But surely it was not beyond them to find a similar form of words to those used by Silver in the midst of the Morey firestorm. He pointedly told the Chinese government that American values travelled with the league wherever it went. \u201cAnd one of those values is free expression,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2e5b6000bdd1efc40db91e691a7e6efc96e5eb6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2e5b6000bdd1efc40db91e691a7e6efc96e5eb6/0_508_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, was thanked by Hong Kong protesters for his support but the Chinese government responded by trying to have him sacked.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, was thanked by Hong Kong protesters for his support but the Chinese government responded by trying to have him sacked.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Failing that, the club should have said nothing \u2013 just as they did when another Arsenal player, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, voiced his support for Labour on the morning of the general election.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, this issue is clearly not going away. Last week it was Joshua who faced accusations that he was being duped by a Saudi regime paying him around \u00a360m to \u201csportswash\u201d the kingdom. This week it is Arsenal in the firing line. In the days ahead, Liverpool are bound to face questions in Doha when they play in the Fifa Club World Cup. Clearly clubs and organisations need to think harder about finding an elegant way to walk the tightrope if they decide to take the money of certain regimes.</p> \n<p>But as the backlash over \u00d6zil\u2019s Instagram message intensifies, some at the Emirates Stadium might just wonder about replicating that famous Mitchell and Webb sketch in which two Nazis ask themselves: \u201cAre we the baddies?\u201d On this issue there is only one answer.</p>",

Yes, the same Rwandan government that Human Rights Watch warns is guilty of \u201carbitrary detention, ill-treatment and torture\u201d \u2013 and is one of 38 countries worldwide where human rights defenders face reprisals for cooperating with the UN. Of course in trying to be apolitical, Arsenal were desperately trying to put a lid on the problem before the top blew off it. They would have seen the fate of the Houston Rockets, who plunged from being one of China\u2019s most popular NBA teams to being blacklisted after its general manager Daryl Morey tweeted his support for protesters in Hong Kong, flashing before their eyes. The Rockets are already a textbook study of what happens when you upset the Chinese government, who according to the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, also made the extraordinary demand that Morey be sacked. The NBA has also suffered blowback, with CCTV-5, the country\u2019s state-controlled broadcaster, replacing coverage of US games with highlights of the Chinese league. The decision by CCTV not to show Arsenal\u2019s match against Manchester City is another reminder that there is no middle ground here. No way to stick up for human rights and free speech without angering China. You are either for such values or against them. As Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports enterprise at Salford University who specialises in China, puts it: \u201cThe world is in the midst of an ideological battle: western liberalism versus eastern authoritarianism. And sport is one of the front lines. \u201cThis case reveals a great deal about China\u2019s growing power, how it seeks to exercise it, and what it deems to be acceptable and unacceptable. It also reveals how far the balance of power has tipped away from Europe and towards China.\u201d So what should Arsenal have done? Of course, the club were placed in an invidious position. But surely it was not beyond them to find a similar form of words to those used by Silver in the midst of the Morey firestorm. He pointedly told the Chinese government that American values travelled with the league wherever it went. \u201cAnd one of those values is free expression,\u201d he said. Failing that, the club should have said nothing \u2013 just as they did when another Arsenal player, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, voiced his support for Labour on the morning of the general election. Meanwhile, this issue is clearly not going away. Last week it was Joshua who faced accusations that he was being duped by a Saudi regime paying him around \u00a360m to \u201csportswash\u201d the kingdom. This week it is Arsenal in the firing line. In the days ahead, Liverpool are bound to face questions in Doha when they play in the Fifa Club World Cup. Clearly clubs and organisations need to think harder about finding an elegant way to walk the tightrope if they decide to take the money of certain regimes. But as the backlash over \u00d6zil\u2019s Instagram message intensifies, some at the Emirates Stadium might just wonder about replicating that famous Mitchell and Webb sketch in which two Nazis ask themselves: \u201cAre we the baddies?\u201d On this issue there is only one answer.",

They are necessarily written by those who have had access to higher education; there is a degree of privilege and a lack of class and racial diversity to these books. They are marketed to a relatively literate audience, without the mass-market paraphernalia that is applied to, for example, the memoirs of former Para, Marine and Special Boat Serviceman Ant Middleton, whose autobiography <em>First Man In: Leading from the Front</em> was propelled to the top of the charts partly because of his role as instructor on the Channel 4 series <em>SAS: Who Dares Wins</em>; his new book, <em>Fear Bubble</em>, has sold more than 50,000 copies. But perhaps the sleeper hit of this Christmas will be a different kind of inside story altogether. With his book <em>How to Be a Footballer</em> already a success, Peter Crouch has gone big with a sequel <em>I, Robot</em> (for the uninitiated, a reference to his on-pitch celebration), which promises to lift the lid on what it takes to make it big in the beautiful game. Given his comic touch, blowing the whistle on Crouch\u2019s sporting career might simply have ushered in his second act. And perhaps that\u2019s the lesson of all these books \u2013 now that the age of the job-for-life has passed, it always pays to have something else up your sleeve.</p>",

A theme emerges in the popularity of these books: although the age of deference may have drawn to a close \u2013 as much from within ranks as without \u2013 readers are still gripped by the idea of what goes on in the elite professions. They are necessarily written by those who have had access to higher education; there is a degree of privilege and a lack of class and racial diversity to these books. They are marketed to a relatively literate audience, without the mass-market paraphernalia that is applied to, for example, the memoirs of former Para, Marine and Special Boat Serviceman Ant Middleton, whose autobiography First Man In: Leading from the Front was propelled to the top of the charts partly because of his role as instructor on the Channel 4 series SAS: Who Dares Wins; his new book, Fear Bubble, has sold more than 50,000 copies. But perhaps the sleeper hit of this Christmas will be a different kind of inside story altogether. With his book How to Be a Footballer already a success, Peter Crouch has gone big with a sequel I, Robot (for the uninitiated, a reference to his on-pitch celebration), which promises to lift the lid on what it takes to make it big in the beautiful game. Given his comic touch, blowing the whistle on Crouch\u2019s sporting career might simply have ushered in his second act. And perhaps that\u2019s the lesson of all these books \u2013 now that the age of the job-for-life has passed, it always pays to have something else up your sleeve.",

      "bodyText": "NSW About 2,000 firefighters are currently fighting more 108 active bushfires in NSW. Up to 20 building, including homes, are believed to have been destroyed when firefighters lost control of a backburn at the Gospers Mountain fire, northwest of Sdyney. Emergency warnings remain in place for the 396,000 hectare Gospers Mountain fire, which is burning in the Wollemi National Park. The fire is burning on multiple fronts. Warnings were issued to 24 communities and localities and six more have already been burned through. It\u2019s now burning on boths ides of Bells Line Road. Residents in Wallerawang, Lidsdale, and Blackmans Flat were told on Monday evening to seek shelter as the fire approached because it was too late to leave. Greenpeace has warned that Blackmans Flat was \u201cimmediately adjacent\u201d to the Mount Piper Power Station, which has coal stockpiled. About 450 houses in the upper Blue Mountains were without power on Monday because of the bushfires. An emergency warning also remains in place for Palmers Oaky, near Lithgow, where a fire is burning west of the Castlereagh Highway. It\u2019s about 40km west of the Gospers Mountain fire. The Kerry Ridge fire, a 52,000 hectare fire in the Wollemi National Park, Putty State Forest and Coricudgy state forest, is burning toward Nullo Mountain and Bogee. Those areas have also been placed under an emergency warning. It could merge with the 23,000 hectare Paddock Run fire, the RFS warned. Statewide, 742 homes have been destroyed since the fire season began. Western Australia Authorities are expected to downgrade an emergency warning for a fire burning north of Yanchep. Authorities managed to prevent the 13,000 hectare fire from entering residential estates in the area and saved 6,000 homes. One home and a petrol station were lost. Queensland Residents in the small regional community of Mount Maria, 75km north of Bundaberg, were told to evacuate because of an out of control bushfire burning towards Lowmead. An evacuation warning was also issued for a separate fire burning out of control near Gregory, south of Bundaberg. The RFS have issued a new emergency warning for areas near Muswellbrook. That brings the number of emergency warnings currently active in NSW to three. Heat records across Australia could tumble this week, with forecast tops of 44C in Adelaide on Friday, 41C in Melbourne on Friday, and 43C in Canberra on Saturday. Areas of inland South Australia are forecast to have five consecutive days of 45C or hotter, with three consecutive days of 47C and above. The SA heat record is 49.2C, which was recorded in Moomba in 1972. Temperatures are expected to reach those levels. Bureau of Meteorology climatologist Dr Blair Trewin told AAP: Australia\u2019s warmest day on record occurred in January 2013, when the average maximum temperature across the continent was 40.3C. We\u2019re closely monitoring the development and progression of this heat but, based on current forecasts, we could see that record broken this week.\u201d Emergency warning for Yanchep expected to be lifted soon Fire authorities in Western Australia are hoping to downgrade the emergency warning for the bushfire burning near Yanchep later this afternoon, to allow residents to begin returning home. John Newman, the incident controller of the Yanchep fire with the department of fire and emergency services, told ABC radio in Perth that he hoped that calmer weather conditions would mean that the warning level for Woodridge, Seatrees and Breakwater Estates could be lifted. \u201cAs soon as we have confirmation that conditions are safe we will be looking at downgrading the alert levels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very keen to reduce (warning) levels there and get people back in.\u201d Newman said there was still an area of unburned bush heading toward Woodridge estate. If fire were to get into that bushland, he said, it \u201ccould well run into the community\u201d. The fire started on Wednesday and destroyed one home and a service station, as well as 13,000ha of bushland. Newman said firefighters managed to save 6,000 homes. \u201cThe fire started under very fire-favourable conditions and it was an excellent example for us of how quickly they can get up and how far they can run,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen fire behaviour like this in early December at any time in my career.\u201d A bushfire near Collie, in south-west WA, has jumped containment lines. A watch and act alert has been issued for surrounding residents. About 70 firefighters are currently trying to get the fire back behind containment lines. Two schools in NSW will be closed tomorrow due to bushfires. Bilpin public school, near Lithgow, will be closed due to the Gospers Mountain fire and Oakdale public school, on the eastern edge of the Blue Mountains, will also be closed. The Bobin and Wytaliba public schools burned down last month. The emergency warning remains in place for the Gospers Mountain fire. Craig Spencer from the Bindoon bushfire brigade in WA has described the search for a 12-year-old boy who drove the farm ute across paddocks to escape an out-of-control bushfire at Mogumber yesterday. The boy, named Lucas, was reported missing by his brother while the fire was under an emergency warning on Sunday afternoon. They began a search but could not find him. One hour later, Spencer said, Lucas pulled up alongside firefighters on the northern flank of the blaze, looking terrified and with his dog in the car. Spencer told ABC24: He had a manual Ford Ranger and he could probably drive it better than me, so that\u2019s a good skill to have. They gently prodded him to the passenger seat and drove the ute to the roadblock, where police took charge of him and helped him find his family. We will get an update from the Western Australian fire and rescue service about the Yanchep, Two Rocks and Woodridge bushfire in about half an hour. There\u2019s a press conference scheduled for 3.30pm local time in Gingin, an hour north of Perth. Meanwhile, this is the Yanchep service station. And a note left behind in Two Rocks. There is an updated emergency warning for a 1,000ha bushfire burning out of control near Upper Turon Road, Palmers Oaky. The fire is burning west of the Castlereagh Highway, north-east of Lithgow, on the other side of Bogee from the Gospers Mountain fire. Residents near Razorback Road, Cherry Tree Hill and Running Stream have been warned to be on the lookout for ember attacks. A total fire ban has been issued for the Mount Lofty Ranges fire district of South Australia tomorrow. That district includes Adelaide Hills, the Barossa Valley, Victor harbour, Mount Barker and Gawler. Temperatures are expected to be in the low-mid 4os for the next four days. The fire danger rating for that region tomorrow is severe. The rest of the state has a rating of high or very high, apart from the upper south-east, where the danger rating is low to moderate. An updated emergency warning has been issued for Mount Maria, north of Bundaberg in Queensland. A large fire is burning west towards Lowmead, near Mount Maria. Areas around Tableland Road, between Cross Road and Hills Road, were being directly impacted by fire as of 3.40pm local time (4.40pm AEDT) and properties near Mitchell Road are expected to be impacted within the next hour. Conditions are very dangerous and firefighters may be unable to prevent the fire advancing. It may pose a threat to all lives in its path. Residents have been advised to leave immediately as it will soon be too dangerous to drive. There is an evacuation centre at Miriam Vale Community Hall. There are currently 74 fires burning in New South Wales with emergency warnings active for the fire at Palmers Oaky, near Lithgow, and Gospers Mountain, where a huge 378,000ha fire is burning in the Wollemi national park. There is also an emergency warning active for Woodridge, Seatrees and Breakwater Estates near Yanchep, north of Perth, in Western Australia. The temperature in Brisbane reached 41.2C at 1.40pm. That\u2019s equal to the city\u2019s previous record for its hottest ever day, which was set in 1981. Australia is on track to break its record for the highest ever national average temperature. The previous record is 40.3C. Watch and act for Kumbarilla State Forest, Queensland A watch and act warning has been issued for Kumbarilla State Forest, east of Brisbane, in Queensland. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services says a fast-moving fire is continuing to burn in the Kumbarilla State Forest. It\u2019s burning in a north-easterly direction toward the Moonie Highway between Halliford Rd and Kumbarilla Lane. People in the area have been told to be ready to leave because the situation could get worse quickly. Fire crews are working to contain the fire but firefighters may not be able to protect every property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door. Full alert here. Residents at Mount Maria, north of Bundaberg, have been advised to leave immediately as there is a bushfire approaching and it will soon be too dangerous to drive. Queensland Fire and Emergency Services says that as of 2.40pm local time (3.40pm AEDT) there is a large fire is travelling west towards Mount Maria. It is expected to impact Tableland Road, between Cross Road and Hills Road, within the next hour. The fire is expected to have a significant impact on the community. From QFES: Residents located along Tableland Road between Seeds Road and Hills Road and Whytallabah Road, Kirkpatrick Road, Mitchell Road, Cross Road and Lowmead Road should prepare to leave. While properties at these addresses are not under direct threat at this time, residents should be prepared to leave the area as the situation could change quickly. People evacuating should travel north on Tableland Road and head towards Miram Vale. Conditions are now very dangerous and firefighters may soon be unable to prevent the fire advancing. The fire may pose a threat to all lives directly in its path. Fire crews may not be able to protect your property. You should not expect a firefighter at your door: act now. Power, water, and mobile phone service may be lost and road conditions may become very dangerous over the next several hours. The South Australian housing authority has issued a statewide code red warning for homeless and vulnerable people affected by extreme heat. The code red will remain in place until Friday. Housing SA will provide extra accomodation services and ensure opening hours of service providers are extended during the heatwave, in some cases remaining open overnight, so people sleeping rough are able to seek refuge from the heat. In a statement, human services minister Michelle Lensink said: During a Code Red, agencies across Adelaide will extend their daytime operating hours to ensure people sleeping rough are keeping cool and well-hydrated during the extreme heat. I urge the community to check on the elderly, people who live alone, with disability or mental illness and those who are housebound, frail and the aged. South Australia is forecast to experience four days over 40C, with temperatures reaching 50C in some areas. Emergency WA has issued an updated watch and act alert for the Mogumber fire, 50km north of Perth. The alert covers parts of New Norcia, Glentromie, Regans Ford, Yathroo, Gillingarra, Mogumber and Yarawindah. About 50 firefighters are on scene and actively fighting the fire, which was reported just before 2pm yesterday. It\u2019s currently 7,500ha in size. This is a satellite hotspot animation of the NSW south coast bushfires, one covering 37,425 hectares near Braidwood, and the larger one covering 89,264 hectares north of Bateman\u2019s Bay. Further watch-and-act alert for WA I am taking over from my colleague Naaman Zhou, as bushfire activity starts to pick up in Western Australia. Along with that emergency warning, Emergency WA has issued a watch and act for Guilderton, Eglinton, Sovereign Hill (WA), Redfield Park, Yanchep and Two Rocks. There is a possible threat to lives and homes. People in Eglinton, Yanchep and Two Rocks, as well as Gabbadah and Neergabby, have been advised to evacuate by heading south along Two Rocks Road and Marmion Avenue. A bushfire emergency warning has been issued for Woodridge, Seatrees and Breakwater Estates, as well as Caraban and Wilbinga, in the city of Wanneroo and shire of Gingin north of Yanchep, Western Australia. Emergency WA says people in those areas are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes. People in Woodridge and the localities of Caraban and Wilbinga should leave in an easterly direction towards Indian Ocean Drive and use Gingin Brook Road to travel towards Gingin. There is an evacuation centre available at Granville Civic Centre, Weld Street, Gingin. People in Seatrees and Breakwater Estates should leave in a westerly direction towards Two Rocks, and then leave south along Two Rocks Road and Marmion Avenue. From the alert: If the way is clear, leave now for a safer place. Do not wait and see, leaving at the last minute is deadly. Close all doors and windows and turn off evaporative air conditioners, but keep water running through the system if possible. If you cannot leave, you need to get ready to shelter in your home. Go to a room in your home away from the fire front and make sure you can easily escape. Choose a room with two exits and water such as a kitchen or laundry. If you are not at home, it\u2019s too dangerous to return. Waterbombing aircraft have been sent to a fire on the Kings Highway near Bungendore. The grass fire is still at advice levels, and RFS says crews are on the scene. The huge Gospers Mountain fire has flared back to emergency levels on its south-west front. The fire has crossed Wolgan Road, and residents in the Wolgan Valley area are advised it is too late to leave. It is moving north in the Angus Place, Lidsdale and Wolgan areas. The multi-front fire is spreading out in multiple directions and is more than 378,000 hectares in size. Increasing fire activity at the Myall Creek Road fire, which is at watch and act. Federal Labor MP for Macquarie, Susan Templeman, says she saw damaged homes in Mt Tomah, Bilpin and Berambing today. An emergency warning has been issued for Upper Turon Road, Palmers Oaky. According to the RFS, the fire is burning in the Razorback Road and Cherrytree area. It is heading in a north-easterly direction towards Castlereagh Highway. The fire is more than 1,000 hectares in size and is out of control. \u201cIf you are in the path of the fire, you are at risk,\u201d the RFS says. Some sad news from the Mount Tomah Botanic Gardens. According to a statement on the website, there has been some impact from the fires. \u201cWe are still assessing the extent of the damage, however the impact on some parts of the Garden appears to be significant,\u201d it says. \u201cThankfully, most of the Garden\u2019s Living Collection along with the main buildings are safe at the moment. \u201cWe at the Garden are extremely grateful to our local staff, the local community, the emergency service personnel and the volunteers who are dedicating their time and efforts to dealing with the devastating bushfires. \u201cAt this stage, we anticipate it will be at least a week until the Garden can be reopened to visitors.\u201d In South Australia, it is 40C in Oodnadatta, 39C in Port Augusta and 32C in Adelaide. In NSW, it is 38.1C in Bourke, 37.8C in Walgett and 34C in Lismore. The latest temperatures around the country: In WA, it\u2019s already 37.2C at Marble Bar, 36C in Broome, 36C in Kalgoorlie and, as mentioned, 35.8C in Perth. In Queensland, Birdsville is at 41.5C, Gympie at 38.5C and at Brisbane 39.3C. And some more detail on the fire created by backburning near Mount Tomah, Mount Wilson and Bilpin. \u201cThere was backburning in the area and unfortunately, due to the conditions they\u2019re burning in, it\u2019s taken one ember to cross over the wrong side and that\u2019s where it took a run,\u201d an RFS spokeswoman told AAP. The affected properties are thought to be in the Mount Wilson and Bilpin areas. Endeavour Energy also told AAP 450 customers were without power in the upper Blue Mountains after the Gospers Mountain bushfire damaged powerlines. The fire has been burning for six days, and Perth has experienced three consecutive days above 40C (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). Today, it is currently 35.8C (at 10.30am local time). At least one house has been destroyed in the WA fire, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services has told AAP. A petrol station was also destroyed, and more than 250 properties are without power. The latest advice for the Wilbinga/Yanchep fire, north of Perth, which is still burning at emergency level. \u201cPeople in Woodridge and the localities of Caraban and Wilbinga should leave in an easterly direction towards Indian Ocean Drive and use Gingin Brook Road to travel towards Gingin. There is an evacuation centre available at Granville Civic Centre, Weld Street, Gingin. \u201cPeople in Seatrees and Breakwater Estates should leave in a westerly direction towards Two Rocks, and then leave south along Two Rocks Road and Marmion Avenue. \u201cYou are in danger and need to act immediately to survive. There is a threat to lives and homes.\u201d The fire bans in Queensland have been extended. We previously used satellite hotspot data to visualise how various how fires spread over time. Here is an updated visualisation of the Gospers Mountain megafire. Just to repeat the caveats from our initial datablog: the map is not exactly to scale, as the satellite detection has a resolution of 1km square, and it\u2019s possible for fires to be obscured from satellite by smoke or clouds. Hotspots can also show up where there isn\u2019t a bushfire for other reasons, but we\u2019ve tried to filter these out where possible. The circles fade to black over time to give an idea of the area burned, but it\u2019s worth pointing out that it only covers fires within the time period shown, so the actual burned area will be greater than what is shown here, particularly in areas where fires have been burning on and off for months. Jon Russell, a volunteer fire brigade captain from the northern beaches, has spent the night out at the Gospers Mountain fire where backburning operations near Mt Tomah went out of control and took out up to 20 properties. \u201cWe\u2019d been told properties had come under attack, that this fire had just gathered momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Hills district [brigades] were there, from the Cumberland zone, they were there from everywhere... it was a case of just \u2018pick a house and protect it\u2019.\u201d He described lining up his truck in front of a house, remarking to a colleague John Duffy (who filmed that incredible footage above), that if a nearby area of bush caught alight there\u2019d be little they could do, and they\u2019d have to leave. \u201cThen in an instant that area of bush just went boom.\u201d \u201cWe just went from daylight to nighttime in a instant. It\u2019s a very eerie feeling for new people. I\u2019ve been at this a long time, I\u2019ve been captain of my brigade 18 years. It was an experience for everybody that we\u2019ll never forget.\u201d Australia is facing a massive rethink on how it prepares for long-term bushfires and air pollution, my colleague Melissa Davey reports. David Bowman, the director of the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania\u2019s school of natural sciences, says it\u2019s too late to call for action to prevent climate change and that people affected by smoke inhalation from fires should demand moves to adapt to it, such as retrofitting houses to make them heat and smoke-proof. \u201cIt\u2019s a transformative time socially, and politicians have completely misunderstood this,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cPoliticians talk about holding the line, but this is escalating. \u201cHobart was fumigated at the beginning of this calendar year for six weeks because of fires. The cost of that was six deaths and $25m in health costs.\u201d In South Australia, AAP reports that extra payments will be made to people affected by out-of-control bushfires last month. Hardship payments of up to $10,000 \u2013 jointly funded by the state and federal governments \u2013 will be available to property owners who were affected on the Yorke Peninsula. Two fires at Price and Yorketown last month caused considerable damage, with at least 11 homes impacted, and damage was also caused to crops, livestock and other infrastructure. The largest fire burned through more than 5,000 hectares after being sparked by a power network fault. Federal natural disaster minister David Littleproud said: \u201cThis puts cash in the pockets of those most in need and helps to give them dignity. It will also help to cover any insurance shortfalls to make sure these communities can be restored.\u201d A map of that Mount Tomah, Mount Irvine, Mount Wilson fire. A few developments here. The ABC has confirmed that up to 20 properties have been destroyed near Mount Irvine, Mount Wilson and Mount Tomah. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons also confirmed to the ABC that the fire itself was started by a backburning operation. According to anchor Joe O\u2019Brien, Fitzsimmons said firefighters were \u201cattempting to protect communities around the Bells Line of Road but unfortunately things don\u2019t always go to plan\u201d. Earlier, deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said in an interview: \u201cWe were quite concerned about that fire jumping Bells Line Of Road. Crews backburned to try to prevent. The backburn got away as well. Nothing is working out for crews. \u201cUnfortunately in these drought conditions, that\u2019s the reality \u2013 whatever we try doesn\u2019t seem to be working and, you know, we just got to try to protect as many properties as we can.\u201d RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has confirmed that dozens of homes have been damaged. He told Nine\u2019s Today Show it was even possible that the local RFS captain lost their home. \u201cWe have reports of dozens of building, structures having been damaged or destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are just not sure on homes and outbuildings and sheds and those sorts of things. I am hearing reports that even our local members and it might be our local captain have lost their home last night trying to defend their local community.\u201d With the heatwave this week making things worse, he said there was an \u201cextraordinary amount of work still to go\u201d. \u201cThe drought is having an absolutely profound effect on the vegetation, and its flammability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing fire burn effectively unimpeded under windy conditions.\u201d The latest advice on the Gospers Mountain fire from the RFS. \u201cThe fire continues to burn on both sides of the Bells Line of Road, and is now burning in the Gross Valley ... Monitor conditions and know what you will do if fire threatens.\u201d The huge fire is also burning near Bell, Newnes Junction, Clarence, Colo, the lower and upper Macdonald, Perrys Crossing and Wollomi national park. According to Sky News, dozens of homes are feared lost near Mount Tomah, as a result of the Gospers Mountain fire. But assessment teams will only be sent once the area is deemed safe, which is not expected until later today at least. In SA, it is already 35C in Ceduna and over 38C at Moomba Airport. It\u2019s 29C in the Adelaide city centre. The forecast for Queensland is also sweltering. It\u2019s set to hit 44C for Mount Isa, 44C for Birdsville. 41C in Gympie and Rockhampton, 39C in Brisbane, and 34C in Townsville. And it\u2019s already 38C in Mount Isa, and 32.7C in Brisbane. It\u2019s only 7.30am in WA, but it\u2019s already 31C in Broome \u2013 and rising. According to 7.10am observations from the Bureau of Meteorology, it is 30C in Marble Bar, 27C in Kalgoorlie and 27.5C in Perth. That is forecast to rise to 43C in the Kimberley, 40C in Kalgoorlie and 36C in Perth during the day. Twenty-two health groups \u2013 including the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine, Public Health Association of Australia and Lung Foundation Australia \u2013 have labelled the bushfire smoke a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d. They have called on Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian to act, saying \u201cgovernments have a responsibility to protect the people they represent\u201d. \u201cThere is no safe level of air pollution,\u201d the joint statement says. In August, the Australian Medical Association declared that climate change was a \u201chealth emergency\u201d, because of the \u201cclear evidence\u201d showing it would create health risks for people now and in the future. More homes lost in Bilpin in the Blue Mountains. And in WA today, the fire danger is extreme for Gascoyne Inland, Eucla and Avon. It is severe for Ashburton inland, inland central west \u2013 south, lower west inland, upper great southern, Roe, Mortlock and Ninghan. New South Wales: Some of the fire danger ratings for today. Queensland: The Mt Tomah Botanical Gardens are currently closed for a few days, according to a statement, but there is no news on whether they have been directly affected. \u201cWe at the garden are extremely grateful to the emergency service personnel and volunteers who are dedicating their time and efforts to dealing with the devastating bushfires,\u201d management said. \u201cWe will provide further updates on the reopening of the Garden on our social media channels.\u201d There are also fears for the Mt Tomah Botanical Gardens, which lie within the fire area. And homes have already been destroyed, according to photographer Nick Moir, from the Sydney Morning Herald. The damage done by the Gospers Mountain fire will be on the minds of residents today. On Sunday, the huge blaze was upgraded to emergency, as it jumped containment lines near Bowen Creek. There are early reports that properties have been destroyed, near Mount Tomah and Mount Wilson. So far the fire has burned through 380,000 hectares. The firegrounds stretch from Lithgow, through the Hawkesbury and towards the central coast. This morning, the Rural Fire Service said fire activity had \u201creduced\u201d around the Gospers Mountain blaze, and \u201cthere is currently no immediate threat\u201d. But it is expected to worsen as temperatures rise this week. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the bushfire crisis and this week\u2019s hot weather. Across the country, a severe to extreme heatwave is settling in. Currently, it\u2019s sitting over southern Western Australia and most of South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory \u2013 from Broome to Brisbane. In coming days, it will sweep east and south, blanketing most of NSW and the ACT. Over the weekend, the huge Gospers Mountain fire in NSW flared to emergency levels. It is currently at watch and act, but remains a threat to homes. The extent of the damage will become more apparent today. In WA, an emergency warning is still active for a fire near Wilbinga, Woodridge, Seatrees and Breakwater Estates, north of Perth. Across the country, it\u2019s forecast to hit 43C in WA\u2019s Kimberley region, 40C in Kalgoorlie, 36C in Perth; 44C in Mount Isa in Queensland, 41C in Rockhampton , 39C in Brisbane; 43C in Oodnadatta in SA, 34C in Adelaide, and 41C in Walgett and Bourke in NSW.",

      "body": "<p>Jameis Winston, once again, started a game on the worst possible note. For the fifth time this season \u2013 and the 10th time in his career \u2013 he threw an interception on the game\u2019s opening drive, this one to the Detroit Lions\u2019 Jahlani Tavai. It looked like it was going to be one of those Jameis Winston Games, but it ended up being the other kind: he bounced back to throw four touchdowns in a 38-17 victory for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was yet another chapter in the up-and-down career of a quarterback who continues to show tantalizing flashes of being an elite signal-caller while also showing a frightening predisposition for ugly turnovers.</p> <p>In Sunday\u2019s win, Winston became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 450 yards in consecutive games. He\u2019s also thrown for over 4,573 yards on the season, which currently puts him ahead of the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Dak Prescott for the league lead, to go alongside his 30 touchdowns. Sounds great, right? Here\u2019s the problem: the interception increased Winston\u2019s season total for picks to 24, with many of those giveaways avoidable. He\u2019s also incredibly sack-prone \u2013 he\u2019s been sacked 43 times on the year \u2013 and has shown a frustrating inability to learn when he needs to throw the ball away. At no point during his pro career, has he shown any sign of improving all-important ball security.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/nfl/index.html?opinion-tint=false&amp;headline=2019%20season&amp;name=Jameis%20Winston&amp;team=Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers&amp;position=Quarterback&amp;number=3&amp;touchdowns=30&amp;interceptions=24&amp;yards=4573&amp;rating=87.9\" data-alt=\"Jameis Winston\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/nfl/index.html?opinion-tint=false&headline=2019%20season&name=Jameis%20Winston&team=Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers&position=Quarterback&number=3&touchdowns=30&interceptions=24&yards=4573&rating=87.9\">Jameis Winston</a> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, as much as the Bucs must love games such as the one Winston gave them on Sunday, those strong performances may be making it more difficult for them to figure out what to do <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl-winners-and-losers-the-buccaneers-are-going-to-pay-jameis-winston-right-good-luck-211854970.html\">when his contract runs out</a> at the end of the season. Do the Buccaneers hand an extension to a young quarterback capable of putting up monster numbers? Do they place the one-year franchise tag on him and hope that he becomes more consistent in his sixth year as an NFL starter? Or do they let another team take up his services and find a replacement quarterback in free agency? It\u2019s not like they have had a tremendous amount of success with Winston \u2013 he has yet to lead them to the playoffs.</p> <p>Winston\u2019s troubled history may make that third option more attractive. The Buccaneers drafted Winston out of Florida State University, where he was the subject of a high-profile sexual assault allegation, one that eventually ended with him coming to a <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/18281435/jameis-winston-settles-lawsuit-2012-sexual-assault-accuser\">settlement with the victim</a> (he was not charged over the allegations). There were also several other less serious incidents that occurred during his college career: a citation for shoplifting and a suspension for shouting vulgarities in the campus cafeteria. Tampa Bay took a risk with Winston but hoped that he would keep out of trouble once in the NFL.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t. In 2018, the NFL suspended him three games after he was accused of groping an Uber driver (Winston was never charged over the incident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/28/jameis-winston-nfl-ban-uber-driver-groping-allegations-nfl\">but did apologize to the driver</a>). The NFL report <a href=\"https://nflcommunications.com/Documents/18winstonrelease.pdf\">was particularly damning</a>: \u201cAs a result, the investigation had concluded that Winston violated the Personal Conduct Policy by touching the driver in an inappropriate and sexual manner without her consent and that disciplinary action was necessary and appropriate.\u201d </p> <p>The Buccaneers clearly have a conundrum. Winston can win games for the team, he can lose games for the team and there\u2019s a chance that legal or personal issues could prevent him from taking the field altogether.</p> <p>In a league where starting quarterback options are plentiful, it would be an easy decision for Tampa Bay to move on and let another team take on the risks. That doesn\u2019t describe the modern NFL, however, where teams seem to be constantly installing and discarding proven mediocrities. Because of this, there must be an temptation within the organization to stick with the Devil They Know and hope that he keeps coming up with games like the one had had on Sunday.</p> <h2><strong>Stat of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>31</strong>. After Sunday\u2019s game against the Miami Dolphins, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has thrown at least one interception against 31 NFL teams. In other words, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFLResearch/status/1206294368358825985\">every single team besides the Giants</a>. In fact, in what was likely his last game at MetLife Stadium, he ended up throwing three to various Dolphins defenders. Manning also, however, threw two touchdowns and led his team to a 36-20 victory, which was well appreciated by the hometown fans who rewarded him with a standing ovation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NFLResearch/status/1206294368358825985\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Eli Manning has now thrown an INT against every NFL team except for the Giants in his career<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsNYG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIAvsNYG</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Giants?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Giants</a></p>&mdash; NFL Research (@NFLResearch) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFLResearch/status/1206294368358825985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 15, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>MVP of the week</strong></h2> <p><strong>Kenyan Drake, running back, Arizona Cardinals</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Jameis Winston, once again, started a game on the worst possible note. For the fifth time this season \u2013 and the 10th time in his career \u2013 he threw an interception on the game\u2019s opening drive, this one to the Detroit Lions\u2019 Jahlani Tavai. It looked like it was going to be one of those Jameis Winston Games, but it ended up being the other kind: he bounced back to throw four touchdowns in a 38-17 victory for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It was yet another chapter in the up-and-down career of a quarterback who continues to show tantalizing flashes of being an elite signal-caller while also showing a frightening predisposition for ugly turnovers. In Sunday\u2019s win, Winston became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 450 yards in consecutive games. He\u2019s also thrown for over 4,573 yards on the season, which currently puts him ahead of the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Dak Prescott for the league lead, to go alongside his 30 touchdowns. Sounds great, right? Here\u2019s the problem: the interception increased Winston\u2019s season total for picks to 24, with many of those giveaways avoidable. He\u2019s also incredibly sack-prone \u2013 he\u2019s been sacked 43 times on the year \u2013 and has shown a frustrating inability to learn when he needs to throw the ball away. At no point during his pro career, has he shown any sign of improving all-important ball security. Ultimately, as much as the Bucs must love games such as the one Winston gave them on Sunday, those strong performances may be making it more difficult for them to figure out what to do when his contract runs out at the end of the season. Do the Buccaneers hand an extension to a young quarterback capable of putting up monster numbers? Do they place the one-year franchise tag on him and hope that he becomes more consistent in his sixth year as an NFL starter? Or do they let another team take up his services and find a replacement quarterback in free agency? It\u2019s not like they have had a tremendous amount of success with Winston \u2013 he has yet to lead them to the playoffs. Winston\u2019s troubled history may make that third option more attractive. The Buccaneers drafted Winston out of Florida State University, where he was the subject of a high-profile sexual assault allegation, one that eventually ended with him coming to a settlement with the victim (he was not charged over the allegations). There were also several other less serious incidents that occurred during his college career: a citation for shoplifting and a suspension for shouting vulgarities in the campus cafeteria. Tampa Bay took a risk with Winston but hoped that he would keep out of trouble once in the NFL. He didn\u2019t. In 2018, the NFL suspended him three games after he was accused of groping an Uber driver (Winston was never charged over the incident but did apologize to the driver). The NFL report was particularly damning: \u201cAs a result, the investigation had concluded that Winston violated the Personal Conduct Policy by touching the driver in an inappropriate and sexual manner without her consent and that disciplinary action was necessary and appropriate.\u201d The Buccaneers clearly have a conundrum. Winston can win games for the team, he can lose games for the team and there\u2019s a chance that legal or personal issues could prevent him from taking the field altogether. In a league where starting quarterback options are plentiful, it would be an easy decision for Tampa Bay to move on and let another team take on the risks. That doesn\u2019t describe the modern NFL, however, where teams seem to be constantly installing and discarding proven mediocrities. Because of this, there must be an temptation within the organization to stick with the Devil They Know and hope that he keeps coming up with games like the one had had on Sunday. Stat of the week 31. After Sunday\u2019s game against the Miami Dolphins, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has thrown at least one interception against 31 NFL teams. In other words, every single team besides the Giants. In fact, in what was likely his last game at MetLife Stadium, he ended up throwing three to various Dolphins defenders. Manning also, however, threw two touchdowns and led his team to a 36-20 victory, which was well appreciated by the hometown fans who rewarded him with a standing ovation. MVP of the week Kenyan Drake, running back, Arizona Cardinals. Congratulations to every fantasy football player who had Drake on their roster: he managed to score four touchdowns in a 38-24 Cardinals win over the Cleveland Browns. As you can imagine, Drake also accumulated plenty of carries (22) and a ton of yardage (137) in an Arizona victory that essentially sealed Cleveland\u2019s playoff fate. Quote of the week \u201cWalking in here with Stretch (assistant to the head coach, John Streicher) I said one idiot was going to ask me that question\u201d - Tennessee head coach Mike Vrabel, after being asked about LeShaun Sims\u2019 punt return at the end of the Titans\u2019 24-21 loss to the Houston Texans. You can\u2019t blame Vrabel for coming into the press conference a little bit heated. His team\u2019s record, after all, fell to 8-6 thus putting the Titans in second place in the AFC South behind the 9-5 Texans. To be fair to the reporter in question, it wasn\u2019t an entirely ridiculous question, as the Titans would have had better field possession, and slightly more time on the clock, had Sims not returned the punt during their final drive of the game. Vrabel, however, had a point by emphasizing that was hardly the key play in what ended up being a frustratingly close loss, one that puts their postseason hopes in jeopardy.

      "body": "<h2>1) City find another way to win</h2> \n<p>The scoreline suggests a clear and obvious case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. But City\u2019s victory at the Emirates Stadium was a little different from their other recent wins against Arsenal. Pep Guardiola started with an unusual 4-2-3-1 formation, with two holding midfielders and Kevin De Bruyne as a No 10, and his team seemed more content than usual to allow the opposition to have the ball. They knew they could slice and dice Arsenal with sudden attacking thrusts, especially with De Bruyne in such regal form. There was a savage ruthlessness to City\u2019s play and Arsenal were 3-0 down after 40 minutes despite having more of the ball. With Arsenal\u2019s spirit broken, the match finished with the familiar sight of City passing the ball around in the opposition half. For once City\u2019s effortless possession did not tell the story of the game. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/arsenal-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Arsenal 0-3 Manchester City</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"432fbc00-c3f4-4ef1-afef-e152ea03b492\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZOJEP0i3Y54?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>2) Newcastle look shot shy</h2> \n<p>Newcastle ended the match at Turf Moor with four strikers on the pitch but they had failed to muster a shot on target between them. It was the first time in Burnley\u2019s Premier League history that they had stopped their opponents from achieving such a mediocre feat. The Clarets are a well-organised unit but not testing the goalkeeper in 90 minutes is shameful. Andy Carroll was an aerial threat around the box but never in it; his most dangerous moment was when he caught the resilient Ben Mee with an elbow. Carroll has not scored a league goal since April 2018 and his lack of match sharpness means it will be a surprise when he does. Steve Bruce might need a better plan than swapping between him and Joelinton in the hope one finds form. Instead it could be time to give Dwight Gayle another chance to prove he is a top-flight striker. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/burnley-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">\u2022 Match report: Burnley 1-0 Newcastle</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city-arsenal\">Arsenal defence proves perfect audience for De Bruyne\u2019s one-man show | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3) Lampard needs improvement</h2> \n<p>Frank Lampard is not a happy man at the moment. Chelsea have lost four of their last five league games and Lampard was fuming after Bournemouth\u2019s latest victory at Stamford Bridge, questioning whether his players possess the personality to break down opponents who sit deep and disrupt their rhythm. It was another insipid performance in front of their fans from Chelsea, who have only four home wins this season, and it bolsters the argument that they need to spend now their transfer ban has been halved. None of their creative players is showing enough consistency and, with his team\u2019s hold on fourth spot looking uncertain, Lampard cannot tolerate the lack of decisiveness in the final third much longer. Mason Mount is showing signs of fatigue and Willian, out of contract next summer, was poor against Bournemouth. No wonder Chelsea are interested in Fyodor Chalov, Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Jadon Sancho, Timo Werner and Wilfried Zaha. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/chelsea-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Chelsea 0-1 Bournemouth</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b359e3fd9fd71e073b82abb9ce3361f4e5404020\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b359e3fd9fd71e073b82abb9ce3361f4e5404020/0_63_2340_1404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Godfrey closes down Leicester\u2019s Ricardo Pereira\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Godfrey closes down Leicester\u2019s Ricardo Pereira.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images via Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4) Godfrey impresses for Norwich</h2> \n<p>It has not happened often enough yet this season but Norwich\u2019s brightest talents all came to the fore at once on Saturday, and more performances like the 1-1 draw at Leicester could yet haul them out of the mire. Max Aarons covered a prodigious amount of ground from right-back, Emi Buend\u00eda was a bewitching and effective presence on the ball in possibly his best showing of the campaign, while Teemu Pukki did exactly what Teemu Pukki does. But perhaps the most convincing operator of all was Ben Godfrey, who would reportedly set suitors back \u00a350m if Norwich get their way and on this evidence may be worth that kind of investment. Godfrey is only 21 but sailed through on all fronts, his imposing physical frame getting the better of Leicester\u2019s attack and some sublime distribution from the back putting Norwich on the front foot. One raking 60-yard pass almost put Pukki in for the winner late on. If the worst does happen in May then you suspect that, in whatever they receive for Godfrey, Norwich will essentially have an extra parachute payment. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/leicester-city-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Leicester 1-1 Norwich</a></em></p> \n<h2>5) VAR again the focus at Anfield</h2> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t celebrate goals any more,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp said with a shrug. As the Liverpool manager\u2019s celebrations are often something to behold, that probably counts as another downside to VAR. Had Watford scored a goal or two at Anfield, and they certainly had the chances, a lot more would have been heard about the disallowed Sadio Man\u00e9 goal at the start of the second half. The latest VAR ludicrousness could have had a bearing on the title race if Liverpool had dropped points, as it was a fine Xherdan Shaqiri cross and a perfect Man\u00e9 finish counted for nothing due to the scorer eventually being adjudged offside by an eyebrow or something just as imperceptible. Once again the question must be posed: are these pettifogging and increasingly arbitrary interventions really the future the game wants to embrace? <strong>Paul Wilson</strong></p> \n<p><em>\u2022 Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/14/liverpool-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool 2-0 Watford</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Time for Greenwood to get proper chance</h2> \n<p>Is it time for Mason Greenwood to get a proper run in the Manchester United side? His superb equaliser against Everton on Sunday means he now has more Premier League goals this season (two) than starts (one) and, though Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has largely restricted him to cameos off the bench, the case for starting him \u2013 perhaps ahead of Daniel James, who after 26 games in all competitions looks in need of a rest \u2013 is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Part of the issue is whether Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford \u2013 all quick forwards who like to attack central areas \u2013 can truly complement each other in a front three. But it seemed to work a treat against Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League, and there surely comes a point when you just have to suck it and see. <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong><em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/manchester-united-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">\u2022 Match report: Manchester United 1-1 Everton</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"451d0c27-c22e-4eb3-a757-1401516ebac1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uEPVw00mXOI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/duncan-ferguson-everton-plan-hunger-manchester-united\">Duncan Ferguson gives Everton a plan but hunger will get them only so far | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>7) Smith faces selection quandary</h2> \n<p>After seeing Aston Villa disappoint during Saturday\u2019s defeat at Sheffield United \u2013 their sixth loss in eight league games \u2013 Dean Smith has an interesting pickle to chew on.

      "bodyText": "1) City find another way to win The scoreline suggests a clear and obvious case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. But City\u2019s victory at the Emirates Stadium was a little different from their other recent wins against Arsenal. Pep Guardiola started with an unusual 4-2-3-1 formation, with two holding midfielders and Kevin De Bruyne as a No 10, and his team seemed more content than usual to allow the opposition to have the ball. They knew they could slice and dice Arsenal with sudden attacking thrusts, especially with De Bruyne in such regal form. There was a savage ruthlessness to City\u2019s play and Arsenal were 3-0 down after 40 minutes despite having more of the ball. With Arsenal\u2019s spirit broken, the match finished with the familiar sight of City passing the ball around in the opposition half. For once City\u2019s effortless possession did not tell the story of the game. Rob Smyth \u2022 Match report: Arsenal 0-3 Manchester City 2) Newcastle look shot shy Newcastle ended the match at Turf Moor with four strikers on the pitch but they had failed to muster a shot on target between them. It was the first time in Burnley\u2019s Premier League history that they had stopped their opponents from achieving such a mediocre feat. The Clarets are a well-organised unit but not testing the goalkeeper in 90 minutes is shameful. Andy Carroll was an aerial threat around the box but never in it; his most dangerous moment was when he caught the resilient Ben Mee with an elbow. Carroll has not scored a league goal since April 2018 and his lack of match sharpness means it will be a surprise when he does. Steve Bruce might need a better plan than swapping between him and Joelinton in the hope one finds form. Instead it could be time to give Dwight Gayle another chance to prove he is a top-flight striker. Will Unwin \u2022 Match report: Burnley 1-0 Newcastle 3) Lampard needs improvement Frank Lampard is not a happy man at the moment. Chelsea have lost four of their last five league games and Lampard was fuming after Bournemouth\u2019s latest victory at Stamford Bridge, questioning whether his players possess the personality to break down opponents who sit deep and disrupt their rhythm. It was another insipid performance in front of their fans from Chelsea, who have only four home wins this season, and it bolsters the argument that they need to spend now their transfer ban has been halved. None of their creative players is showing enough consistency and, with his team\u2019s hold on fourth spot looking uncertain, Lampard cannot tolerate the lack of decisiveness in the final third much longer. Mason Mount is showing signs of fatigue and Willian, out of contract next summer, was poor against Bournemouth. No wonder Chelsea are interested in Fyodor Chalov, Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Jadon Sancho, Timo Werner and Wilfried Zaha. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: Chelsea 0-1 Bournemouth 4) Godfrey impresses for Norwich It has not happened often enough yet this season but Norwich\u2019s brightest talents all came to the fore at once on Saturday, and more performances like the 1-1 draw at Leicester could yet haul them out of the mire. Max Aarons covered a prodigious amount of ground from right-back, Emi Buend\u00eda was a bewitching and effective presence on the ball in possibly his best showing of the campaign, while Teemu Pukki did exactly what Teemu Pukki does. But perhaps the most convincing operator of all was Ben Godfrey, who would reportedly set suitors back \u00a350m if Norwich get their way and on this evidence may be worth that kind of investment. Godfrey is only 21 but sailed through on all fronts, his imposing physical frame getting the better of Leicester\u2019s attack and some sublime distribution from the back putting Norwich on the front foot. One raking 60-yard pass almost put Pukki in for the winner late on. If the worst does happen in May then you suspect that, in whatever they receive for Godfrey, Norwich will essentially have an extra parachute payment. Nick Ames \u2022 Match report: Leicester 1-1 Norwich 5) VAR again the focus at Anfield \u201cI don\u2019t celebrate goals any more,\u201d J\u00fcrgen Klopp said with a shrug. As the Liverpool manager\u2019s celebrations are often something to behold, that probably counts as another downside to VAR. Had Watford scored a goal or two at Anfield, and they certainly had the chances, a lot more would have been heard about the disallowed Sadio Man\u00e9 goal at the start of the second half. The latest VAR ludicrousness could have had a bearing on the title race if Liverpool had dropped points, as it was a fine Xherdan Shaqiri cross and a perfect Man\u00e9 finish counted for nothing due to the scorer eventually being adjudged offside by an eyebrow or something just as imperceptible. Once again the question must be posed: are these pettifogging and increasingly arbitrary interventions really the future the game wants to embrace? Paul Wilson \u2022 Match report: Liverpool 2-0 Watford 6) Time for Greenwood to get proper chance Is it time for Mason Greenwood to get a proper run in the Manchester United side? His superb equaliser against Everton on Sunday means he now has more Premier League goals this season (two) than starts (one) and, though Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has largely restricted him to cameos off the bench, the case for starting him \u2013 perhaps ahead of Daniel James, who after 26 games in all competitions looks in need of a rest \u2013 is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Part of the issue is whether Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford \u2013 all quick forwards who like to attack central areas \u2013 can truly complement each other in a front three. But it seemed to work a treat against Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League, and there surely comes a point when you just have to suck it and see. Jonathan Liew \u2022 Match report: Manchester United 1-1 Everton 7) Smith faces selection quandary After seeing Aston Villa disappoint during Saturday\u2019s defeat at Sheffield United \u2013 their sixth loss in eight league games \u2013 Dean Smith has an interesting pickle to chew on. How many of his first-choice players should the Villa manager deploy in the Carabao Cup quarter-final against a Liverpool shadow side on Tuesday? Along with a semi-final spot, an authoritative win could prove a timely boost before a critical run of Premier League fixtures: they have to play all three of the teams below them in the table before the new year. But injuries \u2013 or defeat by a band of rookies \u2013 would be a painful blow at a tricky time. Paul Doyle \u2022 Match report: Sheffield United 2-0 Aston Villa 8) Saints take another step back One step forward, two steps back: two wins on the bounce have been followed by back-to-back defeats and a pervading sense Southampton are treading water.

Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Southampton 0-1 West Ham 9) Mourinho takes another step in right direction Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was so exhausted by the sight of Tottenham Hotspur fending off Wolves\u2019 lethal wingers that he sighed when asked to discuss his team\u2019s dramatic 2-1 victory over the hosts at Molineux. \u201cAdama [Traor\u00e9] and Diogo [Jota]: I don\u2019t even want to speak about them because I get tired just to see them run,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>There are some things that only ever happen at Christmas, like Turkish delight, charades and pretending to like each other, which is a sort of real-time no-fun game of charades that goes on for days.</p> <p>Perhaps the most famous Thing That Only Happens At Christmas is The Queen\u2019s Speech. The Queen\u2019s Speech is very much the Bond film of the Christmas TV schedules.</p> <p>It\u2019s traditional for old people to talk to the TV, especially if they\u2019re trying to remember which sitcom the actor in the funeral plan advert used to be in, or losing their shit with the news. But this is more than that, because the Queen\u2019s Speech has been going on for decades and decades, ever since Her Majesty was barely out of her Princessing uniform.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably the longest-running TV series of all time. Longer even than Coronation Street or The Weather. That\u2019s why it can be hard to work out where you are in the plot when you first watch it. It\u2019s probably one of those things that takes years to appreciate properly, like athletics and tomatoes.</p> <p>If you haven\u2019t seen it before, it\u2019s a bit like Gogglebox, but even posher than the bits with Stef and Dom in.

      "bodyText": "There are some things that only ever happen at Christmas, like Turkish delight, charades and pretending to like each other, which is a sort of real-time no-fun game of charades that goes on for days. Perhaps the most famous Thing That Only Happens At Christmas is The Queen\u2019s Speech. The Queen\u2019s Speech is very much the Bond film of the Christmas TV schedules. It\u2019s traditional for old people to talk to the TV, especially if they\u2019re trying to remember which sitcom the actor in the funeral plan advert used to be in, or losing their shit with the news. But this is more than that, because the Queen\u2019s Speech has been going on for decades and decades, ever since Her Majesty was barely out of her Princessing uniform. It\u2019s probably the longest-running TV series of all time. Longer even than Coronation Street or The Weather. That\u2019s why it can be hard to work out where you are in the plot when you first watch it. It\u2019s probably one of those things that takes years to appreciate properly, like athletics and tomatoes. If you haven\u2019t seen it before, it\u2019s a bit like Gogglebox, but even posher than the bits with Stef and Dom in. The Queen, who you\u2019ll recognise from her starring role in money, talks about what\u2019s been going on in the world and how we have to put up with it all. It\u2019s a sort of human Keep Calm and Carry On poster that looks like it\u2019s done up for a wedding. So, for instance, this year, she\u2019ll probably talk about the Greggs vegan sausage roll and how Ant\u2019s back on I\u2019m a Celebrity, and probably try not to mention the one-hour TV special her son did about a dead paedophile he liked. I mean, it\u2019s a shame it got such a bad reaction, because it must have looked a good idea at the time. But I expect they said the same thing about Guinness Red and the Squarial, and nobody remembers them now.

Today, the team is gathered around, drinking coffee and chatting about their pop-up event in east London the week before, which invited a community of young writers to dance and seek writing advice from the likes of playwright Inua Ellams and musician Wretch 32.</p> <p>The team are all characters worth reading about themselves. Twenty-two-year-old editorial assistant Gabriel, who routinely dresses all in purple (today she has a crop of lilac hair, violet glasses and a purple jumper), currently on an internship programme, was the first in her British Grenadan family to go to university, and publishes a radical zine, <em>Onyx</em>, which celebrates black creatives. Emma Wallace, 30, the senior audience and brand manager, is British Sri Lankan and English, and previously worked at start-ups and the BBC doing social media. The softly spoken founder and editorial director Tom Avery, 36, brings 13 years of publishing experience. And there\u2019s 31-year-old commissioning editor Lemara Lindsay-Prince, who made her name as a writer, curator and founder of the acclaimed fanzine <em><a href=\"https://www.plantainpapers.com/\" title=\"\">Plantain Papers</a></em>, a homage to the delectable carb, which told stories across the diaspora.</p> <p>#Merky Books was the unlikely result of a meeting at which Avery invited Stormzy to write a book for Penguin in the summer of 2015. \u201cOne of the reasons I first approached Stormzy is that I loved the music and recognised something in that DIY attitude,\u201d says Avery. \u201cStormzy\u2019s incentive for creating the imprint was that he just felt like, \u2018I know all these incredible writers that are just not getting very far.\u201d\u2019</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One of the reasons I\u00a0first approached Stormzy is that I loved the music and recognised something in that DIY attitude</p> <footer> <cite>Tom Avery</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The slang term \u201cmerky\u201d (loosely meaning something great) has also been adopted by Stormzy for his record label. If the heritage of the Penguin brand gave #Merky legitimacy in the publishing world, the Stormzy name broke down some of the barriers to access, reimagining the kind of stories that might \u201cget far\u201d. Launching in July 2018, it has gone on to publish three books: <em>That Reminds Me</em>, a fictional narrative told in verse by Derek Owusu about his troubled boyhood; <em>Taking Up Space</em> by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi, which they describe as a \u201cblack girl\u2019s manifesto for change\u201d; and <em>Rise Up: The </em>#<em>Merky Story So Far </em>charting Stormzy\u2019s career, co-written by Jude Yawson.</p> <p>The recent signing of Malorie Blackman, the former Children\u2019s Laureate, to publish her autobiography, is a major coup for the imprint. \u201cI have been thinking about writing my memoirs for a while now, but the right moment never presented itself until a meeting with #Merky Books\u2026 an imprint that embraces new methods and ideas,\u201d she tells me over email.</p> <p>The #Merky Books Instagram account has 17.5k followers and no shortage of submissions. Stormzy\u2019s team has been proactive in putting forward promising young writers. The most recent signing is 20-year-old Jeremiah Emmanuel. I meet him in Creams, on Brixton high street, a dessert caf\u00e9 filled with the heady scent of Oreo waffles. \u201cI used to come here all the time after school,\u201d grins Emmanuel between icy slurps of his blueberry and strawberry slushie. He explains how Creams and McDonald\u2019s ended up being places to gather after funding cuts hit youth clubs in the area.</p> <p>Emmanuel\u2019s memoir, <em>Dreaming in a Nightmare</em>, touches on wealth disparity, class and British Nigerian identity through youthful observations. \u201cOnce when I was about eight, I stayed on the 345 bus from Brixton to South Kensington,\u201d he says. \u201cBy the time you got to Chelsea, you knew the floor looked the same colour as the day it was paved. There was no litter on the ground. There\u2019s a chapter called \u2018345\u2019 about that.\u201d</p> <p>The identity of #Merky Books is still in its formative stages. The team agree that the only prerequisite is that writers are \u201cfrom under-represented communities\u201d, which includes writers of colour, black writers, queer writers and beyond. It\u2019s telling, then, how the wider publishing industry perceives it.</p> <p>A quick call around a few publishing houses to get their impressions on the new imprint elicits a range of responses, from \u201ca home for young black men\u201d to \u201ca music imprint\u201d, which gets a laugh in the room when I share it. In reality, the sheer breadth of the #Merky roster quietly makes the point about the thrill of diverse writing without labouring the point which should by now be obvious: that universal stories can come from anywhere. Next year, they\u2019re itching to take on science fiction, historical narratives, crime thrillers and short stories.</p> <p>I ask Avery whether things such as Michael Gove\u2019s changes to the GCSE curriculum in 2015, which saw <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> replaced by books which met a more stringent definition of \u201cEnglish\u201d literature, turned young readers off. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think that it wouldn\u2019t have had an impact,\u201d he says. Lindsay-Prince adds: \u201cMy parents are Grenadan and Jamaican and would centre black children\u2019s books in front of me when all I was getting was Biff and Chip. The folklore they put in front of me was the antithesis to the school curriculum.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'I\u2019ve never been in a room where we\u2019re the majority and that feels really important and powerful'</p> <footer> <cite>Lemara Lindsay-Prince</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A 2018 Publishing Association report on workforce diversity in the industry found that just 11.6% of respondents identified as BAME, a decrease on previous years.

He\u2019s living in the UK just trying to understand how he fits in and why his history is important.\u201d The writing is poetic, recalling the cadence of Qawwali devotional songs, which may have been influenced by her years of reading the Qur\u2019an in Arabic.</p> <p><em>Birds of Uganda</em> is perhaps a useful illustration of the direction in which the imprint could go next. For now, they are focusing on crucial points of business: curating an in-house playlist for the team to share in the office and focusing on projects they hope will define the stories of a new decade. Right now, what the books all have in common is that they are inherently political, exploring everything from taking up space to celebrating social housing, and gearing up for a new decade in flux. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of reasons people want to get lost in other worlds,\u201d says Lindsay-Prince, leaning back on her chair. \u201cWe\u2019re giving new readers somewhere to escape to.\u201d</p>",

Households and individuals across the UK are turning their backs on the vulgarity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas\">Christmas</a> consumerism and waste by cutting back on obvious and most visible areas of excess such as unwanted gifts, plastic trees and decorations and unrecyclable wrapping paper.</p> <p>But the scale of our extravagance remains shocking. The <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/how-much-do-we-spend-at-christmas\">Bank of England</a> has calculated that the average UK household will splurge \u00a3800 extra in December on food and drink as well as gifts. Included in this is an average of 17 gifts bought per individual, according to online retailer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a>.</p> <p>And according to a recent <a href=\"https://www.biffa.co.uk/media-centre/news/new-research-shows-brits-are-dreaming-of-a-green-christmas\">study by waste management company Biffa</a>, the UK creates 30% more waste than usual over Christmas. This includes an estimated 227,000 miles of wrapping paper and 1bn cards that end up in the bin. An estimated 20% of gifts \u2013 some 120m items \u2013 will be headed for landfill on Boxing Day, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ukgcva.co.uk/\" title=\"http://www.ukgcva.co.uk/\">UK Gift Card &amp; Voucher Association</a>.</p> <p>To make the most of the festive season without costing the earth, there are numerous other steps consumers can take to reduce their mountain of food waste, opt for the most carbon-efficient cooking, lighting and heating and even trim tedious miles spent on the motorway. The charity Oxfam helped blaze a trail with its range of poverty-busting <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/oxfam-unwrapped?pscid=ps_ggl_Google+-+Fundraising+-+Unwrapped+-+Brand_gift_exact&amp;&amp;pscid=ps_ggl_Google+-+Fundraising+-+Unwrapped+-+Brand_gift_exact&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3fDEqtWU5gIVjLTtCh3c9ADbEAAYASAAEgJCjvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">ethical gifts </a>including the \u201cvirtual goat\u201d. Today, there is greater recognition the value of swapping physical gifts for more meaningful and useful experiences, and even investing time in volunteering.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6decf278c99bfd7374d25ba14d0940213fd226ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6decf278c99bfd7374d25ba14d0940213fd226ba/0_0_600_600/500.jpg\" alt=\"Goat with green Oxfam tag hanging from neck\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oxfam\u2019s \u201cvirtual\u201d goat</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oxfam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Which is more eco-friendly \u2013 a real or an artificial tree?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/real-christmas-trees-are-the-greener-choice\">Fresh trees</a> are the more eco-friendly choice, as long as they are from a sustainable source. There are now well over 400 Christmas tree growers across the UK registered with the <a href=\"http://www.christmastree.org.uk/\">British Christmas Tree Growers\u2019 Association</a>, where trees are grown to guidelines governing sustainable cultivation. Look also for the <a href=\"http://www.fsc-uk.org/en-uk/about-fsc/what-is-fsc\" title=\"Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\">FSC certification </a>logo or <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/\">Soil Association</a> organic certification which means that no pesticides have been used during growing. You could also choose a tree with roots so that it can be replanted and enjoyed year after year.</p> <p>Artificial, plastic trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have less environmental impact than natural alternatives, depending on how they are disposed of. However local charity shops may accept them for resale if they are in good condition.</p> <p>A 2-metre (6.5ft) artificial tree has a carbon footprint equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is burned.</p> <p>Many consumers are also now opting to rent trees \u2013 complete with lights and decorations. Check your local garden centres or plant nursery, which will usually also deliver and collect the tree to save you the hassle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Not%20fir%20sale&amp;description=Marketing%20executive%20Louisa%20Ziane%20will%20be%20%3Cstrong%3Erenting%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20a%20Christmas%20tree%20for%20the%20first%20time%20this%20year%20for%20her%20Walthamstow%20home%2C%20through%20London%20Christmas%20Tree%20Rental.%20It%20will%20cost%20%3Cstrong%3E%C2%A355%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20for%20three%20weeks%2C%20(plus%20%C2%A320%20deposit%20and%20%C2%A320%20delivery%2Fcollection)%20which%20is%20marginally%20cheaper%20than%20she%20would%20normally%20spend%20on%20a%20fresh%20tree.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20taking%20delivery%20of%20it%20on%2013th%20December%20and%20although%20I%20thought%20I%20was%20planning%20well%20ahead%20%E2%80%93%20I%20booked%20it%20on%209th%20November%20-%20but%20already%20there%20were%20only%20a%20few%20delivery%20slots%20left%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Ziane.%20%E2%80%9CI%20look%20forward%20to%20greeting%20it%20in%20my%20original%20%3Cstrong%3E1980s%20Christmas%20jumper%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20that%20I%20found%20on%20eBay%20about%2010%20years%20ago%2C%20and%20then%20trimming%20it%20with%20my%20kids%E2%80%99%20salt%20dough%20decorations.%20We%E2%80%99re%20going%20fully%20green%20this%20year!%E2%80%9D&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Not fir sale\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Not%20fir%20sale&description=Marketing%20executive%20Louisa%20Ziane%20will%20be%20%3Cstrong%3Erenting%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20a%20Christmas%20tree%20for%20the%20first%20time%20this%20year%20for%20her%20Walthamstow%20home%2C%20through%20London%20Christmas%20Tree%20Rental.%20It%20will%20cost%20%3Cstrong%3E%C2%A355%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20for%20three%20weeks%2C%20(plus%20%C2%A320%20deposit%20and%20%C2%A320%20delivery%2Fcollection)%20which%20is%20marginally%20cheaper%20than%20she%20would%20normally%20spend%20on%20a%20fresh%20tree.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20taking%20delivery%20of%20it%20on%2013th%20December%20and%20although%20I%20thought%20I%20was%20planning%20well%20ahead%20%E2%80%93%20I%20booked%20it%20on%209th%20November%20-%20but%20already%20there%20were%20only%20a%20few%20delivery%20slots%20left%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Ziane.%20%E2%80%9CI%20look%20forward%20to%20greeting%20it%20in%20my%20original%20%3Cstrong%3E1980s%20Christmas%20jumper%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20that%20I%20found%20on%20eBay%20about%2010%20years%20ago%2C%20and%20then%20trimming%20it%20with%20my%20kids%E2%80%99%20salt%20dough%20decorations.%20We%E2%80%99re%20going%20fully%20green%20this%20year!%E2%80%9D&link=false\">Not fir sale</a> </figure>  <p>Among alternatives, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose\">Waitrose</a> is selling a 30cm-high \u201cedible\u201d rosemary tree, shaped like its traditional counterpart, which can be used as a decoration or a Christmas table centrepiece. Friends of the Earth suggests that in smaller spaces indoor plants such as yucca or palm trees could be perked up with decorations.</p> <p>An estimated 8m trees decorated homes and offices across Britain last year, of which only 10% were recycled. The rest went into landfill, a wasted opportunity to create biomass that would have provided nutrients for depleted soil. Many local authorities and garden centres will be recycling Christmas trees in January.</p> <h2>What alternative gifts would be better for the planet?</h2> <p>Buy less and buy local. Each Christmas, a staggering 4,000 tonnes of products arrive in the UK by container from China. Presents bought locally means you will be supporting small suppliers and makers, while minimising your carbon footprint. Initiatives such as<a href=\"https://smallbusinesssaturdayuk.com/\"> Small Business Saturday</a> help, but support local retailers at other times too. Through its <a href=\"https://www.hubbub.org.uk/join-airweshare-and-take-action-on-air-pollution\">#AirWeShare campaign</a> the environmental charity Hubbub urges shoppers to consider more environmentally friendly options for online shopping, including switching to a click and collect service to reduce the amount of city centre deliveries.</p> <p>The Carbon Trust says gifts that don\u2019t consume electricity, such as toys and books, tend to have a lower carbon footprint than those that do. Buying good quality toys means they can be passed on to friends, family and charity shops, giving them a second or even a third life.</p> <p>And think whether you have to buy physical gifts? Could you buy an \u201cexperience\u201d instead? Try gift tokens, cinema tickets, museum membership and so on. Sponsor an animal, buy some rainforest to protect, or even have a stab at making your own, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/nov/23/four-edible-christmas-gift-recipes\">foodie gifts</a> such as chutneys and cookies.</p> <p>Emi Murphy, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cChristmas presents don\u2019t need to cost the earth. By shopping around a little you can find unique gifts that support the fight against the climate crisis, keep plastic out of our oceans and boost tree cover.\u201d</p> <h2>Deck the halls with boughs of \u2026 anything eco-friendly?</h2> <p>Choose decorations wisely and keep them to use again. As tinsel can\u2019t be recycled, try to limit how much you buy, and keep what you have to use year on year. Most tinsel sold in the UK is made in China (and of dubious quality), although John Lewis\u2019s is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/09/tinsel-succumbs-to-shrinkflation-as-tesco-cuts-it-down-to-size\">made in a factory in Wales</a> (which churns out 12,000km a year, enough if laid end to end to get from the UK to South Africa).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c9d54b8075aa9685206894228219334a88e53ab0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9d54b8075aa9685206894228219334a88e53ab0/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Studio shot of gift wrapped in newspaper on sparkled background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wrapping paper is one of the most wasted materials at Christmas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates that last year\u2019s wasted paper would be enough to wrap up Guernsey. If we all recycled just half the 8,000 tonnes produced we\u2019d save 25,000 trees.</p> <p>When wrapping steer clear of anything shiny, plastic-lined or decorated with glitter, which are not recyclable. Try the \u201cscrunch\u201d test \u2013 anything that doesn\u2019t hold its shape when scrunched into a ball is not recyclable. Use salvageable materials like newspaper, brown paper, textiles, string, raffia (made from bark which regenerates) and vintage ribbon. Wrapping in newspaper (try the distinctive Eyewitness photo double page spread in the middle of the Guardian which my family has been doing for years) looks better than it sounds. Increasingly popular and Instagrammable is wrapping with brightly coloured fabric \u2013 based on the traditional Japanese art of <a href=\"https://japanobjects.com/features/furoshiki\">furoshiki</a>.</p> <p>Ditch the commercial Christmas crackers which are typically dusted with glitter (containing microplastics) and contain ghastly plastic toys that nobody wants anyway. Make your own (Lakeland and Hobbycraft do handy packs of \u201cfill your own\u201d) and invite your guests to make their own hats.</p> <h2>What\u2019s the best thing to do for homeless people this Christmas?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/01/salvation-army-winter-homeless-rough-sleepers-deaths-warning\">Homelessness</a> has reached epidemic proportions in the UK, where half of the homeless people are in London. Official figures show that at least <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsofhomelesspeopleinenglandandwales/2018\" title=\"\">726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018 </a>\u2013 a 22% increase on the previous year and the largest rise since records began in 2013.</p> <p>Homelessness charities say you can best help by donating directly to them in order to maximise resources. <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/get-involved/donate/\">St Mungo\u2019s</a>, for example, says \u00a325 would pay for a health check, \u00a350 could fund a counselling session or \u00a3100 could buy resources for the charity\u2019s Recovery College.</p> <p>Petra Salva, director of rough sleeper services at St Mungo\u2019s, said: \u201cRough sleeping is harmful and dangerous at any time, [but is] increased when temperatures drop dramatically over times such as Christmas. I would encourage people to contact StreetLink to help connect someone with their local service as soon as possible. Giving money and food is a personal choice; we would encourage people to contact charities like St Mungo\u2019s to see how they can help people in the long term.\u201d</p> <h2>Where can I volunteer?</h2> <p>Check out whether local charities, old people\u2019s homes, homeless shelters and food banks could do with a spare pair of hands. <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/volunteer/\">The Trussell Trust</a> welcomes <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/volunteer/\">volunteers</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/21/christmas-food-bank-newcastle\">over Christmas</a> for its 1,200-strong network of food banks across the UK, to help hand out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/more-people-than-ever-turning-to-food-banks-charity-says\">a record number</a> of emergency food parcels.</p> <p>The national food redistribution charity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/22/fareshares-surplus-food-redistribution-saves-uk-economy-51m-a-year\">FareShare </a>seeks volunteers at its depots across the UK to help sort food donated by supermarkets and to drive it to recipients such as charities and community projects serving up meals.</p> <p>You can also help FareShare by choosing a green token through its Community Matters \u201cgreen token\u201d scheme on Waitrose.com over Christmas. A similar scheme is FoodCycle, which <a href=\"http://volunteer.foodcycle.org.uk/\">welcomes volunteers</a> for its 34 projects across the UK.</p> <p>Loneliness is always an issue at Christmas. You can volunteer or donate to Age UK, which says there are 1.4 million \u201cchronically lonely\u201d older people in England alone.</p> <h2>What can I do to reduce my carbon footprint in the kitchen?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"94eca037ce0e326c2c6d07179b093c0dbadb5f8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94eca037ce0e326c2c6d07179b093c0dbadb5f8c/0_356_3834_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roast turkey with trimmings on white platter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you are stuck when choosing what to cook, the Carbon Trust points out that turkey has a lower carbon footprint than beef, while vegetarian and vegan options are even lower than that. If you can\u2019t steer clear of red meat make sure it\u2019s British. Don\u2019t overdo the cheeseboard, which has a high carbon footprint. Don\u2019t preheat the oven for too long, or leave it on after the meal is prepared to keep food heated.</p> <p>And eat up those leftovers.</p> <h2>What about plastics?</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard but not impossible to have a plastics-free Christmas. Food packaging is tricky, but supermarket chain Iceland is offering customers the choice of a plastic-free or reduced plastic packaging Christmas dinner this year. It is selling 18 Christmas products that are completely free from plastic packaging, including stuffing balls and black forest layered pavlova. Selfridges is removing plastic packaging from its own brand range of Christmas food, switching to home compostable alternatives for 90,000 mince pies and 3,000 Christmas cakes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Waste%20potatoes&amp;description=Waste%20management%20company%20Biffa%20says%20that%2C%20staggeringly%2C%20%3Cstrong%3E2m%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20turkeys%2C%20%3Cstrong%3E74m%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20mince%20pies%20and%20%3Cstrong%3E17.2m%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20sprouts%20are%20thrown%20away%20every%20Christmas.%20The%20Love%20Food%20Hate%20Waste%20campaign%20(run%20by%20the%20Government%E2%80%99s%20waste%20advisory%20body%20Wrap)%20claims%20enough%20potatoes%20are%20thrown%20away%20in%20UK%20homes%20each%20year%20to%20make%20roast%20potatoes%20on%20Christmas%20Day%20for%20the%20whole%20country%20for%20%3Cstrong%3E48%20years%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20It%20offers%20a%20series%20of%20handy%20tips%20to%20reduce%20waste%20through%20forward%20planning%2C%20portion%20control%2C%20better%20use%20of%20the%20freezer%20and%20recipes%20to%20use%20up%20leftovers.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Waste potatoes\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Waste%20potatoes&description=Waste%20management%20company%20Biffa%20says%20that%2C%20staggeringly%2C%20%3Cstrong%3E2m%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20turkeys%2C%20%3Cstrong%3E74m%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20mince%20pies%20and%20%3Cstrong%3E17.2m%3C%2Fstrong%3E%20sprouts%20are%20thrown%20away%20every%20Christmas.%20The%20Love%20Food%20Hate%20Waste%20campaign%20(run%20by%20the%20Government%E2%80%99s%20waste%20advisory%20body%20Wrap)%20claims%20enough%20potatoes%20are%20thrown%20away%20in%20UK%20homes%20each%20year%20to%20make%20roast%20potatoes%20on%20Christmas%20Day%20for%20the%20whole%20country%20for%20%3Cstrong%3E48%20years%3C%2Fstrong%3E.%20It%20offers%20a%20series%20of%20handy%20tips%20to%20reduce%20waste%20through%20forward%20planning%2C%20portion%20control%2C%20better%20use%20of%20the%20freezer%20and%20recipes%20to%20use%20up%20leftovers.&link=false\">Waste potatoes</a> </figure>  <p>Dispense with plastic cling film by using reusable beeswax-covered cotton cloths, available from <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/bee%27s-wrap-assorted-wrap/703540-675903-675904?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4bH2gIKV5gIVTLTtCh16UgqKEAQYAyABEgL3dfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Waitrose</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lakeland.co.uk/73477/Bee%E2%80%99s-Wrap-Assorted-Reusable-Food-Wraps---Pack-of-3?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4bH2gIKV5gIVTLTtCh16UgqKEAQYASABEgLiu_D_BwE&amp;src=gfeed&amp;ev_chn=shop&amp;s_kwcid=AL!49!3!335395499734!!!g!299024532955!&amp;ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI4bH2gIKV5gIVTLTtCh16UgqKEAQYASABEgLiu_D_BwE:G:s\">Lakeland</a>. And make you sure you recycle aluminium \u2013 popular as mince pie wrappers \u2013 correctly. A new campaign from the Co-op chain aims to stop tonnes of aluminium \u2013 including mince pie wrappers, from being dumped into landfill. Its research shows that more than one in five (22%) of UK adults do not recycle household aluminium and that more than 3,000 tonnes could end up in the general household waste.</p> <h2>How can I reduce my travel?</h2> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people will be criss-crossing the UK over the holiday, driving significant distances to visit family and friends \u2013 what some environmentalists refer to as \u201clove miles\u201d<em> \u2013</em> adding to greenhouse gases and congestion. Avoid air travel if at all possible.</p> <p>Where a large number of people are travelling, the Carbon Trust advises people to check to see whether they can share a car or take public transport (though the railways are not for the faint-hearted at this time of year). Use car sharing websites and apps such as <a href=\"https://liftshare.com/uk\">Liftshare</a> and <a href=\"https://gocarshare.com/\">GoCarShare</a> \u2013 sharing a journey means a lower carbon footprint for each passenger, less traffic on the roads, splitting fuel costs and hopefully enjoying some company. It urges people to consider a Skype chat rather than a visit.</p> <h2>Can I offset my Christmas?</h2> <p>Everything seems to be carbon-offsettable these days (you can even offset fake news now by paying to support its antidote \u2013 Guardian journalism). Offsetting Christmas is slightly harder (despite what companies offering opportunities to do so might say). With tree planting all the range now, you could forgo the palaver of getting a Christmas fir and <a href=\"https://shop.woodlandtrust.org.uk/dedications?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI38Cks9OU5gIVirHtCh1VuAluEAAYASABEgKZ5PD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">dedicate a tree</a> to a loved one \u2013 it\u2019ll offset some carbon emissions, too.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2> Reading list</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/22/in-brief-reviews-turning-tide-on-plastic-long-island-story-life-of-my-own\">Turning the Tide on Plastic</a> by Lucy Siegle</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/jack-monroe/vegan-ish/9781529005080\">Veganish</a> by Jack Monroe</strong></p></li> </ul> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>Useful blogs</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://friendsoftheearth.uk/lifestyle/21-ecofriendly-christmas-tips?utm_source=press&amp;utm_medium=offline&amp;utm_campaign=fundraising&amp;utm_content=FY1920-11_21-eco-xmas-tips\">21 eco-friendly Christmas tips</a> from Friends of the Earth</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.recyclenow.com/news/2019-10-23-plan-less-wasteful-christmas\">Plan for a less wasteful Christmas</a> from Recycle Now</strong> </p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sustainabilityexchange.ac.uk/files/sustainable_christmas_ideas_from_the_sra.pdf\">The Sustainable Christmas Guide</a> from the Sustainable Restaurant Association </strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.soilassociation.org/organic-living/organic-christmas/gift-guides/\">Organic Gift Guides</a> from the Soil Association </strong></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Are you dreaming of a green Christmas? Households and individuals across the UK are turning their backs on the vulgarity of Christmas consumerism and waste by cutting back on obvious and most visible areas of excess such as unwanted gifts, plastic trees and decorations and unrecyclable wrapping paper. But the scale of our extravagance remains shocking. The Bank of England has calculated that the average UK household will splurge \u00a3800 extra in December on food and drink as well as gifts. Included in this is an average of 17 gifts bought per individual, according to online retailer Amazon. And according to a recent study by waste management company Biffa, the UK creates 30% more waste than usual over Christmas. This includes an estimated 227,000 miles of wrapping paper and 1bn cards that end up in the bin. An estimated 20% of gifts \u2013 some 120m items \u2013 will be headed for landfill on Boxing Day, according to the UK Gift Card &amp; Voucher Association. To make the most of the festive season without costing the earth, there are numerous other steps consumers can take to reduce their mountain of food waste, opt for the most carbon-efficient cooking, lighting and heating and even trim tedious miles spent on the motorway. The charity Oxfam helped blaze a trail with its range of poverty-busting ethical gifts including the \u201cvirtual goat\u201d. Today, there is greater recognition the value of swapping physical gifts for more meaningful and useful experiences, and even investing time in volunteering. Which is more eco-friendly \u2013 a real or an artificial tree? Fresh trees are the more eco-friendly choice, as long as they are from a sustainable source. There are now well over 400 Christmas tree growers across the UK registered with the British Christmas Tree Growers\u2019 Association, where trees are grown to guidelines governing sustainable cultivation. Look also for the FSC certification logo or Soil Association organic certification which means that no pesticides have been used during growing. You could also choose a tree with roots so that it can be replanted and enjoyed year after year. Artificial, plastic trees need to be used for up to nine years in order to have less environmental impact than natural alternatives, depending on how they are disposed of. However local charity shops may accept them for resale if they are in good condition. A 2-metre (6.5ft) artificial tree has a carbon footprint equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is burned. Many consumers are also now opting to rent trees \u2013 complete with lights and decorations. Check your local garden centres or plant nursery, which will usually also deliver and collect the tree to save you the hassle. Among alternatives, Waitrose is selling a 30cm-high \u201cedible\u201d rosemary tree, shaped like its traditional counterpart, which can be used as a decoration or a Christmas table centrepiece. Friends of the Earth suggests that in smaller spaces indoor plants such as yucca or palm trees could be perked up with decorations. An estimated 8m trees decorated homes and offices across Britain last year, of which only 10% were recycled. The rest went into landfill, a wasted opportunity to create biomass that would have provided nutrients for depleted soil. Many local authorities and garden centres will be recycling Christmas trees in January. What alternative gifts would be better for the planet? Buy less and buy local. Each Christmas, a staggering 4,000 tonnes of products arrive in the UK by container from China. Presents bought locally means you will be supporting small suppliers and makers, while minimising your carbon footprint. Initiatives such as Small Business Saturday help, but support local retailers at other times too. Through its #AirWeShare campaign the environmental charity Hubbub urges shoppers to consider more environmentally friendly options for online shopping, including switching to a click and collect service to reduce the amount of city centre deliveries. The Carbon Trust says gifts that don\u2019t consume electricity, such as toys and books, tend to have a lower carbon footprint than those that do. Buying good quality toys means they can be passed on to friends, family and charity shops, giving them a second or even a third life. And think whether you have to buy physical gifts? Could you buy an \u201cexperience\u201d instead? Try gift tokens, cinema tickets, museum membership and so on. Sponsor an animal, buy some rainforest to protect, or even have a stab at making your own, including foodie gifts such as chutneys and cookies. Emi Murphy, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cChristmas presents don\u2019t need to cost the earth. By shopping around a little you can find unique gifts that support the fight against the climate crisis, keep plastic out of our oceans and boost tree cover.\u201d Deck the halls with boughs of \u2026 anything eco-friendly? Choose decorations wisely and keep them to use again. As tinsel can\u2019t be recycled, try to limit how much you buy, and keep what you have to use year on year. Most tinsel sold in the UK is made in China (and of dubious quality), although John Lewis\u2019s is made in a factory in Wales (which churns out 12,000km a year, enough if laid end to end to get from the UK to South Africa). Wrapping paper is one of the most wasted materials at Christmas. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates that last year\u2019s wasted paper would be enough to wrap up Guernsey. If we all recycled just half the 8,000 tonnes produced we\u2019d save 25,000 trees. When wrapping steer clear of anything shiny, plastic-lined or decorated with glitter, which are not recyclable. Try the \u201cscrunch\u201d test \u2013 anything that doesn\u2019t hold its shape when scrunched into a ball is not recyclable. Use salvageable materials like newspaper, brown paper, textiles, string, raffia (made from bark which regenerates) and vintage ribbon. Wrapping in newspaper (try the distinctive Eyewitness photo double page spread in the middle of the Guardian which my family has been doing for years) looks better than it sounds. Increasingly popular and Instagrammable is wrapping with brightly coloured fabric \u2013 based on the traditional Japanese art of furoshiki. Ditch the commercial Christmas crackers which are typically dusted with glitter (containing microplastics) and contain ghastly plastic toys that nobody wants anyway. Make your own (Lakeland and Hobbycraft do handy packs of \u201cfill your own\u201d) and invite your guests to make their own hats. What\u2019s the best thing to do for homeless people this Christmas? Homelessness has reached epidemic proportions in the UK, where half of the homeless people are in London. Official figures show that at least 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018 \u2013 a 22% increase on the previous year and the largest rise since records began in 2013. Homelessness charities say you can best help by donating directly to them in order to maximise resources. St Mungo\u2019s, for example, says \u00a325 would pay for a health check, \u00a350 could fund a counselling session or \u00a3100 could buy resources for the charity\u2019s Recovery College. Petra Salva, director of rough sleeper services at St Mungo\u2019s, said: \u201cRough sleeping is harmful and dangerous at any time, [but is] increased when temperatures drop dramatically over times such as Christmas. I would encourage people to contact StreetLink to help connect someone with their local service as soon as possible. Giving money and food is a personal choice; we would encourage people to contact charities like St Mungo\u2019s to see how they can help people in the long term.\u201d Where can I volunteer? Check out whether local charities, old people\u2019s homes, homeless shelters and food banks could do with a spare pair of hands. The Trussell Trust welcomes volunteers over Christmas for its 1,200-strong network of food banks across the UK, to help hand out a record number of emergency food parcels. The national food redistribution charity FareShare seeks volunteers at its depots across the UK to help sort food donated by supermarkets and to drive it to recipients such as charities and community projects serving up meals. You can also help FareShare by choosing a green token through its Community Matters \u201cgreen token\u201d scheme on Waitrose.com over Christmas. A similar scheme is FoodCycle, which welcomes volunteers for its 34 projects across the UK. Loneliness is always an issue at Christmas. You can volunteer or donate to Age UK, which says there are 1.4 million \u201cchronically lonely\u201d older people in England alone. What can I do to reduce my carbon footprint in the kitchen? If you are stuck when choosing what to cook, the Carbon Trust points out that turkey has a lower carbon footprint than beef, while vegetarian and vegan options are even lower than that. If you can\u2019t steer clear of red meat make sure it\u2019s British. Don\u2019t overdo the cheeseboard, which has a high carbon footprint. Don\u2019t preheat the oven for too long, or leave it on after the meal is prepared to keep food heated. And eat up those leftovers. What about plastics? It\u2019s hard but not impossible to have a plastics-free Christmas. Food packaging is tricky, but supermarket chain Iceland is offering customers the choice of a plastic-free or reduced plastic packaging Christmas dinner this year. It is selling 18 Christmas products that are completely free from plastic packaging, including stuffing balls and black forest layered pavlova. Selfridges is removing plastic packaging from its own brand range of Christmas food, switching to home compostable alternatives for 90,000 mince pies and 3,000 Christmas cakes. Dispense with plastic cling film by using reusable beeswax-covered cotton cloths, available from Waitrose and Lakeland. And make you sure you recycle aluminium \u2013 popular as mince pie wrappers \u2013 correctly. A new campaign from the Co-op chain aims to stop tonnes of aluminium \u2013 including mince pie wrappers, from being dumped into landfill. Its research shows that more than one in five (22%) of UK adults do not recycle household aluminium and that more than 3,000 tonnes could end up in the general household waste. How can I reduce my travel? Hundreds of thousands of people will be criss-crossing the UK over the holiday, driving significant distances to visit family and friends \u2013 what some environmentalists refer to as \u201clove miles\u201d \u2013 adding to greenhouse gases and congestion. Avoid air travel if at all possible. Where a large number of people are travelling, the Carbon Trust advises people to check to see whether they can share a car or take public transport (though the railways are not for the faint-hearted at this time of year). Use car sharing websites and apps such as Liftshare and GoCarShare \u2013 sharing a journey means a lower carbon footprint for each passenger, less traffic on the roads, splitting fuel costs and hopefully enjoying some company. It urges people to consider a Skype chat rather than a visit. Can I offset my Christmas? Everything seems to be carbon-offsettable these days (you can even offset fake news now by paying to support its antidote \u2013 Guardian journalism). Offsetting Christmas is slightly harder (despite what companies offering opportunities to do so might say). With tree planting all the range now, you could forgo the palaver of getting a Christmas fir and dedicate a tree to a loved one \u2013 it\u2019ll offset some carbon emissions, too. * * * Reading list Turning the Tide on Plastic by Lucy Siegle Veganish by Jack Monroe * * * Useful blogs 21 eco-friendly Christmas tips from Friends of the Earth Plan for a less wasteful Christmas from Recycle Now The Sustainable Christmas Guide from the Sustainable Restaurant Association Organic Gift Guides from the Soil Association",

Two of her new works, Sirens and the viscerally unsettling slideshow Memory Lost, draw deeply on lived experience.

Best known for his war photography, the show reminded us of the wealth of other defining documentary images from closer to home: post-war working class life in London\u2019s East End, the declining landscapes of the industrial north, poverty and homeless in the capital. Comprising over 250 photographs, all hand-printed by McCullin in his darkroom, it was a celebration of, and an elegy for, a time when photojournalism and documentary photography indelibly shaped our view of the world. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/04/don-mccullin-tate-retrospective-review\">Read the full review.</a></p> <h2><strong>6</strong></h2> <h2>Alys Tomlinson: The Faithful</h2> <p><strong>Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles<br></strong>On the back of her acclaimed first book, <a href=\"http://www.alystomlinson.co.uk/personal/ex-voto/\">Ex</a><a href=\"http://www.alystomlinson.co.uk/personal/ex-voto/\">-Voto</a>, which merged landscapes of contemporary sites of religious pilgrimage with starkly haunting portraits of latter-day pilgrims, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/apr/04/alys-tomlinson-best-photograph-volunteer-pilgrimage-lourdes\">the young English artist</a> won the Audience Award at Arles for <a href=\"https://www.rencontres-arles.com/en/expositions/view/837/alys-tomlinson\">The Faithful</a>. Here, the central subject of stark monochrome prints and a quietly compelling film was a young Orthodox nun named Vera, who works with captive wild horses in a convent in rural Belarus. The end result was another austere and affecting exploration of contemporary religious devotion.</p> <h2><strong>5</strong></h2> <h2>Peter Hujar: Speed of Life</h2> <p><strong>Jeu de Paume, Paris<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/oct/14/peter-hujar-photography-new-york\">Peter Hujar</a>\u2019s reputation has risen steadily since his death in 1987, his often deftly composed portraits possessed of an acutely intimate undertow. Hujar came of age in the downtown art scene in New York, his creative life bookended by two defining cultural moments: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/19/stonewall-50th-anniversary-night-that-unleashed-gay-liberation\">Stonewall riots</a> in 1969 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/21/there-was-a-lot-of-panic-behind-the-first-movies-to-tackle-the-aids-crisis\">Aids crisis</a> of the 1980s. He once described his approach as \u201cuncomplicated, direct photographs of complicated and difficult subjects\u201d.

Around two thirds of the 100 plus prints on view had not been seen before in the UK; what they revealed was a precocious talent for the eccentric and the perverse, whether tattooed strong men, circus performers, self-styled outsiders or passing strangers.

In that most exuberant of decades, the 60s, Heath emerged almost unseen as a master of solitude and introspection. His images, as <a href=\"https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibition/dave-heath-dialogues-solitudes\">this deftly-curated exhibition</a> highlighted, instil a thoughtful silence in the space around them.

Jarcovj\u00e1kov\u00e1\u2019s diaristic approach brilliantly captures the low rent hedonism and self destructiveness of a semi-clandestine bohemian milieu. But there is something energetic, even joyful, in her laying bare of her own reckless life. Often, she is her own subject, the captions a kind of defiantly nihilist manifesto: \u201cI understand nothing and don\u2019t care. Life is pelting along too fast to understand. I\u2019m rarely sober.\u201d Elsewhere, she shot on the nocturnal streets and in dive bars, parties and scuzzy bedrooms, capturing the long nights and hungover days of a repressive, and thus doggedly dissolute, time in her homeland. Uncompromising and grittily poetic, <a href=\"https://un-titled.org/exhibitions/libuse-jarcovjakova-evokativ\">Evokativ</a> took me by complete surprise and stayed with me for days afterwards.</p>",

It was an immersive experience that threatened to overwhelm, but, once surrendered to, unfolded to its visceral soundtrack at a furious pace. Looming figures flitted across the viewer\u2019s vision in constantly unfolding juxtapositions, making Doyle\u2019s native city seem more Ballardian than Joycean. 9 Nan Goldin: Sirens Marian Goodman, London A long-awaited major London show for Nan Goldin, her first since the Whitechapel Gallery retrospective in 2002, Sirens is shadowed by her recent addiction to Oxycontin and the direct action anti-Sackler activism she has embraced since her recovery. Two of her new works, Sirens and the viscerally unsettling slideshow Memory Lost, draw deeply on lived experience. The latter in particular uses her signature diaristic approach to explore memory, mourning, death and dislocation. Tough, heartbreaking and utterly compelling. On until 11 January. Read the full review. 8 Dora Maar Tate Modern, London An ambitious, sprawling and constantly surprising retrospective of an artist too long considered in the reflective light of Pablo Picasso, with whom she had a turbulent relationship. Her career began in earnest in 1932, when Henriette Markovitch, painter, became Dora Maar, photographer. The creative trajectory that followed took her from fashion to portraiture to street photography and on into surrealist-inspired experiments in photomontage and camera-less photography. An expansive portrait of a restless spirit. On until 15 March. Read the full review. 7 Don McCullin Tate Britain, London Britain\u2019s most famous living photographer drew the crowds to Tate Britain for this expansive retrospective, drawn from an archive that stretches back 60 years. Best known for his war photography, the show reminded us of the wealth of other defining documentary images from closer to home: post-war working class life in London\u2019s East End, the declining landscapes of the industrial north, poverty and homeless in the capital. Comprising over 250 photographs, all hand-printed by McCullin in his darkroom, it was a celebration of, and an elegy for, a time when photojournalism and documentary photography indelibly shaped our view of the world. Read the full review. 6 Alys Tomlinson: The Faithful Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles On the back of her acclaimed first book, Ex-Voto, which merged landscapes of contemporary sites of religious pilgrimage with starkly haunting portraits of latter-day pilgrims, the young English artist won the Audience Award at Arles for The Faithful. Here, the central subject of stark monochrome prints and a quietly compelling film was a young Orthodox nun named Vera, who works with captive wild horses in a convent in rural Belarus. The end result was another austere and affecting exploration of contemporary religious devotion. 5 Peter Hujar: Speed of Life Jeu de Paume, Paris Peter Hujar\u2019s reputation has risen steadily since his death in 1987, his often deftly composed portraits possessed of an acutely intimate undertow. Hujar came of age in the downtown art scene in New York, his creative life bookended by two defining cultural moments: the Stonewall riots in 1969 and the Aids crisis of the 1980s. He once described his approach as \u201cuncomplicated, direct photographs of complicated and difficult subjects\u201d. They include avant-garde artists, gay activists, intellectuals and drag queens; among the most celebrated are a reclining Susan Sontag and, posing languorously on her deathbed, Warhol superstar Candy Darling. On until 19 January. 4 Diane Arbus: In the Beginning Hayward Gallery, London Devoted to the formative years in which Diane Arbus honed her dark vision, In the Beginning showed how her sensibility and signature style \u2013 a crucial shift from 35mm to square format \u2013 took shape on the streets of New York. Around two thirds of the 100 plus prints on view had not been seen before in the UK; what they revealed was a precocious talent for the eccentric and the perverse, whether tattooed strong men, circus performers, self-styled outsiders or passing strangers. Still unsettling, still singular. Read the full review. 3 Dave Heath: Dialogues With Solitude The Photographers\u2019 Gallery, London For all their quiet stillness, Dave Heath\u2019s portraits possess an intensity that is by turns melancholic and unsettling. In that most exuberant of decades, the 60s, Heath emerged almost unseen as a master of solitude and introspection. His images, as this deftly-curated exhibition highlighted, instil a thoughtful silence in the space around them. An illuminating survey of a quiet American photographer who was a master of mood and sequence. 2 Cindy Sherman National Portrait Gallery, London A long overdue British retrospective showed the full range of Sherman\u2019s work, from the iconic early series Untitled Film Stills (1977-80) to the more elaborately constructed Sex Pictures, which still shock in terms of their sheer grotesquery. She is a conceptual shapeshifter, whose one brilliant idea \u2013 turning the camera on her transformed self in order to exaggerate and illuminate myriad female archetypes \u2013 is one of the most fascinating creative journeys of our time. Read the full review. 1 Libu\u0161e Jarcovj\u00e1kov\u00e1: Evokativ Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles In the 1970s and 80s, self-taught Czech photographer Libu\u0161e Jarcovj\u00e1kov\u00e1 relentlessly chronicled her wild life during a time of political repression. The results, shot in edgy monochrome, were one of the revelations of this year\u2019s Arles\u2019 photo festival. Jarcovj\u00e1kov\u00e1\u2019s diaristic approach brilliantly captures the low rent hedonism and self destructiveness of a semi-clandestine bohemian milieu. But there is something energetic, even joyful, in her laying bare of her own reckless life. Often, she is her own subject, the captions a kind of defiantly nihilist manifesto: \u201cI understand nothing and don\u2019t care. Life is pelting along too fast to understand. I\u2019m rarely sober.\u201d Elsewhere, she shot on the nocturnal streets and in dive bars, parties and scuzzy bedrooms, capturing the long nights and hungover days of a repressive, and thus doggedly dissolute, time in her homeland. Uncompromising and grittily poetic, Evokativ took me by complete surprise and stayed with me for days afterwards.",

Yet, despite the fact that he had such a pedigree, literary critics of the time couldn\u2019t help feeling that Eliot, who was not only the author of <em>Practical Cats</em> but, by virtue of his job at Faber, its publisher, too, had misjudged the nation\u2019s mood.

It\u2019s now held by a republican whose father was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries with the help of state forces, an event that even David Cameron was forced to admit involved \u201cshocking levels of collusion\u201d. Which brings us to the national question. In July, I wrote that a progressive, united Ireland was more likely than ever due to Foster\u2019s incompetence, and now the north has shifted towards marriage equality and reproductive rights, and has a majority of nationalist MPs \u2013 all for the first time in its history. This election also delivered a resounding majority of remain parties, thanks to an election fought away from the fantasyland of false conviction offered across the water and rooted in the real world of direct threats to the Northern Irish way of life, and life in general. People for whom the border is harder to lie about because they themselves lie upon it. With a mandate for a Scottish independence vote now delivered for the SNP, the north now faces a credible prospect of its own unity poll, and perhaps even the first sense that conditions could coalesce to make that long-sung song a political reality. Local reporters spent most of Friday giving their reports of this bewildering news, during the blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-them segments the UK typically allots to Northern Ireland\u2019s results. These were uniformly in front of the Titanic Museum, that giant, impressive monument to what was, until election night, the world\u2019s most salutary lesson in Northern Irish hubris. When the Museum Of DUP Utter Self-Annihilation is eventually erected in its place, perhaps they\u2019ll be charging euros on the door. \u2022 S\u00e9amas O\u2019Reilly is a writer from Derry.

      "body": "<p><strong>Q</strong> My partner and I both own our own homes but we\u2019re planning to move in together soon. Our plan is for me to sell my house, then move in with my partner at her house. Shortly afterwards she would sell her house and we will then buy a new house together. This is to avoid setting up a complicated chain which will make it difficult to complete a purchase.</p> <p>My house is worth around \u00a3140,000 and I have a mortgage balance of around \u00a390,000. Her house is worth around \u00a3110,000 and she has a mortgage balance of \u00a350,000.</p> <p>The problem is, I have four years left on my fixed-rate mortgage and so will have to pay an early repayment charge of \u00a34,000 if I sell up now. She only has one year left on her fixed-rate mortgage and would only have to pay a fee of \u00a3500. So it would be better financially for her to sell first and for me to sell next and then port my mortgage to the new joint property which won\u2019t cost me anything. However, for various reasons, that\u2019s not a practical option.</p> <p>So it occurred to me that I could buy my partner\u2019s house from her when I sell mine. That way I could port my mortgage to her house, then port my mortgage to the new house after that, avoiding my early repayment charge both times. Does this plan make sense and save us money? Are there any pitfalls I have missed? I haven\u2019t been able to find any good advice on this because mortgage advisers just want to sell you a mortgage. <strong>RL</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> It is certainly a cunning plan but whether it\u2019s a plan that makes sense is largely down to your lender\u2019s view. \u201cPorting\u201d your mortgage means taking out a new \u2013 but same-sized \u2013 mortgage on a different property but keeping the same lender, interest rate and terms and conditions as you currently have. As you are abundantly aware, the main reason for porting a mortgage is to avoid paying early repayment charges which typically apply if you pay off your mortgage before a fixed-rate or discounted period is over.</p> <p>Being able to port your mortgage to a new property is not automatic, however. You will need to go through the mortgage application process using the details of the property you intend to move to \u2013 in your case, your partner\u2019s house. Your lender will assess your application using its current lending criteria \u2013 which may have changed since your original mortgage application, as may your personal circumstance \u2013 so your lender could turn you down.</p> <p>So before you do anything, it would be a good idea to have a chat with your lender about how likely you are to qualify to port your mortgage. For example, your lender may not be happy that your outstanding loan of \u00a390,000 represents a loan to value (LTV) of just over 80% of your partner\u2019s property which is a more risky proposition than the 64% LTV on your house. When you come to apply to port the mortgage for a second time, your lender may take a dim view if the application happens only a short time after the first.</p> <p>If your lender does allow you to port your mortgage, you need to be aware that it won\u2019t cost nothing because you\u2019ll be expected to pay a fee for your lender\u2019s valuation of your new property. You also need to know that if you want a mortgage bigger than \u00a390,000 when you come to buy your joint home, you won\u2019t necessarily get the same interest rate as now and any top-up loan could be at a much less favourable rate. So that\u2019s something you might also want to chat to your lender about.</p> <ul> <li><p>Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

      "bodyText": "Q My partner and I both own our own homes but we\u2019re planning to move in together soon. Our plan is for me to sell my house, then move in with my partner at her house. Shortly afterwards she would sell her house and we will then buy a new house together. This is to avoid setting up a complicated chain which will make it difficult to complete a purchase. My house is worth around \u00a3140,000 and I have a mortgage balance of around \u00a390,000. Her house is worth around \u00a3110,000 and she has a mortgage balance of \u00a350,000. The problem is, I have four years left on my fixed-rate mortgage and so will have to pay an early repayment charge of \u00a34,000 if I sell up now. She only has one year left on her fixed-rate mortgage and would only have to pay a fee of \u00a3500. So it would be better financially for her to sell first and for me to sell next and then port my mortgage to the new joint property which won\u2019t cost me anything. However, for various reasons, that\u2019s not a practical option. So it occurred to me that I could buy my partner\u2019s house from her when I sell mine. That way I could port my mortgage to her house, then port my mortgage to the new house after that, avoiding my early repayment charge both times. Does this plan make sense and save us money? Are there any pitfalls I have missed? I haven\u2019t been able to find any good advice on this because mortgage advisers just want to sell you a mortgage. RL A It is certainly a cunning plan but whether it\u2019s a plan that makes sense is largely down to your lender\u2019s view. \u201cPorting\u201d your mortgage means taking out a new \u2013 but same-sized \u2013 mortgage on a different property but keeping the same lender, interest rate and terms and conditions as you currently have. As you are abundantly aware, the main reason for porting a mortgage is to avoid paying early repayment charges which typically apply if you pay off your mortgage before a fixed-rate or discounted period is over. Being able to port your mortgage to a new property is not automatic, however. You will need to go through the mortgage application process using the details of the property you intend to move to \u2013 in your case, your partner\u2019s house. Your lender will assess your application using its current lending criteria \u2013 which may have changed since your original mortgage application, as may your personal circumstance \u2013 so your lender could turn you down. So before you do anything, it would be a good idea to have a chat with your lender about how likely you are to qualify to port your mortgage. For example, your lender may not be happy that your outstanding loan of \u00a390,000 represents a loan to value (LTV) of just over 80% of your partner\u2019s property which is a more risky proposition than the 64% LTV on your house. When you come to apply to port the mortgage for a second time, your lender may take a dim view if the application happens only a short time after the first. If your lender does allow you to port your mortgage, you need to be aware that it won\u2019t cost nothing because you\u2019ll be expected to pay a fee for your lender\u2019s valuation of your new property. You also need to know that if you want a mortgage bigger than \u00a390,000 when you come to buy your joint home, you won\u2019t necessarily get the same interest rate as now and any top-up loan could be at a much less favourable rate. So that\u2019s something you might also want to chat to your lender about. Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

That was just one of the surprises from this year\u2019s Strictly; a year that has been blessedly light on tabloid scandal, but packed with great dancing and plenty of laughs to see us through what has felt like a VERY long autumn. Here are my top 10 Strictly moments. Feel free to share yours in the comments below.</p> <h2>1. Saffron\u2019s waltz</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ssp2br1-Og\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3ssp2br1-Og?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Back in the old days the waltz was a classic dance our Strictly couples did early on, but now it gets lost in the madness of couple\u2019s choice and sometimes isn\u2019t performed at all (I\u2019m looking at you, Karim and Amy). This heartfelt routine from Saffron and AJ in week eight was beautiful \u2013 my favourite waltz of the series, and Saffron\u2019s ticket to Blackpool.</p> <h2>2 Kelvin and Oti\u2019s rumba</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzhTNpu21U0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BzhTNpu21U0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The rumba isn\u2019t usually a high point of Strictly \u2013 they\u2019re hard to master and require a level of chemistry few couples can pull off without making tabloid headlines. Most couples avoid it like the plague, but this one from Kelvin and Oti was a perfect blend of sensitivity, masculinity, storytelling and down-and-dirty hip action.</p> <h2>3 Strictly\u2019s pros slay the red carpet</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYSFo-YBaQM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tYSFo-YBaQM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Strictly pros have put on some showstopping numbers over the years, but this high fashion-themed dance from week five was one of the greatest ever. Everything about it is classy and fabulous, from Oti\u2019s sparkly catsuit to Johannes slaying the red carpet in killer heels. An absolute treat.</p> <h2>4 Craig comments on Anton\u2019s \u2018fake teeth\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbcstrictly/status/1180574799271063552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83e\udd23The teeth are real.

What\u2019s wonderful about it, however, is the sheer determination on Alex\u2019s face throughout \u2013 she\u2019s learned this dance, and she\u2019s doing it no matter what.</p> <h2>7 Emma and Anton\u2019s American smooth</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1IQl8vZf0Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y1IQl8vZf0Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Blackpool special always offers up a few treats, and this gorgeous American smooth was no exception.

      "body": "<h2>District life</h2> <p>Vienna is divided into 23 districts (<em>Bezirke</em>), each distinct in reputation and purpose. The old town, officially the Innere Stadt (1st district, with St Stephen\u2019s cathedral at its heart), is surrounded by the Ringstrasse, a splendid boulevard begun in the 1850s and not quite finished by the time the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed in 1918. Beyond the Ring lie districts two to nine, which are in turn surrounded by a much larger ring road, the <em>G\u00fcrtel </em>(belt). The Viennese often prefer to shop, drink and eat in their own district or a neighbouring one than venture into the centre. In winter, I advise huddling in the cosy bars and cafes of the 4th district (especially around Schleifm\u00fchlgasse), or the streets either side of the Mariahilferstrasse, the city\u2019s unremarkable shopping drag. In recent years, Leopoldstadt (2nd district and traditionally the Jewish part of town) has happily re-emerged, and is also replete with warm and atmospheric cafes, bars, restaurants and clubs.</p> <h2>Brilliant museums</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66514052b8c45d90ea2421e8c51dd458fa1c92ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66514052b8c45d90ea2421e8c51dd458fa1c92ff/0_1580_5661_3396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leopold Museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leopold Museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Massimo Borchi/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vienna has a vast array of museums, including institutions dedicated to shoes, condoms, Esperanto and sanitation. Personal favourites include the <strong><a href=\"https://www.leopoldmuseum.org/en/visit/opening-hours\" title=\"\">Leopold Museum</a></strong> (\u20ac14/\u20ac10), which houses the largest collection of Egon Schiele art in the world, plus many others. The <strong><a href=\"http://www.jmw.at/en/visit\" title=\"\">Jewish Museum</a></strong> (\u20ac12/\u20ac8) showcases the fascinating history of Jewish life, and continues to acquire artefacts to enrich its archives and innovate \u2013 its temporary exhibitions are often remarkable. My favourite piece is Theodor Herzl\u2019s bicycle. Also well worth visiting is the imperial furniture collection, <strong><a href=\"https://www.hofmobiliendepot.at/en/\" title=\"\">Hofmobiliendepot</a></strong> (\u20ac10.50/\u20ac9.50), with many former possessions of Habsburg monarchs.</p> <h2>Music and ballet</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40dc5a5f36ce900bef013e1390dad6538a015e73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40dc5a5f36ce900bef013e1390dad6538a015e73/0_449_2250_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natascha Mair and Denys Cherevychko of the Vienna State Ballet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natascha Mair and Denys Cherevychko of the Vienna State Ballet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Taylor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vienna pretty much sets the standard for the rest of the world when it comes to classical music, and 2020 marks the <a href=\"https://www.wien.info/en/music-stage-shows/city-of-music/beethoven-memorials\" title=\"\">250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth</a>. I advise against pointing out to the Viennese that Beethoven was German and not Austrian (he established his career here), instead just revel in the devotion and adulation he stirs among locals. Incidentally, the building in which he completed his Ninth Symphony still stands and is now an excellent pub, <strong><a href=\"http://www.bierteufl.at/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Bierteufl</a></strong>, with typical Austrian fare. For an alternative to the prestigious venues, try the <strong><a href=\"https://www.volksoper.at/\" title=\"\">Volksoper</a></strong> \u2013 where the Vienna State Ballet sometimes perform (in addition to the state opera of course) \u2013 which has almost daily performances of operettas, operas, musicals or ballets at reasonable prices; standing places can cost as little as \u20ac3.</p> <h2>Bar crawling</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"223498ed42be377de732a9947e8c7f1fc6d07007\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/223498ed42be377de732a9947e8c7f1fc6d07007/574_54_5429_3259/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe Europa in Vienna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cafe Europa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julia Dragosits</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Relaxed licensing times mean there is rarely any hurry when out for a drink in Vienna. <strong><a href=\"http://www.cafeeuropa.at/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Europa</a></strong> is a good example of this laidback attitude: it is open seven days a week, from 9am to 5am. <strong><a href=\"https://cafe-tachles.at/kontakt/\" title=\"\">Tachles</a></strong>, which bills itself as a <em>Kulturcaf\u00e9</em> and takes its name from the Yiddish for \u201cstraight-talking\u201d, is the full package. A lovely old-fashioned, wood-panelled boozer in its own right, it serves delicious Polish <em>pierogi</em> (filled savoury dumplings) and often has live music.</p> <h2><strong>Death in Vienna</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37cf04bc9a0aed2ee38752eff03c90c038fe8ed2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37cf04bc9a0aed2ee38752eff03c90c038fe8ed2/0_175_5215_3130/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zentralfriedhof.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zentralfriedhof.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Vienna has the best quality of life in the world, it also has the best quality of death. Few cities have such beautiful, well-tended and pleasant cemeteries. The Viennese take strolls in cemeteries as others would go for a walk in the park. Of the nearly 50 cemeteries, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.wien.info/en/locations/central-cemetery\" title=\"\">Zentralfriedhof</a></strong> is the biggest and most famous. Many of the world\u2019s greatest composers are here, including Beethoven and Schubert, but not Mozart; his remains are in the <strong><a href=\"https://www.wien.gv.at/english/environment/parks/sankt-marx.html\">St Marx cemetery</a></strong> in the 3rd district (Landstra\u00dfe). For a more morbid \u2013 but dynastic \u2013 experience, head to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.kapuzinergruft.com/site/en/home\" title=\"\">Kapuzinergruft</a></strong> (\u20ac7.50/\u20ac6.50), the burial place of the Habsburgs on the Neuer Markt in the Inner City. There, you\u2019ll find the sarcophagi of over 100 members of the imperial family in all imaginable styles. History buffs like me will be thrilled to see Empress Maria Theresa and her son the enlightened despot Joseph II (brother to Marie Antoinette), Franz Joseph I and Empress Sisi (assassinated in Geneva by an Italian anarchist in 1898), the tragic Crown Prince Rudolf (who committed suicide with his 17-year-old mistress) and the equally tragic Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (executed by firing squad in 1867).</p> <h2>Eating out</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90b30601f0bce09e6b17001d7609936aa3bcb885\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90b30601f0bce09e6b17001d7609936aa3bcb885/0_251_4824_2894/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meissl & Schadn restaurant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meissl &amp; Schadn restaurant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a real, no-nonsense taste of Vienna, head for <strong><a href=\"https://www.schnitzelwirt.co.at/\">Schnitzelwirt</a></strong><strong>,</strong> which serves family-size portions of schnitzel at an unbeatable \u20ac6.90. The Viennese traditionally eat it with a cold potato salad. Diverging may cause frowns. Viennese menus usually comprise the same group of dishes, sometimes Austrian in origin but often inherited from the various nationalities of the empire: Hungarian goulash (thicker and less spicy than its Magyar counterpart), wiener schnitzel (strictly made from veal but often from pork), south Slav <em>\u0107evap\u010di\u0107i</em> (grilled minced meat), cr\u00eape-like <em>Palatschinken</em> (claimed by the Romanians), and <em>Powidltascherl</em> (sweet dumplings filled with stewed plum or plum jam) from the Czechs, to name but a few. Emperor Franz Joseph\u2019s favourite was <em>Tafelspitz</em>, beef boiled in a vegetable broth, served with gratin potatoes, apple horseradish and sour cream with chives. The most famous Tafelspitz restaurant is <strong><a href=\"https://www.plachutta.at/\" title=\"\">Plachutta</a></strong>, which has three locations in the city, but I would head for the equally excellent <strong><a href=\"http://www.gasthauspfudl.com/home-pfudl-en.html\" title=\"\">Gasthaus Pfudl</a></strong>. Also worth a mention is the resurrected Viennese institution <strong><a href=\"https://meisslundschadn.at/en/\" title=\"\">Meissl &amp; Schadn</a></strong>: an imperial staple that survived the first world war (even though future Social Democratic grandee Friedrich Adler assassinated the Austrian prime minister there during his lunch in 1916), but not the second. Reopened at Schubertring 10-12 in 2017, it now offers traditional Viennese cuisine in a charming setting. </p> <h2><strong>Architectural delights</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e75a8a0197249ca8256ef15f93dc243022274b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e75a8a0197249ca8256ef15f93dc243022274b5/366_560_4612_4613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Looshaus in Michaelerplatz.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Looshaus in Michaelerplatz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leave your map in your pocket and wander through the old town, raising your eyes and poking your nose into every courtyard and hidden church. This eclectic cocktail of medieval, baroque, historicist and modernist buildings will quench most architectural thirsts. Look out for the <strong>Looshaus</strong> (Michaelerplatz 3), which offended upper-class Viennese people with its \u201cobscene nakedness\u201d (lack of window-roofing) upon completion in 1912, and the gothic <strong>Maria am Gestade</strong> (Salvatorgasse 12), finished in 1414, which Joseph Cotten memorably runs past in Carol Reed\u2019s 1949 film The Third Man \u2013 still shown at least three times a week at the city\u2019s oldest cinema, <strong><a href=\"https://www.burgkino.at/\" title=\"\">Burg Kino</a></strong>. The <strong>university</strong>, the oldest in the German-speaking world, offers guided tours in English (\u20ac5, every Saturday, 11.30am) through its neo-Renaissance premises, and the <strong>Prunksaal</strong> (state hall) of the old imperial library (1723-26), surely one of the most beautiful in the world (\u20ac8, Josephsplatz 1). Often missed by visitors are Vienna\u2019s <em>Gemeindebauten</em> (municipality buildings), social housing projects built between 1919 and 1934. Still the property of the council and serving their original purpose, these beautiful icons of the Red Vienna era are worth exploring. The most remarkable example is the one-kilometre-long <strong>Karl-Marx-Hof </strong>in the 19th district. Also try the <strong>Rabenhof</strong> in the 3rd district and the exotic-looking <strong>Reumannhof</strong> in the 5th.</p> <h2><strong>Kaffeeh\u00e4user</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"114d2a2d20c9bf3f0bd4e300754d05e7144b265a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/114d2a2d20c9bf3f0bd4e300754d05e7144b265a/0_736_5073_3044/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe Diglas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caf\u00e9 Diglas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Viennese institution par excellence, the coffee house is far more than a place to drink coffee (from a bewildering array of recipes) and to enjoy guilt-inducing slices of cake. The waiters are haughty, buttoned-up and stuffy: that is in the job description. Do not let it put you off! In Vienna, you can order a single espresso for \u20ac3 and stay put for hours; with hot food served from late morning to late evening, there often appears to be no reason ever to leave. Many Kaffeeh\u00e4user have retained their old-world glory and charm, such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.cafe-schwarzenberg.at/en/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Schwarzenberg</a>,</strong> which even has friendly service. <strong><a href=\"http://wollzeile.diglas.at/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Diglas</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.cafefrauenhuber.at/index.php/en/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Frauenhuber</a></strong> almost manage the same feat, despite being right in the centre of the old town. <strong><a href=\"https://www.kaffeealtwien.at/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Kaffee Alt Wien</a></strong>, founded in 1936, is a relative newcomer, but offers a more informal, youthful atmosphere. Further afield, in the 4th district, a splendid example of a local coffee house is <strong><a href=\"https://www.wien.info/en/locations/cafe-anzengruber#\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Anzengruber</a></strong>, run by a delightful mother-and-son team (I recommend the goulash). <strong><a href=\"https://cafehummel.at/\" title=\"\">Caf\u00e9 Hummel</a></strong> in the 8th is equally reliable and authentic.</p> <h2>Wine taverns</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c639541ba3efc2b6f7341f26e753f3e60bc3c14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c639541ba3efc2b6f7341f26e753f3e60bc3c14/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A wine tavern in Grinzing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wine tavern in Grinzing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the summer it is a pleasure to go out to <em><a href=\"https://www.wien.info/en/shopping-wining-dining/wine/heurige-2\" title=\"\">Heurige</a></em> wineries in Nu\u00dfdorf and Grinzing or to their less well-known counterparts in Sievering, Neustift am Walde or Ottakring (at the end of public transport lines in the west of the city). These traditional taverns simply serve wine produced from their own vineyards (ie their back gardens). They are open during the clement half of the year or longer. Some, such as <strong><a href=\"https://10ermarie.at/\" title=\"\">10er Marie</a></strong> (16th district), the oldest <a href=\"https://www.wien.info/en/shopping-wining-dining/wine/heurige-2\" title=\"\">Heuriger</a> in Vienna (1740), are open all year. Walk in, sit at a large wooden table, order a jug (or several), pick from the buffet, and enjoy the views of vine-covered hillsides.</p> <h2>Beer</h2> <p>The Viennese are keen beer drinkers and the standard is invariably good (I favour <a href=\"https://www.stiegl.at/en\">Stiegl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.murauerbier.at/\">Murauer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wieselburger.at/en/our-beer\">Wieselburger</a> above all, though the local Viennese lager is Ottakringer). Avoid the drunken touristic area around Schwedenplatz and Rotenturmstra\u00dfe in the 1st district, and head for a traditional inn \u2013 a <em>Gastwirtschaft </em>or<em> Gasthaus</em>.

      "bodyText": "District life Vienna is divided into 23 districts (Bezirke), each distinct in reputation and purpose. The old town, officially the Innere Stadt (1st district, with St Stephen\u2019s cathedral at its heart), is surrounded by the Ringstrasse, a splendid boulevard begun in the 1850s and not quite finished by the time the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed in 1918. Beyond the Ring lie districts two to nine, which are in turn surrounded by a much larger ring road, the G\u00fcrtel (belt). The Viennese often prefer to shop, drink and eat in their own district or a neighbouring one than venture into the centre. In winter, I advise huddling in the cosy bars and cafes of the 4th district (especially around Schleifm\u00fchlgasse), or the streets either side of the Mariahilferstrasse, the city\u2019s unremarkable shopping drag. In recent years, Leopoldstadt (2nd district and traditionally the Jewish part of town) has happily re-emerged, and is also replete with warm and atmospheric cafes, bars, restaurants and clubs. Brilliant museums Vienna has a vast array of museums, including institutions dedicated to shoes, condoms, Esperanto and sanitation. Personal favourites include the Leopold Museum (\u20ac14/\u20ac10), which houses the largest collection of Egon Schiele art in the world, plus many others. The Jewish Museum (\u20ac12/\u20ac8) showcases the fascinating history of Jewish life, and continues to acquire artefacts to enrich its archives and innovate \u2013 its temporary exhibitions are often remarkable. My favourite piece is Theodor Herzl\u2019s bicycle. Also well worth visiting is the imperial furniture collection, Hofmobiliendepot (\u20ac10.50/\u20ac9.50), with many former possessions of Habsburg monarchs. Music and ballet Vienna pretty much sets the standard for the rest of the world when it comes to classical music, and 2020 marks the 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth. I advise against pointing out to the Viennese that Beethoven was German and not Austrian (he established his career here), instead just revel in the devotion and adulation he stirs among locals. Incidentally, the building in which he completed his Ninth Symphony still stands and is now an excellent pub, Bierteufl, with typical Austrian fare. For an alternative to the prestigious venues, try the Volksoper \u2013 where the Vienna State Ballet sometimes perform (in addition to the state opera of course) \u2013 which has almost daily performances of operettas, operas, musicals or ballets at reasonable prices; standing places can cost as little as \u20ac3. Bar crawling Relaxed licensing times mean there is rarely any hurry when out for a drink in Vienna. Caf\u00e9 Europa is a good example of this laidback attitude: it is open seven days a week, from 9am to 5am. Tachles, which bills itself as a Kulturcaf\u00e9 and takes its name from the Yiddish for \u201cstraight-talking\u201d, is the full package. A lovely old-fashioned, wood-panelled boozer in its own right, it serves delicious Polish pierogi (filled savoury dumplings) and often has live music. Death in Vienna If Vienna has the best quality of life in the world, it also has the best quality of death. Few cities have such beautiful, well-tended and pleasant cemeteries. The Viennese take strolls in cemeteries as others would go for a walk in the park. Of the nearly 50 cemeteries, the Zentralfriedhof is the biggest and most famous. Many of the world\u2019s greatest composers are here, including Beethoven and Schubert, but not Mozart; his remains are in the St Marx cemetery in the 3rd district (Landstra\u00dfe). For a more morbid \u2013 but dynastic \u2013 experience, head to the Kapuzinergruft (\u20ac7.50/\u20ac6.50), the burial place of the Habsburgs on the Neuer Markt in the Inner City. There, you\u2019ll find the sarcophagi of over 100 members of the imperial family in all imaginable styles. History buffs like me will be thrilled to see Empress Maria Theresa and her son the enlightened despot Joseph II (brother to Marie Antoinette), Franz Joseph I and Empress Sisi (assassinated in Geneva by an Italian anarchist in 1898), the tragic Crown Prince Rudolf (who committed suicide with his 17-year-old mistress) and the equally tragic Emperor Maximilian of Mexico (executed by firing squad in 1867). Eating out For a real, no-nonsense taste of Vienna, head for Schnitzelwirt, which serves family-size portions of schnitzel at an unbeatable \u20ac6.90. The Viennese traditionally eat it with a cold potato salad. Diverging may cause frowns. Viennese menus usually comprise the same group of dishes, sometimes Austrian in origin but often inherited from the various nationalities of the empire: Hungarian goulash (thicker and less spicy than its Magyar counterpart), wiener schnitzel (strictly made from veal but often from pork), south Slav \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i (grilled minced meat), cr\u00eape-like Palatschinken (claimed by the Romanians), and Powidltascherl (sweet dumplings filled with stewed plum or plum jam) from the Czechs, to name but a few. Emperor Franz Joseph\u2019s favourite was Tafelspitz, beef boiled in a vegetable broth, served with gratin potatoes, apple horseradish and sour cream with chives. The most famous Tafelspitz restaurant is Plachutta, which has three locations in the city, but I would head for the equally excellent Gasthaus Pfudl. Also worth a mention is the resurrected Viennese institution Meissl &amp; Schadn: an imperial staple that survived the first world war (even though future Social Democratic grandee Friedrich Adler assassinated the Austrian prime minister there during his lunch in 1916), but not the second. Reopened at Schubertring 10-12 in 2017, it now offers traditional Viennese cuisine in a charming setting. Architectural delights Leave your map in your pocket and wander through the old town, raising your eyes and poking your nose into every courtyard and hidden church. This eclectic cocktail of medieval, baroque, historicist and modernist buildings will quench most architectural thirsts. Look out for the Looshaus (Michaelerplatz 3), which offended upper-class Viennese people with its \u201cobscene nakedness\u201d (lack of window-roofing) upon completion in 1912, and the gothic Maria am Gestade (Salvatorgasse 12), finished in 1414, which Joseph Cotten memorably runs past in Carol Reed\u2019s 1949 film The Third Man \u2013 still shown at least three times a week at the city\u2019s oldest cinema, Burg Kino. The university, the oldest in the German-speaking world, offers guided tours in English (\u20ac5, every Saturday, 11.30am) through its neo-Renaissance premises, and the Prunksaal (state hall) of the old imperial library (1723-26), surely one of the most beautiful in the world (\u20ac8, Josephsplatz 1). Often missed by visitors are Vienna\u2019s Gemeindebauten (municipality buildings), social housing projects built between 1919 and 1934. Still the property of the council and serving their original purpose, these beautiful icons of the Red Vienna era are worth exploring. The most remarkable example is the one-kilometre-long Karl-Marx-Hof in the 19th district. Also try the Rabenhof in the 3rd district and the exotic-looking Reumannhof in the 5th. Kaffeeh\u00e4user The Viennese institution par excellence, the coffee house is far more than a place to drink coffee (from a bewildering array of recipes) and to enjoy guilt-inducing slices of cake. The waiters are haughty, buttoned-up and stuffy: that is in the job description. Do not let it put you off! In Vienna, you can order a single espresso for \u20ac3 and stay put for hours; with hot food served from late morning to late evening, there often appears to be no reason ever to leave. Many Kaffeeh\u00e4user have retained their old-world glory and charm, such as Caf\u00e9 Schwarzenberg, which even has friendly service. Caf\u00e9 Diglas and Caf\u00e9 Frauenhuber almost manage the same feat, despite being right in the centre of the old town. Kaffee Alt Wien, founded in 1936, is a relative newcomer, but offers a more informal, youthful atmosphere. Further afield, in the 4th district, a splendid example of a local coffee house is Caf\u00e9 Anzengruber, run by a delightful mother-and-son team (I recommend the goulash). Caf\u00e9 Hummel in the 8th is equally reliable and authentic. Wine taverns During the summer it is a pleasure to go out to Heurige wineries in Nu\u00dfdorf and Grinzing or to their less well-known counterparts in Sievering, Neustift am Walde or Ottakring (at the end of public transport lines in the west of the city). These traditional taverns simply serve wine produced from their own vineyards (ie their back gardens). They are open during the clement half of the year or longer. Some, such as 10er Marie (16th district), the oldest Heuriger in Vienna (1740), are open all year. Walk in, sit at a large wooden table, order a jug (or several), pick from the buffet, and enjoy the views of vine-covered hillsides. Beer The Viennese are keen beer drinkers and the standard is invariably good (I favour Stiegl, Murauer and Wieselburger above all, though the local Viennese lager is Ottakringer). Avoid the drunken touristic area around Schwedenplatz and Rotenturmstra\u00dfe in the 1st district, and head for a traditional inn \u2013 a Gastwirtschaft or Gasthaus. Good examples are Rohrb\u00f6ck in the 4th, Wratschko, in the 7th or Zur Eisernen Zeit, on the Naschmarkt in the 6th at the popular market. When to go Winters are usually very cold, but the Christmas markets, ice-skating (head to Rathausplatz) and snow make the city look idyllically festive. In the hot summers, enjoy riverside beaches on the Danube, open-air public baths and ice-cream parlours. To avoid extremes, both of temperature and tourism, try May or September. Getting there I travel by rail every time; if you set off early from London, you can reach Vienna the same day.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Tories to push through policies as Labour leadership race heats up</h2> \n<p>Good morning, I\u2019m Alison Rourke and welcome to this Monday briefing in what\u2019s going to be another blockbuster week of politics.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson will tell his new Tory MPs that they have a responsibility to change the party for the better when they start arriving in Westminster today. He will also carry out a minor cabinet reshuffle after Alun Cairns\u2019s resignation as Welsh secretary, Nicky Morgan\u2019s exit from culture and Zac Goldsmith from environment. A much more substantial movement is expected in the new year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/johnson-to-tell-new-tory-mps-they-have-to-change-party-for-good\">The PM also intends to accelerate plans for his Brexit bill</a> this week. The party\u2019s new members, who mostly represent northern and Midlands seats, will be sworn in on Tuesday and Wednesday before a Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday, where much-touted NHS spending changes will top the bill. Johnson is also planning a huge shake-up of Whitehall, undoing many of Theresa May\u2019s changes to the machinery of government.</p> \n<p>Johnson also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">has the BBC in his sights</a>, with Downing Street seriously considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, while boycotting Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. No 10 pulled ministers from Saturday\u2019s edition and sources said it intended to \u201cwithdraw engagement\u201d from the show in future.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham (Labour),<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/andy-burnham-warns-northerners-to-be-wary-of-glib-tory-promises\"> has urged urged new Tory voters in the north of England</a> to be wary of Conservative promises to invest tens of billions in the region\u2019s infrastructure. Johnson will tell his Tory recruits in the Midlands and the North that they must help him deliver for the voters in their areas.</p> \n<p>On the Labour side of the ledger, the leadership race will heat up this week as recriminations over how things went so wrong intensify. You can see the Labour leadership <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/labour-leadership-contest-who-are-the-runners-and-riders\">runners and riders here</a> and read a Q&amp;A on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/qa-how-will-the-labour-party-choose-its-next-leader\">how the contest will happen here</a>. The party confirmed last night that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/labour-leadership-race-begins-as-senior-figures-back-rebecca-long-bailey\">Jeremy Corbyn had asked for a leadership process to elect his successor by the end of March</a>, which means he will sit across the dispatch box from Johnson for another three months.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Worse than Nixon\u2019</strong> \u2013 As Wednesday\u2019s expected vote on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/15/trump-impeachment-democrats-republicans-president\">whether to impeach President Trump approaches</a>, both sides have been out in force pushing their cases. Adam Schiff, who chaired the House inquiry for the Democrats, said: \u201cIf anything this president\u2019s conduct is far worse than anything Nixon did.\u201d On the Republican side, Lindsay Graham led the president\u2019s defence: \u201cThis thing will come to the Senate and it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly.\u201d A simple majority in the full House of Representatives is required for the impeachment to go ahead, most likely in January. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/15/james-comey-sloppiness-fbi-surveillance-trump-page-fox-news-sunday\">Trump himself threatened former FBI director</a> James Comey with \u201cyears in jail\u201d over his FBI Russia report.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Flu vaccinations </strong>\u2013 Parents are being encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/15/doctors-urge-parents-vaccinate-children-against-flu\">vaccinate their children for flu</a>, as the NHS faces a flood of cases. The number of patients booking doctor\u2019s appointments with flu-like symptoms has increased by 24% in the past week, according to the latest data from Public Health England.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Tories to push through policies as Labour leadership race heats up Good morning, I\u2019m Alison Rourke and welcome to this Monday briefing in what\u2019s going to be another blockbuster week of politics. Boris Johnson will tell his new Tory MPs that they have a responsibility to change the party for the better when they start arriving in Westminster today. He will also carry out a minor cabinet reshuffle after Alun Cairns\u2019s resignation as Welsh secretary, Nicky Morgan\u2019s exit from culture and Zac Goldsmith from environment. A much more substantial movement is expected in the new year. The PM also intends to accelerate plans for his Brexit bill this week. The party\u2019s new members, who mostly represent northern and Midlands seats, will be sworn in on Tuesday and Wednesday before a Queen\u2019s speech on Thursday, where much-touted NHS spending changes will top the bill. Johnson is also planning a huge shake-up of Whitehall, undoing many of Theresa May\u2019s changes to the machinery of government. Johnson also has the BBC in his sights, with Downing Street seriously considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, while boycotting Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. No 10 pulled ministers from Saturday\u2019s edition and sources said it intended to \u201cwithdraw engagement\u201d from the show in future. Meanwhile, the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham (Labour), has urged urged new Tory voters in the north of England to be wary of Conservative promises to invest tens of billions in the region\u2019s infrastructure. Johnson will tell his Tory recruits in the Midlands and the North that they must help him deliver for the voters in their areas. On the Labour side of the ledger, the leadership race will heat up this week as recriminations over how things went so wrong intensify. You can see the Labour leadership runners and riders here and read a Q&amp;A on how the contest will happen here. The party confirmed last night that Jeremy Corbyn had asked for a leadership process to elect his successor by the end of March, which means he will sit across the dispatch box from Johnson for another three months. * * * \u2018Worse than Nixon\u2019 \u2013 As Wednesday\u2019s expected vote on whether to impeach President Trump approaches, both sides have been out in force pushing their cases. Adam Schiff, who chaired the House inquiry for the Democrats, said: \u201cIf anything this president\u2019s conduct is far worse than anything Nixon did.\u201d On the Republican side, Lindsay Graham led the president\u2019s defence: \u201cThis thing will come to the Senate and it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly.\u201d A simple majority in the full House of Representatives is required for the impeachment to go ahead, most likely in January. Meanwhile, Trump himself threatened former FBI director James Comey with \u201cyears in jail\u201d over his FBI Russia report. * * * Flu vaccinations \u2013 Parents are being encouraged to vaccinate their children for flu, as the NHS faces a flood of cases. The number of patients booking doctor\u2019s appointments with flu-like symptoms has increased by 24% in the past week, according to the latest data from Public Health England. The NHS national medical director has urged the 25 million Britons eligible for a free jab to get it now: \u201cIt might be the difference between a Christmas to remember, and one to forget,\u201d Prof Stephen Powis said. * * * House price rise \u2013 After a downbeat 2019, home prices are expected to rise in 2020 by an average of 2%, with northern regions doing better than the south. Rightmove, the UK\u2019s biggest property website, predicts the election landslide is likely to deliver the boost, with an active spring market delivering 2-4% rises in the north, about 1% in the south, and a bottoming out of the London market. * * * Greta hits back \u2013 Whoever does PR for the German rail firm that took a swipe at Greta Thunberg, for saying she took an overcrowded train back to Sweden, will likely be having second thoughts today.

Ardern told reporters at parliament in the capital, Wellington, on Monday that as well as the tour operators who took the visitors to the active volcano when it erupted, cruise ship companies and landowners could also come under scrutiny.</p> <p>Many of the tourists who were visiting White Island when it erupted were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, which was docked in the nearby Port of Tauranga. The island is owned privately by a family from Auckland, who sold leases to four tourism operators.</p> <p>A second investigation by New Zealand\u2019s chief coroner is also under way.</p> <p>Neither inquiry will examine the actions of emergency services in the immediate aftermath of the eruption.

A week after the eruption of Whakaari, also known as White Island, 14 people remain in burns units around New Zealand, 10 of them in critical condition, 13 more were airlifted to hospitals in Australia where one person has since died. The bodies of two people are still missing. New Zealanders observed a minute\u2019s silence on Monday afternoon to commemorate the disaster. Ardern was in a cabinet meeting, where ministers observed the event, and Judy Turner, the mayor of Whakatane \u2013 the town closest to the island \u2013 led a moment of remembrance there for hundreds of mourners, according to Radio New Zealand. Specialists from New Zealand\u2019s military hoped to return to Whakaari on Monday to search the nearby waters for two bodies that they could not find during a perilous recovery mission to the island on Friday. During that trip \u2013 a gruelling and physically demanding operation \u2013 the bodies of six of the eight people unaccounted for were found. Divers returned to the island on Sunday to look for the remaining two, who were believed to be in the ocean off the island, and returned empty-handed; weather conditions at sea prevented a recovery mission on Monday. \u201cPolice with the navy will continue their recovery operation for the two remaining victims,\u201d Ardern said onMonday, adding that searchers would reassess the risk \u201ceach day.\u201d White Island\u2019s volcanic alert status is currently rated at two out of five, the same level of risk as the day it erupted. Whether tourists should have been on New Zealand\u2019s most active volcano last Monday, and whether anyone failed to do anything that could have kept them safe, will be a question for the government agency WorkSafe, in an investigation that is likely to take a year, Ardern said. The inquiry will decide whether charges should be brought against any named individuals who are found to have violated New Zealand\u2019s workplace health and safety laws. Ardern told reporters at parliament in the capital, Wellington, on Monday that as well as the tour operators who took the visitors to the active volcano when it erupted, cruise ship companies and landowners could also come under scrutiny. Many of the tourists who were visiting White Island when it erupted were passengers on the cruise ship Ovation of the Seas, which was docked in the nearby Port of Tauranga. The island is owned privately by a family from Auckland, who sold leases to four tourism operators. A second investigation by New Zealand\u2019s chief coroner is also under way. Neither inquiry will examine the actions of emergency services in the immediate aftermath of the eruption. The authorities were criticised by some of the grieving families for their decision not to allow first responders to return to the island after an initial trip to rescue survivors due to safety risks. Tourism and legal analysts told the Guardian last week that New Zealand\u2019s \u201cno fault\u201d accident compensation system had given rise to more risk-taking in the adventure tourism sector than was considered acceptable in other countries. The scheme, known as ACC, covers the treatment costs for all accidental injuries in New Zealand but bars the injured from bringing lawsuits for negligence. \u201cI simply do not agree that ACC in any way has led to there being less focus on health and safety issues,\u201d Ardern said, adding there were \u201cregulatory regimes\u201d that managed risks to tourists. Ardern said on Monday that $5million NZD had been set aside to help support small businesses in the area, as well as those on the West Coast of the South Island who were cut off by flooding last week. The small, tourist town of Whakatane, in the economically-deprived region of Bay of Plenty has long been reliant on the tourist draw of White Island as an anchor for its economic survival. A panel of government ministers and public officials would decide on the criteria for distributing the funds, Ardern said. The prime minister said it was also not for her to say whether White Island would be reopened for tour groups in the year that the inquiry would take to complete.",

The station was opened in 1960, in the midst of nuclear tensions with the United States. Other cities in the Soviet Union had similar systems. Much of the Moscow Metro is specifically engineered to protect against nuclear attack, where blast doors can seal train tunnels, allowing for a total seal against blast pressure and fallout. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-defence-usa/russian-calls-for-cold-war-civil-defense-training-to-be-revived-idUSKCN0SO2D420151030\">In 2015, the Russian authorities revived</a> public civil defence training, effectively reactivating bunkers that had lain dormant since the end of the cold war.</p> <p>Berlin, being on the fault line between the Soviet bloc and the west, is also riven by extensive bunker systems on both sides of the now-demolished Berlin Wall. Some of these bunkers are air raid-shelters from the second world war and were retrofitted during the cold war for nuclear fallout filtration. Many are now in the care of <em><a href=\"https://www.berliner-unterwelten.de/en.html\">Berliner Unterwelten</a></em>, a group of tunnel and bunker devotees who have become the de facto custodians of the city\u2019s subterranean heritage. On a snowy afternoon at <em>Pankstra\u00dfe</em> station, a tour guide from the group called Kate took us underground and through a sneaky door to reveal bunk beds, kitchens, an infirmary, and a nuclear, biological and chemical air filtration system that could keep 3,339 ordinary citizens alive for 14 days underground.</p> <p>On the way back to surface level, she expressed frustration that many tourists viewed the bunker as a historical novelty. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d she says, \u201cthe nuclear threat is current, and the fact that we know about this bunker means its usefulness is now limited.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"615709165140d9296184ba6fbd6084b7b554d881\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/615709165140d9296184ba6fbd6084b7b554d881/0_491_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The telephone exchange in \u201cBurlington\u201d, a 35-acre underground city just outside Bath, UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The telephone exchange in \u201cBurlington\u201d, a 35-acre underground city just outside Bath, UK.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesse Alexander/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>\u201cBurlington\u201d, a 35-acre underground city just outside Bath, UK, has a telephone exchange, an industrial kitchen and almost 60 miles of roads.

Israel recently built a multistorey underground operations centre in Jerusalem and <a href=\"https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3738902,00.html\">moved all future meetings</a> of its cabinet into the bunker. Meanwhile, the UK government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47658403\">activated a team in a nuclear-proof bunker</a> under a Ministry of Defence building earlier this year in preparation for potential chaos resulting from a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>As governments build new bunkers, the abandoned subterranean cities of the cold war have become a hot commodity in the private market. In 2016, the British government listed for sale the Central Government War Headquarters, also known as \u201cBurlington\u201d. This 35-acre underground city just outside Bath was once the fallback headquarters for the government in the event of a nuclear strike on London. The subterranean space could be \u201cbuttoned up\u201d to seal off and shelter 4,000 people for at least three months. Almost 60 miles of roads connect an industrial kitchen, sleeping quarters, radio broadcasting facility, laundries, dedicated rail line, drinking water reservoir, library and operation rooms.</p> <p>One of the prospective buyers looking to snap up the bunker for \u00a33m was Robert Vicino, a doomsday prepper and real estate developer based in California looking to build a survival city. The Ministry of Defence eventually pulled Burlington off the market without explanation \u2013 perhaps due to parts of the bunker being listed on the heritage register, which complicates redevelopment.</p> <p>With Burlington off the table, Vicino set his sights on the 30,000sq ft (2,787sq m) bunker at RAF Chilmark near Salisbury, a 20-room hardened facility split over two floors. Five months earlier, Wiltshire police raided the abandoned bunker following information received that it had been into an enormous underground marijuana farm. Those events may have motivated the Ministry of Defence to find a buyer for the site. Vicino estimates the site could accommodate 154 people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a75da4248493b6160d1f1b6c7f4d5244933f2816\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a75da4248493b6160d1f1b6c7f4d5244933f2816/0_0_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vivos xPoint, a former Army munitions depot, has 575 hardened concrete military bunkers and is the largest survival shelter community on Earth, located near the Black Hills area of South Dakota, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vivos xPoint, a former Army munitions depot, has 575 hardened concrete military bunkers and is the largest survival shelter community on Earth, located near the Black Hills area of South Dakota, US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley L Garrett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"14aa4de2e92251e269d543e02b422a456fe0ad78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14aa4de2e92251e269d543e02b422a456fe0ad78/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty Vivos xPoint bunker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty Vivos xPoint bunker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"d7a3593514a1bf0936035a166530887843293de3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7a3593514a1bf0936035a166530887843293de3/0_148_7592_4555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A fully-fitted Vivos xPoint bunker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fully-fitted Vivos xPoint bunker.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley L Garrett</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Vivos xPoint, a former Army munitions depot, has 575 hardened concrete military bunkers and is the largest survival shelter community on Earth, located near the Black Hills area of South Dakota, US.

Inhabitants of these tunnels were known as the <em>shuzu</em>, or \u201crat tribe\u201d. Annette Kim, an urban planner from the University of Southern California, told Al Jazeera that she saw Beijing\u2019s underground bunker cities \u201cnot as a relic of the cold war but as a possible precursor for urban living in densely populated Asian cities\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>The future is down</strong></h2> <p>The most concerted move underground is taking place in Singapore, where officials are burying infrastructure, shops, pedestrian walkways, highways, storage facilities, homes and offices as part of a \u201csubterranean masterplan\u201d for the city-state. As an added bonus, spoils from excavation can be used to terraform new land and stave off rising sea levels.</p> <p>The Nanyang Centre for Underground Space, a research institute within Nanyang Technological University, is directing Singapore\u2019s deep underground development. The director of the centre, Zhiye Zhao, told me his team imagines the future moving in only one direction: down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abbabe79407b16f01cc606af3346595586d001ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abbabe79407b16f01cc606af3346595586d001ad/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Beijing, a million people live underground in 5,000km of defunct subterranean tunnels and command bunkers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Beijing, a million people live underground in 5,000km of defunct subterranean tunnels and command bunkers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nelson Ching/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>In Beijing, a million people live underground in 5,000km of defunct subterranean tunnels and command bunkers.

It is guarded by a camouflaged lookout with an assault rifle. Underneath this unassuming hill is a 15-storey inverted luxury tower block called the Survival Condo \u2013 and it could be a portend of future private underground developments in cities the world over. Stretching 60 metres below the surface, the Kansas silo was one of 72 \u201chardened\u201d missile structures built during the cold war to protect a ballistic missile with a nuclear payload one hundred times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. It was bought in 2008 by Larry Hall, an ex-government contractor, property developer and doomsday prepper who, like millions of others, is actively attempting to adapt for what he sees as probable future conditions of wide-scale calamity. Preppers anticipate war, pandemics, climate chaos, nuclear disaster, runaway technology, or just a simple collapse of the supply lines keeping cities functioning. The end result of all these scenarios is the same: bedlam. The Survival Condo extends 15 storeys underground. Photographs: Bradley Garrett Hall was able to buy the long since decommissioned silo for a fraction of its construction cost. He then spent $20m (\u00a315m) transforming it into a cushy bolthole replete with a library, swimming pool, climbing wall, video arcade, shooting range, bar, cinema, and seven floors of private living space. Half floor units sell for $1.5m, full-floor units for $3m and penthouses for $4.5m, cash only. Fifty-five ultra-high-net-worth residents have purchased private apartments inside the condo. Residents are understandably cagey about sharing their identities, but include real estate moguls, a financial entrepreneur and two doctors. One resident had the view from her loft in Manhattan filmed in all four seasons, so it could be piped into high-definition screens installed as \u2018windows\u2019 inside the bunker. Residents often do not have specific motivations for moving into the bunker, they are acting on a sense of general unease about the future. The Survival Condo\u2019s grocery store, common room and living quarters with video -feed \u2018windows\u2019. Photographs: Bradley L Garrett/SurvivalCondo.com Hall says 75 individuals can survive inside the sealed, self-sufficient converted silo for up to five years during social, political or environmental instability \u2013 even total collapse. When the crisis passes, silo residents expect to be able to emerge into the post-apocalyptic world to rebuild. \u201c[Before] this was not a space of hope,\u201d Hall explains as we tour the facility. \u201cThe defensive capability of this structure only existed to the extent that needed to protect a weapon, a missile \u2026 We have converted a weapon of mass destruction into the complete opposite.\u201d The condos are in such high demand that Hall is currently building out a second silo. From cold war to hot commodity The idea more of us might move underground once seemed hysterical but, as people continue to flood into fragile cities and the world shudders under our weight, it appears some find it more and more alluring. A daily drip of terrible news: flooding in Venice; riots in Bogot\u00e1, Paris and Hong Kong; nuclear tensions in the Korean Peninsula and Middle East; Sydney and Los Angeles burning; mass shootings \u2013 all feed a sense that something terrible is over the horizon that might require just such a bunker. Although the involvement of private sector investors and developers is new, the construction of underground bunkers by governments is not. Many are hidden in plain sight underneath our biggest cities. Arsenalna Station, Kyiv. A steel shutter can be lowered to seal off the tunnels and platform at the bottom of the escalators. Photograph: Bradley Garrett In Kyiv\u2019s Arsenalna metro station, the deepest in the world at 105 metres, a steel shutter in the walls can be lowered to seal the tunnels and platform at the bottom of the escalators, creating a public nuclear shelter. The station was opened in 1960, in the midst of nuclear tensions with the United States. Other cities in the Soviet Union had similar systems. Much of the Moscow Metro is specifically engineered to protect against nuclear attack, where blast doors can seal train tunnels, allowing for a total seal against blast pressure and fallout. In 2015, the Russian authorities revived public civil defence training, effectively reactivating bunkers that had lain dormant since the end of the cold war. Berlin, being on the fault line between the Soviet bloc and the west, is also riven by extensive bunker systems on both sides of the now-demolished Berlin Wall. Some of these bunkers are air raid-shelters from the second world war and were retrofitted during the cold war for nuclear fallout filtration. Many are now in the care of Berliner Unterwelten, a group of tunnel and bunker devotees who have become the de facto custodians of the city\u2019s subterranean heritage. On a snowy afternoon at Pankstra\u00dfe station, a tour guide from the group called Kate took us underground and through a sneaky door to reveal bunk beds, kitchens, an infirmary, and a nuclear, biological and chemical air filtration system that could keep 3,339 ordinary citizens alive for 14 days underground. On the way back to surface level, she expressed frustration that many tourists viewed the bunker as a historical novelty. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d she says, \u201cthe nuclear threat is current, and the fact that we know about this bunker means its usefulness is now limited.\u201d \u201cBurlington\u201d, a 35-acre underground city just outside Bath, UK, has a telephone exchange, an industrial kitchen and almost 60 miles of roads. Photographs: Jesse Alexander/Alamy/Bradley Garrett In many parts of the world, governments never stopped building bunkers. Israel recently built a multistorey underground operations centre in Jerusalem and moved all future meetings of its cabinet into the bunker. Meanwhile, the UK government activated a team in a nuclear-proof bunker under a Ministry of Defence building earlier this year in preparation for potential chaos resulting from a no-deal Brexit. As governments build new bunkers, the abandoned subterranean cities of the cold war have become a hot commodity in the private market. In 2016, the British government listed for sale the Central Government War Headquarters, also known as \u201cBurlington\u201d. This 35-acre underground city just outside Bath was once the fallback headquarters for the government in the event of a nuclear strike on London. The subterranean space could be \u201cbuttoned up\u201d to seal off and shelter 4,000 people for at least three months. Almost 60 miles of roads connect an industrial kitchen, sleeping quarters, radio broadcasting facility, laundries, dedicated rail line, drinking water reservoir, library and operation rooms. One of the prospective buyers looking to snap up the bunker for \u00a33m was Robert Vicino, a doomsday prepper and real estate developer based in California looking to build a survival city. The Ministry of Defence eventually pulled Burlington off the market without explanation \u2013 perhaps due to parts of the bunker being listed on the heritage register, which complicates redevelopment. With Burlington off the table, Vicino set his sights on the 30,000sq ft (2,787sq m) bunker at RAF Chilmark near Salisbury, a 20-room hardened facility split over two floors. Five months earlier, Wiltshire police raided the abandoned bunker following information received that it had been into an enormous underground marijuana farm. Those events may have motivated the Ministry of Defence to find a buyer for the site. Vicino estimates the site could accommodate 154 people. Vivos xPoint, a former Army munitions depot, has 575 hardened concrete military bunkers and is the largest survival shelter community on Earth, located near the Black Hills area of South Dakota, US. Photographs: Bradley L Garrett Vicino\u2019s Vivos Group has already built two facilities in the US in the voids left behind by the state. In Indiana, he spruced up a cold war bunker that now accommodates 80 preppers. And in South Dakota, at a site called xPoint, he has sold space in 575 concrete bunkers, part of an abandoned second world war ordnance depot. A different sort of annexation has taken place in Beijing, where reports emerged in 2015 of a million people living underground in around 5,000km of defunct subterranean tunnels and command bunkers from the cold war. Inhabitants of these tunnels were known as the shuzu, or \u201crat tribe\u201d. Annette Kim, an urban planner from the University of Southern California, told Al Jazeera that she saw Beijing\u2019s underground bunker cities \u201cnot as a relic of the cold war but as a possible precursor for urban living in densely populated Asian cities\u201d. The future is down The most concerted move underground is taking place in Singapore, where officials are burying infrastructure, shops, pedestrian walkways, highways, storage facilities, homes and offices as part of a \u201csubterranean masterplan\u201d for the city-state. As an added bonus, spoils from excavation can be used to terraform new land and stave off rising sea levels. The Nanyang Centre for Underground Space, a research institute within Nanyang Technological University, is directing Singapore\u2019s deep underground development. The director of the centre, Zhiye Zhao, told me his team imagines the future moving in only one direction: down. In Beijing, a million people live underground in 5,000km of defunct subterranean tunnels and command bunkers. Photograph: Nelson Ching/Bloomberg via Getty Images But Zhao did sound a note of caution. The biggest problems his team is tackling are not technical but social, he explains. To put it another way, we still don\u2019t have a clear idea what long-term living underground will do to us. One the most in-depth studies into the effects of subterranean life on humans was carried out by the Disaster Research Group funded by the National Academy of Sciences. Their findings, published in 1960 as Human Problems in the Utilization of Fallout Shelters, found that extended time underground impacts the body both physically and psychologically. \u201cMany of these stresses have significant effects on behaviour,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThese include decreased efficiency in performance, difficulties in concentration, irritability, depression and personality disturbances.\u201d In other words, people might survive but that does not mean they will thrive. It might only be a matter of time before disquiet starts rippling through any post-apocalyptic underground society. Hall, though, is convinced that the social aspects of underground life can also be anticipated and prepared for. The key to wellbeing is maintaining expectations of normalcy, he believes, and safety, comfort, sociability and distraction are crucial. In that way, the Survival Condo\u2019s amenities are not mere luxuries, they are critical to the functioning of its underground community. \u201cWhether you\u2019re woodworking or just taking the dog for a walk, it\u2019s crucial that people feel they are living a relatively normal life,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want good quality food and water and for everyone to feel safe and to feel they\u2019re working together towards a common purpose. This thing\u2019s gotta function like a miniature cruise ship.\u201d Bradley Garrett\u2019s new book Bunker: Building for the End Times, will be published by Penguin Random House in August 2020 Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

After shelling out an average of \u00a373.90 per person on partywear for the festive period, one in five people admit they won\u2019t wear the same outfit to more than one party or event, according to the study from environmental charity Hubbub. The charity is highlighting the findings as another example of the environmental and financial impact of fast or throwaway fashion, amid growing concerns that the industry is wasting valuable resources and contributing to the climate crisis. With consumers now bombarded with advertising for Christmas partywear, it is urging shoppers to consider second-hand clothing, swapping and even renting outfits rather than only buying brand new. Sarah Divall, project co-ordinator at Hubbub, said: \u201cVintage and pre-loved clothing has never been so on trend and it\u2019s only going to get bigger as people realise the massive environmental impact of the fashion industry. Going green doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t dress up.

Hubbub analysed 169 party dresses from 17 online, high street and designer outlets and found 94% are partially or totally made from plastic or plastic-derived fabrics. A damning UK parliamentary committee report this year found that the textile industry creates 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 a year, and is responsible for the consumption of vast quantities of water, while 35% of the microplastics in the ocean come from the synthetic fibres in abandoned clothing.

None made a more vivid first impression than this year\u2019s dazzling import, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/20/catherine-cohen-edinburgh-star-millennial-comic-fringe\">Catherine Cohen</a>. A 27-year-old native of Texas, Cohen is a comic cabaret artiste resident at Alan Cumming\u2019s nightspot in downtown Manhattan. With her UK debut The Twist \u2026 ? She\u2019s Gorgeous this summer, she hit Scotland\u2019s capital like a hurricane, whipped up laughs and plaudits in abundance \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/24/ex-call-centre-worker-wins-top-edinburgh-comedy-award\">left with a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/24/ex-call-centre-worker-wins-top-edinburgh-comedy-award\">best </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/24/ex-call-centre-worker-wins-top-edinburgh-comedy-award\">newcomer award</a> in her slipstream.</p> <p>As with all great musical comedy, her two-for-the-price-of-one offer delivers great tunes and big laughs in equal measure. And these laughs knock the wind out of you. Cohen\u2019s act is \u2013 as a fellow comic described it \u2013 \u201cpure id\u201d, the kind of Niagara of self-love, self-loathing and snark you get when a brittle, brilliant millennial turns herself inside out for you on stage. Sequins-and-smile fabulous, as sidekick Henry Koperski tinkles the piano stage right, Cohen trills about her ego, her weight, her dating life. \u201cBoys never wanted to kiss me,\u201d runs the signature lyric, \u201cso now I do comedy.\u201d</p> <p>And she does it wonderfully. Every gesture, moue or flash of eye is engineered for humour. Her voice \u2013 abstracted from words \u2013 can be as funny as her choicest lyrics. So too her ad libs (after a burp: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I literally can\u2019t stop creating content\u201d) and the detours her songs take into anecdote and confession. Each lead us deeper into the fragile ego of the modern twentysomething, where the strain of presenting a perfect face (or, at least, photogenic vulnerability) to the world threatens to bring the whole structure crashing down. It\u2019s monstrous, it\u2019s ridiculous and, in Cohen\u2019s hands, it\u2019s showbiz. She\u2019s a star in the making \u2013 and the find of the year. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/04/catherine-cohen-review-pleasance-courtyard-edinburgh-festival-2019\">Read the full review.</a></p>",

Among the best is Curb Your Enthusiasm star Wanda Sykes, the first half hour of whose London date was a concentrated howl of dismay at POTUS 45. It was salutary, it was cathartic \u2013 and it couldn\u2019t sustain, as Sykes\u2019 set devolved into good but less great material on LA life. But that opening sequence lingers in the mind: as fierce a blast as standup has yet administered to the Maga man. Read the full review. 9 James McNicholas: The Boxer The Boxer was an absolute gem of a show from one third of the sketch team Beasts, in which McNicholas tells the story of his grandad Terry Downes, a 1960s boxing champ. Cue faux-cockney accent, loving boxing-movie cliches and much self-mockery as McNicholas\u2019s feeble life is contrasted with grandpa\u2019s glory. But that\u2019s rope-a-dope stuff: there\u2019s nothing feeble about The Boxer\u2019s closing rounds, which come out swinging with big laughs and lumps in the throat, too. Read the full review. 8 London Hughes: To Catch a D*ck It hosted Michael McIntyre back in the day. But I doubt the mismatch between the size of the Pleasance Courtyard\u2019s Attic and its performer\u2019s potential was ever greater than when London Hughes performed To Catch a D*ck there this summer. This uproarious blue-humour hour advertised a personality that demanded attention \u2013 and delivered it, with gloriously shameless tales of sex, dating and the lower rungs of celebrity. The roof was raised; the profile too. McIntyre-level stardom probably beckons. Read the full review. 7 Jordan Brookes: I\u2019ve Got Nothing Brookes lowered his sights this year, after experiencing burnout with 2018\u2019s hi-tech fringe show Bleed. I\u2019ve Got Nothing could not have been more low-fi: it featured Brookes on stage with no mic, no props and scarcely any prepared material. But his keen eye remained intact for the faultlines in standup convention and those unsettling areas where joking meets antisocial behaviour \u2013 and he used it to ruthless effect in this part-improvised hour, which bagged him a well-deserved Edinburgh comedy award. Read the full review. 6 Count Arthur Strong: Is There Anybody Out There? Steve Delaney\u2019s confused alter ego Count Arthur Strong might easily coast through this stage in his career: the popular sitcom is behind him; national treasure status is secured. But his senile, malapropping comedy gets more sublime in this touring show, in which the count bids to supplant Brian Cox as the nation\u2019s astronomer-in-chief. He teaches us precisely nothing about the cosmos, of course \u2013 but plenty about bats, \u201cDustbin Hoffman\u201d and the Renaissance stargazer Gary Barlow. A tragicomic tour de force. Read the full review. 5 Hannah Gadsby: Douglas How do you follow the standup sensation of the decade? Aussie comic Hannah Gadsby would have been forgiven for not trying \u2013 particularly given that the global Netflix hit Nanette was meant to be her comedy swansong. Instead, she returned with Douglas, cheerfully baiting her trolls, reflecting on a recent autism diagnosis and sending up her newfound prophet status with an audaciously cocky intro. She is, it turns out, in the big league for keeps. Read the full review. 4 Max and Ivan: Commitment Memories were stirred of the legendary Pappy\u2019s: Last Show Ever by this big-hitting turn, in the same venue, from double act Max Olesker and Ivan Gonzalez. It likewise conjures big questions of friendship, young dreams and what they amount to \u2013 as the duo tell the tale (in sketch, PowerPoint and multi-character fun) of Max\u2019s efforts to reunite Ivan\u2019s teenage band for the latter\u2019s wedding. Under Kieran Hodgson\u2019s direction, Commitment delivers laugh after unexpected laugh \u2013 and warms the heart, too. Read the full review. 3 Kate Berlant There\u2019s a particular \u2013 and intense \u2013 pleasure that comes from comedians who make you laugh in ways you barely understand. Step forward US standup Kate Berlant, who returned to the UK with another thrilling part-improvised hour. The joke is on Berlant\u2019s preciousness and narcissism, as she congratulates herself on her brilliance, shows off her (questionable) ESP, and narrates, instant by instant, her experience of existing on stage. It\u2019s so in the moment, and constantly, surprisingly hilarious. Read the full review. 2 Stewart Lee: Tornado/Snowflake We waited almost three years for new material from the \u00e9minence increasingly grise of alt comedy, and \u2013 with two new shows, Tornado and Snowflake, either side of an interval \u2013 Lee delivered handsomely. Exploring the twilight of political correctness and his own place in the entertainment firmament \u2013 and biting chunks out of fellow standups, Bond movies and the cult of Phoebe Waller-Bridge \u2013 the beady, ultra-ironic Lee was as funny (looser and more fun, even) than we\u2019d ever seen him before. Read the full review. 1 Catherine Cohen: The Twist\u2026 ? She\u2019s Gorgeous The Edinburgh fringe has introduced us to many a blazing comic talent from overseas in the past \u2013 Bo Burnham, Hans Teeuwen and Tim Minchin among them. None made a more vivid first impression than this year\u2019s dazzling import, Catherine Cohen. A 27-year-old native of Texas, Cohen is a comic cabaret artiste resident at Alan Cumming\u2019s nightspot in downtown Manhattan. With her UK debut The Twist \u2026 ? She\u2019s Gorgeous this summer, she hit Scotland\u2019s capital like a hurricane, whipped up laughs and plaudits in abundance \u2013 and left with a best newcomer award in her slipstream. As with all great musical comedy, her two-for-the-price-of-one offer delivers great tunes and big laughs in equal measure. And these laughs knock the wind out of you. Cohen\u2019s act is \u2013 as a fellow comic described it \u2013 \u201cpure id\u201d, the kind of Niagara of self-love, self-loathing and snark you get when a brittle, brilliant millennial turns herself inside out for you on stage. Sequins-and-smile fabulous, as sidekick Henry Koperski tinkles the piano stage right, Cohen trills about her ego, her weight, her dating life. \u201cBoys never wanted to kiss me,\u201d runs the signature lyric, \u201cso now I do comedy.\u201d And she does it wonderfully. Every gesture, moue or flash of eye is engineered for humour. Her voice \u2013 abstracted from words \u2013 can be as funny as her choicest lyrics. So too her ad libs (after a burp: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I literally can\u2019t stop creating content\u201d) and the detours her songs take into anecdote and confession. Each lead us deeper into the fragile ego of the modern twentysomething, where the strain of presenting a perfect face (or, at least, photogenic vulnerability) to the world threatens to bring the whole structure crashing down. It\u2019s monstrous, it\u2019s ridiculous and, in Cohen\u2019s hands, it\u2019s showbiz. She\u2019s a star in the making \u2013 and the find of the year. Read the full review.",

      "body": "<p>The UK cinema industry is banking on the final instalment in the Star Wars saga to set new highs for ticket sales and revenues in 2019, despite the onward march of Netflix.</p> \n<p>Last year proved to be the best for cinema-going since 1970, a year featuring classic hits including French Connection and Bond film Diamonds are Forever, with admissions hitting 177m despite the lack of a Star Wars Christmas blockbuster. If this number is passed this year then the UK is also on for a box office sales bonanza as well, beating the all-time record of just under \u00a31.3bn set in 2017.</p> \n<p>Film experts believe both marks could be bettered thanks to a strong December slate including Jumanji: The Next Level and Cats, starring James Corden and Taylor Swift. But it is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the last film in a franchise that started more than four decades ago, which will ultimately decide the fate of the British box office this year.</p> \n<p>Admissions this month will need to surpass 16m, and perhaps even reach 17m or more, to pass the 177m target \u2013 while setting a new revenue record at the same time.

      "bodyText": "The UK cinema industry is banking on the final instalment in the Star Wars saga to set new highs for ticket sales and revenues in 2019, despite the onward march of Netflix. Last year proved to be the best for cinema-going since 1970, a year featuring classic hits including French Connection and Bond film Diamonds are Forever, with admissions hitting 177m despite the lack of a Star Wars Christmas blockbuster. If this number is passed this year then the UK is also on for a box office sales bonanza as well, beating the all-time record of just under \u00a31.3bn set in 2017. Film experts believe both marks could be bettered thanks to a strong December slate including Jumanji: The Next Level and Cats, starring James Corden and Taylor Swift. But it is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the last film in a franchise that started more than four decades ago, which will ultimately decide the fate of the British box office this year. Admissions this month will need to surpass 16m, and perhaps even reach 17m or more, to pass the 177m target \u2013 while setting a new revenue record at the same time. History indicates that in each year there has been a Star Wars film in the run-up to Christmas, admissions have beaten this mark.

      "body": "<p>More than 600 French hospital doctors have threatened to resign if the government does not increase health funding, as striking medics prepare to take to the streets this week across the country.</p> <p>The doctors warn that budget cuts, bed closures and staff shortages are bringing France\u2019s health system to the brink of collapse and putting patients\u2019 lives at risk.</p> <p>\u201cPublic hospitals in France are dying,\u201d wrote 660 medics from hospitals all over France in an unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Sante/tribune-660-medecins-hospitaliers-se-disent-prets-a-la-demission-3937400\">open letter</a>, saying funding cuts were threatening patient safety in what was once seen as one of the best healthcare systems in the world.</p> <p>Doctors are calling for urgent government talks after nine months of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/french-medics-health-service-collapse-doctors-nurses-protest-outside-french-health-ministry-strikes\">hospital strikes</a>, which began in March in emergency rooms and have since spread across departments from paediatrics to psychiatry, with junior doctors joining this month and no end in sight.</p> <p>On Tuesday, medics will march across France carrying banners saying: \u201cPublic hospitals: a life-threatening emergency\u201d. The long-running healthcare strikes are proving a major headache to the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, with rail workers now adding to his troubles by carrying out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/france-french-pm-reveals-details-of-fairer-pension-reforms\">nationwide stoppages</a> against pension changes.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s pledge last month of more hospital funding and staff bonuses was rejected by doctors\u2019 groups as not enough.</p> <p>In 2000, the World Health Organization ranked France\u2019s health system the best of 191 countries. But a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, published in the Lancet medical journal in 2017, placed it in 15th place for quality of care.</p> <p>\u201cFor years we\u2019ve watched from afar with a lot of empathy as UK healthcare staff struggle under NHS funding cuts,\u201d said Cathy Le Gac, a Sud union representative, who worked for 19 years as a trauma nurse, dealing with serious car crash accidents north of Paris. \u201cAnd yet, now in France, funding cuts mean we\u2019re seeing similar problems to our NHS colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>For many years, governments on the right and left have reduced funding. Public hospitals in France have been forced to cut \u20ac9bn in spending since 2005, leading to the scrapping of hundreds of beds and dozens of operating theatres while stagnant salaries fuelled a flight to the private sector. Emergency room staff complain of elderly patients being left for hours on trolleys in corridors, not enough equipment, increased waiting times for operations and even deaths.</p> <p>At one Paris hospital this year, medics blamed staff shortages for the death of a 55-year-old woman on a trolley in a corridor, while the hospital management maintained staffing numbers were fine. Doctors also warn of staff suicides. More than 400 medical staff marched in Flers, Normandy, in September, after a senior member of the psychiatry department took his life with colleagues blaming poor working conditions.</p> <p>Adeline, 36, a nurse in a hospital in the south of Paris, said despite looking after ageing patients with multiple issues, staff shortages and cuts meant there was not enough time for proper equipment or washing patients. \u201cWe used to have big towels, now there are small towels that don\u2019t dry; our machines for reading blood pressure are old and there aren\u2019t enough of them,\u201d she said. \u201cEven crucial cream for our patients\u2019 private areas, to prevent sores \u2013 we used to have large tubs and are now given small tubes. Some services have no more bin-bags. The idea seems to be rot the health system from the inside and then say it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>Like many nurses \u2013 whose pay is lower than in countries such as Germany, and who often live on the periphery of towns, struggling to make ends meet \u2013 Adeline took part in the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gilets-jaunes-protests\">gilets jaunes</a></em> anti-government protests earlier this year. Unions said many nurses were quitting the profession due to burn-out.</p> <p>Fanny Rigaud, a healthcare assistant at a major Paris hospital, said: \u201cI work with young people being treated for leukemia. They\u2019re scared, we need to reassure them, that takes time but we\u2019re constantly under time pressure.\u201d</p> <p>In an effort to calm the tension, Macron has shifted his approach to the hospital crisis. For months he had maintained that hospitals and emergency rooms were struggling principally due to the way healthcare was organised, citing the lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/27/what-keeps-me-going-my-patients-says-frances-oldest-doctor-at-98\">general doctors</a> who should be treating patients in towns and rural areas. But last month he also acknowledged the need for more funding. \u201cWe must invest more than we first envisaged because the situation is worst than we had thought,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the government\u2019s promise to give an extra \u20ac1.5bn over three years, including staff bonuses, was brushed aside as too little by medics, who vowed to continue the protests. The government also promised to absorb \u20ac10bn of debt from public hospitals.</p> <p>Some 87% of French people support the hospital strikes, according to <a href=\"http://www.institut-viavoice.com/nouvelles-fractures-francaise/\">ViaVoice</a> pollsters, with the public deeply concerned about protecting universal healthcare as a pillar of the social system. Over 90% of people trust healthcare staff to do their best with limited resources. But crucially, 73% are pessimistic about the future for healthcare.</p> <p>Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant for Viavoice, said pressure was acute on Macron because \u201cwhile France is currently living a period of social crisis and tension, the health system is seen as a key right and common good that must be protected \u2013 a plank of the French social security system.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.raisonsdagir-editions.org/catalogue/la-casse-du-siecle/\">Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Juven</a>, a sociologist and research fellow on health systems at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, said: \u201cMedical staff feel there is so much pressure and time-constraint that they cannot do their jobs right, even though they want to.\u201d He said France valued its universalist system of protecting everyone \u201cbut inequalities in access to healthcare are growing in France, alongside great difficulties in hospitals, that\u2019s why this protest movement is going on for so long.\u201d</p> <p>Olivier Youinou, who had been working for almost 30 years as a highly specialised anesthetics nurse in a hospital in Cr\u00e9teil outside Paris, said: \u201cI had better working conditions when I started than I do today.\u201d</p>",

The doctors warn that budget cuts, bed closures and staff shortages are bringing France\u2019s health system to the brink of collapse and putting patients\u2019 lives at risk. \u201cPublic hospitals in France are dying,\u201d wrote 660 medics from hospitals all over France in an unprecedented open letter, saying funding cuts were threatening patient safety in what was once seen as one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Doctors are calling for urgent government talks after nine months of hospital strikes, which began in March in emergency rooms and have since spread across departments from paediatrics to psychiatry, with junior doctors joining this month and no end in sight. On Tuesday, medics will march across France carrying banners saying: \u201cPublic hospitals: a life-threatening emergency\u201d. The long-running healthcare strikes are proving a major headache to the centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, with rail workers now adding to his troubles by carrying out nationwide stoppages against pension changes. Macron\u2019s pledge last month of more hospital funding and staff bonuses was rejected by doctors\u2019 groups as not enough. In 2000, the World Health Organization ranked France\u2019s health system the best of 191 countries. But a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, published in the Lancet medical journal in 2017, placed it in 15th place for quality of care. \u201cFor years we\u2019ve watched from afar with a lot of empathy as UK healthcare staff struggle under NHS funding cuts,\u201d said Cathy Le Gac, a Sud union representative, who worked for 19 years as a trauma nurse, dealing with serious car crash accidents north of Paris. \u201cAnd yet, now in France, funding cuts mean we\u2019re seeing similar problems to our NHS colleagues.\u201d For many years, governments on the right and left have reduced funding. Public hospitals in France have been forced to cut \u20ac9bn in spending since 2005, leading to the scrapping of hundreds of beds and dozens of operating theatres while stagnant salaries fuelled a flight to the private sector. Emergency room staff complain of elderly patients being left for hours on trolleys in corridors, not enough equipment, increased waiting times for operations and even deaths. At one Paris hospital this year, medics blamed staff shortages for the death of a 55-year-old woman on a trolley in a corridor, while the hospital management maintained staffing numbers were fine. Doctors also warn of staff suicides. More than 400 medical staff marched in Flers, Normandy, in September, after a senior member of the psychiatry department took his life with colleagues blaming poor working conditions. Adeline, 36, a nurse in a hospital in the south of Paris, said despite looking after ageing patients with multiple issues, staff shortages and cuts meant there was not enough time for proper equipment or washing patients. \u201cWe used to have big towels, now there are small towels that don\u2019t dry; our machines for reading blood pressure are old and there aren\u2019t enough of them,\u201d she said. \u201cEven crucial cream for our patients\u2019 private areas, to prevent sores \u2013 we used to have large tubs and are now given small tubes. Some services have no more bin-bags. The idea seems to be rot the health system from the inside and then say it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Like many nurses \u2013 whose pay is lower than in countries such as Germany, and who often live on the periphery of towns, struggling to make ends meet \u2013 Adeline took part in the gilets jaunes anti-government protests earlier this year. Unions said many nurses were quitting the profession due to burn-out. Fanny Rigaud, a healthcare assistant at a major Paris hospital, said: \u201cI work with young people being treated for leukemia. They\u2019re scared, we need to reassure them, that takes time but we\u2019re constantly under time pressure.\u201d In an effort to calm the tension, Macron has shifted his approach to the hospital crisis. For months he had maintained that hospitals and emergency rooms were struggling principally due to the way healthcare was organised, citing the lack of general doctors who should be treating patients in towns and rural areas. But last month he also acknowledged the need for more funding. \u201cWe must invest more than we first envisaged because the situation is worst than we had thought,\u201d he said. But the government\u2019s promise to give an extra \u20ac1.5bn over three years, including staff bonuses, was brushed aside as too little by medics, who vowed to continue the protests. The government also promised to absorb \u20ac10bn of debt from public hospitals. Some 87% of French people support the hospital strikes, according to ViaVoice pollsters, with the public deeply concerned about protecting universal healthcare as a pillar of the social system. Over 90% of people trust healthcare staff to do their best with limited resources. But crucially, 73% are pessimistic about the future for healthcare. Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant for Viavoice, said pressure was acute on Macron because \u201cwhile France is currently living a period of social crisis and tension, the health system is seen as a key right and common good that must be protected \u2013 a plank of the French social security system.\u201d Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Juven, a sociologist and research fellow on health systems at the French National Centre for Scientific Research, said: \u201cMedical staff feel there is so much pressure and time-constraint that they cannot do their jobs right, even though they want to.\u201d He said France valued its universalist system of protecting everyone \u201cbut inequalities in access to healthcare are growing in France, alongside great difficulties in hospitals, that\u2019s why this protest movement is going on for so long.\u201d Olivier Youinou, who had been working for almost 30 years as a highly specialised anesthetics nurse in a hospital in Cr\u00e9teil outside Paris, said: \u201cI had better working conditions when I started than I do today.\u201d",

That is the case for a certain species of tiger moth, which researchers have found displays a nonchalant approach when faced with potential predators, on account of its disgusting flavour. Dr Nicolas Dowdy, of the Milwaukee Public Museum and Wake Forest University in the US, found certain members of the Tiger moth family do not duck and dive from predatory bats with the same vigour as their counterparts. A study published in the Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution journal suggested this approach can pay dividends for winged insects, which have evolved a special chemical defence that makes them less palatable. Dowdy came to this conclusion after an experiment in which he released five species of tiger moth into an outdoor flight arena at night, where wild bats would frequently swoop in to feed. Using infrared cameras, he monitored interactions between the bats and moths, and recorded how often different species displayed evasive or nonchalant behaviour during a bat attack. Dowdy said: \u201cStrikingly, we observed that moths with weak or no chemical defences often dive away to escape bat attacks. However, moths with more potent chemical defences are more \u2018nonchalant\u2019, performing evasive manoeuvres less often.\u201d When considering why the insects did not just try to evade the bats anyway, researchers suggested that the method posed risks as well as rewards. Performing panicked evasive manoeuvres might help a moth avoid becoming dinner but it might also land it in a spider\u2019s web or away from a food source or mate. Dowdy speculated that unsavoury moths may often take the lazier and potentially safer option by relying on their chemical defences, rather than roll the dice on an emergency flight. Many creatures in the animal kingdom have evolved defence tactics to evade and deter predators. Ultrasonic hearing and mid-flight swoops and dives are some of the other tactics within the moth\u2019s arsenal. It may be possible that this relationship between palatability and nonchalance exists elsewhere in the animal kingdom but future studies are needed, said the researchers.",

And why is that surplus not concurrent with a strong economy?</p> <p>The answer lies in the changed nature of our economy, and also the changed nature of the mining boom.</p> <p>Generally the greater the level of profit an industry captures, the greater the number of workers it employs.</p> <p>If we look at the manufacturing industry we can see that back in the 1990s, when it accounted for around 35% of all business profits in Australia, it employed 12% of all workers. Now that its profits only account for 9% the share of workers it employs has also decreased:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Manufacturing industry share of total profits and employment\">  <iframe title=\"Manufacturing industry share of total profits and employment\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9cZKe/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now that seems pretty obvious \u2013 if an industry makes a bigger share of profits it will be growing and thus employing more people.</p> <p>But with mining the relationship is much weaker.</p> <p>Over this century mining has gone from accounting for just over 20% of total profits to now 37%, and yet in that time the level of workers in the economy it employs has risen from 0.9% to just 1.8%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mining industry share of total profits and employment\">  <iframe title=\"Mining industry share of total profits and employment \" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EoOxR/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In manufacturing a 5% increase in the share of total profits led to a 1% increase in the share of workers it employed; with mining a 5% increase in the share of profit led to just a 0.4% point increase in the share of workers.</p> <p>But the relationship is even more damaging now for our economy.</p> <p>During the 2000s mining boom, not only did we see an increased level of employment in the sector, but the wages it paid surged \u2013 and as a result the amount of total wages that went to workers in the mining sector also grew.</p> <p>But now we are in a mining export boom. And that is not a boom that needs workers. It is a greatly automated process that does not need masses of construction workers.</p> <p>As a result, we can see that while the share of total profits going to mining has soared over the past three years, the industry\u2019s share of total wages has not.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mining industry share of total profits and wages\">  <iframe title=\"Mining industry share of total profits and wages\" aria-label=\"Scatter Plot\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Po2xV/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And thus we have an economy where the government continues to get solid levels of revenue, even with the downgrades, but there is no flow-through to workers, either directly to the mining sector, or in flow-on impacts into other sectors which have workers whose skills are attractive to the mining sector and thus require strong wages to keep them from leaving.</p> <p>And so yes, we have a surplus, but we also have the worst GDP growth since the GFC, we have households shutting their wallets, we have wages growth remaining weak and continuing to be so for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>And we have the Reserve Bank needing to cut rates to record lows, and a prediction for even lower rates next year, because we also have a government determined to deliver a surplus even if it means economic growth continues to stagnate<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <p>\u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p>",

The massive downgrade in household consumption, which comes off the back of pathetic wages growth and overall flat real household incomes, has smashed the estimates for GST. Predictions for revenue this financial year are down $3bn, and $1.8bn of that is the GST. Revenue is also revised down $5.7bn in the following year and $11.8bn and $12bn in 2021-22 and 2022-23 respectively. But the overall level of revenue remains predicted to stay above 24.6% of GDP \u2013 well above the highest amount ever collected during the ALP\u2019s time in government: 23.2% of GDP in 2008-09. It highlights again that since the 1990s recession no government has delivered a budget surplus with revenue of less than 24.5%: For workers, however, we see just how pointless the surplus is. Far from suggesting good times and a booming economy flowing through to households, the Myefo yet again downgraded wages growth forecasts. This has been the standard operating procedure for every economic statement under the Coalition government. They promise a return to average wages growth, and then have to revise the timeline out another year or two. A return to 3% wage growth is now not predicted until June 2023, by which time it will have been a decade since we have had what was once average wages growth. The level of company tax revenue has been downgraded \u2013 but mostly in later years, and it remains well above what was anticipated two years ago: So if everything is so bad, how come we are still seeing historically strong tax revenue and predictions of a surplus? And why is that surplus not concurrent with a strong economy? The answer lies in the changed nature of our economy, and also the changed nature of the mining boom. Generally the greater the level of profit an industry captures, the greater the number of workers it employs. If we look at the manufacturing industry we can see that back in the 1990s, when it accounted for around 35% of all business profits in Australia, it employed 12% of all workers. Now that its profits only account for 9% the share of workers it employs has also decreased: Now that seems pretty obvious \u2013 if an industry makes a bigger share of profits it will be growing and thus employing more people. But with mining the relationship is much weaker. Over this century mining has gone from accounting for just over 20% of total profits to now 37%, and yet in that time the level of workers in the economy it employs has risen from 0.9% to just 1.8%: In manufacturing a 5% increase in the share of total profits led to a 1% increase in the share of workers it employed; with mining a 5% increase in the share of profit led to just a 0.4% point increase in the share of workers. But the relationship is even more damaging now for our economy. During the 2000s mining boom, not only did we see an increased level of employment in the sector, but the wages it paid surged \u2013 and as a result the amount of total wages that went to workers in the mining sector also grew. But now we are in a mining export boom. And that is not a boom that needs workers. It is a greatly automated process that does not need masses of construction workers. As a result, we can see that while the share of total profits going to mining has soared over the past three years, the industry\u2019s share of total wages has not. And thus we have an economy where the government continues to get solid levels of revenue, even with the downgrades, but there is no flow-through to workers, either directly to the mining sector, or in flow-on impacts into other sectors which have workers whose skills are attractive to the mining sector and thus require strong wages to keep them from leaving. And so yes, we have a surplus, but we also have the worst GDP growth since the GFC, we have households shutting their wallets, we have wages growth remaining weak and continuing to be so for the foreseeable future. And we have the Reserve Bank needing to cut rates to record lows, and a prediction for even lower rates next year, because we also have a government determined to deliver a surplus even if it means economic growth continues to stagnate. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

At a Senate committee hearing on Monday, Department of Human Services officials refused to provide any estimate or running total of the unlawful debts \u2013 despite government services minister Stuart Robert\u2019s assurances that only a \u201csmall cohort\u201d are affected. Ros Baxter, the deputy secretary of integrity and information, told the Senate community affairs inquiry that the department expects to have identified all affected welfare recipients \u201cearly in the new year\u201d and is preparing to write to those it has already found to explain why it has frozen debt recovery against them. Officials also revealed that \u2013 although the department has paused the use of income-averaging for raising new debts \u2013 existing purported debts could still be enforced through debt collectors and garnisheeing of tax returns until recipients are proven to be victims of unlawful averaging. In November the Morrison government abandoned sole reliance on income-averaging ahead of a landmark federal court case in which it conceded averaging was not a proper basis to claim the plaintiff, Deanna Amato, owed the commonwealth a debt. The changes triggered a massive review of purported debts that have already been issued \u2013 with the promise of refunds for all those calculated in whole or part using income average alone. On Monday, officials revealed that at least half of the department\u2019s 1,500 compliance staff have been reallocated to find recipients of dodgy debts and recalculate them. Baxter said it was \u201ctricky to know\u201d how much the clean-up will cost until the full cohort had been identified. In the midyear economic and fiscal update, the government noted the \u201crefinement\u201d to the program but said the effect on the value of recovery is not yet clear. Baxter repeatedly deflected questions about what proportion of debts are affected, saying only that at 31 August there were 734,000 online income compliance reviews which resulted in a debt, not all of which used income-averaging, and not all of which would have been calculated differently if it hadn\u2019t been. Staff have been told more than 220,000 debts may be affected. Asked how many debts using income-averaging have been identified so far, the general manager of information and integrity, Jason McNamara, replied \u201cwe haven\u2019t been counting [that] dataset\u201d. Baxter said she would \u201chate to give an inaccurate perception\u201d about how many debts had been identified for recalculation when the department is only part-way through the review process. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anthony Seebach, a general manager at Services Australia, said that its approach \u201cis to continue debt recovery\u201d until debts are identified in the affected cohort \u2013 meaning the Australian Taxation Office could garnishee tax refunds this year of people who will later be entitled to a refund. Nor have debts referred to \u201cexternal collection agents\u201d been recalled \u2013 unless and until they are identified as affected \u2013 he said. Baxter offered to \u201ctake on board the suggestion\u201d that the department should change its process so that when the ATO asks for permission to garnishee tax refunds, a separate check be undertaken so income-averaged debts are frozen at that point. Earlier, the ATO second commissioner, Jeremy Hirschhorn, revealed that from 2016-17 it had garnisheed 225,000 Australians\u2019 tax refunds to recover a total of $205m for unpaid Centrelink debts. Garnisheeing of tax refunds rose from 40,000 cases worth $32m in 2017-18, to 74,000 recoveries worth $63m in 2018-19 and 66,000 in the year-to-date for 2019-20, worth a total of $72m. Hirschhorn said the ATO cannot independently check whether income-averaging was used on a debt and the validity of a debt \u201cis a matter for DHS\u201d. \u201cWhether it is lawful is relevant \u2013 but we can only assume that a government agency issues lawful debts.\u201d Baxter noted the legality of robodebts is still being challenged through a separate federal court case and a class action. She took on notice questions about when the department received legal advice, and suggested the minister may make a public interest immunity claim to block disclosure. Baxter conceded the department had taken recent litigation into account when it changed the robodebt rules, but painted the move as part of an \u201congoing\u201d and \u201citerative\u201d process of improvement that predated the cases.",

Should good business be considered as important as rave reviews? <br><br>The dichotomy between great art and popular art is almost as old as art itself. This year in Australian cinema there was a profound disconnect between the best locally produced films and the ones audiences most wanted to see. Titles such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/24/ride-like-a-girl-review-cinematic-schmaltz-swamps-michelle-paynes-ride-to-the-melbourne-cup\">Ride Like a Girl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/06/palm-beach-review-unsatisfying-bubble-of-privilege-and-water-views\">Palm Beach</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/14/storm-boy-review-not-even-a-beloved-pelican-can-save-this-epic-downer\">Storm Boy</a>, for instance, did commendable business at the box office, but all were artistically wanting, to say the least. </p> <p>In this context, as always, the role of the critic is surely to separate the wheat from the chaff. To qualify for this list, films must have had either some kind of theatrical release this year outside the festival circuit or a direct-to-television/streaming release.

Sen-Gupta doesn\u2019t turn a blind eye to grim reality, nor does he prioritise verisimilitude over dramatically interesting storytelling.</p> <h2><strong>7.

      "bodyText": "Do impressive box office results indicate a film is worth seeing? Should good business be considered as important as rave reviews? The dichotomy between great art and popular art is almost as old as art itself. This year in Australian cinema there was a profound disconnect between the best locally produced films and the ones audiences most wanted to see. Titles such as Ride Like a Girl, Palm Beach and Storm Boy, for instance, did commendable business at the box office, but all were artistically wanting, to say the least. In this context, as always, the role of the critic is surely to separate the wheat from the chaff. To qualify for this list, films must have had either some kind of theatrical release this year outside the festival circuit or a direct-to-television/streaming release. Without further ado, here are the 10 best Australian films of 2019. 10. She Who Must be Loved The legacy of the soft-spoken but courageous media pioneer Freda Glynn, who founded Indigenous TV and radio networks across Australia, reminds us that humility and timidity are not the same thing. The film that explores her life (directed by her daughter Erica Glynn and produced by her granddaughter Tanith Glynn-Maloney) is part observational documentary and part detective story, with a mission to construct a historical narrative counter to the widely accepted (and deeply problematic) Judeo-Christian-centric view of Indigenous Australian culture and history. It is warming, alarming, touching and insightful. 9. Defend, Conserve, Protect Director Stephen Amis\u2019s pulse-pounding documentary \u2013 in effect, a high seas war movie \u2013 charts the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society\u2019s ninth campaign (titled Zero Tolerance, which took place from 2012\u20132013) during which it policed the world\u2019s only international whale sanctuary. While superpowered Marvel characters stomped across CGI-slathered landscapes, reversing time and defeating cartoon villains, Amis showed us something rare: real heroes in high-stakes situations, fighting a war that can never be completely \u201cwon\u201d. 8. Slam The writer-director Partho Sen-Gupta confronts difficult questions in his ethically complex Sydney-set mystery-drama, exploring Islamophobia and public perceptions of Muslim people. When a politically outspoken Palestinian-Australian slam poet (Danielle Horvat) disappears, many people, including her brother (Adam Bakri, whose commanding performance anchors the film), wonder whether she has been radicalised. A tangly plotline questions the motives of both the characters and the audience and plays with their expectations. Sen-Gupta doesn\u2019t turn a blind eye to grim reality, nor does he prioritise verisimilitude over dramatically interesting storytelling. 7. Little Monsters When a kindergarten excursion descends into a battle against a zombie outbreak (don\u2019t you hate it when that happens?) a teacher (Oscar winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o) takes a leaf out Roberto Benigni\u2019s Life is Beautiful, assuring her children that the drooling brain-munchers are part of a make-believe playtime experience. It\u2019s not easy to shake the ol\u2019 zombie genre back to life, but the writer-director Abe Forsythe (following up his black comedy Down Under) brings comedic flair, a vibrant pulse and party-like vibes to this effort. 6. Judy &amp; Punch The actress-cum-writer-director Mirrah Foulkes infuses an old moth-eaten narrative with contemporary zing, delivering a feminist retelling of the famously misogynistic fairytale, Punch and Judy. Mia Wasikowska and Damon Herriman are in fine form as the titular puppeteers, living in a 17th century village named Seaside, run by chauvinistic, panic-spreading religious zealots. A portrait of marital abuse and domestic violence morphs into a revenge story in the second half. Foulkes shrewdly balances dark and penetrative social commentary with an air of comically exaggerated theatricality; you laugh while your stomach turns. 5. Animals With notes of wastoid classics such as Withnail and I, director Sophie Hyde\u2019s Irish-Australian co-production follows two hard-partying best friends living in Dublin: 30-something hedonists Laura (Holliday Grainger) and Tyler (Alia Shawkat, best known from TV\u2019s Arrested Development). Like other classic texts about liver and sinus-busting celebrations, Animals contemplates the unthinkable: what happens when the party comes to an end? The performances are terrific, the script (adapting Emma Jane Unsworth\u2019s novel) is full of wit, and Hyde\u2019s direction is loaded with spirit and verve. 4. The Final Quarter Documentarian Ian Darling deploys an approach used in films such as Senna and Amy, using nothing but archival material (ie television footage and radio clips) to deliver a damning postmortem of the final years of the career of AFL legend Adam Goodes. This rousing film is less a documentary than a supercharged electric cine-essay, pulsing with energy and urgency. The other doco about Goodes released this year, The Australian Dream, is also recommended viewing. 3. Buoyancy Set and shot in Cambodia, writer-director Rodd Rathjen\u2019s feature film directorial debut explores modern-day slavery in the format of an exquisitely shot and edited coming-of-age film. Fourteen-year-old Chakra (an outstanding Sarm Heng) is determined to leave Cambodia in pursuit of a job in a Bangkok factory, but gets enslaved on a seafood trawler working for a terrible captain (Thanawut Kasro). Buoyancy (Australia\u2019s entry for best international feature film at next year\u2019s Academy Awards) is a powerful reminder of cinema\u2019s ability to provide a window to the world; its value as a medium that breaks down geographical borders and allows audiences to observe people and places outside their own experiences. 2. The Nightingale To express the power and impact of the writer-director Jennifer Kent\u2019s second feature film (following the brilliant The Babadook) one naturally feels inclined to reach towards turns of phrase such as \u201cgut-churning\u201d or \u201csoul-bruising\u201d or \u201choly hell this film hurts\u201d. Anything to make the point that this unforgettable revenge movie \u2013 set in 19th century Tasmania and following an Irish convict (Aisling Franciosi) as she tracks down a diabolical lieutenant (Sam Clafin) \u2013 packs one almighty punch. In addition to its brutality, the film is utterly elegant in construction, Kent juggling many elements including the painterly boxed-in cinematography of Radek Ladczuk \u2013 presented in 4:3 aspect ratio \u2013 and a haunting score from Jed Kurzel. 1. Acute Misfortune Thomas M Wright\u2019s scorching biopic of the artist Adam Cullen, adapted from journalist and Saturday Paper editor Erik Jensen\u2019s wild and compelling book of the same name is, like The Nightingale, a beautifully shot film presented in a 4:3 ratio. This narrower canvas has a claustrophobic effect, concentrating the drama and emphasising human faces. The most striking among these faces, in this instance, belongs to Daniel Henshall, whose brilliant and meditatively gloomy performance as Cullen is compulsively watchable. Acute Misfortune works on many levels, including as a rumination on the nature of Australian legend, posing the question of whether this country celebrates the wrong kind of people. It\u2019s the best and most interesting Australian biopic since Chopper in 2000.",

Consumer group Which? carried out a series of tests according to the electrical safety standard, which products must pass to be sold in the UK, on 13 products bought from third-party sellers across four online marketplaces, and two from high street retailers. Six of the 13 sets of Christmas tree lights bought through online marketplace sellers failed the testing and were deemed dangerous. AliExpress, eBay and Wish each sold two products that failed the tests. In two cases, control boxes on lights bought from AliExpress and eBay got so hot during a short-circuit test that they began to smoke and melt. The insides were left charred and the circuit board reduced to a molten plastic mess by the end of the test. Five products from Amazon Marketplace passed all the electrical safety tests, while lights from high street retailers John Lewis and Argos also passed.
