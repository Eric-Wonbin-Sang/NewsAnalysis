      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wrap this live blog up now. My colleague Sam Jones has filed a comprehensive take on the election that was supposed to unlock Spain\u2019s political impasse, but instead may well have made things worse. You can read his full story here. He concludes Spain is \u201conce again bound for months of negotiations and horsetrading as it tries to form a government at a time of unprecedented political fragmentation.\u201d Spain\u2019s politics remain in deadlock after the centre-left PSOE party of prime minister Petro S\u00e1nchez shed a handful of seats but still won the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years, but his left bloc fell well short of the 176 seats needed for a majority in parliament. Despite the far-right, anti-immigration Vox party more than doubling its previous score and the conservative People\u2019s party also making sizeable gains, the right was also left without enough seats to form a government after the liberal Citizens party lost four-fifths of its deputies and was all but wiped out. The major national parties\u2019 final scores, compared with their tallies in April\u2019s elections, were as follows: Left 157 seats: PSOE 120 (down 3), Podemos 35 (down 7), Mas Pais 2 Right 149 seats: PP: 87 (up 21), Vox: 52 (up 28), Citizens: 10 (down 47) Pedro Sanchez tells PSOE supporters the party has won a clear victory and assures those urging him not to cooperate with the conservative People\u2019s party that \u201cthis time, yes, we will have a progressive government\u201d. He called on all the country\u2019s other parties to be \u201cgenerous\u201d in helping to break the gridlock, and promised the PSOE would be too. It might be easier said than done. The leading daily El Pais sums up the results of a vote that was meant to break the deadlock in which Spanish politics has found itself since the last one seven months ago: A poll that was meant to unblock the political situation in Spain has served only to complicate it, with losses for the left, a recovery for the PP and a huge boost for the far-right Pablo Casado, leader of the centre-right People\u2019s party which made good much of the losses it suffered in April\u2019s election, has also appeared before party supporters: We have shown that we are strong, and that we will continue to serve the Spanish people. S\u00e1nchez has lost his gamble. We are going to see what propositions he puts forward, and then we will exercise our responsibility - this political gridlock in Spain can no longer continue. Albert Rivera, whose liberal Citizens party has lost 47 of its 57 deputies, says Spain had voted to \u201cvalidate the PSOE\u2019s victory. Spain wanted more Sanchez, but also more Vox - and less of the centre.\u201d Rivera added that his future was in the hands of the party\u2019s members: What we got today was an unmitigated bad result - with no excuses. Given these bad results I believe that as leader it is my duty to call an urgent extraordinary meeting of the party executive. So what coalitions might be theoretically possible to form a majority government in Spain\u2019s seemingly intractably hung parliament? El Pais columnist Jorge Galindo lists some of the options here - while noting that they may be mathematically feasible, but politically, probably not so much ... With more than 99% of votes now counted, the centre-left PSOE party of prime minister Petro S\u00e1nchez remains Spain\u2019s largest party after the country\u2019s fourth general election in as many years - but his left bloc has fallen well short of the 176 seats needed for a majority in parliament. Despite the far-right, anti-immigration Vox party more than doubling its previous score and the conservative People\u2019s party making sizeable gains, the right, too, was left without enough seats to form a government after the liberal Citizens party was all but wiped out. Having been ruled since April\u2019s inconclusive poll by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s caretaker administration, which failed to forge a coalition with either Citizens or the anti-austerity Podemos, the country now faces many more weeks - or months - of political deadlock and uncertainty. The major national parties\u2019 final scores, compared with their tallies in April\u2019s elections, were as follows: Left 157 seats PSOE: 120 (down 3) Podemos: 35 (down 7) Mas Pais: 2 Right 149 seats PP: 87 (up 21) Vox: 52 (up 28) Citizens: 10 (down 47) The far-right Vox party\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, is currently addressing crowds of supporters after its leap from 24 parliamentary seats to 52, making it the country\u2019s third largest party. \u201cLet\u2019s go get them!\u201d the party\u2019s supporters roar, as Abascal put its performance down to the fact it had \u201cled a cultural and political change by opening up all the forbidden debates and told the left that the story isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d Abascal added: \u201cThey don\u2019t have any moral superiority, and we have the same right to defend our ideas without being stigmatised and insulted as we still are by the media.\u201d Not to be outdone, Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy\u2019s far-right League party, has also congratulated Vox, adding: I bet the headlines are already ready - \u201cextreme right-wing victory, racists, sovereignists, fascists ...\u201d Not at all racism and fascism, in Italy as in Spain we just want to live peacefully in our own home. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s far right National Rally, has congratulated Vox and its leader Santiago Abascal for the party\u2019s \u201cspectacular advance\u201d: Since its return to democracy in 1975, Spain had been considered immune to the advance of the populist, anti-immigrant and far-right parties that have seen such electoral success in much of continental Europe. Respected El Pais columnist Jorge Galindo says that era has now come to an end: the 10 November elections \u201cconfirm the end of the Spanish exception in Europe: the Vox vote is already similar to that of the far right in Austria or the Netherlands\u201d, he says. With more than 50% of votes counted, it looks like a pretty good night for the centre-left PSOE; a very good one for the centre right PP; a spectacular one for the far-right Vox; a disappointing one for the anti-austerity Podemos and a truly dreadful one for the liberal Citizens. But above all, nether left the left nor the right bloc are anywhere near an absolute majority in the 350-seat parliament. The Guardian is now running live result updates which you can follow here. Here\u2019s Spain and Latin America specialist Michael Reid of the Economist with his view of the results so far: Results are now starting to come in - and Spain counts votes fast ... With nearly 23% of votes counted, the parties\u2019 scores and seats in the 350-seat parliament look like this: PSOE (centre left) 29.2% : 121 seats PP (conservative) 20.4% : 81 seats VOX (far right) 13.6% : 46 seats Podemos (anti-austerity) 12.4% : 32 seats Citizens (liberal) 35.6% : 10 seats Mas Pais (breakaway left) 1.6% : three seats With the far-right Vox party forecast by several late polls to become Spain\u2019s third-largest party, potentially winning as many as 60 seats in the 350-seat parliament, Guardian Madrid correspondent Sam Jones send this take: Although widely anticipated, Vox\u2019s apparent vault into third place - with almost 60 seats now predicted - is dramatic. Two years ago, the far-right outfit was viewed as an atavistic irrelevance. That changed, largely due to the Catalan independence crisis, in December last year when Vox won 12 seats in the Andaluc\u00edan regional parliament. It fared a little less well than predicted in April\u2019s general election, winning 24 seats. But helped once again by renewed tensions in Catalonia, Vox now seems on course to more than double its parliamentary presence. Its rise comes as the centre-right Citizens see their support collapse and the conservative People\u2019s party experiences a bounce back. The question now is what effect Vox\u2019s surge will have on the PP as negotiations begin to try to form a government. Teneo analyst Antonio Barroso pointing out the obvious, assuming the pre-election polls now being released prove anything like correct. With neither the right bloc nor the left approaching a majority in parliament, Spain is headed for more deadlock and more uncertainty: Javier Casquiero, the political correspondent of the leading Spanish daily, El Pa\u00eds, does the sums from public broadcaster RTVE\u2019s poll: In the worst case scenario, the right \u2013 the People\u2019s party, Vox and Citizens \u2013 would win 157 seats of the 350 in parliament, and in the best case 166. The left \u2013 the PSOE, Podemos and its breakaway party M\u00e1s Pa\u00eds \u2013 would have 147 seats in the worst case, and 156 in the best. At that point, speculation would begin of possible alliances with the regional and separatist Basque Nationalist party, Canaries Coalition and the Catalan nationalists. A second poll, carried out on Saturday and Sunday for the online news site EL ESPA\u00d1OL, is predicting roughly similar results, with the PSOE set to remain the largest party in parliament with between 112 and 118 deputies \u2013 as many as 11 down on its score in April\u2019s inconclusive elections. But the centre-left party\u2019s chances of forming a government \u201cwould depend on an arithmetic even more devilish than that of April 28, since the leftwing parties are even further from an absolute majority,\u201d the website said. \u201cSpain remains lost in a maze, with this election night not producing any solution to the institutional gridlock.\u201d The RTVE poll suggests the left (the PSOE party and anti-austerity Podemos) are on set to lose seats compared to April\u2019s vote, with the conservative People\u2019s party and far-right Vox making big gains. The big loser of the night looks set to be the liberal Ciudadanos (Citizens) party, which seems to be paying the electoral price for refusing to even contemplate entering a coalition with the PSOE seven months ago. Polls are now closed. This isn\u2019t an exit poll, but a survey conducted in the days immediately before the election which could not be published during the run-up to the vote. If it\u2019s borne out it looks like being an uncomfortable night for the centre-left prime minister Pedro Sanchez \u2013 it gives the rightwing parties the most votes, although well short of a majority. The poll, for Spanish state broadcaster RTVE, was of 13,000 people, conducted between 25 October and 10 November. Perhaps as a consequence of voter apathy, turnout at 6pm was 56.8%, nearly four points down on the same figure in the April 28 poll - but this is pretty much in line with recent November elections, so may not be significant. The Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones, has an evocative scene-setter for today\u2019s elections from Guadalajara, about 60km north-east of Madrid, where he found voters feeling \u201cfed up and defrauded\u201d after four elections in as many years: \u201cNone of the politicians here seems to get it. We can\u2019t go on like this. We can\u2019t go on with more and more problems and more and more unemployment. People keep saying things are getting better but they\u2019re not.\u201d You can read Sam\u2019s full report here. One thing to watch out for this evening will be the performance of the anti-immigrant, far-right Vox party. After entering the national parliament for the first time in April with 24 seats, Vox, which favours a radical recentralisation of Spain, has seen its popularity soar, largely on the re-eruption of the Catalan crisis, and could well double its previous score. The parliamentary spokeswoman for the centre-left PSOE party, Adriana Lastra, made clear that this was an election in which everyone\u2019s vote would count: \u201cWe have to stop them,\u201d she tweeted, none too subtly. \u201cGo and vote.\u201d Good evening and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Spanish general election. Polls close soon in Spain\u2019s fourth general elections in less than four years, with the centre-left PSOE of prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez on course to remain the largest party. But after an inconclusive result in April and unsuccessful coalition talks with the anti-austerity Podemos, which now seems to be shedding support, S\u00e1nchez again looks unlikely to win enough seats to be able to form a left-leaning government. The right, too, seems set to fall short of a majority, with pre-election polling suggesting the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) will do well and the far-right Vox could surge to become the country\u2019s third-largest party, but support for the liberal Cuidadanos is in freefall.

      "bodyText": "Two members of the so-called Nauru 19 have sought asylum in Australia ahead of a retrial this week. Lawyers say the trial has been rigged against the defendants, who have been denied any real legal representation. Squire Jeremiah and Rutherford Jeremiah arrived in Australia just days before a government-imposed travel ban, and have sought asylum ahead of a new trial ordered to begin on Monday. They join the wife of the former president Sprent Dabwido. Dabwido died in Australia after seeking asylum. The group, which now consists of 15 Nauruan activists and former politicians, are answering charges over 2015 protests against the expulsion from parliament of three MPs who had publicly criticised the government. Their prosecution and inclusion on a government-operated blacklist, was found to be a \u201cshameful affront to the rule of law\u201d by a judge who dismissed the case against them, only for himself to then be effectively sacked and prosecution restarted. \u201cWe the Nauru 19 protested because the Waqa government, including the current president, working in the Justice Department, illegally sacked and deported the judiciary and destroyed the opposition by expelling us from parliament,\u201d said former MP Squire Jeremiah. \u201cSince then we have been blacklisted, banned from travel, denied health care and persecuted. Our families too have suffered persecution at the hands of their own government.\u201d While some of the group pleaded guilty, most defended themselves before the prosecution was thrown out by an independently appointed judge, Geoffrey Muecke, in September 2018. However, Muecke was later sacked by the Nauruan government, then led by president Baron Waqa, and his ruling was overturned by a newly created court earlier this year, with the group\u2019s case sent back to the supreme court for trial. On Friday Judge Daniel Fatiaki, a controversial former Fijian chief justice, dismissed the Nauru 19\u2019s application for a permanent stay and for the Nauruan government to pay defence legal costs. He ordered a trial begin on Monday. One of the island\u2019s only two public legal defenders had told Fatiaki he could not reasonably represent all 15 in a group as directed, that he had not been given any deposition files. Muecke had said that a team of at least five lawyers would be needed for a fair trial. However Fatiaki said there was \u201cno fundamental right in this country that a trial cannot begin and continue in the absence of legal representation\u201d. \u201cA criminal trial in this country can begin, continue and end without a defendant being represented.\u201d Stephen Lawrence, an Australian lawyer who has previously represented the group, said it was a \u201ccontinuation of years of persecution\u201d. \u201cIt should be clearly understood that what has gone on in the Nauru supreme court in the last two weeks is a parody of justice,\u201d said Lawrence. \u201cWe are seeing the legal process deliberately used to achieve unfair and unlawful outcomes. How can 15 accused be put to trial without the government allocating one cent for the their defence?\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The late former Nauruan president Sprent Dabwido was also among the group. Before he died in May, he accused the government of holding his passport and preventing him from seeking cancer treatment overseas. He eventually sought asylum in Australia, where he lived out his final days. His wife, Luci Dabwido, has also sought asylum in Australia. \u201cThere will be no justice in Nauru for the Nauru 19,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband died because they didn\u2019t want him treated for cancer. Australian people would be shocked if they knew what is going on. I am calling on the president to end this case. End the unfairness and the persecution. Nauru needs to be united by strong leadership.\u201d Last week a new Australian-funded prison opened in Nauru, which the Nauruan government has been accused of building solely for the Nauru 19 group. In his 2018 judgment Muecke said the actions of the Nauruan government and its justice minister, David Adeang, were \u201ca shameful affront to the rule of law\u201d, and he granted a permanent stay of prosecution against the group and ordered the Republic of Nauru to pay more than $300,000 in court costs. Muecke said he considered the case to be a rare example of executive interference, virtually from the day of the protest. \u201cI consider that in denying the defendants legal representation and resisting their obtaining legal assistance, in imposing a \u2018blacklist\u2019, in forbidding any plea bargaining, and in publicly denouncing and vilifying the victims and those seeking to assist them, the Executive Government of Nauru has displayed persecutory conduct towards these defendants which is all the more serious in the unique context of Nauru,\u201d Muecke said. The Nauruan government has been contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Novak Djokovic does not expect Roger Federer to be scarred by the trauma of losing to him in the longest Wimbledon final of them all when they meet for the 49th time in London this week. Early evidence suggests that is a charitable assessment. After fifth-ranked Dominic Thiem beat Federer 7-5, 7-5 in the first round of the ATP Tour Finals on Sunday night, the 38-year-old Swiss will view his rematch with Djokovic on Thursday as he might an alp without skis. It was Thiem\u2019s third win this year over Federer. After his fifth defeat in seven matches against the Austrian, Federer said: \u201cHe played a tough first-round performance today, and my game was probably just not good enough.\u201d Of his next match, against Berrettini , he added: \u201cIt\u2019s a normal tournament from here on forward. Not allowed to lose any more. With his serve, with what he can do, obviously he\u2019s dangerous. I\u2019ve got to play better than today.\u201d Meanwhile Djokovic, the world No2, is poised to replace Rafael Nadal at the top of the rankings, and earlier took only 62 minutes to beat the young Italian, Matteo Berrettini, 6-2, 6-1. He is in awesome form. Djokovic and Federer spent nearly five hours together on Centre Court on the last Sunday of the championships in mid-July. It was a final Federer could have won. Federer said when he arrived in London on Friday he had long come to terms with that defeat. Selecting his words carefully, Djokovic was inclined to agree with him. \u201cI will not expect it, to be honest,\u201d he said of a Federer meltdown, \u201cbecause Roger\u2019s experience and mental strength have been almost unprecedented.

Both players arrive with reason to believe that this meeting should favour them. Thiem swaggers into this match-up after extending the head-to-head to 4-2 with two wins over the Swiss this year. Thiem produced a magnificent performance to defeat Federer on hard in the Indian Wells final, lasering winners at will from a set down to clinch perhaps the biggest win of his career. </p> <p>The most striking part of their recent battles has been how thoroughly Thiem has dominated the baseline rallies between them, often leaving Federer with little choice but to serve well and attempt to disrupt Thiem\u2019s rhythm while on the back foot.

Although Thiem has improved significantly and has planned his schedule more intelligently this year, the fast court should help Federer\u2019s serve and his first strike tennis. It should be a significant challenge for Thiem, who prefers slower courts that give him more time to set up his big swings.<br></p> <p>This match will likely be pivotal in deciding who qualifies for the semi-finals, so let\u2019s see who steps up tonight.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dc800eb8f08c2d1f80dd17a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T12:22:06.194Z\">12.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hello! </strong>Welcome to our coverage from day one of the ATP Tour Finals in London where the round robin group stage is just kicking off. Earlier in Group Borg, Novak Djokovic produced a statement performance by viciously dismantling debutante Matteo Berrettini 6-2 6-1 to open up the tournament. The players say that the courts are fast and the balls are bouncing low, and it certainly looks that way. It was a measure of Djokovic\u2019s incredible returning that he broke the Italian\u2019s booming serve 5 times in a row this afternoon. He begins as tournament favourite for a very good reason.</p> <p>This evening, attention turns to a huge match in the stacked Group Borg between Roger Federer and Dominic Thiem. Both players arrive with perfect preparation. Thiem has enjoyed the best season of his career, reaching his second Roland Garros final, winning his first Masters 1000 title and capturing five titles in total. Most importantly, he has established himself as a top player across all surfaces. His new partnership with former Olympic champion Nicolas Massu has been fruitful and they have worked hard on complimenting his heavy hitting with more variety.<br></p> <p>Federer endured one of the greatest heartbreaks of his career this year, falling to Novak Djokovic after holding double match point in their epic Wimbledon final. But beyond that, this has been another strong year for a 38 year old who improbably continues to compete with the best. A six time Tour Finals champ, Federer loves this event in general and he loves it even more with the faster courts this year. He won his fourth title of the year a few weeks ago by destroying the field at home in Basel so he comes into London both fresh and in great form.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T18:01:17.620Z\">at 6.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Finally, here is Kevin Mitchell on the first day of action at the O2 Arena. That was very fun and we\u2019ll do it all over again tomorrow when Stefanos Tsitsipas faces Daniil Medvedev and then Rafael Nadal squares up to Alexander Zverev. Until then. Few scorelines are quite as revealing as 7-5 7-5. It shows that both players were competing at a similar level throughout the entire match and they twice stood a game away from a tiebreak, but while Thiem responded so well to just about every one of the many tight situations he found himself in, Federer\u2019s game simply didn\u2019t stand up to the pressure. This seems like another step forward for Thiem in a year filled with them. He was 0-3 in his opening match at the ATP Finals in previous years and 3-6 overall. There is still a long way to go, but he has given himself a great opportunity to survive the group stages for the first time in his career and he looks determined to do so. For Federer, losing in straight sets could prove extremely costly. But it should be noted that he was absolutely abysmal in his first match against Nishikori last year yet still made it into the semi-final. There are more twists to come so let\u2019s see what the Swiss still has up his sleeve. Mr Dominic Thiem in his on-court interview: It was a great performance. My first opening win here at the finals. It\u2019s every single time overwhelming and breathtaking to enter this arena, especially if it\u2019s packed like that. I think we had a good and close match and of course it\u2019s always something special to beat Roger as he is an absolute legend. I love to play against him and learn a lot, so thanks a lot. Well it not because of that [his 5-2 record] that I love to play him, it\u2019s because it\u2019s amazing to play against probably the best player of all time, to play against a real legend like that. But, yeah, luckily I have a pretty good record against him and I try to play positive against him all the time [laughing]. These games where I have to serve out is always a struggle. Especially that you don\u2019t get any presence from him. He will put every return in he can, play all the rallies and, of course, play a little bit on nerves. It\u2019s not every day to play in this arena against Roger so I\u2019m very happy that I pulled it through in the last game. A brilliant win for Thiem, who played so well under pressure today. He was clearly feeling it there, with a couple of loose errors and then a routine backhand slice into the net bringing up break point. But Thiem eradicated the break point with a big first serve. After netting a forehand on his first match point and eventually finding himself facing a second break point, Thiem did what he has done all day and continued to attack with his back to the wall. From break point down, he crushed two brilliant forehand winners before sealing the match with a service winner. A sublime performance. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 5-6* Dominic Thiem: Dominic Thiem breaks! The level has been quite similar from both players, but Thiem has played so much better under pressure today. After a missed backhand from Federer to open the game, Thiem saw his opportunity and blasted through it, crushing a forehand to bring up 0-30. A bad backhand volley from Federer followed by a netted forehand and that\u2019s that. Thiem to serve for the match. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 *5-5 Dominic Thiem: After landing 56% of first serves in the opening set, Dominic Thiem is serving at 70% so far in the second set. The scoreline reflects it as he pieces together a solid hold to 15, sealed with a monstrous 130mph first serve down the T. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 5-4* Dominic Thiem: As Thiem continues to hold firm in tight situation, Federer once again fails to close another lead. After speeding to 40-15, Federer sprayed a forehand long and then floated a backhand out after a solid return from Thiem. The chance was there for Thiem after a missed first serve from the Swiss at deuce, but Thiem blasted his return well long. Federer held with a dynamic move to the net, closed out with a great backhand volley. Tense moments in the O2 Arena. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 *4-4 Dominic Thiem: Once again, Dominic Thiem faces 30-30 as Federer piles on the pressure and once again the Austrian finds a first serve and lasers an inside-out forehand winner into the corner. On the game point, Federer was absolutely crushing the ball, but Thiem held firm on top of the baseline and it was eventually Federer who dumped a forehand into the net. The confidence is quite stunning. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 4-3* Dominic Thiem: What a messy game! Federer led 40-0 and looked well on his way to another easy hold, but then Thiem connected with a great return followed by a booming forehand down the line. On the final game point, Federer had quite an easy smash after some great defence from Thiem, but he only went and dumped it into the net! However, Federer continues to serve well and eventually he escaped by sealing the hold with a big serve and forehand combo. The pressure is building. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 *3-3 Dominic Thiem: It is such a delight to see Dominic Thiem oozing with confidence on an indoor hardcourt. Very few of his holds have been easy in this set, but he is coming up with gems whenever his back is to the wall. At 30-30, he connects with a classic sliding wide serve followed by a forehand down-the-line winner. He holds with more booming forehands. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 3-2* Dominic Thiem: One of Federer\u2019s many underrated strengths is his ability to shrug off missed break points and respond with great serving. He does so once again, holding to 15 with ease. Federer is serving 81% of first serves in this second set. Once again, he is in a rhythm, but will it last? First set: Roger Federer 5-7 *2-2 Dominic Thiem: An absolutely incredible hold from Domninic Thiem to stay in touch. Federer finally made a move in a return game, crunching a backhand down the line to set up break point. After a long, long break point in which Federer defended valiantly then found a brilliantly angled forehand, Thiem connected with a stunning forehand down the line on the run to scupper the danger. After some big serving, Thiem held by following a booming forehand into the net and slamming down a smash. Another mini-battle goes in the Austrian\u2019s favour. A question from Tony: \u201cI wonder if Dom has been inspired by the exploits of his partner - \u2018kiki\u2019 - down in Perth? \u201c You would hope so! That was an inspirational performance from Kiki Mladenovic this morning, who defeated number one Ashleigh Barty and captured all three rubbers for France to seal their 3-2 win over Australia in the Fed Cup final. Even I\u2019m inspired. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 2-1* Dominic Thiem: Some beautiful points from both players here, with Thiem chasing down every last ball, throwing up a great defensive lob and eventually finishing the point at the net to bring up 15-30. But Federer scuppers the danger with some great serving and a loud cry of \u201clet\u2019s go!\u201d A great forehand winner by Federer to seal a very good hold. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 *1-1 Dominic Thiem: Thiem still isn\u2019t serving at his highest level and he opened the door for Federer by missing a first serve 30-30. Federer dumped the return into the net, then sprayed a forehand wide to helpfully hand the Austrian a hold. That was bad. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 1-0* Dominic Thiem: Federer is right back to his dominant serving, capturing his first hold to 15. Five first serves in, four points won, sealed with a big service winner down the T. Clearly, Federer is generally serving well today but he cannot afford any more loose service games. First set: Roger Federer 5-7 Dominic Thiem: Dominic Thiem holds firm to take the first set! Much like Federer, Thiem stared down a daunting 30-30 situation on his serve. Unlike Federer, rather than balking, Thiem stepped in and scuppered the danger with a brilliant forehand down the line winner. He took the set with more blistering forehands. Despite some solid serving from Federer throughout the middle of the set, Thiem started the match the more fearless player and he ended the set in the same manner. Nothing less will suffice at this event. First set: Roger Federer 6-5* Dominic Thiem: Thiem breaks! After streaming through his last four service games and finding such a great rhythm, it\u2019s Federer who blinks first. Federer fought back well from 0-30 to 30-30, but then he badly mistimed a forehand and shanked a backhand long. One bad service game and now Thiem has the chance to serve out the set. First set: Roger Federer *5-5 Dominic Thiem: Another solid hold from Thiem, who is starting to find his first serve again. He seals a hold to 30 with a big service winner and puts the pressure straight back on the Swiss\u2019s shoulders. First set: Roger Federer 5-4* Dominic Thiem: Federer responds with another quick hold of his own. He is still serving at an extremely impressive 75% of first serves and backing it up by flitting to the net whenever the opportunity arises. Both men look so confident behind their serves at the moment, but we\u2019re moving into the business end now. Who will blink? First set: Roger Federer *4-4 Dominic Thiem: Thiem still won\u2019t be happy with his first serve percentage (48%), but he will be satisfied with how swiftly he has navigated his last few holds really well and continues to step in and fire missiles. This is high quality tennis from both now and the games are moving fast. First set: Roger Federer 4-3* Dominic Thiem: Federer pieces together another solid hold to keep himself ahead. Some beautiful play from him; he wrestled control of the first point before finishing the long exchange with a forehand winner, then he slipped into the net and placed a great backhand volley winner. He held with a forehand drive volley winner. Federer is moving forward whenever he can. First set: Roger Federer *3-3 Dominic Thiem: Good work from Thiem to break the run of three games for Federer with a solid hold. He opened with a booming crosscourt forehand and held with another big forehand. Despite the errors, he\u2019s still stepping into the court and taking the initiative whenever he can. First set: Roger Federer 3-2* Dominic Thiem: While Thiem began to miss too many first serves in his previous service game, Federer seems to be finding his rhythm on serve. He pieces together a second really solid service game behind plenty of first serves. It\u2019s early days, but Federer\u2019s first serve percentage is 73%. Thiem\u2019s? 43%. First set: Roger Federer *2-2 Dominic Thiem: That break did not last very long, did it? Thiem is determined to play this match entirely on his terms, but after a couple of early bruising forehands, he sprays a couple of groundstrokes. Great work from Federer to take the first break point with a solid backhand down the line. We\u2019re back on serve. First set: Roger Federer 1-2* Dominic Thiem: Federer gets on the board with a trademark love service game sealed with an ace. It only lasted about a minute. First set: Roger Federer 0-2* Dominic Thiem: Thiem consolidates his break with aplomb, opening his service game with a service winner and closing it with a big forehand after a first serve. The Austrian\u2019s first serve is already purring and he is finding his forehand behind it. He is here to play. First set: Roger Federer 0-1* Dominic Thiem: That was some start from Dominic Thiem. After Federer nets a simple backhand volley, Thiem slots a brilliant forehand crosscourt winner on the run before bringing up break point by forcing an error with a great, deep forehand return. Federer gallantly saves two break points, but he shanks a forehand wide on the third. If you elect to serve first, you better hold. Roger Federer and Dominic Thiem are out on the court. Federer won the toss and elected to serve. All out attack. In the doubles this evening, second seeds \u0141ukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo edged out Ivan Dodig and Filip Pol\u00e1\u0161ek 4-6 6-4 10-5. Earlier today, Britain\u2019s Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram of the United States fell 6-3 6-4 to Raven Klaasen and Michael Venus. Do check out Kevin Mitchell on Djokovic\u2019s swift victory earlier today. Novak Djokovic will be watching this match keenly. Here is the Serb\u2019s assessment of Thiem earlier today: I think he was mentioning earlier in the week that this has been probably his best season, winning at home in Vienna, and of course that was a very important win for him. Indian Wells. We know how good of a player he is on clay. He\u2019s been proving that he can play equally well on other surfaces. He\u2019s already established top-5, top-10 player. We don\u2019t need to talk about his qualities. Quality is great. His dedication and professionalism and hard work ethics is fantastic, and he\u2019s a really nice guy. So all positive things about him. His coach, Nico Massu, that I have known for many years and I have played against him, as well, they are a great team and they deserve to be here. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how he plays against Federer tonight, and then we\u2019ll see after that. So, who will win? It\u2019s a tough question. Both players arrive with reason to believe that this meeting should favour them. Thiem swaggers into this match-up after extending the head-to-head to 4-2 with two wins over the Swiss this year.

On the other hand, the pair played here last year and Federer easily dealt with Thiem 6-2 6-3. Although Thiem has improved significantly and has planned his schedule more intelligently this year, the fast court should help Federer\u2019s serve and his first strike tennis. It should be a significant challenge for Thiem, who prefers slower courts that give him more time to set up his big swings. This match will likely be pivotal in deciding who qualifies for the semi-finals, so let\u2019s see who steps up tonight. Hello! Welcome to our coverage from day one of the ATP Tour Finals in London where the round robin group stage is just kicking off. Earlier in Group Borg, Novak Djokovic produced a statement performance by viciously dismantling debutante Matteo Berrettini 6-2 6-1 to open up the tournament. The players say that the courts are fast and the balls are bouncing low, and it certainly looks that way. It was a measure of Djokovic\u2019s incredible returning that he broke the Italian\u2019s booming serve 5 times in a row this afternoon. He begins as tournament favourite for a very good reason. This evening, attention turns to a huge match in the stacked Group Borg between Roger Federer and Dominic Thiem. Both players arrive with perfect preparation. Thiem has enjoyed the best season of his career, reaching his second Roland Garros final, winning his first Masters 1000 title and capturing five titles in total. Most importantly, he has established himself as a top player across all surfaces. His new partnership with former Olympic champion Nicolas Massu has been fruitful and they have worked hard on complimenting his heavy hitting with more variety. Federer endured one of the greatest heartbreaks of his career this year, falling to Novak Djokovic after holding double match point in their epic Wimbledon final. But beyond that, this has been another strong year for a 38 year old who improbably continues to compete with the best. A six time Tour Finals champ, Federer loves this event in general and he loves it even more with the faster courts this year. He won his fourth title of the year a few weeks ago by destroying the field at home in Basel so he comes into London both fresh and in great form.",

He is doing well because our fans love him. Its good to see him scoring and it is good to see him recognise that we are important for him as well. Seeing Richarlison being a Brazilian international is fantastic for me and seeing how he is playing and how the fans love him as well. He deserves it.\u201d Last week Silva launched a staunch defence of Richarlison after accusations that the forward goes to ground too easily and the Portuguese admitted he broached the subject at a meeting with Mike Riley, manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited, on Thursday. \u201cI am here to protect my players until the end,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI have to work with them and we are working with Richarlison to be stronger. I said something to the referees about that situation but Richarlison is not a diver. He is a worker, he is a big, big talent and I repeat: zero yellow cards [for diving] in two seasons and a half.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "You can read Tom Dart\u2019s match report here. The Seattle Sounders are an MLS success story, setting a new standard for club ambition and supporter fervor. They won a few US Open Cups, but the grand prize eluded them for nearly a decade. Until today, they still hadn\u2019t scored a goal in MLS Cup even though they won the trophy once. Even when the goal finally happened, it was an own goal -- no matter what the statisticians say. They were overshadowed by LAFC, which ran away with the Supporters Shield this season, but this is a club with quality. The quirks of MLS sometimes turn up some fluke champions, but the Sounders are as worthy a champion as the league has ever had. And Seattle will be a fun place to be for the next week. Thanks as always for following along today. See you next time. The Canadian club will feel aggrieved, claiming a foul in the buildup to the first goal after dominating possession for a half and more. But they can only blame themselves for creating very little out of all that possession. It was a comfortable day for former Toronto keeper Stefan Frei apart from one superb save, and Toronto simply capitulated after conceding the goal. Then a superb finish from Victor Rodriguez gave Toronto an even longer path back. Then Toronto made the fatal mistake of letting Ruidiaz sneak past them. For the second time in four years, the Sounders are MLS champions. A cross, a header from the spot, and you have to wonder if he could\u2019ve made a difference had he been fully healthy. 90 min+2: Seattle make a final defensive substitution, mostly to provide Ruidiaz with a ceremonial farewell. 90 min: The goal was Route 1. Literally. A long pass up the middle. Mavinga is far too casual with it, and Ruidiaz simply slips past him. We\u2019ll have five minutes of stoppage time. Well, that\u2019ll do it. After an injury brings action to a fault for an eternity, Toronto make an absolute mess of things, letting Ruidiaz take the ball off a defender for a breakaway and a chip. The defender was Mavinga, who has had a simply awful game. 87 min: The second-best chance of the game for Toronto, as a ball is lobbed into defender-turned-forward Omar Gonzalez, who collides with Frei and sandwiches a defender in the process. ABC informs us that the first Seattle goal has been credited to Leerdam. The commentators disagree, as would anyone who was actually watching. The ball was going well wide until it hit Morrow. 86 min: There is absolutely nothing to suggest Toronto will get back into this match. I say this hoping I will jinx things and set up a grandstand finish. 85 min: Jordy Delem is now replacing Seattle-born Jordan Morris, who gives a hug to a teammate and strides off the field with the speed of an electric car whose battery has run down to zero. 83 min: Same thing now from Toronto that we saw all game. Possession. Nothing resembling a chance. Toronto have only had one half-decent chance all game, the shot by the since-withdrawn Benezet in the first half. 81 min: The U.S. president isn\u2019t here, but you can\u2019t escape politics these days: 80 min: Good attack from Seattle, but the AR\u2019s flag stops it. Toronto have managed nothing at all for a long time. Here\u2019s the goal that may clinch it: 78 min: How do you get instructions to your captain in a loud stadium? Send a note with your substitute. Richie Laryea enters for Toronto and hands a piece of paper to Michael Bradley while the ball goes around them, in play. Let\u2019s give credit to referee Allen Chapmen here for a second. Toronto clearly fouled Lodeiro as he was laying the ball off to Rodriguez. The ref let play continue, and Rodriguez ripped the ball to the lower right corner from the top of the box. 75 min: Seattle didn\u2019t commit many numbers forward on that corner, but they\u2019ve managed to maintain possession. Mavinga hobbles back on, but Toronto are preparing another substitution. 74 min: Toronto haven\u2019t recovered from surrendering the goal. They may be forced into another substitution, with Mavinga limping off just as Seattle take the corner. 73 min: A mess in the Toronto defense forces Westberg into an awkward save with his own defender running straight at him. The result is another Seattle corner. 71 min: Altidore also holds the ignominious distinction of playing 70 Premier League games for Sunderland and Hull while only scoring two goals. Elsewhere, he has been very successful. He blasted his way onto the MLS scene as a teenager before going to the Netherlands and scoring at will. 68 min: Jozy Altidore scored against Spain in the 2009 Confederations Cup when the USA pulled off a historic upset. Since then, he has been alternately cheered and vilified by U.S. supporters. He\u2019s on now for Toronto, to a chorus of boos. But Seattle remain on the front foot and force a save from Westberg. 67 min: Lodeiro and Morris combine on Seattle\u2019s right flank and think they\u2019ve won yet another corner for the Sounders. They have not. 65 min: Attendance announcement: 69,274 fans have packed the stadium. Most of them are quite happy right now but will be fretting as Toronto\u2019s attack gets more dangerous. Jozy Altidore is tying his shoes. And still tying them. That\u2019s a long camera shot of someone tying his shoes. 64 min: Now Toronto must press forward and leave some holes at the back. Frei finds himself under pressure with the ball at his feet before passing to the only defender in sight. 62 min: Toronto introduce Nick DeLeon, whose superb goal knocked out Atlanta United in the semifinals. Tsubasa Endoh is the player to depart. 61 min: ABC reminds us of what Justin Morrow would surely like to forget -- he missed from the spot for Toronto in 2016 against Seattle, leaving the door open for Torres to net the winner. 60 min: Seattle\u2019s Victor Rodriguez, once on Barcelona\u2019s books and a La Liga veteran, goes into the game to replace fullback Brad Smith, which seems a touch odd. That was unusual. We did mention before the game that Kelvin Leerdam was good at getting forward down the right flank. He finds some space in the box and fires. It hits the unfortunate Justin Morrow and promptly nestles in the lower left corner. In their sixth half of action against Toronto in MLS Cups, the Sounders have finally scored, even if it took a Toronto defender to do it. 56 min: Same as the first half -- a lot of Toronto possession with no incisive play to make it matter. 54 min: A new approach for Toronto, eschewing the flanks to let Pozuelo beat 6-7 Seattle players before his final pass is played out to safety. 53 min: They\u2019re getting snarky in Canada ... 51 min: And Benezet will surely maintain his lead in that mysterious Player Index after taking a hard shot from his preferred spot at the upper right corner of the box (from Stefan Frei\u2019s perspective). Another solid block from the green wall. 50 min: Toronto\u2019s Benezet has just claimed the lead from Seattle\u2019s Torres in the MLS stat breakdown called the Audi Player Index. Is any bonus money at stake there? 49 min: Jordan Morris has switched sides to the right, which may not be for the best if he can\u2019t do more with it at the end of one of his runs than he did there. Promising run but obvious discomfort as he tried to figure out what to do next. 48 min: A nice Toronto attack, and the ball is laid back to Delgado, whose shot is well-blocked. 47 min: Seattle doing something it didn\u2019t do through the entire first half -- maintain possession. It\u2019s in their own half, but it\u2019s something. Before we start the second half, let\u2019s see the other save that has kept this match scoreless: First order of business for MLS offseason: Avoiding a player strike. Stats favoring Toronto: 83% pass completion, 65.1% possession edge Stats favoring Seattle: 8-2 corners The Seattle PA is featuring another Seattle musician -- Jimi Hendrix. Macklemore is one of the Sounders\u2019 co-owners. Call them the Watford of the Pacific Northwest. I have no earthly idea what to make of this ... Terrific pressure from Toronto, but aside from forcing one terrific save from Frei, they haven\u2019t done much with it. Seattle look dangerous going the other way but just can\u2019t keep the ball. 45 min: CHANCE and as I type that, Ruidiaz nicks the ball away from Omar Gonzalez and forces Westberg into a point-blank save. Toronto have had the better of play, but Seattle has had as much of a chance of scoring as the visitors. 45 min: As we\u2019ve been reminded many times now, Seattle have yet to score against Toronto in all these MLS Cups. The Sounders lifted the trophy in penalties once but have not yet done anything in regulation. 43 min: Toronto hail right back Auro Jr., who has been causing all sorts of problems. 41 min: Lodeiro neatly plays the ball away from danger with his stomach, which is especially impressive considering the ball was under him. Looked like a pilates class for a moment. Here\u2019s why we\u2019re scoreless ... 40 min: Now Seattle are defending for their lives. Multiple lunging tackles just to get the ball out of immediate danger and into slightly less immediate danger. 39 min: Toronto with some possession that would be threatening if the Sounders hadn\u2019t put most of their team and probably a few players from the Seattle Seahawks in their own box. Quite a few bodies back there, neatly camouflaged against the green field. 38 min: A kind word from Twitter ... And a tweet from Seattle\u2019s favorite sons ... 36 min: CHANCE, and it\u2019s a stellar save by Frei, who quickly sprawls to his left to paw away a well-driven low shot by Benezet. Kim clears it from there. 35 min: The crowd reaches a crescendo for the third corner, but it\u2019s collected by Westberg, and everyone calms down. Svensson concedes a rather pointless foul to give Toronto a free kick from 30 yards out. It\u2019s cleared, but Toronto maintain possession and ... 34 min: And another. 33 min: Michael Bradley now appears to be playing every defensive position at once. This time, he\u2019s to the left of his own goal to block the ball away from Torres, who has adventurously crept up from the Seattle back line. Another corner. And another. 31 min: Brad Smith plays a nice 1-2 with Lodeiro and crosses, only to see it blocked away by Michael Bradley, whose work rate has never been questioned. Seattle win a corner. And another. And it\u2019s starting to feel as if the home side are finally getting a grip on the game besides the occasional counter. 30 min: A bit of boring midfield back-and-forth until the Sounders decide to liven things up by blasting the ball back toward Stefan Frei with a bit more venom than a keeper would like from a backpass. Toronto win a corner, and Frei flies out to punch it away. 28 min: The odd thing here is that Seattle seem to be playing as if they\u2019re the underdogs. They\u2019re not. They earned home field here by having a better record than Toronto, which has had 61% of possession according to a TV graphic that I can\u2019t verify because I\u2019m not using a stopwatch. 26 min: Michael Bradley gets a bit of space 25 yards out and decides to go for glory. The ball rolls harmlessly wide. 25 min: From the dean of the U.S. soccer press corps ... 23 min: The ball and Ruidiaz get past Mavinga, but those two objects are not really in proximity to each other, and nothing results from it. I did referee a game earlier today, so yes, I do feel that I can question the second-guessing of our commentators. Take a recertification class and THEN argue with me. So there. 21 min: Brad Smith gets forward on the left for Seattle, which inspires the crowd. The ball pings around for an eventual Sounders corner, which lands at the feet of the onrushing Torres to volley over the bar. Best chance so far for either team. 20 min: Another Mavinga foul at midfield, this time on Lodeiro. ABC\u2019s Taylor Twellman doesn\u2019t see a foul, but he\u2019s incorrect. 18 min: Now Mavinga has to do some actual defending against Ruidiaz, whose pressure forces the Toronto defender to boot it out of play. Seattle reclaim the ball and send the ball in to Ruidiaz, who has little room to put his header on frame. 16 min: And a bit of pain the other way as Mavinga whacks Ruidiaz in the back. Michael Bradley has a discussion with the ref, but it\u2019s hard to see why he\u2019s doing that except that he\u2019s Michael Bradley. 15 min: Seattle defender Kim Kee-hee inflicts a bit of on Alejandro Pozuelo by stepping on the Spaniard\u2019s ankle. Toronto maintain possession and win a corner that looks a bit dangerous but is cleared. 13 min: Seattle\u2019s talisman Ruidiaz gets the ball to the left just outside the box and sends a cross to the far side that bends a bit too much and goes out of play. 12 min: Now Toronto gets a bit of possession in the Seattle box (OK, fellow refs -- \u201carea\u201d), and Benezet his a square pass to Osorio near the spot. He only has a narrow slot between defenders to shoot and puts it into Frei\u2019s hands. 10 min: Michael Bradley floats a ball into the box. It\u2019s headed upward and rather fortunately arcs gently into the hands of Stefan Frei. The Seattle crowd loves that, but it\u2019s not the best sign for the Sounders defense. 9 min: THERE\u2019S the crowd noise. Jordan Morris picks up a pass and goes 3v4, then beats his defender with a burst of speed and unleashes a quick shot on goal. Westberg covers rather easily, but that\u2019s a nice bit of inspiration for a Seattle team that has been pinned back for a while. 8 min: A patient buildup from Toronto now, again working it wide to marauding right back Auro. A bit of pressure forces another rushed Seattle clearance. This is good from the visitors. 7 min: Toronto is putting on some pressure now, forcing Leerdam to escape to the outside and clear, only for TFC to regain possession. 6 min: Our commentators have mentioned the noise many times already, but we\u2019re not hearing much on the broadcast. Some singing and a little bit of percussion, as you\u2019d expect. 4 min: Our first shot on goal is from Toronto\u2019s Benezet, and it\u2019s rather speculative from outside the box. Toronto worked the ball nicely down the right and switched fields well but may have rushed things a bit. 3 min: Seattle has a good spell of possession and wins a corner. J.R. in Illinois asks why Seattle doesn\u2019t have a grass surface, pointing out that the argument of \u201cit\u2019s too rainy\u201d doesn\u2019t stand up when English clubs make do with the same amount of precipitation. It\u2019s a good question, here and in Portland. Maybe someone will spring for retractable fields someday. 1 min: Lodeiro starts us with a tone-setting tackle at midfield. The crowd will compare favorably to any soccer gathering in the world today. The Pacific Northwest not only has large crowds but also the best tifo displays. (This picture is just a taste. Much bigger displays have been on the broadcast.) Kickoff is in ... now. Neither team is supposed to be here. In the West, LAFC ran away with everything -- until Seattle upended them in the conference final. In the East, Toronto struggled through a middling season but dumped out both East-leading NYCFC and defending champion Atlanta United on the road in the thrilling new MLS single-game playoff format. Debate the fairness of crowning a champion through league play or Cup play all you want. After the game. Each of these teams claims a place in pushing MLS forward. Toronto came into the league in 2007 and quickly established a reputation for having some of the largest and liveliest crowds in the league. Seattle joined MLS in 2009 and took things up a notch. Previous attempts to put MLS teams in NFL stadiums had looked dreary, with pockets of fans scattered throughout vast stands. Seattle was different. They sometimes cover part of the stadium and limit ticket sales to just under 40,000, but for some games, the whole stadium is available -- and loud. Atlanta United has duplicated that success on the other side of the country. Toronto starting lineup The irony here is that this Canadian club features two of the most debated players in recent U.S. history, midfielder Michael Bradley and forward Jozy Altidore, the latter of whom is on the bench after a late race to get fit for this final. Defender Omar Gonzalez had the misfortune of being credited with an own goal in the USA\u2019s loss to Trinidad and Tobago that kept them from World Cup 2018. At the time, he was playing in Mexico, but he joined Toronto this summer. The leading scorer is Alejandro Pozeulo, from Spain via several seasons in Belgium. Goalkeeper Quentin Westberg was long one of those players followed via long distance by U.S. soccer geeks. He has spent almost all of his life and professional career in France but represented the U.S. at youth lineup and moved to Toronto this season. Jonathan Osorio and Marky Delgado have been lining up in the midfield with Bradley for a few years now. Nicolas Benezet has only played eight games this season, starting five. Tsubasa Endoh also has played less than half of TFC\u2019s games so far. Justin Morrow played both of the last two MLS Cups vs. Seattle on the left side. He\u2019s joined on defense by Gonzalez, young Brazilian Auro Jr. and French player Chris Mavinga. Seattle starting lineup The tip of the spear is a strong one. Forward Raul Ruidiaz, who has been nicknamed \u201cThe Flea\u201d and \u201cthe Peruvian Messi,\u201d has been a consistent scoring threat in his first full season with Seattle. He\u2019s also connected to a country that has had a strong taste of success recently -- Croatia, from which his mother\u2019s family hails. Uruguayan midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro is a staple in Seattle. Two more midfielders, Jordan Morris and Cristian Roldan, are on the U.S. national team. These days, we\u2019re not sure if that\u2019s a compliment. The rest of the midfield is from Trinidad and Tobago (Joevin Jones) and Sweden (Gustav Svensson). Goalkeeper Stefan Frei, who used to play for Toronto, has been on this stage a couple of times now. Korean defender Kim Kee-hee anchors the backline alongside Panamanian defender Roman Torres, who has been to a couple of MLS Cups along with Frei and converted the winning kick from the mark in the first Seattle-Toronto MLS Cup matchup in 2016. Kelvin Leerdam, a Dutch player born in Suriname, provides some scoring punch from right back. Australian Brad Smith, who played a few games for Liverpool in the mid-2010s, is on the left. What time is kickoff? Never a simple question when you\u2019re talking about a U.S. soccer broadcast, which mimics other U.S. sports by having a pregame show for its pregame show. The Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s Jonathan Tannenwald is plugged into the TV scene and says 3:08 p.m. Eastern time, which is surprisingly quick. But national anthems here tend to take 20 minutes, so you never know. Good afternoon to the East Coast, good morning to the West Coast, good caffeinated overnight to Australia and much of Asia, and good evening to those in Europe who watched Liverpool beat Manchester City and are hoping for a closer game here. Funny thing about that -- MLS is a league of salary cap-enforced parity, and yet we have the same two teams in the final for the third year in the last four. Should be a fun one in any case. Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Graham Ruthven\u2019s lookahead to today\u2019s final.",

      "body": "<p>It is the hardest thing in any sport to make astonishingly difficult things look astonishingly simple. With 13 minutes gone at Anfield Liverpool produced a piece of play that seemed to stop the day, a perfect little miniature of bold, simple lines, carved across the pitch, like a Mir\u00f3 line drawing.</p> \n<p>It took six seconds, four touches and three diagonal movements for the ball to travel from right-back to left wing, back to inside-right, then back again into the left-hand corner of the net. The moment of ignition came from Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold, who looked up and played one of those lofted cross\u2011kicks, full-back to full-back.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Fabinho leaves Manchester City fuming and helps Liverpool go eight points clear</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Andrew Robertson took one touch and hared into the space ahead of him. His pass back across into Mo Salah\u2019s path had a gorgeous symmetry, 45 degrees back the other way and perfectly weighted, making Fernandinho hop and lunge, erased from the game by the precision of the delivery. Salah had time to measure his stride before nodding the ball back across Bravo in perfect symmetry with the angle of that first pass.</p> \n<p>There will of course be an urge to talk about VAR, because there must always be an urge to talk about VAR. Perhaps Alexander-Arnold might have been called for a handball in the build-up to Liverpool\u2019s first goal. He wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t. Perhaps Salah\u2019s finger might have been offside for the second (it wasn\u2019t, or it wasn\u2019t enough).</p> \n<p>How far do we really want to go with this? Liverpool did not win this game because of marginal refereeing decisions. This is simply wishful thinking, subjectivity bending the lines and frying the brain. For all his misdirection, his insistence during the game that Manchester City had been wronged, robbed, betrayed by the gods of the video screen, Pep Guardiola will know this better than anyone else.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ee862f80-63ac-459c-9782-4dcc9ed4599b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qkey_npSOVo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps he might also dwell on the way Liverpool\u2019s decisive strengths here, the key actors in that Mir\u00f3 ball goal, mirrored his own team\u2019s weaknesses. What kind of Pep-coached champion team comes to Anfield to play a game like this with a raggedy back-up goalkeeper, a makeshift centre-half, the remains of John Stones and a tyro left-back?</p> \n<p>Guardiola\u2019s arrogance is one of the things that makes him successful. Guardiola\u2019s arrogance is also one of the things that makes him vulnerable. Why would you play Angeli\u00f1o here, a left-back who has never been to Anfield, who has four Premier League games behind him but found himself up against the strongest right-hand side in European club football?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/pep-guardiola-calls-on-referees-chief-for-explanation-on-handball\">Pep Guardiola calls on referees\u2019 chief for explanation on handball</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>City have signed one centre-half in the past two and half years. In that time one has retired. Another has gone. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi has fallen through the floor. Buying from a position of strength is always an optimistic tactic. Buying in a position of weakness when you aim to be the best club side in the world, well, that\u2019s just common sense.</p> \n<p>And yet Guardiola hasn\u2019t bought, he has shown a kind of disdain for a position, a role that simply doesn\u2019t fire his imagination.

      "bodyText": "It is the hardest thing in any sport to make astonishingly difficult things look astonishingly simple. With 13 minutes gone at Anfield Liverpool produced a piece of play that seemed to stop the day, a perfect little miniature of bold, simple lines, carved across the pitch, like a Mir\u00f3 line drawing. It took six seconds, four touches and three diagonal movements for the ball to travel from right-back to left wing, back to inside-right, then back again into the left-hand corner of the net. The moment of ignition came from Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold, who looked up and played one of those lofted cross\u2011kicks, full-back to full-back. Andrew Robertson took one touch and hared into the space ahead of him. His pass back across into Mo Salah\u2019s path had a gorgeous symmetry, 45 degrees back the other way and perfectly weighted, making Fernandinho hop and lunge, erased from the game by the precision of the delivery. Salah had time to measure his stride before nodding the ball back across Bravo in perfect symmetry with the angle of that first pass. There will of course be an urge to talk about VAR, because there must always be an urge to talk about VAR. Perhaps Alexander-Arnold might have been called for a handball in the build-up to Liverpool\u2019s first goal. He wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t. Perhaps Salah\u2019s finger might have been offside for the second (it wasn\u2019t, or it wasn\u2019t enough). How far do we really want to go with this? Liverpool did not win this game because of marginal refereeing decisions. This is simply wishful thinking, subjectivity bending the lines and frying the brain. For all his misdirection, his insistence during the game that Manchester City had been wronged, robbed, betrayed by the gods of the video screen, Pep Guardiola will know this better than anyone else. Perhaps he might also dwell on the way Liverpool\u2019s decisive strengths here, the key actors in that Mir\u00f3 ball goal, mirrored his own team\u2019s weaknesses. What kind of Pep-coached champion team comes to Anfield to play a game like this with a raggedy back-up goalkeeper, a makeshift centre-half, the remains of John Stones and a tyro left-back? Guardiola\u2019s arrogance is one of the things that makes him successful. Guardiola\u2019s arrogance is also one of the things that makes him vulnerable. Why would you play Angeli\u00f1o here, a left-back who has never been to Anfield, who has four Premier League games behind him but found himself up against the strongest right-hand side in European club football? City have signed one centre-half in the past two and half years. In that time one has retired. Another has gone. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi has fallen through the floor. Buying from a position of strength is always an optimistic tactic. Buying in a position of weakness when you aim to be the best club side in the world, well, that\u2019s just common sense. And yet Guardiola hasn\u2019t bought, he has shown a kind of disdain for a position, a role that simply doesn\u2019t fire his imagination. It is a failure of management, albeit one that comes from the same place as his strengths, the same will that allows him to build a team who play with such beauty when they have the ball. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s achievement is to produce a team capable of exposing this weakness here, and doing so with a performance that owed much to another bravura display from the attacking parts of its own defence. Guardiola has been credited with revolutionising the role of the full\u2011back. You wouldn\u2019t have guessed it here as his team were cleaved apart for that crucial second goal by Liverpool\u2019s own variations on the full-back as left- and right\u2011sided playmakers. Alexander-Arnold was, once again, sublime here. His range of passing from right-back is a thing of beauty. His calmness, his physical strength, his ability to cover the ground allow him to dominate his flank. He sees the whole picture from inside his own half. One to pass and one to run: Robertson was an urgent, thrusting menace on the other flank, a \u00a37m player coached into phenomenon at this level. Robertson and Alexander\u2011Arnold played 21 long passes in this game, compared to seven by Kyle Walker and Angeli\u00f1o. Virgil van Dijk was, as ever, a wall. But either side of him it was Liverpool\u2019s full-backs who dictated the rhythms of this victory. It should come as no great surprise.

Next week it\u2019s the BLACKPOOL special \u2013 kick off is at 7.05pm, so don\u2019t be late for the Glitterbus; I\u2019ve thoroughly steam cleaned it after last year, and will bring a selection of finger sandwiches. In the meantime you can find me Twitter @heidistephens \u2013 thanks for coming, and have a good week! Hx Mike has been on a transformative Strictly journey, and his mum has even started Zumba. It\u2019s a heartfelt goodbye from both of them, then they take to the floor to Take That\u2019s \u2018Rule The World\u2019. Mike gets his head jammed in Katya\u2019s crotch, and now they\u2019ve started a Conga. Best farewell dance ever. All the judges vote for Michelle and Giovanni (obviously), which means MIKE AND KATYA are leaving Strictly. He\u2019s had a good run and improved enormously since the beginning, but that\u2019s absolutely the right decision. Michelle and Giovanni\u2019s American Smooth is still fabulous, despite the faffing abaaaht at the beginning and Michelle being dressed as a bottle of toilet duck. Dance off time! Mike is doing the banana dance again. It is much as it ever was. I\u2019ve still never been to Blackpool, Every year I\u2019m tempted to blag Strictly tickets and go, but that would mean missing the liveblog and the opportunity to get annoyed about superfluous backing dancers. Incidentally, I really don\u2019t get the love for Chris \u2013 he must have had a HUGE public vote score to end up ahead of Michelle and Giovanni. He\u2019s not a great dancer, nor is he particularly funny or charming; I am entirely at a loss as to his appeal. Karen, however, is entirely fierce and I love her. So who is joining Michelle and Giovanni in the dance off? I\u2019ve accepted that one of Mike or Chris will be going to Blackpool, but I may tip over the edge if it\u2019s both of them. Kelvin and Oti are safe, along with Emma and Anton and Chris and Karen! Which means MIKE AND KATYA are in the dance-off. I\u2019m not sure if there has ever been a dance off that\u2019s more of a done deal, but it\u2019s reasonable to assume that Michelle and Giovanni are safely off to Blackpool. As is traditional on Remembrance weekend, the Strictly stars are helping to sell poppies in what looks like Waterloo station. My sister is a serving member of the RAF and laid a wreath in Stamford today, whilst my dad and brother-in-law both marched as RAF veterans at the Cenotaph. Am hugely proud of all of them. Up in the Clauditorium, I am entirely in love with Shirley\u2019s dress. It\u2019s DIVINE. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of actor Luke Evans, arguably the most square-jawed human ever to cross the Severn Bridge. He\u2019s singing \u2018Bring Him Home\u2019 from Les Miserables, presumably for lols because I can\u2019t find any evidence that he\u2019s ever played Valjean other than in his own shower. Ooh this song gives me the shivers, AND we get bonus barefoot Johannes and Amy! Is Amy on some kind of retainer with the Blackpool Tourist Board? Well, did NOT see that coming. Michelle and Giovanni scored 36 last night, and were second of the leaderboard \u2013 they should absolutely not have been in the bottom two. So unless viewers decided to punish Michelle for that ghastly dress, I\u2019m guessing people assumed they were safe and voted for those in a slightly more shaky position. VOTE FOR YOUR FAVES, PEOPLE. So who is safely on the way to next week\u2019s Blackpool extravaganza? Karim and Amy are safe, along with Alex and Neil and Saffron and AJ. First couple in the bottom two: MCHELLE AND GIOVANNI! WAIT, WHAAAAT? Last night on Strictly: A bag of (mostly) delights, including a high energy Jive from Alex and Neil, a saucy housewife American Smooth from Michelle and Giovanni, and a hiptastic Salsa from Kelvin and Oti. Saffron and AJ waltzed their way to the top of the leader board, whilst Mike and Katya Paso-ed their way to the bottom. Please for the love of all things Strictly can we let them go \u2013 Mike has run his course and Katya looks like a woman on the edge. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess caught in a fishing net of blue sequins, Claudia in a rather fabulous dinner jacket. Tonight\u2019s pro dance is a Remembrance Sunday special, featuring stories of families sending their loved ones off to battle, to Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u2018Time After Time\u2019. A hauntingly beautiful and moving tribute, I am quite undone. If you missed Countryfile Casual Weather earlier, it was presented by the delightful Nick Miller, resplendent in jeans, black belt and a burgundy plaid shirt with rolled up sleeves. Could have undone another button there Nick, but a casual effort nonetheless. Evening all, and welcome back for some Sunday night Strictly results! Hopefully you all had a love-filled, reflective and peaceful Remembrance Sunday, and have dried out after the Blackpool Bingo last night. Based on the performances and leaderboard, we should be waving goodbye to either Chris or Mike this evening \u2013 which one won\u2019t be get a seat on the Blackpool funbus? Kick off is at 7.20pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! Thanks all for joining in down below and being amazing as always \u2013 I\u2019m off to read your comments and have a retrospective sip of wine for every one of the mentions of Blackpool \u2013 was anyone keeping count? I\u2019ll be back tomorrow at 7.20pm for the results, so join me then! Enjoy the rest of your Saturday x So that\u2019s it for the dancing, and the voting is open! Saffron and AJ are at the top of the leaderboard, whilst Mike and Katya have sunk to the bottom. Lots of dances I loved this evening \u2013 loved Alex, Michelle, Saffron and Kelvin. Can\u2019t see how Mike and Chris won\u2019t be facing off in the dance off, either one of them could go home tomorrow and if I\u2019m honest I don\u2019t much care which. Scores: 8,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 35 and a happy finish all round. Motsi loved the speed and body movement, and Shirley was impressed with the lifts, although there were a couple of timing issues. Bruno thought it was a Salsa in top gear, and Kelvin\u2019s hips were turbo charged. Craig couldn\u2019t really enjoy it because Motsi was screeching all the way through, but it was \u2018hiptastic\u2019. This has a motor racing theme, because Kelvin is an actual racing car driver. But never mind that, look at Kelvin\u2019s HIPS. They\u2019re more fluid than my nan\u2019s custard, and quite hypnotic to watch. He also has nice bounce, but between Kelvin\u2019s hip action and Oti\u2019s splits it\u2019s quite hard to take it all in. A bit scrappy in places, but I definitely want an invitation to Kelvin\u2019s lovin\u2019 one man show. And finally tonight it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! This week they\u2019re dancing the Salsa to \u2018Let\u2019s Hear It For the Boy\u2019 by Deniece Williams, one of my absolute favourite songs of the 1980s. However I can strongly recommend not attempting to sing it at karaoke; it\u2019s surprisingly high and just gets higher, until only dogs can hear you. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Saffron and AJ. So much screaming. Craig calls AJ a clever cherub \u2013 that was absolutely gawjus. Motsi thought it was the best dance she\u2019s seen on her first Strictly. Shirley thought they made it look easy, whilst Bruno was swept away \u2013 it was a dance of the highest quality. Four tens, anyone? Saffron appears to have embraced the poppy theme with gusto, although on a flesh-coloured dress it looks a bit like a nasty rash. This is, however, rather a charming Waltz, with nice flow and lovely rise and fall from Saffron. Her frame goes a bit awry towards the end, but generally quite lovely \u2013 easily my favourite dance of theirs. Who\u2019s next? It\u2019s SAFFRON AND AJ! This week they\u2019re dancing the Waltz to another insipid cover \u2013 this time Ellie Goulding\u2019s John Lewis version of Elton John\u2019s \u2018Your Song\u2019. I really want to love this partnership more, but I find myself unmoved. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re both lovely people, but there\u2019s no chemistry for me \u2013 it\u2019s like watching two plastic dolls bumping into one another. I need more of a connection and a bit more fire. Scores: 8,9,8,8 \u2013 a total of 33 for Emma and Anton. Bruno loved all the Fosse references, Emma was in her element although there were a couple of occasions when they weren\u2019t mirrored. Craig thought it was understated and stylised \u2013 very much Emma\u2019s dance. Motsi loved it too, and Shirley loved the use of music and the details \u2013 one of Emma\u2019s better dances. Is there some law that states all Jazz dances have to be done in a bowler hat? A few balance issues at the beginning, but some nice footwork from Emma and some good hat action. I don\u2019t really get this type of dancing, not really my cup of tea - also why does this song sound like the theme to the Flintstones? Next up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! It\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice week for them, and they\u2019ve chosen a Theatre/Jazz routine to \u2018Right Now\u2019 by The Pussycat Dolls. Since Faye and Giovanni\u2019s Theatre/Jazz CC was one of the most memorable dances of last year, this is hugely risky. But if we consider the alternative of Anton doing street dance or interpretive contempo-waft, it\u2019s probably for the best. Scores: 9,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Michelle and Giovanni. Shirley thought it was sophisticated and sassy \u2013 naughty and nice from Michelle. Bruno loved the flawless storytelling, and the little touches Michelle gave to the character. Craig thought Michelle was the mistress of detail, he loved it. Motsi always buys what Michelle is selling \u2013 they use technique in the right way so she can really feel the dancing. So Michelle is a housewife trying to please her man, but Giovanni is having none of it. Changing that ghastly dress might be a good start. I love the storytelling of this American Smooth, it\u2019s a lovely build of attitude to the finish and Michelle is an absolute queen. LOVED that. It\u2019s time for MICHELLE AND GIOVANNI! This week they\u2019re dancing the American Smooth to \u2018I Just Want To Make Love To You\u2019 by Etta James. Alison Hammond and Aljaz danced the Foxtrot to this back in 2014, but I\u2019m very much hoping that Michelle will turn the sass dial up to 11 and Giovanni will give us full Diet Coke Break realness. Scores: 5,7,7,7 \u2013 a total of 26 for Chris and Karen. Motsi loved serious Chris, but the footwork could have been cleaner. Shirley enjoyed the focus and how he led the dance, and the footwork was fairly decent. Bruno appreciated the purpose, the intent and the content, but he looked like he was walking it in places. Craig thinks Chris seriously needs to up his game to stay in the competition, it was technically lacking. Oooh, flames! Chris has a great Tango face, but from the neck down this lacks drive and precision. Mostly this a lot of wandering about, with pigeon toes in hold. A nice effort, but less of a Tango and more of a grumpy stroll. Next up it\u2019s CHRIS AND KAREN! This week they\u2019re dancing the Tango to \u2018Survivor\u2019 by 2wei, the inspired cover of the Destiny\u2019s Child anthem. Sorry, \u2018inspired\u2019 was a typo, I meant \u2018insipid\u2019. Chris is definitely a survivor, and yet I have no idea why or how. Scores: 6,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 30 for Karim and Amy. \u2018I don\u2019t know how I got that\u2019, says Karim. Neither do I, Karim, neither do I. Craig points out that there were two large mistakes and too much rise and fall, and Motsi wants Karim to overcome his nerves and gain more focus. Shirley thought it lost some of the quality in hold, but it was disappointing for Karim. Bruno liked the sense of stormy romance, if Karim had managed to get it right it would have been fantastic. Ooh, they\u2019re up a lighthouse! This is a pretty Viennese from Karim , although Amy\u2019s chiffon wings are rather distracting and it all feels a bit tangly. Too much rise and fall and not Karim\u2019s best dance, but charming nonetheless. It\u2019s time for KARIM AND AMY! This week they\u2019re dancing the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Give Me Love\u2019 by Ed Sheeran. Their Quickstep last week earned them three tens, so they\u2019ve got a lot to live up to this week. But Karim is the precision dancer in this year\u2019s competition, I don\u2019t suppose a Viennese is going to give him any trouble. Scores: 5,7,7,6 \u2013 a total of 25 for Mike and Katya. Bruno appreciated the effort, but it needed more power and was too heavy and rigid. Craig thought the shaping at the beginning showed promise but it had no flow. Motsi liked the focus and the characterisation, it was without a doubt a great Paso. Shirley was impressed by Mike\u2019s solo start and he led the dance well \u2013 a good effort despite the lack of flow. Mike opens with a nice bit of stompy flamenco, and if you ignore his free arm this absolutely isn\u2019t the worst Paso we\u2019ve ever seen. However his Spanish line isn\u2019t quite happening, and mostly Katya is using him as a pole to dance around. Also not sure about the weird knee balance finish. Next up tonight (slot of death, Mike\u2019s time is up) it\u2019s MIKE AND KATYA! This week they\u2019re dancing the Paso Doble to \u2018Tamacun\u2019 by Rodrigo y Gabriela. This is a proper Paso tune, for what I\u2019m guessing will be anything but a proper Paso. Reading this week\u2019s Terms &amp; Conditions \u2013 Clara Amfo off of Radio 1. I love her, and that catsuit is incredible. Scores: 7,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 31 for Alex and Neil. Shirley thought Alex did very well, she was light on her feet and looked like she was having the time of her life. Bruno thought it was bright, lively and sunny \u2013 Alex is growing in confidence and her timing was great, but her leg retractions need to be a bit sharper. Craig thought Alex\u2019s balance was slightly off and needed more attack in the kicks and flicks, but she was working it. Motsi thought they looked like a couple who have got new life in their relationship after one of them had an affair. TOO SOON. Neil appears to be dressed as your grandad, whilst Alex has been line dancing in custard. Loving the energy of this Jive, and great to see Alex in her absolute element \u2013 she\u2019s got the stamina and her personality is shining through. The footwork is a bit soft in places but definitely one of my favourite Jives this year. First up tonight it\u2019s ALEX AND NEIL! This week they\u2019re dancing the Jive to \u2018Let\u2019s Twist Again\u2019 by Chubby Checker. More than happy to hear the original version of this, rather than the Jive Bunny butchered version. Good to see Neil back on the dancefloor this evening, I think it was a bit touch and go whether he\u2019d be dancing this week. Thanks for everything Kevin, but your Grimsby harbour jigsaw isn\u2019t going to finish itself. Meanwhile the stars descend the Strictly stairway \u2013 some absolute frock horrors this week, Michelle looks like a pine fresh magic tree. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in one-shouldered gold foil (including a random tail), and Claudia in a black pearly halterneck. Thanks for the drinking game nod, Clauds. Chin chin to you too. And we\u2019re off! First Blackpool mention! DRINK! Last week on Strictly we waved goodbye to society zookeeper Emma Weymouth and the lovely Aljaz. This week, the pressure is on, because they all want to go to Blackpool. Three or four Blackpool mentions there. Get stuck in, people. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo is a ONE WORD SPECIAL, as is traditional in Week 8 - take a sip of your favourite tipple for any mention of BLACKPOOL. Only very small sips, mind; the NHS is already in crisis and I don\u2019t wish to add to their burden. Evening all, and welcome back for another spin around the Strictly dancefloor! It\u2019s the pre-Blackpool warm-up week, where seats on the Glitterbus are being allocated on a strictly first-come first-served basis. With only eight couples left, things are starting to heat up a bit down in Heidi\u2019s Hunches. Chris and Karen and Mike and Katya are very much the weakest remaining links, and history tells us that they\u2019ll both probably go over the next two weeks now they\u2019re both running out of personality-driven dances and the judges have no choice but to judge their actual technique. I\u2019d put Emma and Anton in the danger zone too, but they\u2019re playing their Couple\u2019s Choice joker this evening, which seems to guarantee you nines even if you just rock up and do the Macarena in your underwear. Group 1: one eye on the final \u2013 Kelvin and Oti, Michelle and Giovanni, Karim and Amy Group 2: hot on their heel leads \u2013 Alex and Neil, Saffron and AJ Group 3: couple\u2019s choice free pass \u2013 Emma B and Anton Group 4: dodging the dance-off \u2013 Mike and Katya, Chris and Karen Kick off is at 6.50pm, so get ready to sprinkle a little joy and sparkle in the comment box below. See you then!",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 November.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Vast swathes of New South Wales and Queensland are on maximum bushfire alert,</strong> with the greater Sydney region <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/10/nsw-and-queensland-fires-sydney-to-face-catastrophic-fire-danger-for-first-time\">facing catastrophic fire danger for the first time</a> since ratings were introduced. More than 80 fires continue to burn in blazes that have claimed three lives and destroyed at least 150 properties. High temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions are expected to exacerbate operations on Tuesday. The prime minister has announced disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child, while visiting affected areas alongside the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. Mid-north coast resident Terri Nicholson said she was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the scale of the fires in northern NSW. \u201cIt\u2019s quite intense to see ancient, iconic rainforest burn \u2026 and see firefighters here risking their lives and just to see global heating in action.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The unidentified intelligence official who sparked the presidential impeachment inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/10/trump-impeachment-whistleblower-public-hearings-schiff-democrats-republicans\">will not testify publicly</a>, </strong>amid committee concerns that \u201cPresident Trump and his allies\u201d will \u201cfacilitate efforts \u2026 to threaten, intimidate and retaliate against\u201d the individual. The inquiry concerns the president\u2019s alleged bargaining of $400m in aid to Ukraine in return for investigations into his political rivals, which first came to light after the whistleblower raised concerns over a 25 July phone call between the two heads of state. Public hearings begin Wednesday, which is expected to bring the inquiry on to the national stage \u2013 and become a key battleground for public opinion ahead of the 2020 election.</p> <p><strong>An Iranian man who spent six years detained on Manus Island has returned to Iran</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/10/designed-to-torture-asylum-seeker-chooses-iranian-prison-over-png-detention-centre\">just nine weeks after being transferred to a new facility in Port Moresby</a>, where he says the conditions are so stifling they\u2019re \u201cdesigned to torture people\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 November. Top stories Vast swathes of New South Wales and Queensland are on maximum bushfire alert, with the greater Sydney region facing catastrophic fire danger for the first time since ratings were introduced. More than 80 fires continue to burn in blazes that have claimed three lives and destroyed at least 150 properties. High temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions are expected to exacerbate operations on Tuesday. The prime minister has announced disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child, while visiting affected areas alongside the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian. Mid-north coast resident Terri Nicholson said she was \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the scale of the fires in northern NSW. \u201cIt\u2019s quite intense to see ancient, iconic rainforest burn \u2026 and see firefighters here risking their lives and just to see global heating in action.\u201d The unidentified intelligence official who sparked the presidential impeachment inquiry will not testify publicly, amid committee concerns that \u201cPresident Trump and his allies\u201d will \u201cfacilitate efforts \u2026 to threaten, intimidate and retaliate against\u201d the individual. The inquiry concerns the president\u2019s alleged bargaining of $400m in aid to Ukraine in return for investigations into his political rivals, which first came to light after the whistleblower raised concerns over a 25 July phone call between the two heads of state. Public hearings begin Wednesday, which is expected to bring the inquiry on to the national stage \u2013 and become a key battleground for public opinion ahead of the 2020 election. An Iranian man who spent six years detained on Manus Island has returned to Iran just nine weeks after being transferred to a new facility in Port Moresby, where he says the conditions are so stifling they\u2019re \u201cdesigned to torture people\u201d. Facing a potential prison sentence in Iran, the man, alongside five of the other 51 asylum seekers transferred to the Bomana facility, has abandoned his asylum request. Detailing a lack of access to legal support or family, a lack of books and writing materials, and meagre rations that leave those inside perpetually hungry, the man said a dozen asylum seekers have attempted self-harm, with most failing to receive medical attention, and some moved away to isolation cells. Australia The Norwegian government is set to make more from oil and gas drilling in the Great Australian Bight than Australia, according to the findings from a new study that suggests Norway could make $8.1bn from resources in the region over the next 40 years. A Coalition bill to increase sentences for child sex offenders could receive crossbench support, with Labor divided over the inclusion of mandatory minimum sentences which the shadow attorney general believes may undermine the bill. Allegations of terrorism against a 70-year-old Australian man held in detention in Vietnam are \u201cabsolutely false\u201d, according to his wife who has petitioned the prime minister to fight for retired baker Chau Van Kham\u2019s release. The world Bolivian president Evo Morales has agreed to fresh elections after international monitors found \u201cclear manipulations\u201d in the 20 October poll, including a 24-hour halt during counting after which Morales claimed victory. A hundred members of a Mormon community have arrived in the US after a violent attack in Mexico that killed nine women and children, believed to have been conducted by a significant drug cartel. Cambridge academics have written in protest to the British Home Office, detailing major concerns about the UK\u2019s future research potential, after a talented research fellow was denied leave to remain in the country. A prominent Russian history professor has been arrested with a backpack containing a woman\u2019s arm, St Petersburg police have confirmed. It\u2019s alleged the 63-year-old fell into a river while attempting to dispose of body parts of a former student. Recommended reads Anger and frustration, stories of self-harm and suicide \u2013 the \u201cmost important inquiry\u201d in 25 years sees federal senators hear firsthand from Newstart recipients. Sixty-one-year-old Deborah, a factory worker for 30 years, speaks of her humiliation and desire for basic dignity through a living wage. With the Newstart allowance remaining the same, in real terms, since 1994 and with more than 3 million Australians living in poverty, the hearings have been well-received from the business community. But Scott Morrison remains unmoved, writes Luke Henriques-Gomes. It\u2019s the activist group credited with helping Commonwealth Bank get out of coal in five years, but why is the government starting to target what it calls the \u201cradical activist group\u201d Market Forces and what concrete legislation does prime minister Scott Morrison have in mind to curtail business-focused activism? Adam Morton talks to the group\u2019s executive director Julien Vincent about an organisation that moved from an anti-capitalist space and now finds unlikely backers from within the orthodoxy. Darwin is often stereotyped as Australia at its most ocker \u2013 a place you come to crack a cold one and skim-read an NT News article about blokes wrestling crocs. But the city is so much more than just a gateway to Kakadu, writes Katie Cunningham. It\u2019s more a south-east Asian city than a desert outpost. \u201cPalm trees dot the city and humidity hugs you year-round. Thai sweets, Cambodian pancakes and bowls of Vietnamese pho are sold alongside even more laksa.\u201d And that\u2019s before you get to the Indigenous art, museums and spectacular open-air installations such as Bruce Munro\u2019s Tropical Light exhibition. Listen Does Australia need a religious freedom bill? That\u2019s the question posed in this episode of Full Story, as Laura Murphy-Oates is joined by David Marr and Paul Karp. There\u2019s one such bill before parliament to be discussed in coming months \u2013 and critics say instead of protecting vulnerable people, it could act as a licence for hate. Sport France have denied Australia a memorable Fed Cup victory, defeating Ash Barty and Sam Stosur in the fifth and final rubber, 6-4, 6-3. Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107 had squared the series 2-2 with a stirring singles victory but Australia couldn\u2019t break its 45-year wait. Liverpool have dealt title-rivals Manchester City a major blow, with a 3-1 home win that has left City\u2019s coach Pep Guardiola incensed. An alleged foul in the build-up to Fabinho\u2019s opener earned the Spaniard\u2019s ire, as the Reds go eight points clear. \u201cGoalmouth scrambles are brilliant.\u201d That\u2019s Jonathan Howcroft\u2019s verdict, reflecting on Perth Glory\u2019s remarkable 85th-minute scramble to kickstart a spluttering season. \u201cThey are not a celebration of jogo bonito or a reflection of totaalvoetbal, but \u2026 there is a visceral brilliance to these infrequent moments of mob rule.\u201d Media roundup The family of a man who died from complications following heart surgery is calling for an inquiry, writes the Australian, after three medical practitioners raised eight complaints against a senior surgeon. Trackless trams are an option under consideration to ease south-east Sydney\u2019s congestion, reports the Sydney Morning Herald, with transport minister Andrew Constance calling the possibility \u201ca no brainer\u201d. \u201cI realised if I was actually to live, I was going to have to run\u201d, the Courier Mail tells, of a father and son\u2019s narrow escape from bushfires in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Coming up The Senate is due to vote on the government\u2019s so-called \u201cbig stick\u201d energy bill, which gives regulators the power to break up energy companies if they engage in price gouging or misconduct. Remembrance Day ceremonies will take place across Australia with the governor-general David Hurley addressing this year\u2019s event at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 A shop in York has banned cheesy Christmas songs out of consideration for its staff, with a hand-selected playlist of pre-1960s carols the only exceptions, to prevent workers from \u201cgoing stir crazy\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re confident we\u2019ll have the happiest staff and customers around,\u201d Gin York\u2019s Sandie Tanner-Smith said. \u201cOur playlist is big enough to make sure no one hears the same Christmas song more than twice in a week.\u201d Sign up If you would like to receive the Guardian Australia morning mail to your email inbox every weekday, sign up here.",

Our first priority is preserving life,\u201d she said. The Hare and Hounds were supplying food to those stranded in their homes, but the landlords, Angie and Scott Godfrey, tsaid on social media on Sunday that they were \u201cfuming\u201d that Doncaster council had not kept them supplied. \u201cWe have been inundated with calls, messages from people wanting a HOT MEAL. These people have no electricity &amp; are living upstairs. We have the equipment to cook the lunches, we just need the food!!\u201d they wrote on Facebook. South Yorkshire police said it had extra officers working in Doncaster to patrol and protect the evacuated areas. The Environment Agency said water levels on the Don had peaked in most places and were receding, but warned of more wet weather that \u201crivers may respond quickly to\u201d on Monday and asked people to sign up to flood warnings. Sophie Yeomans at the Met Office said it was going to be an \u201cunsettled week in terms of rain\u201d. The forecast was for rain to reach Northern Ireland on Sunday evening, before affecting Wales and north-west England later and then spreading across the rest of the UK into Monday morning. Northern Rail said disruption in South Yorkshire could continue until Tuesday morning in some areas and that a significant amount of work was required before the tracks were cleared. Flood waters continued to subside, but tracks in several locations remained under water and debris and damage were surfacing as they receded, it said.",

That is the point. </p> \n   <p>If in the end Liverpool win, I will be the first to congratulate them, because we cannot deny how good they are. The way they play, how they create their chances, and this personality to play all the time. So yeah, it was good. Their first two shots were two goals, and it is difficult. We lost because they scored three goals and we scored one. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T18:52:35.663Z\">at 6.52pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5dc8595d8f08be4a102e690f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T18:42:35.077Z\">6.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>That was an absolutely cracking match.</strong> Full-blooded, high-paced entertainment from first to last, packed with quality; an absolute neutral-thriller.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m done. Thanks for being here, for what turned into an absolute cracker, and potentially a season-defining one. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! J\u00fcrgen Klopp finally turns up. He says he didn\u2019t see the penalty incident and still hasn\u2019t, which is handy. Meanwhile: We saw in the last 10, 15 minutes, the goal gave City momentum. In that moment, they controlled the game. The other 75 minutes, we controlled the game with our intensity. If that was easy I think a lot more teams would try it. The boys put another incredible shift in. Then you need to score goals in the right moment, and obviously that\u2019s what we did. All three goals were incredible. Then you have to defend with all you have, and that\u2019s what we did. I don\u2019t know a lot of ways to beat City but if we want to do it we need to do it with intensity, forcing them to play our game if you like. We\u2019re yet to hear from J\u00fcrgen Klopp, but here\u2019s a bit of Jordan Henderson: We knew it was a big game. City are a fantastic team. We knew the importance of the game and wanted to put on a good performance and win the game. There\u2019s still so long to go, so our first mistake would be to look at the gap. For us it\u2019s irrelevant. For us it\u2019s about keep winning, keep the momentum going. Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s match report: There had been little more than millimetres in it during the previous two meetings of English football\u2019s current powerhouses. Remember John Stones\u2019s goalline clearance for Manchester City at the Etihad last January in his team\u2019s 2-1 Premier League win or when Kyle Walker did the same at the very end of the Community Shield at the beginning of this season? City would squeak to victory that day on penalties. Liverpool authored a different story here, one underpinned by ruthless finishing and which came to be coloured by comfort. Much more here: Pep Guardiola discusses the game. We showed why we are the champions today. The way we played was incredible. I\u2019m so proud of my team, more than ever. I\u2019m so proud, we played so good. Please ask the referees [about the Alexander-Arnold handball], please don\u2019t ask to me. Asky to Mike Riley, and the guys in the VAR. I would like to talk about my performance, it was so good. The way we played, with the problems we have, in the squad, it was awesome. One of the best performances we have played. We play in the way, the reason why we are back-to-back champions. That is the point. If in the end Liverpool win, I will be the first to congratulate them, because we cannot deny how good they are. The way they play, how they create their chances, and this personality to play all the time. So yeah, it was good. Their first two shots were two goals, and it is difficult. We lost because they scored three goals and we scored one. That was an absolutely cracking match. Full-blooded, high-paced entertainment from first to last, packed with quality; an absolute neutral-thriller. That penalty call was obviously important, and had City scored the first goal everything might have been different, though it wouldn\u2019t have made their defence any less dodgy. \u201cWe know if we keep getting 97 points one year we\u2019re going to win the league,\u201d Robertson adds. Robertson discusses the game: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive win,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think we started the best, and I think the first goal was always going to be an important factor then [after half-time] we knew the next goal was crucial.\u201d So, in short, goals help. Back to that not-penalty, for a moment. \u201cIf the ref has to disallow any goal where the ball hits an attacking hand in the build up,\u201d wrrites Richard Beniston, \u201cthen presumably (given the little-mentioned Silva handball preceding Alexander-Arnold\u2019s) the right course of action would be to give the penalty against Liverpool, see if City score it and if so then immediately disallow it.\u201d I would love to see this happen. Pep Guardiola strides across the pitch, heading towards the referee, and Sky\u2019s cameras keep on him as he does it. What will happen when he gets there? Will he start swinging punches? Will he go full hairdryer? Neither: a handshake and an exaggerated thankyou, and he\u2019s off again. 90+5 mins: It\u2019s all over! Liverpool are eight points clear at the top, Manchester City are fourth! 90+3 mins: City chipping balls hopefully into the Liverpool area, Liverpool hacking the ball back out again. 90+1 mins: From the free kick Jesus heads over, though he was offside anyway. We\u2019re into stoppage time, of which there will be about four minutes. 89 mins: Liverpool have completely lost their swagger, but they\u2019ve still got their lead. A blind pass gives the ball back to City, Sterling wins a free kick and then has a bit of a row with Gomez. 87 mins: Salah goes off and Joe Gomez comes on, presumably to shore up the right side of Liverpool\u2019s defence. 86 mins: Chance for another! Angelino crosses from the left, and Walker appears from nowhere to win the header at the far post, but it goes over! 83 mins: Sterling sidefoots the ball straight into Alexander-Arnold\u2019s hand. No penalty, under any circumstances, but Guardiola loses his rag anyway. 83 mins: There\u2019s anxiety in the air, and Sterling is terrorising Alexander-Arnold down the City left. 81 mins: Incidentally, immediately after the goal Liverpool replaced Firmino with Oxlade-Chamberlain. 80 mins: Nearly another! De Bruyne\u2019s lovely backheeled pass sends Sterling sprinting into the area, but instead of chipping over Alisson and into the net he nudges inside towards Jesus, and it\u2019s intercepted. 79 mins: Klopp is absolutely furious about the goal, presumably because De Bruyne may have fouled Fabinho in the buid-up. It survives the VAR check, though, and it\u2019s game on! Well, ish. Angelino\u2019s low cross deflects to Bernardo Silva, whose low shot clips the inside of the post on its way in! 78 mins: Angelino ghosts past Alexander-Arnold very nicely, and tees up Gundogan for a shot he\u2019s too demoralised to take. He instead gives it to Sterling, whose shot is blocked. 75 mins: Sterling cuts in from the left, Mane gets a foot in and diverts the ball towards his own goal. It\u2019s certainly not a deliberate back-pass but Alisson decides he can\u2019t pick it up, and instead panics and concedes a corner. 73 mins: Another Alexander-Arnold crossfield pass to Robertson, and Stones has to slide to cut out his his pass to Milner. Liverpool get, and waste, a corner. 71 mins: City make their first change, hauling off Aguero and replacing him with Jesus. 68 mins: Aguero must score! But he doesn\u2019t even touch it! De Bruyne\u2019s pass is lovely, the Argentinian runs onto it, he sticks out a right foot to turn it in, and ... doesn\u2019t! 67 mins: Now Alexander-Arnold bursts down the left, keeps going into the penalty area, and then goes down. No penalty there either. 66 mins: Sterling goes down in the area. The referee tells him to get up, and books Rodri for arguing. It looks to me like Mane, having been beaten for pace by the England forward, did put a forearm against his back. Goes in the \u201cseen \u2019em given\u201d column. 64 mins: This game is cooked. Liverpool are hogging the ball and looking threatening, with Salah visibly desperate for more goals. 63 mins: Fabinho finds himself in a pocket of space. Shooooot! Screams the crowd. His shot is blocked. 61 mins: Jordan Henderson comes off, presumably so he can have more time to endlessly replay that cross and/or backheel flick in his imagination. Milner is on. 60 mins: Henderson executes a showy backheel flicked pass to Mane. 59 mins: I find De Bruyne\u2019s facial hair extremely unconvincing. Not as unconvincing as the City defence, but not far off. 57 mins: Liverpool are purring now, whenever they have the ball. They like a kitten toying with a half-dead mouse. 54 mins: Sterling cuts in from the left, feints to shoot, feints again, cuts in a bit more, feints to shoot again, eventually decides he should probably actually shoot, and then has a shot that deflects wide. 53 mins: More dodgy defending down the left from City there, mind. Henderson picked up the ball 20 yards from the byline, and just ran in a straight line. Gundogan kept up with him for a while but then gave up, leaving Angelino, who had presumably decided that Gundogan had this under control, behind the play and helpless. Liverpool score a third! It\u2019s a gorgeous Henderson cross, and Mane stoops to head in at the back stick! Bravo gets two hands to it, but can only fumble it in! 48 mins: On Sky, Geoff Shreeves says he was surrounded at half-time by City coaches, demanding to know why they hadn\u2019t been given a penalty. Hopefully they aren\u2019t totally distracted by vengeful frustration, because they could certainly still score a couple of goals here. 46 mins: They\u2019re off! The Premier League has released a statement about the handball incident: The VAR checked the penalty appeal for handball against Trent Alexander-Arnold and confirmed the on-field decision that it did not meet the considerations for a deliberate handball. So there you go. Now, on with the game: both sides are back on the field and ready for action. Sky\u2019s punditry panel of Roy Keane, Graeme Souness, Jose Mourinho and Vincent Kompany all think that Alexander-Arnold handballed and City should have had a penalty. \u201cIf there was no VAR I highly doubt that the hand ball would of been called, nor would the offside against Salah been whistled. In other words, it would still be two-nil,\u201d says Mary Waltz. This is clearly true. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s left-footed crossfield pass to Robertson in the build-up to Liverpool\u2019s second can also go on the wall, incidentally. Simon Yates has had a good think about that handball call: \u201cComing to this a bit late, but isn\u2019t the TAA handball exactly the situation which we were worrying about when the rules were tweaked?\u201d he writes. \u201cIf the ball hits the hand of a member of the attacking side in the move leading to a goal, the goal is now supposed to be disallowed for handball regardless of intent etc. So on that basis you should disallow Fabinho\u2019s goal for TAA\u2019s handball. Even though the handball was in the Liverpool area. But having given handball you then have to give the penalty even though the handball doesn\u2019t meet the criteria for a penalty, where you don\u2019t give it if the arm isn\u2019t in an unnatural position.\u201d Well this is confusing. I think the Alexander-Arnold handball didn\u2019t happen close enough to the Fabinho shot in either time or space for today\u2019s crack refereeing unit to take it into account. The VAR team, incidentally, say the arm was not in an unnatural position, and the ball came at him too quickly. 45+3 mins: Peeeeep! City were hilariously dominant for 10 minutes or so, yet they somehow still managed to be two down in the 13th, mainly because this back four aren\u2019t much cop at defending. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. 45+2 mins: With four seconds of those two minutes remaining, Aguero has another shot, but it\u2019s weak and easily saved. 45+1 mins: Into first-half stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be about two minutes. 45 mins: Bravo stops another one! This time it was Salah\u2019s curler from 20 yards, which was neither powerful enough nor precise enough to sneak into the corner. 43 mins: Incidentally we have now been shown a still from the build-up to the Salah goal with the requisite offside-demonstrating blue line, and it\u2019s all good. 42 mins: Aguero is played into the left side of Liverpool\u2019s penalty area, but his shot zips across goal and wide. 40 mins: Salah is released down the right an tries to skip inside Fernandinho, who takes the ball with a clean sliding challenge. But the Egyptian goes down hurt, and the physio is looking at his foot/ankle area again. 38 mins: Bravo saves a shot! It\u2019s Firmino\u2019s effort, stuck left-footed straight at him. Alexander-Arnold created the opportunity, after producing a touch to control Alisson\u2019s clearance that was so beautiful I want to frame it and hang it in my bedroom so it\u2019s the first thing I see every morning when I wake up and reminds me of beauty, poetry and the potential of humankind. 35 mins: Liverpool attack again. Salah runs free on the left this time; his cross towards Wijnaldum is headed to Firmino, who jinks into the area and then shoots high. 34 mins: They win a corner. Robertson takes, and Lovren glances it across goal and wide. 33 mins: Sky\u2019s commentary team is laying into Angelino, as Liverpool attack down the right again. 29 mins: City hit the post! It\u2019s Angelino, who bumbles through the area and has a rubbish shot, which deflects off Van Dijk\u2019s shin and becomes much better, but still doesn\u2019t go in. Corner. \u201cHave we had one of those VAR photos yet with zig zag lines confirming Salah onside for the second goal?\u201d wonders Adam. We have not, just a rushed freeze-frame in which Salah looked suspiciously offside-ish to me. I\u2019m sure he was actually onside though, because the only alternative is that everything is broken and rotten and ruined. 27 mins: City\u2019s defence is bearing gifts. They half-clear the ball straight to Salah, standing all alone on the edge of the area, but then he passes to Firmino and the ball is nicked away. 25 mins: Save! Aguero does some fine work to not only keep the ball in a crowded area but somehow fashion space for a shot, but it\u2019s all for nought because Alisson saves it. 23 mins: Fabinho trips Gundogan, and somehow gets away without a booking. Just so City fans know where to direct their hate mail, the VAR today is Paul Tierney, with the assistant VAR Constantine Hatzidakis. Also, don\u2019t send hate mail. Play nice. 21 mins: Liverpool threaten again, but Wijnaldum\u2019s ball into the area is cleared for a corner, which it also cleared. 18 mins: Liverpool pass the ball around their defence for a while. \u201cWhether the handball should have led to a penalty or not, if I were a City fan, I\u2019d be furious with Ag\u00fcero,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cPlay to the whistle. Always play to the whistle. The ball fell almost to his feet, but he was too busy screaming at the ref and and allowed Van Dijk to simply step away from him. Basics. Inexcusable.\u201d 16 mins: The penalty call continues to cause controversy. \u201cThis is a distinctly uncharitable theory, but could this last VARce be down to an unwillingness to rule out such a truly stonking hit to call a penalty at the other end?\u201d wonders Matt Richman. \u201cYou would fear for Michael Oliver if that was the case.\u201d The way the ball struck Alexander-Arnold was extremely penaltyesque, but I just don\u2019t think you can win a penalty by punching the ball into a defender\u2019s arm, however accidental the attacker\u2019s punch might have been. 14 mins: He was onside! Liverpool are two goals up, and City are attacking beautifully but not defending at all. They\u2019ve only gone and stolen a second! Robertson\u2019s cross is a beauty, and it bounces to Salah, who heads it in! But was he onside? 11 mins: Bernardo Silva gets another cheap free-kick, just outside Liverpool\u2019s penalty area. This time Aguero nearly gets a touch at the near post, Stones nearly gets one at the far post, but the ball bounces out for a goal kick. City are owning this match, but not the scoreline. 9 mins: Then City win a free-kick on the left - Alexander-Arnold again - from which Sterling heads wide from the corner of the six-yard box! 8 mins: The ball bounced into Alexander-Arnold\u2019s arm off Bernardo Silva\u2019s arm. In those particular circumstances, the two handballs cancel each other out and the referee has to play on. I think that\u2019s right, no? 7 mins: There\u2019s the inevitable VAR delay as the handball decision is checked, but the goal stands! 6 mins: City think they should have had a penalty for handball, after the ball flicked off Alexander-Arnold\u2019s thigh and into his arm. The referee waves play on and Liverpool raid down the left. Mane\u2019s low cross is poked clear, but Fabinho runs onto it, takes a touch and blasts it inside the post from 25 yards! Cowabunga! They\u2019ve had a kick now, sure enough! 5 mins: Stone heads the corner on, but it goes wide. Liverpool really need to keep the ball for 30 seconds ago and hope they start purring. 4 mins: Now the visitors go down the right again, where Bernardo Silva goes shopping at the foulmart and buys a free kick from Robertson. It\u2019s cleared, but City have a corner. 3 mins: City go down the left this time, where Sterling fouls Alexander-Arnold. Liverpool have literally not kicked the ball yet, so here\u2019s there chance. 2 mins: The entire game so far has been played in the far right corner, as City attack. They pumped the ball up there from kick-off and Liverpool haven\u2019t been able to get rid of it. City now have a corner. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Manchester City get us going! All preambles and precursors have been completed. Prepare for kick-off, because it\u2019s coming. \u201cWatching NBC buildup which consists entirely of adverts,\u201d writes Ian Copestake, as Anfield prepares for a minute\u2019s silence. \u201cSo far I have bought a pick-up truck and a year\u2019s supply of skin cleanser.\u201d And they\u2019re out! What\u2019s more, hands have been shaken, and anthems are being sung. There will presumably be some kind of Remembrance Sunday ceremony pre-match, so that\u2019s still to come. The players are in the tunnel! Kick-off is approaching at breakneck speed. \u201cI\u2019m in Stansted airport,\u201d says Alan McSherry. \u201cI\u2019m finding it hard to accept there\u2019s no place to watch this match airside? Is it true? If the Guardian says it, I\u2019ll know it\u2019s true.\u201d Thanks for your faith, Alan, but sadly I have no idea whatsoever. I once watched a match at Frankfurt airport, if that helps. Anyone? Jurgen Klopp talks with Sky: We\u2019ve played them so often, and it\u2019s always so difficult. But the key moments are, all chances we create we should score with, that would help massively. They will have their moments, 100%. Make sure we start good, stay good and finish good. And so does Virgil van Dijk: Well, it\u2019s pretty clear it\u2019s a massive game for both teams. We\u2019re all looking forward to it. We just have to go out there, enjoy it, give everything we\u2019ve got and have no regrets after. \u201cI didn\u2019t survive heart surgery this week to watch a damn draw,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI feel amazingly, serenely confident in this match. Every intangible points to Liverpool and Pep is doing his thing (thanks Pep!) of sending out a scrambled line-up. Reds have this. Easily.\u201d Admirable confidence there. And congratulations on the survival business. Mo Salah called for the physio during the pre-match warm-up, to deal with some kind of foot-related issue. I\u2019ve heard nothing of a team change, so he is presumably fine: Pep Guardiola has a chat with Sky. He reveals that Rodri is in the team because he seemed fine in training (like, obviously), and that David Silva is on the bench because they didn\u2019t want to put both of them straight into the starting line-up after injury for such a significant game: Our plan? Try to win the game. Run when you don\u2019t have the ball and play when you have the ball. We\u2019ll try to do that. They\u2019re so strong. We know it. I\u2019ve said many times, after winning back to back Premier Leagues we needed to be pushed as well. They are going to help us for the next two, three, four years, help this club understand the level you have to achieve to be up there as long as possible. \u201cSurely this fixture can never live up to the hype but if it does ... gawd it would be beautiful,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. Here\u2019s hoping! Here\u2019s the PA Media take on the line-ups: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp went with his tried-and-tested big-game line-up for the visit of Manchester City. That meant four changes from the Champions League win over Genk with Andy Robertson returning at left-back, Jordan Henderson coming back into midfield and Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane rejoining the forward line. City made six changes as Claudio Bravo started in goal for the injured Ederson with three of the back four from Wednesday\u2019s Champions League draw against Atalanta altered. John Stones was picked to partner Fernandinho in the centre of defence with Kyle Walker and Angelino, who was making only his second Premier League start. Rodrigo came into midfield with Sergio Aguero preferred up front to Gabriel Jesus. Andy Hunter had a chat with Alisson this week. Here\u2019s his interview: Last season we had a great experience, an almost perfect season. We lost one game and that one game was against City. We know how big this game is for us. We know how big the game is for everyone \u2013 for them and for our fans. In the end it is just three more important points but Manchester City have been the best team in the league for the last few years so we need to give everything to win this game. We don\u2019t want to feel how we felt last season. Being second by just one point means we know that we need to give everything in every game if we want to become Premier League champions. We want it and we will try to do it. Much more here: So Ederson, as advertised, is missing and Claudio Bravo starts in his place behind a back four of Walker-Stones-Fernandinho-Angelino. Otherwise the teams look entirely surprise-free. The team news is in, and here are this afternoon\u2019s protagonists: Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Milner, Keita, Gomez, Adrian, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana, Origi. Man City: Bravo, Walker, Stones, Fernandinho, Jose Angelino, De Bruyne, Rodri, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Aguero, Sterling. Subs: Gabriel Jesus, Silva, Mahrez, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Carson, Foden. Referee: Michael Oliver. And here are Pep Guardiola\u2019s: I\u2019ve never gone into a game feeling like an outsider or an underdog, thinking I am not going to win. I am not going to take the bus to Liverpool thinking I am going to lose the game. That has never happened in my career. Always I try to believe that, if we do the special things we plan to do, we will have our chance to win. Much more here: Here are Barney Ronay\u2019s pre-match thoughts: There is also something different in the texture of this injury-depleted City team. Guardiola loves midfielders, wants to turn the entire world a shade of midfielder, would ideally simply substitute the word \u201cmidfielder\u201d for the word footballer. Three months into the season this team has gone Full Midfielder. Seven City midfielders have scored a league goal. Eight City midfielders have started five league games or more, compared with three career defenders. Much more here: Manchester City\u2019s team coach has arrived at Anfield, where it was given a peaceful if not entirely friendly welcome: I have a lot of pre-match reading for you. Honestly, tell everyone in the room to go away for an hour or so, because you\u2019re going to be too busy staring at your phone/tablet/other device to interact in any meaningful way. First off: Mane-Firmino-Salah or Sterling-Aguero-whoever? That is the question: Hello world! And welcome to the first leg of this season\u2019s Premier League title play-off! Both teams will I\u2019m sure be looking forward to a bit of genuine competition, away from the 36 mildly glorified irritant friendlies which occupy the majority of their domestic attentions. Whoever wins this one will carry an advantage into the second leg, scheduled for the weekend of 4 April, though the nine-point deficit City will be lumbered with should they lose, coupled with Liverpool\u2019s ongoing refusal to be beaten by anyone under any circumstances, might make that one immaterial. While we wait for the teams here\u2019s a little trip down memory lane, at previous matches between these teams at Anfield since Pep Guardiola joined J\u00fcrgen Klopp in England: Last year\u2019s league game ended goalless, thanks to Riyad Mahrez\u2019s late penalty miss: The teams played at Anfield twice in 2017-18, with the first one ending City\u2019s run of 30 undefeated league games: And the second going a long way to ending their Champions League chances (it was the first leg, but nobody gives away a 3-0 first-leg advantage, except Barcelona obviously): And finally, on New Year\u2019s Eve 2016, Liverpool\u2019s win gave them renewed hope of catching the division\u2019s runaway leaders, Chelsea: And if that\u2019s not enough, have a bit of this:",

      "body": "<p>Santini appears unlikely to tackle the King George VI Chase next month following a return to action that, in the understated words of his trainer, Nicky Henderson, \u201cwas not Earth-shatteringly impressive\u201d. But hopes are still nursed that this seven-year-old, so striking on looks, can make himself into a contender for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, despite running about a stone below what might have been expected here.</p> \n<p>In fairness the circumstances of this race did not lend themselves to an awe-inspiring performance. There were only four runners, none of them a natural pace-setter, and all of them returning from a summer\u2019s break on softer ground than their connections were probably hoping to find.</p> \n<p>Now McGinty, who trailed Santini by 27 lengths when they met at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/mar/15/cheltenham-festival-2019-gold-cup-day-live\" title=\"\">Cheltenham last March</a> and was a 12-1 shot here, generously shouldered the burden of making the running and his reward was that he was still there to fight out a finish with the 1-3 favourite on the run-in. He battled hard and briefly looked like causing a significant shock but was beaten a head by his more imposing rival.</p> \n<p>\u201cHard work, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d was the initial, pensive reaction from Henderson. \u201cHe was rusty and dusty. It did look laboured. He hasn\u2019t come out and started the season with a bang, I\u2019ll be the first to admit. I thought he\u2019d got beat, to be honest with you.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/07/british-horseracing-authority-investigating-betting-patterns-modified-whip-gamble-case\">Betting patterns could be scrutinised in modified whip case</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The spectators gained enormously, as there was a thrilling finish to a race which generally turns into a procession from the third-last. When Might Bite and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/13/cheltenham-gold-cup-coneygree\" title=\"\">Coneygree</a> won it, there was no doubt about the outcome for at least the last half-mile.</p> \n<p>Judged on this showing, Santini would not be in their class but there are always excuses to make for a young horse and, on reflection, a few valid ones apply in his case. \u201cThe pace was just a bit stop/start the entire way,\u201d said his jockey, Nico de Boinville. \u201cI know the second horse runs in snatches. We were trying to help each other along and we ended up at the post together. There\u2019s plenty to work on but we know the ability\u2019s there.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe wants big, galloping tracks. The Gold Cup course at Cheltenham will play into his hands. The Old Course in the RSA played against us, in a way. The improvement will come.\u201d</p> \n<p>Henderson pointed out that this was only the fourth run for Santini over fences. \u201cHe had a horrible season last year. The whole thing got thrown completely out of sync with that wretched flu drama in February, because he was meant to go to the Reynoldstown for some experience before Cheltenham and then we couldn\u2019t do that because we had to vaccinate the week before. It was straight into the RSA on two runs, no experience, and then he was lame for three weeks.

      "bodyText": "Santini appears unlikely to tackle the King George VI Chase next month following a return to action that, in the understated words of his trainer, Nicky Henderson, \u201cwas not Earth-shatteringly impressive\u201d. But hopes are still nursed that this seven-year-old, so striking on looks, can make himself into a contender for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, despite running about a stone below what might have been expected here. In fairness the circumstances of this race did not lend themselves to an awe-inspiring performance. There were only four runners, none of them a natural pace-setter, and all of them returning from a summer\u2019s break on softer ground than their connections were probably hoping to find. Now McGinty, who trailed Santini by 27 lengths when they met at Cheltenham last March and was a 12-1 shot here, generously shouldered the burden of making the running and his reward was that he was still there to fight out a finish with the 1-3 favourite on the run-in. He battled hard and briefly looked like causing a significant shock but was beaten a head by his more imposing rival. \u201cHard work, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d was the initial, pensive reaction from Henderson. \u201cHe was rusty and dusty. It did look laboured. He hasn\u2019t come out and started the season with a bang, I\u2019ll be the first to admit. I thought he\u2019d got beat, to be honest with you.\u201d The spectators gained enormously, as there was a thrilling finish to a race which generally turns into a procession from the third-last. When Might Bite and Coneygree won it, there was no doubt about the outcome for at least the last half-mile. Judged on this showing, Santini would not be in their class but there are always excuses to make for a young horse and, on reflection, a few valid ones apply in his case. \u201cThe pace was just a bit stop/start the entire way,\u201d said his jockey, Nico de Boinville. \u201cI know the second horse runs in snatches. We were trying to help each other along and we ended up at the post together. There\u2019s plenty to work on but we know the ability\u2019s there. \u201cHe wants big, galloping tracks. The Gold Cup course at Cheltenham will play into his hands. The Old Course in the RSA played against us, in a way. The improvement will come.\u201d Henderson pointed out that this was only the fourth run for Santini over fences. \u201cHe had a horrible season last year. The whole thing got thrown completely out of sync with that wretched flu drama in February, because he was meant to go to the Reynoldstown for some experience before Cheltenham and then we couldn\u2019t do that because we had to vaccinate the week before. It was straight into the RSA on two runs, no experience, and then he was lame for three weeks. Two days before the RSA, he was an unlikely runner but we just got him sound on the day and he ran a hell of a race on no preparation whatsoever. \u201cI think you\u2019d have to say he doesn\u2019t look like a King George horse. That\u2019s not his track. I think you put a line through the King George.\u201d But Santini will need a run between now and his Gold Cup prep at Cheltenham in late January and Henderson does not have many options, since he did not seem terribly keen on a trip to Ireland for the Savills Chase. Anyone who thinks Santini will turn up for the King George anyway can now get 40-1, while the horse is a 10-1 shot for the Gold Cup behind Kemboy, Al Boum Photo and Lostintranslation.",

      "bodyText": "The whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump will not testify in public, the House intelligence chair, Adam Schiff, said. \u201cThe committee \u2026 will not facilitate efforts by President Trump and his allies in Congress to threaten, intimidate and retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously raised the initial alarm,\u201d Schiff said in a letter to the ranking Republican, Devin Nunes, released on Saturday night. It comes as an associate of Rudolph Giuliani said he travelled to Ukraine to warn that unless an investigation was announced into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, US aid would be frozen to the country and Mike Pence would not attend the swearing-in of the new president. According to the New York Times, the claim by Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born American charged last month with campaign finance violations for channelling foreign money into the president\u2019s campaign, \u201cdirectly links\u201d Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to threats of repercussions or a quid pro quo with Ukraine, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. House investigations centre on concerns over Trump\u2019s attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals, in return for nearly $400m in military aid and a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Parnas is preparing to speak to impeachment investigators but his account has been disputed by his business partner, Igor Fruman, who was also charged with campaign finance violations, and by Giuliani, who told the NYT he \u201ccategorically\u201d did not tell Parnas to deliver the reported message to Ukraine. The impeachment inquiry followed the whistleblower, an intelligence official, raising concerns about a 25 July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which the US president raised the notion of his counterpart doing the US \u201ca favour\u201d. The incomplete White House memo about the 25 July call remains a key point of contention. Trump said on Saturday he would soon release details of another call with the Ukrainian leader. House committees led by Schiff have so far heard testimony in private. Transcripts released this week were mostly damaging to the White House, bringing the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, firmly into the spotlight over his apparent role in offering the quid pro quo. Mulvaney and other key aides have refused to testify, defying congressional subpoenas and raising fears of a constitutional crisis. On Friday night, Mulvaney asked to join a lawsuit which asks a judge to decide whether a more junior aide should testify. The move could put the chief of staff at odds with the president he serves. Public hearings are scheduled to begin on Wednesday. In his own letter on Saturday, Nunes criticised Schiff\u2019s handling of the impeachment inquiry and set out the witnesses Republicans would like to question. Among them were the whistleblower, whom the president and his allies have demanded be identified contrary to federal law; Hunter Biden, the son of former vice-president Joe Biden who is accused without evidence of corruption in Ukraine; Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American former Democratic National Committee staffer; and Nellie Ohr, a former contractor for the political intelligence firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned the famous Steele dossier on Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. The move indicated a key Republican tactic: to steer argument towards supposed wrongdoing regarding Ukraine involving Trump\u2019s enemies, not the president. Schiff countered, saying the inquiry and his committee would \u201cnot serve as vehicles\u201d for \u201csham investigations into the Bidens or debunked conspiracies about 2016 US election interference that President Trump pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit\u201d. On Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo, the Trump ally and South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham trafficked in one such conspiracy theory, saying: \u201cWhen you find out who the whistleblower is you will find out it\u2019s somebody from the Deep State and had interactions with Schiff and this thing\u2019s going to stink to high heaven.\u201d The Deep State conspiracy theory holds that a permanent and unelected government of bureaucrats and security officials is determined to thwart Trump. In a recent book by the New York Times reporter James B Stewart, the former White House adviser Steve Bannon, a key propagator of the theory, said it was \u201cfor nut cases\u201d. Public hearings will bring the inquiry on to the national stage, opening a vital front in the battle for public opinion as an election year looms. Successive polls have shown slim majorities backing Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal. As Democrats hold the House, it seems likely it will vote for impeachment. As Republicans hold the Senate, it seems unlikely Trump will be convicted and removed. On Sunday members of key House committees set out the parties\u2019 positions on why Trump is being impeached, cases they must now take to the American people. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat on the intelligence committee, said: \u201cWe have evidence of an extortion scheme using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president\u2019s opponent.\u201d On ABC\u2019s This Week, Jackie Speier, also a California Democrat and a member of the intelligence panel, boiled it down further: \u201cThis is a very simple, straightforward act: the president broke the law.\u201d For the Republicans, the House armed services committee ranking member, Mac Thornberry, told ABC of Trump\u2019s behaviour: \u201cI believe it was inappropriate, I do not believe it was impeachable.\u201d Thornberry also repeated a common charge from Republicans \u2013 made by Trump on Twitter \u2013 that Democrats running the inquiry are doing so in partisan fashion. \u201cThere has to be a fair way to arbitrate,\u201d he said, \u201cto decide who the witnesses are. We have had none of that so far.\u201d Democrats have countered that they are following rules laid down by Republicans when they investigated Hillary Clinton over the Benghazi attack of September 2012. Two Republican senators insisted Trump had done nothing wrong.

It\u2019s a risk they don\u2019t want to take.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report also reveals regional variations in accessing justice for rape victims.

      "bodyText": "Almost half of rape victims are dropping out of investigations, as a growing proportion do not want to pursue a prosecution even when a suspect has been identified, according to a Cabinet Office report leaked to the Guardian. The figures, which were prepared for a secret internal government review earlier this year, reveal a system in crisis as tens of thousands of women are reluctant to pursue their alleged attackers when faced with invasive disclosure demands, a lower likelihood of securing a conviction and lengthy delays in seeing their case brought to court. The report, which has emerged during an election campaign in which the Conservatives are making fighting crime a central tenet of their election strategy, suggests a lack of resources, owing to austerity, is impacting the criminal justice system\u2019s ability to pursue rape cases. Reported rapes are on the rise. However, police are referring fewer cases to the Crown Prosecution Service, which in turn is prosecuting even fewer cases. The highly sensitive data was assembled earlier this year by the prime minister\u2019s implementation unit as part of an urgent investigation into the dramatic fall in rape prosecutions in England and Wales. Rape prosecutions are at their lowest level in more than a decade. The briefing shows senior civil servants acknowledging the way the criminal justice system deals with crimes \u201cis particularly poor for rape\u201d and expressing suspicions \u2013 never publicly aired \u2013 that problems may be due to lack of resources. The document, marked as \u201cofficial \u2013 sensitive\u201d, notes: \u201cPolice are assigning certain unsuccessful outcomes after shorter investigations than in previous years.\u201d It also says: \u201cThe drivers for this are unclear, but it may be indicative of \u2018rationing\u2019 of police time and resources to more \u2018solvable\u2019 cases.\u201d While recorded rapes increased by 173% between 2014 and 2018, the police referred 19% fewer cases for charging decisions and CPS decisions to prosecute fell by 44% in the same period. One of the most concerning changes is the growing proportion of cases resulting in \u201coutcome 16\u201d, whereby a suspect has been identified after a police investigation but the victim does not support further action. The document reveals that from 2015 to 2018, the proportion of cases dropped owing to an outcome 16 rose from 33% to 48%. Last year, more than 20,000 women \u2013 an average of one every 30 minutes \u2013 decided not to proceed with a rape investigation, even when the suspect had been identified. Campaigners believe the sharp rise may reflect victims being discouraged from pursuing complaints because they face disclosure of their intimate, private life through requests for the contents of their phones and laptops. The sheer length of time from offence to completion at court, which has increased by 37% to an average of two years since 2014, may be deterring others. Claire Waxman, who is London\u2019s first victims\u2019 commissioner, said the figures highlighted significant problems in the way the criminal justice system deals with rape. \u201cThere is such inconsistency between police forces and areas over the way they handle rapes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did a survey in London with the Met of 500 cases and found that in 58% of them victims withdrew complaints. The main reason we are seeing that is [threats] to privacy from disclosure. People feel very pressured to consent. Victims don\u2019t want to share all their personal details even if it\u2019s only with the CPS and police. It\u2019s a risk they don\u2019t want to take.\u201d The report also reveals regional variations in accessing justice for rape victims. Figures show not a single police force in England and Wales has referred cases in line with the increases in recorded rape between 2014 and 2018. The lower number of cases referred to the CPS has been compounded by a further decline in the charging rate. The majority of CPS areas showed a decline in the charge rate for rape between 2014 and 2018. Overall 11 of 14 CPS areas showed significant falls in the rate of charging suspects and three \u2013 Wales, the south-east and east Midlands \u2013 showed increases. This effectively results in further variation in a victims\u2019 chances of seeing their case prosecuted. The review also shows the amount of time taken by the CPS to produce a decision on whether or not to charge a suspect has doubled since 2013-14, when it was on average 30.6 days, to 2018 when it reached 86.2 days. Katie Russell, a spokesperson for Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales, said: \u201cThe criminal justice process takes far too long and can be re-traumatising for those who\u2019ve already been subjected to the trauma of sexual violence or abuse. \u201cThere are wide disparities in the way sexual offences are handled in different areas. And perhaps most alarmingly, charging rates are declining despite numbers of reports to the police being at an all-time high. The bottom line is that only a tiny fraction of sexual offenders are being brought to justice and victims and survivors of these serious crimes are being failed.\u201d A legal challenge has been launched against the CPS over its failure to pursue rape cases after a collapse in rape charges. The challenge follows reporting of allegations by the Guardian that prosecutors have been advised to \u201ctake the weak cases out of the system\u201d, prompting concerns of a undeclared change in its approach to prosecution. A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cThe growing gap between the number of rapes recorded, and the number of cases going to court is a cause of concern for all of us in the criminal justice system. We consider every case referred to us by the police and the CPS will seek to charge and robustly prosecute whenever the legal test is met. \u201cMost CPS Area teams deal with multiple police forces and any variation in referral numbers will lead to differing charging rates. The cross-government review will explore the issue of regional variation and we are working with police to continue to improve how we manage these complex cases.\u201d The 24-page long \u201cend-to-end review of the criminal justice system\u2019s response to rape\u201d was circulated among cabinet, senior civil servants, senior police officers, prosecutors and victims\u2019 groups involved in the review, which is being coordinated by the Criminal Justice Board. The CJB is chaired by the justice secretary, now Robert Buckland QC, and brings together the home secretary, currently Priti Patel, law enforcement agencies and the senior judiciary. Sarah Crew, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) lead for adult sex offences, said: \u201cEveryone with a role in investigating and prosecuting these crimes acknowledges there is more to be done in increasing the number of cases brought before the courts. \u201cOnce we understand what is causing these trends, we and our partners are committed to making real and lasting improvements across the whole system.\u201d",

Milley told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cThere will be less than 1,000 [troops] for sure. And probably in the 500-ish frame. Maybe 600. But it\u2019s in that area. But we\u2019re not going to go into specific numbers because we\u2019re still going through the analysis right now.\u201d The leader of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in Syria in a US raid last month and Trump has regularly claimed to have defeated the militant group. Critics point out that his decision to withdraw troops from the border with Turkey abandoned Kurdish fighters guarding Isis prisoners amid a Turkish incursion which lead to large-scale escapes. \u201cThere are still Isis fighters in the region,\u201d Milley said, \u201cand unless pressure is maintained, unless attention is maintained on that group, then there\u2019s a very real possibility that conditions could be set for a re-emergence of Isis. So we\u2019re committed to do that. \u201cThe footprint will be small, but the objective will remain the same: the enduring defeat of Isis.\u201d It was unclear if Milley\u2019s prediction included the roughly 200 US troops presently at the al-Tanf garrison in the south of the war-torn country. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, O\u2019Brien was asked if he recognised that \u201cwar crimes were committed\u201d during the Turkish incursion into Syria. \u201cSome of the things that we\u2019ve seen are very disturbing,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMaybe the Turkish supported militias. Turkey has assured us that those are being investigated. We\u2019re very concerned about those issues, the war crimes issues. We\u2019re watching them. We\u2019re monitoring it very closely. \u201cThere is no place for genocide, for ethnic cleansing, for war crimes in the 21st century. The US won\u2019t stand by for it and we\u2019ve made that position very clear to the Turks.\u201d Asked if Trump would veto any new sanctions on Turkey passed by Congress, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens this week with our meetings with President Erdo\u011fan.\u201d",

It\u2019s been a tough week and people have been saying a lot, but we are a tight group through good times and bad.\u201d</p> <p>Saracens\u2019 rise a decade ago was based on a singular approach in which they generated strength from within, not caring about the perception outside, rugby\u2019s version of Millwall. Dislike descended into something deeper last week with the salary-cap breaches, which have not been specified despite the punishment handed out, cited as proof that the club\u2019s titles since the 2015 World Cup were down to breaking rules that the others observed, cheating as blatantly as using blood capsules to simulate an injury and facilitate a replacement, faking front-row injuries to go to uncontested scrums or ensuring victory in a European Cup final by knocking the ball out of a scrum-half\u2019s hands as he was about to feed the set piece.</p> <p>The game is going through one of its unseemly morality outbreaks and Saracens took to the field at Kingsholm with fake \u00a350 notes being waved at them and chants of always cheating. Two of England\u2019s World Cup squad, Jack Singleton and Ben Spencer, who between them enjoyed 17 minutes on the pitch in Japan, were among the replacements but Owen Farrell, the Vunipola brothers, Maro Itoje, Jamie George, George Kruis and Elliot Daly had been given the week off.</p> <p>It was the fourth round of the Premiership and Saracens were again some way below full strength, as they will be for five weekends during the Six Nations, more than 40 per cent of the regular season, plus whatever rest periods the elite player agreement between Premiership Rugby and Twickenham stipulates. A victory earned in typical fashion, digging in, muting the crowd and keeping their heads while their opponents were trying to locate theirs, took them to minus-22 points, although the deduction was suspended after the club indicated it would appeal.</p> <p>Saracens\u2019 England contingent look like being given the next two weeks off with the club\u2019s director of rugby, Mark McCall, saying that he would be giving the Premiership priority with the threat of relegation real if an appeal is lost and the points\u2019 deduction stands. Given the solidarity at the club, it is unlikely that many players would look to leave even if the Championship beckoned but, as he pointed out, there is a Lions tour in 2021 and he does not want them to be in a position where they may have to sacrifice their place in that squad.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not thinking of breaking up the squad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe World Cup players were in twice this week even though they are off, an internal sign of unity.

Saracens are braced for more of the same on their travels this season, the pariahs of the Premiership after a panel set up to hear allegations of salary-cap breaches over the previous three seasons ruled against the English and European champions, deducted 35 Premiership points from them and added a \u00a35m fine with legal costs to be decided. \u201cYou can expect it with what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Jackson Wray, who led the side to a 21-12 victory, their first in the league at Kingsholm for four years. Asked if he was surprised at the strength of feeling against Saracens, with calls for them to be relegated and a mooted boycott, he replied: \u201cFrom other players, probably. It\u2019s been a tough week and people have been saying a lot, but we are a tight group through good times and bad.\u201d Saracens\u2019 rise a decade ago was based on a singular approach in which they generated strength from within, not caring about the perception outside, rugby\u2019s version of Millwall. Dislike descended into something deeper last week with the salary-cap breaches, which have not been specified despite the punishment handed out, cited as proof that the club\u2019s titles since the 2015 World Cup were down to breaking rules that the others observed, cheating as blatantly as using blood capsules to simulate an injury and facilitate a replacement, faking front-row injuries to go to uncontested scrums or ensuring victory in a European Cup final by knocking the ball out of a scrum-half\u2019s hands as he was about to feed the set piece. The game is going through one of its unseemly morality outbreaks and Saracens took to the field at Kingsholm with fake \u00a350 notes being waved at them and chants of always cheating. Two of England\u2019s World Cup squad, Jack Singleton and Ben Spencer, who between them enjoyed 17 minutes on the pitch in Japan, were among the replacements but Owen Farrell, the Vunipola brothers, Maro Itoje, Jamie George, George Kruis and Elliot Daly had been given the week off. It was the fourth round of the Premiership and Saracens were again some way below full strength, as they will be for five weekends during the Six Nations, more than 40 per cent of the regular season, plus whatever rest periods the elite player agreement between Premiership Rugby and Twickenham stipulates. A victory earned in typical fashion, digging in, muting the crowd and keeping their heads while their opponents were trying to locate theirs, took them to minus-22 points, although the deduction was suspended after the club indicated it would appeal. Saracens\u2019 England contingent look like being given the next two weeks off with the club\u2019s director of rugby, Mark McCall, saying that he would be giving the Premiership priority with the threat of relegation real if an appeal is lost and the points\u2019 deduction stands. Given the solidarity at the club, it is unlikely that many players would look to leave even if the Championship beckoned but, as he pointed out, there is a Lions tour in 2021 and he does not want them to be in a position where they may have to sacrifice their place in that squad. \u201cWe are not thinking of breaking up the squad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe World Cup players were in twice this week even though they are off, an internal sign of unity. They wanted to play against Gloucester but we were never going to do that. If we were relegated, we would need to do some thinking and proper planning with a Lions tour at the end of next season. Our job, if the appeal is unsuccessful, is to stay up. We have to plan for a worst-case scenario which will affect our strategy around the Champions Cup.\u201d It was probably just as well they stayed away from the tournament\u2019s launch last week because confessing it was likely to be a refuge for reserves would not quite have been what the organisers wanted to hear. \u201cWe would have had some conversations anyway because it is unrealistic to think some can come back from five months away and play in a Champions Cup game two weeks after a World Cup final,\u201d said McCall. \u201cI think a number of the players involved today deserve to experience European rugby and it could be a big benefit to us in the long term. A siege mentality is not sustainable over seven or eight months. Being fuelled by anger or frustration is too negative. It will all be about how we can support each other.\u201d And, as fate would have it, their next league match, at the end of the month when their England contingent will be fit and firing, is at Bath, not a club that has been advocating the champions be treated leniently.",

Here is a summary of the main developments this afternoon:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have announced new policies for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. </strong>Labour promised them free education and retraining, more apprenticeships, better medical care and homes reserved for ex-armed forces personnel who have been sleeping rough.<strong> </strong>The Lib Dems proposed scrapping settlement fees for veterans born outside the UK, while the Tories pledged to make veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares. </li> <li><strong>The chancellor, Sajid Javid\u2019s claims that Labour has \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament have been derided as a fiction.</strong> The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto.</li> <li><strong>Javid is reportedly keen to hold a head-to-head debate with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, about their parties\u2019 spending plans,</strong> which Labour sources said they were happy to see go ahead. </li> <li><strong>The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a> will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit</strong>, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public.</li> <li><strong>The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness.</strong> The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following the blog today. Here is a summary of the main developments this afternoon: Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories have announced new policies for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. Labour promised them free education and retraining, more apprenticeships, better medical care and homes reserved for ex-armed forces personnel who have been sleeping rough. The Lib Dems proposed scrapping settlement fees for veterans born outside the UK, while the Tories pledged to make veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares. The chancellor, Sajid Javid\u2019s claims that Labour has \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament have been derided as a fiction. The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto. Javid is reportedly keen to hold a head-to-head debate with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, about their parties\u2019 spending plans, which Labour sources said they were happy to see go ahead. The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness. The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. The Green party\u2019s co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, has said he believes it is set for its biggest vote ever, as despite movement on the climate crisis by other parties, it is still leading the way. \u201cThe size of the proposals for climate by Labour are just a quarter of the size of what we are proposing in terms of our Green New Deal,\u201d he said. We know polls are notoriously unreliable and it\u2019s very early days in the election but I\u2019m going to chuck this in anyway, just for fun. The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, Richard Partington, has explained how the Tories arrived at the \u00a31.2tn, five-year figure they attributed to Labour\u2019s spending plans. As well as making the point that Labour has not yet released its manifesto and that the figure has deliberately been summed up for five years to make it look \u201cmore dramatic\u201d, he writes: The Conservatives\u2019 suggestion is that Labour\u2019s spending plans would push up the annual budget deficit \u2013 the gap between government income and expenditure \u2013 and national debt. This would then lead to spending cuts or the levying of higher taxes to bring the public finances back under control. However, the analysis appears to take little account of any benefits the higher spending could deliver for the public purse or public wellbeing. After a decade of austerity there has been growing public clamour for higher spending on services. Although nationalisation could come with a hefty price tag it would mean taking control of profit-generating assets. Labour has said this would mean the policy effectively paying for itself over time. Javid also promised to significantly raise spending and borrowing levels. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said both Labour and the Tories would lift state spending to 1970s levels. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Britain\u2019s oldest independent economics research organisation, Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal could cost the UK economy as much as \u00a370bn over the next 10 years. My colleague, Heather Stewart, has written a story about Labour\u2019s response to the Tory accusation, carried on the front page of many Sunday papers, that its policies would cost \u00a31.2tn. Labour\u2019s election coordinator, Andrew Gwynne, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: Look, this is an absolute work of fiction by the Conservatives. You can\u2019t trust a word that [Boris] Johnson and his ministers say on this issue. We will have a fully costed manifesto in due course when we launch that. And you know, the challenge is actually for the Conservatives to fully cost their own manifesto, something they didn\u2019t do in 2017. Here are details of the package of measures Labour is pledging for veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. With the climate emergency moving up the political agenda \u2013 although not high enough for many \u2013 does the Green party face a battle to persuade people it is the only party tackling the crisis? Both Caroline Lucas, the party\u2019s sole MP, and its co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, have insisted that when it comes to the most meaningful response, the Greens still lead the way. Bartley said he believes his party will secure the biggest Green vote ever in the upcoming general election. Speaking to BBC 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics (quotes from PA Media), Bartley said: I think at this election we\u2019re seeing climate change right up there at the top of the agenda. We think we\u2019re going to see the biggest Green vote ever. Discussing the other major parties\u2019 climate policies, he added: The size of the proposals for climate by Labour are just a quarter of the size of what we are proposing in terms of our Green New Deal. We know that we\u2019re going to have to make this investment and we\u2019re going to have to make it quickly. And the more quickly we make it, the more we\u2019re going to save in the long run. Earlier, Lucas said people should vote Green because the party is leading the way and others are following. It will hold the other parties\u2019 \u201cfeet to the fire\u201d on the issue, she told Andrew Marr. Parties have announced policies to assist armed forces veterans as the country marks Remembrance Sunday. The Lib Dems are proposing to scrap settlement fees for veterans who were born outside the UK, the Tories are making veterans eligible for a railcard, giving them one-third off fares, while Labour is pledging that PTSD suffered by veterans will be treated as seriously as physical illness. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has accused Labour of \u201creckless\u201d plans to spend \u00a31.2tn in the next parliament, although the Tories\u2019 analysis was debunked by the opposition and commentators. The figure includes motions passed at the Labour conference, unlikely to be included in the party\u2019s election manifesto, which has yet to be published. Labour\u2019s co-national campaign coordinator Andrew Gwynne called the figures \u201cfiction\u201d, promising the party\u2019s manifesto would be fully costed. Javid refused to reveal costings for the Tory manifesto. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness. The Tory peer served as the party\u2019s chairman from 1995 to 1997. He was also minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. The business minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has insisted Boris Johnson was correct in arguing that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit, despite this being an apparent part of the departure deal. Kwarteng said the PM was \u201cabsolutely on the money\u201d when he told Northern Irish exporters last week they would not need to fill in extra paperwork, prompting accusations Johnson was misleading the public. With it being Remembrance Sunday, political leaders have joined those at the Cenotaph paying tribute to tribute to those killed in past conflicts. The parties have also announced policies to help veterans. The Lib Dems are proposing to scrap settlement fees for armed forces veterans who were born outside the UK. The Tories have said veterans will be eligible for a railcard giving them a third off the cost of train travel. Labour is pledging that PTSD suffered by veterans will be treated as seriously as physical illness. The former cabinet minister, Brian Mawhinney, has died aged 79 after a long illness, his family said. From PA Media: Lord Mawhinney, who served as Tory party chairman from 1995 to 1997 under Sir John Major\u2019s government, died on Saturday evening. In a statement, his family said: \u201cHis death brings an end to a life dedicated to public service and rooted in an unwavering Christian faith. \u201cHe was a much loved husband, father and grandfather and a friend to many. He will be much missed.\u201d He was elected MP for Peterborough in 1979 and later represented North West Cambridgeshire, retiring in 2005, and was a member of the cabinet from 1994 until 1997. During that time he served as minister of state for the Department of Health and secretary of state for transport. He was knighted in 1997 and created a life peer in 2005. Lord Mawhinney also served as Football League chairman for seven years from 2003. During his time at the helm of the sporting body, he introduced the fit and proper persons test for prospective club directors and the publication of club spending on agents\u2019 fees. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has blamed the \u201cmachinery of government\u201d for the delay in publishing a report by the intelligence and security committee examining Russian influence in British politics. From PA Media: Chairman of the committee Dominic Grieve had previously accused the government of \u201csitting on the report\u201d and said it was sent to the PM for approval on 17 October. Speaking on BBC 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics, Shapps said he was \u201cnot close\u201d to the report. When asked why it had not been published, he said: \u201cLet me just explain how these things work within government at this moment in time as you come up to an election. \u201cI wanted to publish some very trivial information, which was certainly not of any great, huge public interest, and I was blocked from doing so by the civil service machine because come an election you not allowed to, into purdah, publish things which are seen as controversial in any way. So I suspect it\u2019s just the machinery of government.\u201d He added: \u201cI just think as soon as you get to anything, as in the same way as spending plans and all the rest of it, they (civil service machine) will block almost any publishing come an election and I suspect that\u2019s all that\u2019s happened here, which is then being turned into \u2018oh well, there must be something here\u2019 when it\u2019s actually probably just the usual way that purdah, as it\u2019s called, works.\u201d Earlier, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said the report\u2019s publication had been \u201ctimed out because of the election\u201d. Amid much debate about spending, the Mirror\u2019s political editor says a TV debate between Sajid Javid and John McDonnell could be on the cards, although claims the chancellor may not be as keen as he\u2019s making out \u2026 Here is an analysis by BBC Reality Check on Sajid Javid\u2019s claims about Labour spending: The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was reluctant to be drawn on the Conservatives\u2019 spending plans this morning but had plenty to say about Labour\u2019s. My colleague, Peter Walker, has written up Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s interview on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, and the business minister\u2019s insistence Boris Johnson was correct in saying Northern Ireland businesses will not have to fill in forms to export goods to the rest of the UK after Brexit. If you refresh the page, I have added some videos from Andrew Marr\u2019s interviews with Andrew Gwynne, Caroline Lucas and Sajid Javid. You are borrowing more and spending more, Marr tells Javid. He quotes a past comment in which the chancellor stressed the importance of living within his means. The chancellor once again criticises Labour\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d spending plans. Will there be an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Tory party? There will be an inquiry in Islamophobia and it will start this year, says Javid boldly. But asked to clarify, he says it will be a general inquiry into prejudice. Why is the ISC report into Russian interference not being published? \u201cI think it\u2019s been timed out because of the election,\u201d the chancellor answers. Are you sure no Russian money is pulling the strings in this election? I am confident with respect to my own party, says Javid. And that concludes the interview. Marr asks Javid how the Tories are going to fund all their spending plans. The IFS says we\u2019re going to be spending more than we\u2019re bringing in by \u00a350bn under the Conservatives over the next few years. Javid says what comes in in taxes will match the day-to-day spending. We may borrow \u00a320bn to fund capital investments \u201cbut we can afford to do that\u201d. Marr suggests to the chancellor that higher taxes will be necessary. Javid disagrees. He claims the Tories will increase capital expenditure in a \u201ccontrolled manner\u201d unlike Labour \u2013 at which Marr admonishes him for once again trying to get the conversation on to Labour\u2019s plans. Marr asks about the failure of the government to publish the impact of its Brexit deal. We\u2019re talking about something like \u00a372bn in extra borrowing, suggests Marr. That\u2019s not the figure, says Javid. The Bank of England said there would be growth every year, the chancellor says. \u201cThese numbers that you set out I don\u2019t recognise.\u201d Marr challenges Javid for saying he doesn\u2019t recognise the numbers, while not producing his own. Javid utters a soundbite about getting Brexit done. Marr asks about Moody\u2019s downgrading the UK\u2019s credit outlook. Javid says the downgrade is because of the paralysis in parliament and the only way to end that is to return a Conservative majority in parliament. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, is on Marr now. Marr suggests the \u00a31.2tn the Tories claim Labour will spend during the next parliament is \u201cbogus\u201d. \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Javid. Marr says you\u2019ve taken all Labour conference motions and assumed they will implement them straight away. Javid says every single costing has come from Labour\u2019s own figures, independent sources \u2026 or we have worked them out ourselves. You\u2019ve been very unfair, says Marr. This is the true cost of Corbyn\u2019s Labour, says Javid. He continues to stand by the analysis. Marr asks if the Tories will raise the threshold for National Insurance contributions. Javid says he\u2019s not going to set out manifesto commitments. Marr counters that this is something Boris Johnson has promised. Javid says he believes in low tax. Marr says you seem more familiar with Labour\u2019s manifesto than your own. What about inheritance tax? Javid again declines to comment on the Tory manifesto, taking the discussion back to the Labour manifesto. The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, is on Marr now. She\u2019s asked whether the Remain Alliance electoral pact, in 60 seats, can make a difference. She says that it can given that it we are probably heading for a hung parliament. They wanted Labour to be included she says but it was not possible. Marr asks about the \u00a3100bn a year the Greens have committed to \u201cgreening the economy\u201d and the economic impact. Lucas says that would make the UK a net-zero economy by 2030. The government target of 2050 is not good enough. She says it will pay for itself as it will generate jobs and cut health costs. Marr asks Lucas when she last flew. She says she flies as her son lives in the United States. She says \u201csystems change\u201d is important, we shouldn\u2019t focus on individual\u2019s actions and \u2018sitting in judgement on each other\u201d. Does there need to be an end to factory farming? Yes, says Lucas, stressing there needs to be a shift away from industrialised agriculture towards more eco-friendly practices. Marr suggests it is a problem for Greens that other parties, particularly Labour, are moving in the same direction on the climate emergency. Lucas says that voters should realise why they are moving in that direction - because of the Greens who will continue to hold their feet to the fire. She also says that last week there was someone on the show claiming that regional airport expansion is consistent with curbing the climate crisis. Moving swiftly onto BBC One, where Andrew Marr is interviewing the shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne. He is asked about how Labour would get its Brexit deal through the party and the Commons. Gwynne says there has to be compromise, which there hasn\u2019t been so far. He says the way to do it is to let the people decide (through a second referendum). It will be the people, not the politicians that decide. We are the only party offering that. Marr asks whether comments by Jeremy Corbyn last week amounted to preserving free movement. Gwynne says there will be \u201cbespoke arrangements\u201d and refers to \u201creciprocal agreements\u201d with the EU that will allow both British and EU citizens to continue to enjoy benefits such as participation in the Erasmus scheme. Marr asks whether the Labour manifesto will say that freedom of movement will end after Brexit, as it said in 2017. Gwynne tells Marr to ask him next week when the manifesto is published. The Lib Dems\u2019 Home Affairs spokeswoman, Christine Jardine, is being quizzed by Sophy Ridge now. Jardine is asked about the Remain Alliance electoral pact in 60 seats. Is that a kick in the teeth for voters? You\u2019re saying Brexit trumps everything? Jardine says Brexit does trump everything. \u201cIt\u2019s sucking the lifeblood out of everything in this country\u201d. Only then can other issues be tackled, she says. Jardine is asked about whether the Lib Dems are just trying to hang on to existing seats in Scotland. She answers in the negative and says the important distinction between the Lib Dems and the SNP (both remain parties) is that the Lib Dems are against the uncertainty that another independence referendum would bring. If you refresh the page, I have added some videos of Kwasi Kwarteng, Ian Blackford and Nia Griffith on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. The last question put to Griffith by Ridge is why can\u2019t Labour shake off the antisemitism allegations? Griffith says: \u201cWe do need to make sure we stamp this out in the party.\u201d She says Labour is making sure it takes action and investigates. The shadow defence secretary, Nia Griffith, is on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, back over on Sky. Ridge shows her polling that shows, in ex-industrial towns, Labour was well ahead in 2017 but is now trailing the Tories. She says the polling also shows the only areas where Labour is ahead is core cities. Griffith says: \u201cThis is a snapshot now.\u201d She believes there will be a change in polls over the next couple of weeks. Griffith is asked about the Tory claim that Labour\u2019s spending plans will cost the UK \u00a31.2tn over five years. These figures have come from \u201cabsolutely nowhere\u201d, says Griffith. She says when the Labour manifesto is published it will be fully costed, as it was in 2017. Griffith claims the Tories are trying to detract from the Labour manifesto, which will be far more exciting than the Conservatives. Ridge asks, on Remembrance Sunday, whether Labour would ever intervene in foreign conflicts. Griffith replies: There are going to be cases where we are not going to be able to walk by on the other side. She refers to humanitarian crises in the past such as in the Balkans and Rwanda. Ridge asks whether a Labour government would ever be prepared to use a nuclear deterrent. Griffith says the whole point of a deterrent is that you don\u2019t reveal what you would or wouldn\u2019t do. There must be \u201cthat element of doubt in your opponent\u2019s mind\u201d. Over to the BBC One for the Andrew Marr show now: Here\u2019s a clip of Kwasi Kwarteng on Sky News: Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in the House of Commons, was on after Kwarteng. Ridge asked what would be the red lines for the SNP in a hung parliament, when negotiating with other parties.. Blackford said austerity was important. Asked about Trident, he said the SNP had consistently opposed nuclear weapons but did not say it was a red line (as Nicola Sturgeon said in 2015). Climate change was also an important issue, said Blackford. Ridge shows Kwarteng Sky polling saying only 30% of voters think the Tories will spend more on public services. Their message that they are ending austerity is not getting through, she suggests. He responds by saying that Brexit is the central issue \u201cand then we can have a debate about spending\u201d. Ridge asks whether businesses in Northern Ireland will have to fill in forms after Brexit. Boris Johnson said no forms will be necessary but the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, said forms would be required in terms of trade from Northern Ireland to GB. Kwarteng says the PM is right but declines to say Barclay is wrong. Next Ridge asks about the abandoned pledge for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. Kwarteng says the government has a good record of tackling discrimination. He refers to Sajid Javid being in the cabinet. Asked about Lady Warsi\u2019s criticism of Matt Hancock for \u201cwhitesplaining\u201d, Karteng gives a general answer about all discrimination being unacceptable. Ridge asks Kwarteng about Boris Johnson\u2019s comparison of Jeremy Corbyn to Stalin, who is estimated to have killed 1 million people. Kwarteng defends the comparison as appropriate. He says \u201cthe philosophy, the underlying thinking\u201d is similar but there is no suggestion that Corbyn will line people up against a wall and kill anybody. Ridge asks how the Conservatives have gone through Labour\u2019s figures but not come up with their own. Kwarteng says opposition parties can \u201cpromise the earth\u201d without any analysis. Asked again about the figure for the Conservatives, he says: I\u2019m not going to bandy around figures. Ridge tells Kwarteng that\u2019s exactly what the Tories are doing with respect to Labour. Kwasi Karteng is asked by Sophy Ridge if the \u00a31.2tn figure (see previous update) is \u201cproject fear\u201d and \u201cridiculous\u201d, given Labour hasn\u2019t published its manifesto. The business minister says \u201cthey\u2019ve spoken about the four-day week\u201d as part of his justification. He says Labour\u2019s policies \u201cdon\u2019t add up\u201d. Ridge points out that not everything passed at conference becomes a policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that they are reckless in their spending,\u201d says Kwarteng. Ridge asks what the Tories\u2019s spending commitments will cost. Kwarteng says \u00a3150bn on infrastructure but won\u2019t give an answer to the overall figure. All he will say is that it is nowhere near Labour\u2019s figure. Good morning, welcome to Politics Live. It\u2019s a Sunday and it\u2019s just over a month until the general election so leading figures from the different parties will be desperately trying to make their case on the politics talk shows this morning. I\u2019ll be bringing you the action and keeping you updated all all the developments. If you want to get in touch/bring something to my attention your best bet is to tweet me @Haroon_Siddique. The Observer leads with the story that the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has delayed its announcement on whether Boris Johnson should face an investigation into possible criminal misconduct over allegations about a conflict of interest in his dealings while mayor of London with the US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri until after the election. It says: The decision prompted fury from Westminster politicians and London assembly members who said it appeared that a ruling had been \u201csuppressed\u201d in order to protect Johnson from potentially damaging headlines at a crucial stage of the election campaign. The IOPC has denied the allegation that it has delayed the announcement claiming no decision has been made. First up out of the politics shows is Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News and she will be joined by the business minister Kwasi Kwarteng. He will no doubt want to put the emphasis on the Tories\u2019 claim that Labour\u2019s spending plans will cost the UK more than \u00a31tn over five years. The Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Times and Mail on Sunday all loyally splashed on the story. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, rubbished the dossier, which assumes all policies passed at the Labour conference are firm commitments.",

The announcement comes after weeks of unrest over disputed election results, which escalated over the weekend as police forces joined anti-government protests, and the military said it would not \u201cconfront the people\u201d who had taken to the streets. In a televised news conference on Sunday, Morales told journalists he had decided to call fresh elections to \u201cto preserve the new Bolivia, life and democracy\u201d. Morales, who has been Bolivia\u2019s president for nearly 14 years, announced he would also replace members of the country\u2019s election board. The body has been heavily criticised after an unexplained 24-hour halt in the vote count on 20 October, which showed a shift in favour of Morales when it resumed. The stoppage fed accusations of fraud and prompted an audit of the vote by the Organisation of American States. But Bolivia\u2019s opposition leaders say the call for a fresh vote comes too late. Luis Fernando Camacho, a civic leader from the opposition stronghold Santa Cruz, said the OAS audit shows fraud and that Morales should resign. Carlos Mesa, runner up in the October election, said Morales and his vice president Alvaro Garc\u00eda Linares should be disqualified from participating in new elections as they were behind an attempt to rig the vote. Other civic groups and political parties voiced agreement with Mesa while Bolivia\u2019s trade union federation union, the COB \u2013 a one-time ally of Morales - called on the president to resign. The OAS\u2019s preliminary report said it had found \u201cclear manipulations\u201d of the voting system and said it could not verify a first-round victory for Morales. \u201cThe manipulations to the computer system are of such magnitude that they must be deeply investigated by the Bolivian state to get to the bottom of it and assign responsibility in this serious case,\u201d it said. The report added that it was \u201cstatistically improbable that Morales had obtained the 10% difference to avoid a second round\u201d.

So I would urge Labour to direct the bulk of the investment that this borrowing would enable into the areas of the country that have been starved of cash for decades \u2013 and in so doing maybe reduce the eagerness of such areas for Brexit. Terry Horsnell Cambridge \u2022 There are two glaring differences in the spending pledges by Labour and the Conservatives: the Labour party has been advocating this approach since austerity was instigated by George Osborne, whereas an imminent election has driven this U-turn by the Johnson government (Report, 8 November). And the promises/pledges issued by Mr Johnson are not the most durable, more akin to the longevity of a gnat.

      "body": "<p>Darwin is a city obsessed with laksa. In the NT, the fragrant noodle soup is such a big deal it\u2019s celebrated in a month-long <a href=\"https://laksafestival.nt.gov.au/\">dedicated festival</a>. Locals have started stuffing it in toasted sandwiches. They even, somewhat horrifically, infuse the flavour in scoops of ice-cream. (\u201cIt tastes pretty much exactly like laksa, only frozen,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.delicious.com.au/eat-out/latest-news/article/laksa-ice-cream-feature-darwins-international-laksa-festival/hbdnj37p\">apparently</a>.)</p> <p>The Top End capital is often stereotyped as Australia at its most ocker \u2013 a place you come to crack a cold one, skim read an NT News article about blokes wrestling crocs and watch the sunset over the ocean (don\u2019t get in the water though \u2013 the crocs and stingers are not a lie to scare tourists).</p> <p>The city is the gateway to the NT\u2019s beautiful national parks, but it should be treated as more than just a stopover on the way to Kakadu. Darwin\u2019s true appeal lies in its unique cultural makeup. Which is where the laksa comes in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c762304f5a38af2d478df3cac4f7d79b90b0ffe8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c762304f5a38af2d478df3cac4f7d79b90b0ffe8/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laksa at Parap Markets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laksa at Parap markets.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cherubino/Tourism NT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Geographically, as <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia/northern-territory/darwin\">many have noted</a>, Darwin is whole lot closer to Bali than it is Bondi or Brunswick. It certainly <em>feels</em> like an extension of south-east Asia: palm trees dot the city and humidity hugs you year round. Thai sweets, Cambodian pancakes and bowls of Vietnamese pho are sold alongside even more laksa at the city\u2019s many outdoor markets. On FM radio, furniture shops advertise the chance to win a trip to nearby Timor Leste if you spend enough on a lounge set.</p> <p>So it fits that as of the 2016 census, Darwin was more multicultural than Australia as a whole \u2013 37% of the population was born overseas, with the Philippines leading the migration charge. And those born here are more likely to be Indigenous than elsewhere in Australia. Darwin is home to a bigger First Nations population than any other capital city. It\u2019s also the staging ground for events like the National Indigenous Music Awards and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (Natsiaas), the latter of which in particular is worth planning a trip around.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/feb/02/dining-under-the-stars-sunsets-bush-tucker-and-that-view-at-uluru\">Dining under the stars: sunsets, bush tucker and that view at Uluru</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And unlike say Sydney, Darwin is too tiny to relegate its diversity to the outer suburbs. As Australia\u2019s smallest capital city \u2013 the population only officially cracked the 100,000 mark in 2001 \u2013 it often functions more like a small town. That means you can forget about much of anything except the local market being open before noon (if at all) on a Sunday, and locals will usually spot 27 people they know before they\u2019ve finished their second iced latte.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8464748d771855a6fe3af70416c602ef39e2230b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8464748d771855a6fe3af70416c602ef39e2230b/0_546_8275_4965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sunset over Darwin Harbour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sunset over Darwin Harbour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jules Ingall/Tourism NT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the places visitors will want to hit are clustered around the CBD and waterfront area, which can easily be tackled on foot. Remember to keep hydrated, though \u2013 there are two seasons here and both of them are hot. Most other destinations can be reached on a single bus ride, though the city\u2019s public transport system is far from perfect. Other that\u2019s-so-Darwin quirks include the tendency for red wine to be served cold by default and the <a href=\"https://www.ntnews.com.au/lifestyle/pauls-iced-coffee-back-on-territory-store-shelves-after-shortage/news-story/f22ee61df6dff5c18188bf4b89fca588\">local obsession</a> with Paul\u2019s iced coffee, a point of pride I don\u2019t quite understand but have to respect.</p> <p>Of course, those who come seeking the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Aussie_Adventures\">Russel Coight</a> experience will find plenty to keep busy with. You can even find real-life crocodiles in the middle of the main street, at a delightfully kitsch tourist trap dubbed Crocosaurus Cove.</p> <p>Keep your eyes peeled and you might even spot the Territory\u2019s purest source of joy \u2014 \u201cCU in the NT\u201d T-shirts for sale in the window of a dinky souvenir shop, a nod to the viral, sadly fake NT Tourism campaign that <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-08/c-u-in-the-nt-tourism-slogan-causes-social-media-stir/8004430\">swept social media</a> in 2016.

      "bodyText": "Darwin is a city obsessed with laksa. In the NT, the fragrant noodle soup is such a big deal it\u2019s celebrated in a month-long dedicated festival. Locals have started stuffing it in toasted sandwiches. They even, somewhat horrifically, infuse the flavour in scoops of ice-cream. (\u201cIt tastes pretty much exactly like laksa, only frozen,\u201d apparently.) The Top End capital is often stereotyped as Australia at its most ocker \u2013 a place you come to crack a cold one, skim read an NT News article about blokes wrestling crocs and watch the sunset over the ocean (don\u2019t get in the water though \u2013 the crocs and stingers are not a lie to scare tourists). The city is the gateway to the NT\u2019s beautiful national parks, but it should be treated as more than just a stopover on the way to Kakadu. Darwin\u2019s true appeal lies in its unique cultural makeup. Which is where the laksa comes in. Geographically, as many have noted, Darwin is whole lot closer to Bali than it is Bondi or Brunswick. It certainly feels like an extension of south-east Asia: palm trees dot the city and humidity hugs you year round. Thai sweets, Cambodian pancakes and bowls of Vietnamese pho are sold alongside even more laksa at the city\u2019s many outdoor markets. On FM radio, furniture shops advertise the chance to win a trip to nearby Timor Leste if you spend enough on a lounge set. So it fits that as of the 2016 census, Darwin was more multicultural than Australia as a whole \u2013 37% of the population was born overseas, with the Philippines leading the migration charge. And those born here are more likely to be Indigenous than elsewhere in Australia. Darwin is home to a bigger First Nations population than any other capital city. It\u2019s also the staging ground for events like the National Indigenous Music Awards and the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (Natsiaas), the latter of which in particular is worth planning a trip around. And unlike say Sydney, Darwin is too tiny to relegate its diversity to the outer suburbs. As Australia\u2019s smallest capital city \u2013 the population only officially cracked the 100,000 mark in 2001 \u2013 it often functions more like a small town. That means you can forget about much of anything except the local market being open before noon (if at all) on a Sunday, and locals will usually spot 27 people they know before they\u2019ve finished their second iced latte. Many of the places visitors will want to hit are clustered around the CBD and waterfront area, which can easily be tackled on foot. Remember to keep hydrated, though \u2013 there are two seasons here and both of them are hot. Most other destinations can be reached on a single bus ride, though the city\u2019s public transport system is far from perfect. Other that\u2019s-so-Darwin quirks include the tendency for red wine to be served cold by default and the local obsession with Paul\u2019s iced coffee, a point of pride I don\u2019t quite understand but have to respect. Of course, those who come seeking the Russel Coight experience will find plenty to keep busy with. You can even find real-life crocodiles in the middle of the main street, at a delightfully kitsch tourist trap dubbed Crocosaurus Cove. Keep your eyes peeled and you might even spot the Territory\u2019s purest source of joy \u2014 \u201cCU in the NT\u201d T-shirts for sale in the window of a dinky souvenir shop, a nod to the viral, sadly fake NT Tourism campaign that swept social media in 2016. Never forget. Don\u2019t miss: The markets, which are home to some of the best food in town and a cherished social ritual for Territorians. During the dry season, crowds converge at Mindil Beach markets on Thursday evenings, while Parap markets, home of the breakfast laksa (regular laksa, just eaten at 8am), whir year-round on Saturdays. Rapid Creek markets also run every Saturday and Sunday. Where to eat and drink: The city\u2019s best feed is a matter of fierce debate. Darwin-bred musician James Mangohig swears \u201cthe best food EVER in Darwin\u201d is at Sari Rasa, an Indonesian spot in the city only open for lunch during the week. Gurindji painter and fellow local Sarrita King \u2013 who confirms that yes, laksa is the \u201cunofficial cuisine\u201d of Darwin \u2013 votes that the best bowl in town is at Rendezvous cafe on Mitchell Street.

But if you\u2019re in the mood for something slightly fancier, head to Char Restaurant, an upmarket steakhouse set in a heritage-listed building. \u201cYou pay for the quality but it\u2019s worth every cent,\u201d says Mangohig. Where to stay: With rooms starting from around $140 a night, the Hilton on Mitchell Street and the Mindil Beach Casino Resort are about as fancy as things get in Darwin; just down the road in the CBD the Darwin City Hotel has rooms starting at $80 a night. Culture fix: The obvious first stop is the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory (MAGNT), home to a large permanent collection of Indigenous art and a great place to dig into Darwin\u2019s remarkable history, from the World War II bombing to Cyclone Tracey. For a glimpse of the city\u2019s music scene, Mangohig recommends hitting the Air Raid Arcade on Cavenagh Street, home to two record stores and a cosy drinking establishment in Babylon Bar. And if you\u2019re keen to explore things on foot? \u201cEveryone should download the Darwin Audio Tour,\u201d Mangohig adds. \u201cIt\u2019s an app and you take the tour and it\u2019s narrated by a legend named Charlie King who is a Gurindji man and one of the most beloved ABC presenters.\u201d Must-do day trip: A day trip to Litchfield National Park will take you to waterfalls, termite mounds and swimming holes. If you don\u2019t have a car, there are several operators who offer one-day trips from the city. When to visit: Visit before April 30, 2020 to see artist Bruce Munro\u2019s Tropical Light exhibit, a 2.5-kilometre trail of installation pieces that stretches from the waterfront to the CBD. The light \u201csculptures\u201d tip their hat to Australiana and Territory icons \u2013 think hills hoists decorated with technicolour clothes pegs and fishing rods arranged to form the NT\u2019s floral emblem, the Sturt desert rose.

      "body": "<p>Sitting in a nondescript conference centre in Launceston, Deborah asked the senators in front of her to be patient.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me,\u201d she told them, her voice trembling. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before and I\u2019m extremely nervous.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just her first time. For more than a month, a Senate inquiry into the Newstart payment has heard first-hand accounts of what life is like for some of Australia\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people.</p> <p>There have been references to self-harm and suicide. Anger and frustration. And stories of poverty, often set in train by bad luck \u2013 that and the low rate of their welfare payments, which is currently about $280 a week for a single person.</p> <p>Deborah, 61, broke down as she told the inquiry about being made redundant three years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve worked a total of 35 years for Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked 30 of those 35 years in factory work, it\u2019s physical labour.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly I\u2019m scared about what\u2019s going to happen to me when my car rego and my insurances come because there\u2019s no savings. Am I going to be forced to live in my car?</p> <p>\u201cI feel like people like myself deserve to be treated with some respect for our contribution to our country. And to be able to keep some dignity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7af6f1170790b2f2aa1766f14003b389814243c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7af6f1170790b2f2aa1766f14003b389814243c5/0_0_4816_3144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brenton, who has postgraduate qualifications in sciences and worked for two decades in IT, in the kitchen of the Community Centre at Marrickville\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brenton, who has postgraduate qualifications in sciences and worked for two decades in IT, in the kitchen of the Community Centre at Marrickville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The hearings are part of what the Australian Council of Social Service\u2019s (Acoss) chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, calls the \u201cmost important inquiry that\u2019s been undertaken in Australia for 25 years\u201d.</p> <p>Goldie rattled off the stats and facts at a hearing in Sydney. In one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, she said, there are still 3 million people live in poverty, including 740,000 children; Newstart has not risen in real terms since 1994; just in Queensland, a $75 per week increase would inject about $748m into local economies across the state.</p> <p>She listed a long list of supporters: the Business Council, unions, John Howard, Dick Smith, Deloitte. Another accounting giant, KPMG, told the inquiry last month it backed an increase of more than $90 a week, larger than the $75 advocated by Acoss and the Greens.</p> <p>Scott Morrison has been unmoved. At hearings in West Perth, Launceston, Alice Springs, Adelaide, Launceston and Sydney, about 30 of Australia\u2019s 700,000 Newstart recipients have popped their heads up above the parapet to convince Morrison he\u2019s wrong, a brave decision in a political environment that has overseen the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/13/duncan-storrar-qanda-personal-life-dragged-through-mud\"> high-profile demonisation of individual welfare recipients</a> who have dared to speak out.</p> <p>Deborah said she felt \u201cvery sad\u201d and \u201cdemeaned\u201d by the prime minister. In Sydney, Karen, who has been on Newstart for 10 years, has battled homelessness, depression and anxiety.</p> <p>To avoid sleeping on the streets, she tried living with a friend in rooming houses. It never worked out. There was violence and, at a rooming house, she lived with bed bugs.</p> <p>\u201cThe owner of the boarding house refused to get the place fumigated because one of the residents loved collecting live bedbugs in a jar,\u201d she told the inquiry in Sydney.</p> <p>She is now in public housing. After her bills are paid, she\u2019s left with $19 a day to live on.</p> <p>\u201cI have heard media comments that the social welfare system should be a trampoline and not a hammock that people get used to,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThe current low rate of welfare allowance is not a trampoline for people to bounce back up. It is a poverty trap.\u201d</p> <p>Alyx, 56, has also been on Newstart for about a decade. She finds contract work from time to time, but it rarely lasts longer than three months.</p> <p>Before she got into public housing, she was left with $11 a day to live on after she had paid the rent. That was factoring the rent assistance she got on top of Newstart.</p> <p>\u201cI have a bachelor of visual arts degree and an advanced diploma in business management,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m often told I\u2019m overqualified.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People like myself deserve to be treated with some respect for our contribution to our country. And to be able to keep some dignity.</p> <footer> <cite>Deborah</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As another Newstart recipient, Brenton, 56, put it: \u201cEntry-level positions are clogged with old people.\u201d</p> <p>They are part of the largest cohort of people on the dole: people over 55. The research shows women like Deborah and Alyx are increasingly likely to end up homeless. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/21/newstart-analysis-reveals-huge-leap-in-amount-of-time-people-spend-on-dole\">government statistics analysed by Guardian Australia</a> show the average time people can expect to spend on Newstart has increased almost every quarter September 2014.</p> <p>\u201cThe heart of the debate about the low rate of Newstart is not just about the consequences that we\u2019re all well aware of; it\u2019s also about the root cause,\u201d Brenton said.</p> <p>He has postgraduate qualifications in the sciences and worked for two decades in IT. Brenton knows the history of the system that he says has kept him poverty. The Americans had \u201cmakers not takers\u201d and the UK had \u201cworkers not shirkers\u201d, he said.</p> <p>In Australia, it\u2019s \u201clifters not leaners\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason for the government\u2019s resistance to raising Newstart is that that would undermine this whole central policy,\u201d he argued.</p> <p>Asked how he knew so much about the welfare system, Brenton replied: \u201cYou do, when your face is rubbed in it for years.\u201d</p> <p>Coalition senators have defended the government\u2019s position by employing variation on a theme proffered by Morrison: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/29/unfunded-empathy-scott-morrison-pushes-back-on-growing-calls-to-lift-newstart-rate\">that Labor was engaging in \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI think we can be quite clear on what [Labor\u2019s policy] was. A review of a review, with no budgeting,\u201d Liberal senator Hollie Hughes said. \u201cI think the Australian public have spoken very clearly on that one.\u201d</p> <p>But there have been signs the government acknowledges something needs to change. Hughes, who has appeared for the Coalition with fellow Liberal Wendy Askew, has explored the idea that any additional support for people on Newstart could be \u201ctargeted\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA blanket cry for an increase in Newstart obviously has significant cost benefits that would impact them potentially in other programs, or have impacts elsewhere,\u201d Hughes said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be very mindful and apply some intellectual depth to this, to make sure we\u2019re not just doing a blanket application where we can potentially better target what we\u2019re looking at.\u201d</p> <p>During the campaign, Labor sought to imply that its Newstart review would have been like the Harmer process, which led to the largest real terms age pension increase in history. Now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/23/labor-demands-boost-to-newstart-but-refuses-to-commit-to-size-of-increase\">it is explicitly campaigning for an increase, though it won\u2019t name a figure</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis inquiry represents a broader national discussion, about who we are as a nation \u2013 and whether we are truly prepared to measure ourselves by how we care for our most vulnerable citizens,\u201d Linda Burney, Labor\u2019s social services spokeswoman, said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9865afb17b7c65b4d5a7ccab3c40c38ca7ddb262\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9865afb17b7c65b4d5a7ccab3c40c38ca7ddb262/0_0_5040_3360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Before Alyx got into public housing, she was left with $11 a day to live on after she had paid the rent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Before Alyx got into public housing, she was left with $11 a day to live on after she had paid the rent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is little doubt the opposition\u2019s decision to openly campaign has made a made a difference. Labor teamed up with the Greens to launch the inquiry, a \u201creview\u201d of sorts, led by Rachel Siewert, who has long called for an increase to Newstart.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes a lot of bravery to air your personal experiences when [you are] talking about feelings of worthlessness caused by the system,\u201d the Greens senator says.</p> <p>Siewert is not new to the Senate\u2019s community affairs committee, which often deals with legislation impacting the most vulnerable people in Australia. There is genuine emotion in her voice after the final scheduled hearing of the year in Launceston.</p> <p>\u201cI think the evidence we just heard moved everybody in the room,\u201d Siewert tells Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Deborah said she agreed with another welfare recipient in Launceston, Patrick, when he said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being told that it would be better if I just wasn\u2019t here. It would be easier for Australia if I just disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>There will more hearings next year before the committee hands down a report in March. At the end of her appearance, Deborah was asked what she hoped would come from the inquiry.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I would say to the government, \u2018Use a bit of common sense, please,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA bit of common sense, a bit of compassion \u2026 We don\u2019t deserve to be thrown on the rubbish tip.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone, please listen to us.\u201d</p> <p><em>Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: <a href=\"http://www.lifeline.org.au/\">Lifeline</a> 13 11 14; <a href=\"http://www.suicidecallbackservice.org.au/\">Suicide Call Back Service</a> 1300 659 467; <a href=\"http://www.kidshelp.com.au/\">Kids Helpline</a> 1800 55 1800; <a href=\"http://www.mensline.org.au/\">MensLine Australia</a> 1300 78 99 78</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sitting in a nondescript conference centre in Launceston, Deborah asked the senators in front of her to be patient. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me,\u201d she told them, her voice trembling. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before and I\u2019m extremely nervous.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just her first time. For more than a month, a Senate inquiry into the Newstart payment has heard first-hand accounts of what life is like for some of Australia\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people. There have been references to self-harm and suicide. Anger and frustration. And stories of poverty, often set in train by bad luck \u2013 that and the low rate of their welfare payments, which is currently about $280 a week for a single person. Deborah, 61, broke down as she told the inquiry about being made redundant three years ago. \u201cI\u2019ve worked a total of 35 years for Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked 30 of those 35 years in factory work, it\u2019s physical labour. \u201cFrankly I\u2019m scared about what\u2019s going to happen to me when my car rego and my insurances come because there\u2019s no savings. Am I going to be forced to live in my car? \u201cI feel like people like myself deserve to be treated with some respect for our contribution to our country. And to be able to keep some dignity.\u201d The hearings are part of what the Australian Council of Social Service\u2019s (Acoss) chief executive, Cassandra Goldie, calls the \u201cmost important inquiry that\u2019s been undertaken in Australia for 25 years\u201d. Goldie rattled off the stats and facts at a hearing in Sydney. In one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries, she said, there are still 3 million people live in poverty, including 740,000 children; Newstart has not risen in real terms since 1994; just in Queensland, a $75 per week increase would inject about $748m into local economies across the state. She listed a long list of supporters: the Business Council, unions, John Howard, Dick Smith, Deloitte. Another accounting giant, KPMG, told the inquiry last month it backed an increase of more than $90 a week, larger than the $75 advocated by Acoss and the Greens. Scott Morrison has been unmoved. At hearings in West Perth, Launceston, Alice Springs, Adelaide, Launceston and Sydney, about 30 of Australia\u2019s 700,000 Newstart recipients have popped their heads up above the parapet to convince Morrison he\u2019s wrong, a brave decision in a political environment that has overseen the high-profile demonisation of individual welfare recipients who have dared to speak out. Deborah said she felt \u201cvery sad\u201d and \u201cdemeaned\u201d by the prime minister. In Sydney, Karen, who has been on Newstart for 10 years, has battled homelessness, depression and anxiety. To avoid sleeping on the streets, she tried living with a friend in rooming houses. It never worked out. There was violence and, at a rooming house, she lived with bed bugs. \u201cThe owner of the boarding house refused to get the place fumigated because one of the residents loved collecting live bedbugs in a jar,\u201d she told the inquiry in Sydney. She is now in public housing. After her bills are paid, she\u2019s left with $19 a day to live on. \u201cI have heard media comments that the social welfare system should be a trampoline and not a hammock that people get used to,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThe current low rate of welfare allowance is not a trampoline for people to bounce back up. It is a poverty trap.\u201d Alyx, 56, has also been on Newstart for about a decade. She finds contract work from time to time, but it rarely lasts longer than three months. Before she got into public housing, she was left with $11 a day to live on after she had paid the rent. That was factoring the rent assistance she got on top of Newstart. \u201cI have a bachelor of visual arts degree and an advanced diploma in business management,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m often told I\u2019m overqualified.\u201d As another Newstart recipient, Brenton, 56, put it: \u201cEntry-level positions are clogged with old people.\u201d They are part of the largest cohort of people on the dole: people over 55. The research shows women like Deborah and Alyx are increasingly likely to end up homeless. And government statistics analysed by Guardian Australia show the average time people can expect to spend on Newstart has increased almost every quarter September 2014. \u201cThe heart of the debate about the low rate of Newstart is not just about the consequences that we\u2019re all well aware of; it\u2019s also about the root cause,\u201d Brenton said. He has postgraduate qualifications in the sciences and worked for two decades in IT. Brenton knows the history of the system that he says has kept him poverty. The Americans had \u201cmakers not takers\u201d and the UK had \u201cworkers not shirkers\u201d, he said. In Australia, it\u2019s \u201clifters not leaners\u201d. \u201cThe reason for the government\u2019s resistance to raising Newstart is that that would undermine this whole central policy,\u201d he argued. Asked how he knew so much about the welfare system, Brenton replied: \u201cYou do, when your face is rubbed in it for years.\u201d Coalition senators have defended the government\u2019s position by employing variation on a theme proffered by Morrison: that Labor was engaging in \u201cunfunded empathy\u201d. \u201cI think we can be quite clear on what [Labor\u2019s policy] was. A review of a review, with no budgeting,\u201d Liberal senator Hollie Hughes said. \u201cI think the Australian public have spoken very clearly on that one.\u201d But there have been signs the government acknowledges something needs to change. Hughes, who has appeared for the Coalition with fellow Liberal Wendy Askew, has explored the idea that any additional support for people on Newstart could be \u201ctargeted\u201d. \u201cA blanket cry for an increase in Newstart obviously has significant cost benefits that would impact them potentially in other programs, or have impacts elsewhere,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe need to be very mindful and apply some intellectual depth to this, to make sure we\u2019re not just doing a blanket application where we can potentially better target what we\u2019re looking at.\u201d During the campaign, Labor sought to imply that its Newstart review would have been like the Harmer process, which led to the largest real terms age pension increase in history. Now, it is explicitly campaigning for an increase, though it won\u2019t name a figure. \u201cThis inquiry represents a broader national discussion, about who we are as a nation \u2013 and whether we are truly prepared to measure ourselves by how we care for our most vulnerable citizens,\u201d Linda Burney, Labor\u2019s social services spokeswoman, said. There is little doubt the opposition\u2019s decision to openly campaign has made a made a difference. Labor teamed up with the Greens to launch the inquiry, a \u201creview\u201d of sorts, led by Rachel Siewert, who has long called for an increase to Newstart. \u201cIt takes a lot of bravery to air your personal experiences when [you are] talking about feelings of worthlessness caused by the system,\u201d the Greens senator says. Siewert is not new to the Senate\u2019s community affairs committee, which often deals with legislation impacting the most vulnerable people in Australia. There is genuine emotion in her voice after the final scheduled hearing of the year in Launceston. \u201cI think the evidence we just heard moved everybody in the room,\u201d Siewert tells Guardian Australia. Deborah said she agreed with another welfare recipient in Launceston, Patrick, when he said: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m being told that it would be better if I just wasn\u2019t here. It would be easier for Australia if I just disappeared.\u201d There will more hearings next year before the committee hands down a report in March. At the end of her appearance, Deborah was asked what she hoped would come from the inquiry. \u201cWhat I would say to the government, \u2018Use a bit of common sense, please,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA bit of common sense, a bit of compassion \u2026 We don\u2019t deserve to be thrown on the rubbish tip. \u201cSomeone, please listen to us.\u201d Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78",

That\u2019s why they jailed these 50 people as a symbol. It is not reasonable and acceptable that among 1,100 people, they reject 50. These people who rejected, their cases are similar to others. We left from the same countries and same systems. \u201cPart of this policy\u2019s culture is that it\u2019s like a rule that always someone should be beaten.

All the tactical ephemera that makes modern football so sophisticated can\u2019t deny the physics of a ball in motion being chased by a pack of single-minded athletes in an arbitrarily enclosed space. Sporadic anarchy in an increasingly ordered universe.

They evolved into a winning machine last season under Tony Popovic and despite some significant departures from the premiership-winning squad the replacements appeared more than capable of filling the breach. So far it isn\u2019t going according to plan.</p> <p>Defensively, the absence of Shane Lowry and Matt Spiranovic has made Glory\u2019s spine less rigid, prompting Popovic to jettison his preferred three-man defence in favour of a flat back four. Further forward, ball movement is not so slick. In transition there isn\u2019t the focal point Andy Keogh used to provide, nor the sympatico of movement he shared with Chris Ikonomidis and Joel Chianese that would stretch defences and create undefendable space. In more considered build-up play there is plenty of circulation from side to side, but a lack of finesse when the ball is delivered forward - a problem commonplace in the A-League.</p> <p>After 85-and-a-half minutes against Newcastle Jets on Saturday, Glory\u2019s indifferent start to the season was threatening to become a mini-crisis. One-nil down, and with star signing Bruno Fornaroli substituted for a 16-year-old, inspiration was in short supply. Then, with play unfolding innocuously in Newcastle\u2019s half, Juande spotted an intelligent overlapping run from right-back Ivan Franjic and dinked the ball in his direction. It precipitated a game-changing, possibly season-defining scramble.</p> <p>A weary Johnny Koutroumbis could have shut the party down before it started but he failed to make the clearing header. However, he did enough to prevent Franjic collecting the ball in his stride, forcing an awkward extra touch. That was all the invitation Nikolai Topor-Stanley required to leave his man and hurl his Dothraki-like frame between Franjic and the ball. It was on.</p> <p>A good scramble needs a critical mass of bodies. Too few and it\u2019s merely a showcase for ineptitude, too many and the sought-after pinball effect descends into the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5_YTSQpIuE\">Kirkwall Ba game</a>. When Franjic attempted the first effort on goal there were 11 players inside the penalty area with reinforcements on the way.</p> <p>Topor-Stanley\u2019s first block was superb, as was his wherewithal to avoid a handball, before he somehow contorted his body into a second diving tackle without regaining his footing.

      "bodyText": "Goalmouth scrambles are brilliant. Brilliant like a Paul Whitehouse Fast Show sketch, all hyperactive and confused and overwhelmed by infectious energy. They\u2019re not brilliant in a pure footballing sense, that much is self-evident. They are not a celebration of jogo bonito or a reflection of totaalvoetbal, but in an era where our understanding of how the game should be played is approaching orthodoxy there is a visceral brilliance to these infrequent moments of mob rule. All the tactical ephemera that makes modern football so sophisticated can\u2019t deny the physics of a ball in motion being chased by a pack of single-minded athletes in an arbitrarily enclosed space. Sporadic anarchy in an increasingly ordered universe. Football\u2019s equivalent of punk gatecrashing a prog solo. Before the A-League season began, Perth Glory were among the favourites to compete for silverware. They evolved into a winning machine last season under Tony Popovic and despite some significant departures from the premiership-winning squad the replacements appeared more than capable of filling the breach. So far it isn\u2019t going according to plan. Defensively, the absence of Shane Lowry and Matt Spiranovic has made Glory\u2019s spine less rigid, prompting Popovic to jettison his preferred three-man defence in favour of a flat back four. Further forward, ball movement is not so slick. In transition there isn\u2019t the focal point Andy Keogh used to provide, nor the sympatico of movement he shared with Chris Ikonomidis and Joel Chianese that would stretch defences and create undefendable space. In more considered build-up play there is plenty of circulation from side to side, but a lack of finesse when the ball is delivered forward - a problem commonplace in the A-League. After 85-and-a-half minutes against Newcastle Jets on Saturday, Glory\u2019s indifferent start to the season was threatening to become a mini-crisis. One-nil down, and with star signing Bruno Fornaroli substituted for a 16-year-old, inspiration was in short supply. Then, with play unfolding innocuously in Newcastle\u2019s half, Juande spotted an intelligent overlapping run from right-back Ivan Franjic and dinked the ball in his direction. It precipitated a game-changing, possibly season-defining scramble. A weary Johnny Koutroumbis could have shut the party down before it started but he failed to make the clearing header. However, he did enough to prevent Franjic collecting the ball in his stride, forcing an awkward extra touch. That was all the invitation Nikolai Topor-Stanley required to leave his man and hurl his Dothraki-like frame between Franjic and the ball. It was on. A good scramble needs a critical mass of bodies. Too few and it\u2019s merely a showcase for ineptitude, too many and the sought-after pinball effect descends into the Kirkwall Ba game. When Franjic attempted the first effort on goal there were 11 players inside the penalty area with reinforcements on the way. Topor-Stanley\u2019s first block was superb, as was his wherewithal to avoid a handball, before he somehow contorted his body into a second diving tackle without regaining his footing. Nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd and protagonists were now entering the scene from all angles like AAMI Park seagulls. It was becoming a McFadden\u2019s Cold War interpretation of El Clasico, the Jets in their blaugrana stripes, Glory in Real white, players parking images of chalkboards and memories of third-man runs to allow room for System 1 behaviour to take over. See ball, kick ball. Improbably, the brief melee spat out a pass so perfect for the onrushing Chris Harold it suggested divine intervention (clearly it wasn\u2019t, because His hands are full up in Brisbane). A few blades of grass to the right of the penalty spot the substitute side-footed a shot that was deflected by the blur that was a charging Matt Millar, sending the ball cannoning against the crossbar and back into the teeming soccer sea. Koutroumbis was first to react but his flailing header could not divert the ball out of play.

      "bodyText": "A new cafe development in a key Tasmanian marginal seat and a $1m mountain bike path in Victoria were exempted from co-funding requirements under the Coalition\u2019s $200m regional grants scheme in breach of the program\u2019s guidelines. One of the projects, in the marginal seat of Bass in Tasmania, received $365,000 for the total cost of a new cafe development on Flinders Island despite the department advising the ministerial panel the applicant had supplied \u201climited evidence\u201d to support their case. In another instance, a mountain bike club in Gippsland was awarded almost $1m for a new bike track and was exempted from providing matching co-funding even though its application was not properly assessed. The revelations are included in a scathing report from the auditor general into the grants scheme, which has raised concern about the government approving funds for projects against the advice of the department. In relation to the Gippsland project, the auditor found the department \u201cdid not provide any assessment advice to the panel on the case made by the applicant in support of its request\u201d, despite recommending that the request be approved. It also said that this briefing was not signed by the minister on behalf of the panel, with the department suggesting it was \u201csuperseded\u201d by a later recommendation. However, the auditor said that this later briefing did not ask that the panel approve the co-funding exemption request, even though the $976,950 bike track proposal at Hernes Oak was funded. \u201cSo there is no record that the exemption request was approved.\u201d Under the program guidelines, applicants could apply for a co-funding exemption if they could demonstrate \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, with examples such as drought or disaster declaration and industry decline given. It said it would be \u201crare\u201d for the ministerial panel to approve exemptions. The auditor general found that the department did not assess each exemption request against the program guidelines, nor did it provide a recommendation on each request to the ministerial panel that was consistent with any assessment that was undertaken. Four of the 16 applications for co-funding exemption were granted, two of which were approved against the advice of the department. In total, the four projects were awarded $1.74m in grant funding. Labor will target the Coalition over the grants scheme when parliament resumes this week, with the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, calling on the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, to provide a \u201cfull explanation\u201d of the ministerial panel\u2019s approach. \u201cWith the Gippsland project, the auditor general found the ministers approved the exemption without an assessment of the co-funding case and didn\u2019t even properly sign the briefing. \u201cWhile a mountain bike park should be a positive for the people of the Latrobe Valley, this is a million dollars of taxpayer funds that should have leveraged at least another million dollars in private investment into Gippsland.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning King also questioned whether the panel had asked the proponents of the Tasmanian project if they could contribute any finance to the cafe development. \u201cThis is hundreds of thousands of taxpayer funds going to what will be a privately run cafe without leveraging a cent of private investment,\u201d King said. \u201cIf a cafe proprietor isn\u2019t prepared to stump a cent to back the project, why should the government?\u201d According to the proposal from the Flinders Island Tourism and Business organisation, the $365,000 grant will be used to build a cafe and community centre, along with an accommodation unit for the operator of the cafe. \u201cThe outcomes of this project will contribute to economic growth and diversification, job creation and a sustainable community on Flinders Island,\u201d the grant summary states. The objective of the regional job and investment program was to create jobs in regional areas across five states. This included the Bowen Basin, tropical north Queensland and Wide Bay Burnett in Queensland; the north and south coast of New South Wales; South Australia\u2019s Upper Spencer Gulf; Geelong, the Goulburn Valley and the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, and regional Tasmania. The ministerial panel overseeing grants for the first three regions comprised Nationals Darren Chester and Michael McCormack and Liberals Michaelia Cash and James McGrath. For the remaining regions, the panel consisted of the LNP\u2019s John McVeigh and National Bridget McKenzie \u2013 who replaced Cash. The audit found the ministerial panel declined to fund 28% of grant applications recommended to them by the department, and approved 17% of applications that had not been recommended. One of the companies to receive a $1m grant is currently being targeted by the corporate regulator for deregistration, while the project is losing money and unlikely to be complete for another two years. The department has declined to comment on the merits of individual projects, and has refused to reveal which projects were approved by the ministerial panel against the advice of bureaucrats.",

      "bodyText": "When Market Forces, a small climate activist group, was singled out as the target of the government\u2019s push to stop environmental campaigns that advocate boycotts of fossil-fuel companies, its leader was briefly taken aback but not disappointed. \u201cYou know you\u2019re doing something right when the Morrison government tries to bring you down,\u201d Julien Vincent, the group\u2019s executive director and founder, says from its base in Melbourne. \u201cIt\u2019s unpleasant, but it\u2019s only happening because we are getting results.\u201d From Vincent\u2019s perspective, those results include the Commonwealth Bank and insurers QBE, Suncorp and IAG pledging they would soon no longer work with or underwrite developments that use thermal coal, and the group\u2019s part in the campaign that frustrated attempts by Indian company Adani to find investors for its proposed Carmichael coalmine. In terms of winning the government\u2019s attention, it is likely the results also included a recent profile in the Australian Financial Review, the newspaper of the business community. Under the headline \u201cHow activists pushed CBA out of coal in five years\u201d, it talked up Market Forces\u2019s successes and methods, including a deal-making meeting with the bank\u2019s chairwoman, Catherine Livingstone. Coincidentally or not, the attorney general, Christian Porter, last week nominated Market Forces as a poster child \u201cradical activist group\u201d trying to impose its will on companies through coordinated harassment and threats of boycotts. Porter said it was \u201csimply not OK\u201d that mining and resources businesses were being targeted on ideological grounds by activists that wished them financial harm. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It followed Scott Morrison telling the Queensland Resources Council that activists who campaigned for secondary boycotts against miners and small businesses that work with resources companies potentially posed a \u201cmore insidious threat\u201d to jobs and the economy than street protests. How the government plans to deal with this remains unclear. Porter suggested the response would be urgent and broad, possibly including regulatory action aimed at investors who fund class actions. But in an interview with the ABC on Sunday, Matthew Canavan, the resources minister, suggested any change would be narrow, restricted to adjusting an existing competition law that outlaws secondary boycotts but exempts activities related to environmental and consumer protection.

With the details in the wind, Morrison\u2019s push has led to some confusion among Coalition MPs about what is proposed and how it will avoid impinging on freedom of expression, though none spoke publicly. The Business Council of Australia has backed the prime minister; legal academics have warned changes to reduce the influence of environmental campaigns could breach the constitution.

In 2016, the superfit 20-year-old was flying through the Hampshire countryside on his bicycle when he was knocked down by a car.<strong> </strong>He died of his injuries.</p> <p>At the Houghtons\u2019 house in Buckinghamshire, a tall and handsome Will smiles out of family portraits. The bright red racing bike he bought but never rode \u2013 it arrived a fortnight after his death \u2013 hangs on a wall.</p> <p>Houghton recalls she would come downstairs in the morning to find him sitting red-faced and muddy in the kitchen, having cycled 50 miles before breakfast: \u201cHe would be stuffing his face with porridge and saying: \u2018We live in such a beautiful country, Mum.\u2019 That\u2019s what cycling gave him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had the best life \u2026 we want everyone to have a bit of what Will had,\u201d she says.

All his mother would like in return is \u201cto know that the fact Will died so young has changed other people\u2019s lives\u201d. But she has heard almost nothing about the people who benefited. \u201cIt\u2019s so upsetting. I knew my 20-year-old son\u2019s heart was out there and I wanted to know that person woke up and thought: \u2018There was a boy who did that for me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The gravity of Will\u2019s injuries meant Houghton and her husband, Richard, were escorted by police to the hospital in Southampton where he had been airlifted after the accident. \u201cI relive that every day,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are half thinking the worst because you are in a police car. When we got there, they took us into a room and the doctor asked: \u2018What do you know?\u2019 I said I knew it was bad.

      "bodyText": "Liz Houghton\u2019s son Will was living his best life when his world stopped. In 2016, the superfit 20-year-old was flying through the Hampshire countryside on his bicycle when he was knocked down by a car. He died of his injuries. At the Houghtons\u2019 house in Buckinghamshire, a tall and handsome Will smiles out of family portraits. The bright red racing bike he bought but never rode \u2013 it arrived a fortnight after his death \u2013 hangs on a wall. Houghton recalls she would come downstairs in the morning to find him sitting red-faced and muddy in the kitchen, having cycled 50 miles before breakfast: \u201cHe would be stuffing his face with porridge and saying: \u2018We live in such a beautiful country, Mum.\u2019 That\u2019s what cycling gave him.\u201d \u201cHe had the best life \u2026 we want everyone to have a bit of what Will had,\u201d she says. And, in a way, 12 people did \u2013 his heart beats in another man\u2019s chest, his liver transformed the life of a toddler with a rare disease and his \u201cbeautiful\u201d brown eyes helped four others see. All his mother would like in return is \u201cto know that the fact Will died so young has changed other people\u2019s lives\u201d. But she has heard almost nothing about the people who benefited. \u201cIt\u2019s so upsetting. I knew my 20-year-old son\u2019s heart was out there and I wanted to know that person woke up and thought: \u2018There was a boy who did that for me.\u2019\u201d The gravity of Will\u2019s injuries meant Houghton and her husband, Richard, were escorted by police to the hospital in Southampton where he had been airlifted after the accident. \u201cI relive that every day,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are half thinking the worst because you are in a police car. When we got there, they took us into a room and the doctor asked: \u2018What do you know?\u2019 I said I knew it was bad. He said: \u2018It\u2019s unsurvivable.\u2019 It is like a bulldozer hitting you.\u201d The opinionated and lively sports science student, whose loves included US politics, reality TV and Skittles, had been vocal about his decision to join the donor register. \u201cOnce we knew we had no hope, it all became about his organs,\u201d says Houghton. \u201cIf someone had said to me before the accident: \u2018We want to have Will\u2019s eyes,\u2019 I would have said: \u2018No way.\u2019 He was so handsome. But when it happened, I wanted them to take every single piece of him. I didn\u2019t want one thing going in the ground.\u201d Families can opt to receive a letter containing basic information about the recipients, which arrives about a fortnight after donation. They are also asked if they would like to receive a thank you letter should one be written. But while more than 90% of donor families say they would like to be contacted, only 20% of recipients write.

      "bodyText": "And Jamie Jackson was at Old Trafford ... Thanks for joining me. Enjoy Liverpool v City! Here is Paul Doyle\u2019s match report. It\u2019s a shame Villa did not show the same attacking intent and commitment in the opening 45 mins, as it would have been a tighter match. They looked dangerous after the break, especially El Ghazi. Here\u2019s a stat: Following the amuse-bouche of Wolves v Villa, you should join Simon Burnton for the starter, main and dessert: The old days of Adama Traore having no end product are very much out the window. He has matured and improved beyond measure, especially considering he\u2019s playing as a wing-back and not an out-and-out winger. I have a sneaky feeling Sky will not offer much in the way of post-match analysis on this match. Elsewhere, Manchester United have seen off Brighton 3-1 at Old Trafford. Pereira, Propper (OG) and Rashford bagging for United with Dunk getting the consolation. Traore was my Man of the Match, he caused trouble throughout down the right wing and no one looked capable of coping with him, as a few people did their best to keep him down. He won the free-kick which resulted in the first goal and assisted the second. Very much a deserved victory for the hosts who dominated the majority of the match and created the best chances throughout and probably should have had a few more. Villa were unlucky with the early injury to Steer but they barely offered anything going forward, so can\u2019t complete about the result. A corner finds its way to the back post where Trezeguet whacks a shot at goal, through bodies and just an inch or so over the line despite Saiss\u2019 best efforts as Taylor\u2019s wrist watch alerts him to the goal. 90 mins: Jimenez wanders off with some sort of injury. Maybe he just doesn\u2019t fancy international duty, so wants an excuse. Cutrone on. Three minutes added on. 88 mins: Wolves fans are cheering every pass and there\u2019s been a few of them in recent moments, as the home players toy with the tired Villa team. 86 mins: Moutinho goes into the book for a lunge on McGinn. He had two feet off the floor, so it wasn\u2019t a great effort. El Ghazi takes a punt from the free-kick 30 yards from goal but it\u2019s easy for Patricio. Villa are caught after an attack breaks down on the edge of the Wolves box. Traore dribbles downfield and draws in Luiz, goes past him and waltzes into the box where he pulls it back for a waiting Jimenez who gleefully diverts the ball into the bottom corner. 83 mins: Jota exits stage left, with Neto the man coming on. 81 mins: Dendoncker goes down in the box after getting a knock on the back of his head from a flying Lansbury when challenging for the ball. Trezeguet gets played in down the right on two occasions. First, he sends in a dangerous cross which is just about cleared after Wesley misses his kick, then he cuts in onto his left foot and has a shot blocked. Joe says: \u201c Jota has been moaning every call. Deserved that yellow ages ago.\u201d 79 mins: Wolves look like the side who need to make some changes now. Maybe they are tired from Thursday but they are inviting pressure on themselves now. A cross is lifted into the box for Lansbury to attack, he gets his head to it but Wolves scrappily get the ball clear. David emails in: \u201cVilla fan here in the US. Help me be objective, surely it was penalty to Villa?\u201d It really wasn\u2019t. The defender got the ball. 77 mins: El Ghazi glides between three or four Wolves defenders and his pull-back makes its way to an onrushing McGinn but his shot hits a defender. Mary says about United: \u201cThe Brighton goal has woke up the Devils. After the instant response for their third they have been on fire. Rashford missed a sitter and they have had three golden opportunities for a fourth that made the Brighton goalie sweat.\u201d 75 mins: Jota gets cautioned for having a go at the ref after a throw-in is given the other way. Seems a bit silly from the Wolves man. At Old Trafford, United are 3-1 up. Rashford and Dunk have scored since the break. 73 mins: The ball is played into the Wolves box for Trezeguet to attack but Jonny slides in and gets a toe on the ball but then takes out the Egyptian. Traore then gets into the Villa area and crosses the ball into Taylor\u2019s chest and out for a corner. Both go to VAR but neither are given and rightly so. The fans still sing: \u201cF**k VAR\u201d. 71 mins: Naturally, Villa bring on Lansbury as their final sub and then Mings goes down in a heap after tackling Jota. He screams in agony but gets himself up and limps back into position. Mings does not look happy to still be out there with what looks like a groin injury. 69 mins: Wolves setup camp in the final third but only muster a weak Jota shot which is deflected wide. They come again and Jota once more has a shot blocked, taking it into the path of Jimenez, he makes some room for himself but hits a shot wide when off-balance. 67 mins: Douglas Luiz is a lovely player to watch thanks to his passing range. No wonder Guardiola wanted him at City this season. 65 mins: Luiz whips a stunning first-time pass straight into the path of Trezeguet on the left wing but then the Egyptian runs into trouble and loses it. Down the other end, Jota cuts in from the left and hits a rising shot from the edge of the area which is just above Nyland\u2019s head, he takes no chances by palming it over. 63 mins: Jimenez looks annoyed after pulling back Konsa and being penalised for the infringement. I am not sure how the Mexican thought it was a fair challenge but I appreciate his reaction nonetheless. 61 mins: It turns out Aston Villa had 65 per cent possession in the last 10 minutes, which is a sign of their improvement. El Ghazi backs up this point by winning a corner off Saiss. Sadly for Villa, Wolves head the set-piece clear. 59 mins: Villa are a lot brighter in this half but Wolves still look like they could rip them apart at any point. 57 mins: Aston Villa clear a corner until Luiz fails to take control of the ball and Neves nips in but then bundles the Brazilian over in his own box. 55 mins: McGinn is dispossessed on the halfway by Jota, who takes the ball forward, eventually it lands at Neves\u2019 feet who cracks a shot from 25 yards which Mings gets in the way of and heads wide. Villa break down the other end from the corner as El Ghazi takes it 40 yards up the pitch before laying it off to Wesley who sends his shot well over from just outside the area. 53 mins: Coady goes down injured and removes his left boot. No one comes to treat him and he puts it back on, tying his laces tightly. This update will win my Pulitzer. 51 mins: Traore receives the ball in space for the right, makes a dart for the box, holds it up and then thwacks a shot from 16 yards and it ricochets off the bar and away. That is probably the hardest I\u2019ve seen a ball hit this season. Jimenez then dribbles the ball from a similar position and toe pokes a shot wide from 20 yards. 49 mins: Moutinho whips in a corner from the left but it barely beats the first man and is headed away. 47 mins: Villa show more intent in the opening two minutes of the second-half than in the whole of the first. First El Ghazi does well on the right before a cross is cleared, then Taylor whacks a shot from the edge of the box which flies upwards and over. Here we go again! I would consider bringing on Chester for El Ghazi and matching Wolves\u2019 formation and play Trezeguet as a second striker. I was discussing how Villa could change things to improve but seeing as they\u2019ve already used two subs, their options are extremely limited. Smith will need to hold back to ensure he does not end up making his third sub too early. Souness rightly bemoans Villa\u2019s defence for the Neves goal. Why was no one on the edge of the box? It\u2019s pretty amateur to not see any threat out there. Mary emails in an update from the United-Brighton match, which saves me a job: \u201cRed Devils have had the run of play. Their speed has bothered Brighton and have forced 4 yellows. Both Man U goals were ugly. And Brighton had two set pieces where Man U marking was awful and they had two golden opportunities spoiled.\u201d Pete emails: \u201cJust been in the Asda opposite The Molineux where we had a hot chocolate with a gaggle of fans before the game. \u201cPredict a 2-1 victory today and a final 7th place finish again. Are you jealous of how good we are?\u201d Not sure why I would be jealous, to be honest. I am more jealous of the hot chocolate than Wolves\u2019 performance. At Old Trafford, Manchester United have a 2-0 lead over Brighton. Pereira opened the scoring before Davy Propper turned the ball into his own net. Well ... not a great half for Villa who have lost their goalkeeper and a full-back to injury, not to mention the fact Steer was only playing due Heaton\u2019s knock. Wolves have been on top from the start and should be further ahead in all honesty. 45+2 mins: Targett is down due to a blow to the face other something. And he is replaced by Taylor. Jon Byrne emails in: \u201cSorry to interrupt the Wolves vs Aston Villa game, but I thought people might be interested to know there were first round FA cup ties today. In it, Non-League Dover beat League One Southend 1-0, League Two side Macclesfield Town being beaten 4-0 at home to I believe 7th tier Kingstonian, and League Two Leyton Orient being beaten 2-1 at home to Maldon &amp; Tiptree, to name a few. Football truly can be a funny sport.\u201d 45 mins: El Ghazi is down injured after a kick from Moutinho. It wasn\u2019t that bad, so no idea why he is worried he\u2019s been shot. Three minutes added on - I expected more. 43 mins: The goal was the result of the issues Targett is having with Troare and Mings feeling forced to stop him illegally. If Villa had issues before, then they\u2019re about to get worse. The resulting free-kick from the right-hand edge of the box is pulled back to the edge of the area where Neves is waiting completely unmarked, allowing him to time his run, take aim and find the corner from 18 yards. Woeful defending from Villa, though. 40 mins: Jota bulldozes his way through the Vila defence, getting the best of Nakamba inside the box but he is too close to the goalkeeper when he finally shoots allowing Nyland to block his effort. Mings goes into the book for a crude foul on Traore after the wing-back beat the England defender to the ball at full pace. 38 mins: Targett recovers and gets his own back on Traore by outmuscling the Wolves player when attacking but Villa only get to the edge of the box where the danger is removed. 36 mins: Targett banged his head in that challenge requires a minute or so of treatment, which is fair enough. Maybe he will give him the rest he requires as he is struggling on that flank against Traore et al. 34 mins: Can Villa turn the tide here? I think they will need to change something at half-time even if the score remains the same. Taylor shakes his head when Doherty goes down in tangle with Targett. It looks like a classic tangle of legs and should not be a penalty but it\u2019s goes to VAR and they agree with me. 32 mins: Jota is the latest player to find space out wide but his pull-back goes behind the onrushing Jonny and Villa whack it clear. Targett makes another woeful decision by whacking the ball high and backwards from the halfway but, luckily for him, Jimenez fails to control it. 30 mins: Villa have their first chance of the game as Trezeguet curls in a cross from the left, Wesley finds space around the penalty spot but his flicked header lacks pace and bounces into Patricio\u2019s arms. 28 mins: Nakamba takes emergency action to stop a Wolves counter attack by tripping Jota before things get dangerous. He is rightly booked for his misdemeanour. Villa then set their own downfall when Targett loses the ball with a backheel on the halfway line, allowing Wolves to break but Jimenez eventually fires a shot wide from the edge of the area. 26 mins: Traore squirms into the box and between a couple of defenders, allowing him to lift a cross towards the six-yard box, Jota gets the wrong side of Guilbert but his header is weak and straight at Nyland who calmly collects. 24 mins: Guilbert tries to earn a corner claiming a Wolves had the final touch but everyone can see it came off the Villa, who still seems surprised when the goal-kick is awarded. Elsewhere, Manchester United are winning 2-0 against Brighton. 22 mins: Wolves are completely dominant here, with Neves and Moutinho dictating play in the middle, while Traore and Jonny enjoy plenty of space outwide. Jota should slip in Traore but he overhits the pass and even the former Barcelona can\u2019t catch it. 20 mins: Two good chances for Wolves as Neves lifts a cross into the box. First, Jonny sees his volley blocked and then Jimenez drags the rebound wide from 12 yards when he should have done better in a good position. 18 mins: Wolves jeering the Villa goalkeeper in order to unease him on his Premier League debut but he does not look fazed so far, although he is yet to have a shot to save. 16 mins: Traore leaves Targett for dead on the byline and lifts another dangerous cross into the box but Konsa is there to meet it and remove the danger. Villa might need to rethink how they defend on the flanks as their full-backs are struggling at the moment. 14 mins: Coady smashes another fine long pass straight to Jimenez but he ruins it by controlling the ball with his right wrist, which is spotted by referee Anthony Taylor who has missed nothing so far. 12 mins: Doherty is having a fantastic game, proving a real threat down the right. With Traore being in front of him, it could be an area Wolves can put pressure on and earn plenty of rewards, especially as Trezeguet does not look keen to track back. Saiss is also in the book now, his crime is pulling back McGinn. 10 mins: Now Villa will need to settle themselves once again and not worry too much about their early change in goal. Guilbert makes things slightly worse for his team by picking up an early booking for pulling back Jota. 8 mins: Dean Smith will be hoping it does not have to resort to playing Kyle Walker, that\u2019s for sure. What a fun start. 6 mins: Doherty nearly inadvertently gives Wolves the lead with a chipped cross which deceives the goalkeeper and clips the top of crossbar. The aftermath sees Steer go down injured after his attempts to palm the ball over fail. It looks likes his game is over and Nyland is coming on. To be fair, Nyland has played 27 times for Norway, although he hasn\u2019t played for Villa since December 2018. 4 mins: McGinn and Makamba put in a couple of sturdy challenges to show Wolves they\u2019re in a game. The fans are acknowledging that this is their biggest derby of the season with some vocal support. Wolves have the first shot of the game with Coady whacking a 40 yard pass over the top of the defence, which Doherty controls, cuts inside and fires a shot away but it is deflected wide. 2 mins: Villa have made sure Steer and Konza get an early touch to settle themselves but nothing has happened otherwise. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! The players are in the tunnel with a plethora of mascots. We will have the usual Remembrance Sunday activities pre-match as clubs compete to see who has the biggest poppy. First they forget the match is on and then Sky seem to have forgotten to turn the microphones on. Lots of adverts about Christmas to get you in the mood for this mid-November fixture. I do not think about the festive season until after December 2 and nor should anybody else. Lovely clear skies across England today and it\u2019s no different in Wolverhampton where the conditions are great for a November game. Sky seem to have forgotten about this game, maybe they will just show three hours or so of buildup to Liverpool v City instead. I spoke to someone who previously played under Nuno this week. He was full of praise for the Wolves boss, saying he has the greatest eye for detail, knows how to adapt style depending on the game and ensures the players are always happy. It\u2019s been an interesting week for Adama Traore looked set to declare his international allegiance to Mali earlier in the week but has since been called up to the Spain squad for the first time. Hopefully we won\u2019t see scenes akin to those at Goodison Park last weekend. Here is Sid Lowe on the aftermath of being the player to inflict a terrible injury on another. Just in case you are wondering about Man United v Brighton, our man Jamie Jackson is there and he has the teams. Aston Villa have a tendency of conceding later goals, something manager Dean Smith is aiming to put a stop to. \u201cA lot of those late goals have been against Tottenham, Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool, so top teams in the league,\u201d Smith said in his pre-match press conference. \u201cThe goals we\u2019ve given away in the last two games, in particular, against Manchester City and Liverpool, have been pretty much avoidable, and that\u2019s been the disappointing part. \u201cWhenever a team scores against you, it\u2019s disappointing, so the disappointment grows larger because of the lateness of the goals. With Liverpool, that\u2019s down to the amount of time they had the ball, and they kept putting us under pressure. It was pretty relentless at times. \u201cWe\u2019re working on concentration, working on our ball retention because if we\u2019d have kept the ball more in the second half then we wouldn\u2019t have been so tired at the end. \u201cWe know we didn\u2019t have an awful lot of the ball against Liverpool, and probably that was my biggest disappointment, because when we won the ball back, we then gave it away again too cheaply. It enabled them to wear us down, physically and mentally, but our play without the ball was as good as it\u2019s been this season.\u201d Aston Villa have the most interesting team news with Steer replacing Heaton in goal and Konsa is in the heart of defence, both are making their first Premier League starts. Grealish is also absent. Considering how much has been written about Liverpool v Manchester City, why not get in the mood for this with some Peter Reid swearing at Boris Johnson: Nuno Espirito Santo is looking for his team to improve considering their five draws in their last seven games. \u201cThere are a lot of things (the players need to improve). On Thursday, we managed the game better, the distances of the players, because we had a lot of possession, so the impact is totally different. \u201cThis is the growing process that we want, so we have to improve, we have to work a lot, and it\u2019s about growing during the competition. \u201cEach moment that we compete is a moment that we try new things, new solutions, new lines, new processes. It\u2019s growing with the competition. It\u2019s very good and it\u2019s what the team needs - to compete.\u201d Wolves: Patricio, Dendoncker, Coady, Saiss, Doherty, Neves, Moutinho, Jonny, Traore, Jimenez, Jota. Subs: Ruddy, Bennett, Neto, Cutrone, Perry, Vinagre, Kilman. Aston Villa: Steer, Guilbert, Konsa, Mings, Targett, McGinn, Nakamba, Douglas Luiz, El Ghazi, Wesley, Trezeguet. Subs: Nyland, Taylor, Chester, Lansbury, Hourihane, Kodjia, Elmohamady. Good afternoon! This is the biggest game of the day, as far as I am concerned. It\u2019s 15th against 17th, so both will be fighting to move away from the relegation zone. Wolves will be boosted by a late Europa League win in midweek, while Villa will be looking to take the positives out of their late loss to Liverpool into this fixture. Wolves are unbeaten in six matches but are still sat in an unwanted position due to the amount of draws they have stacked up. The run includes the 2-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad, a performance they will be looking to repeat today. Villa could be boosted by the return of Jack Grealish, although his availability is not a guarantee due to the calf injury which forced him to miss the defeat to Liverpool. In terms of West Midlands derbies, this is possible bottom on the traditional list but seeing as they\u2019re the only two teams from the area in the top flight, it should be pretty feisty. Here\u2019s to a great game.",

The imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence, scrapped in 2012, was a form of indeterminate sentence in which offenders were given a minimum jail tariff but no maximum for a range of crimes. Those given an IPP sentence are placed on licence indefinitely after release, and are only eligible to have their licence removed after 10 years. There are 2,223 people serving IPP sentences who have yet to be released and a further 1,206 serving an IPP sentence who are back in prison having been recalled while on licence. Despite its abolition in 2012, 93% serving an IPP sentence are still in prison having passed their tariff expiry date. A joint report by the Prison Reform Trust and Southampton University has called for legislation to be introduced to \u201cend the injustice it represents for those serving it\u201d and for the government in the meantime to provide support to alleviate the \u201cpainful burden\u201d it places on families of IPP prisoners. Peter Dawson, the director of the trust, said: \u201cThe suffering caused by this disastrous sentence goes on and on.

The figures show for the first time more IPP prisoners were returned to custody after licence recall than were released from custody in the past 12 months. In the year to 30 June, there were 433 releases of IPP prisoners, but 636 IPP prisoners were returned to custody after licence recall. The report, A Helping Hand: Supporting Families in the Resettlement of People Serving IPPs, found that the pain caused to families of people serving IPP sentences had not been addressed by criminal justice agencies. This meant that the contribution families could make to the rehabilitation and resettlement of IPP prisoners was not being realised, the report said. The report\u2019s authors have recommended more consistent communication and the provision of specific support for families. Dr Harry Annison, one of the authors, said: \u201cFamilies of people serving IPPs carry considerable burdens in supporting their relative through their sentence.

The email cited 10 November as the target date for exchanging contracts on the deal but that deadline has now slipped.</p> <p>Sam Woodward, a special manager from accountancy EY who is assisting the Official Receiver, wrote: \u201cAs you are aware, Jingye has been undertaking accelerated due diligence for the last two weeks, and I am pleased to advise that it is progressing well.</p> <p>\u201cAs many of you may know, we have been working towards a target date of exchanging contracts by 10 November 2019 and we are all working hard to keep to that timescale.\u201d</p> <p>A sale could safeguard the immediate future of more than 4,000 staff, most of whom work at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/01/scunthorpe-steelworkers-enjoy-happy-outcome-to-act-of-faith\">Scunthorpe site</a>, one of the last two blast furnace steelworks in the UK.</p> <p>According to one well-placed source, senior officials from Jingye told more than 100 staff at Scunthorpe that they hoped to meet the 10 November deadline, during a recent visit to perform due diligence on the purchase.</p> <p>The Official Receiver, which originally set that deadline, is willing to push the process into next week, if there are signs a deal is imminent. Talks have continued over the weekend, with Jingye increasingly likely to win the race.</p> <p>In the memo to staff, the special manager promised an update on Monday but warned that the signing of contracts would not mean that the sale is fully complete.</p> <p>The Official Receiver has overseen a long and sometimes tortuous effort to find a buyer since the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/22/british-steel-to-enter-insolvency-after-rescue-talks-with-government-fail\">collapsed in May</a> under the ownership of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/23/greybull-capital-rescuer-of-distressed-firms-or-vulture-fund\">investment firm Greybull Capital</a>.

      "bodyText": "A Chinese industrial giant founded by a former Communist party official could be announced as the buyer of British Steel within days, after staff were told in an email that contracts are due to be exchanged. Jingye Group emerged as the frontrunner to buy the steelmaker out of liquidation after talks stalled between government officials and Ataer Holdings, a subsidiary of Turkey\u2019s military pension fund with ties to the country\u2019s autocratic government. Ataer has dropped into a distant third place, with steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta, who wants to add the company to his UK-based group Liberty House, yet to be formally ruled out. But a message sent to British Steel staff and seen by the Guardian indicates that the Official Receiver, a government employee managing the sale, expects to shake hands on a sale to Jingye imminently. The email cited 10 November as the target date for exchanging contracts on the deal but that deadline has now slipped. Sam Woodward, a special manager from accountancy EY who is assisting the Official Receiver, wrote: \u201cAs you are aware, Jingye has been undertaking accelerated due diligence for the last two weeks, and I am pleased to advise that it is progressing well. \u201cAs many of you may know, we have been working towards a target date of exchanging contracts by 10 November 2019 and we are all working hard to keep to that timescale.\u201d A sale could safeguard the immediate future of more than 4,000 staff, most of whom work at the Scunthorpe site, one of the last two blast furnace steelworks in the UK. According to one well-placed source, senior officials from Jingye told more than 100 staff at Scunthorpe that they hoped to meet the 10 November deadline, during a recent visit to perform due diligence on the purchase. The Official Receiver, which originally set that deadline, is willing to push the process into next week, if there are signs a deal is imminent. Talks have continued over the weekend, with Jingye increasingly likely to win the race. In the memo to staff, the special manager promised an update on Monday but warned that the signing of contracts would not mean that the sale is fully complete. The Official Receiver has overseen a long and sometimes tortuous effort to find a buyer since the company collapsed in May under the ownership of investment firm Greybull Capital. The cost to taxpayers of keeping the business afloat since then is thought to have reached \u00a31m a day. Jingye is ready to pay \u00a370m for the stricken business but could also access up to \u00a3300m in loans, indemnities and grants to support its plans to increase production by 10%. A spokesperson for steelworkers\u2019 union Community said: \u201cIf this [the sale] is confirmed, then we welcome this positive step towards securing British Steel under new ownership. \u201cThe fact that there has been ongoing interest from both Ataer and now Jingye, rightly demonstrates that potential buyers believe that British Steel can have a sustainable future. \u201cAny new owner would not just be acquiring a steel business, they would be taking on a dedicated and skilled workforce, who even through the uncertainty of recent months have been breaking production records to give the business a chance.\u201d Jingye was founded 30 years ago by Li Ganpo, a former Communist party official who built the group from scratch in a corner of the Hebei province that is famed for the role it played in the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China. A promotional video on Jingye\u2019s website references its adherence to the \u201cXibaipo spirit\u201d, a reference to the small town from which Mao Zedong orchestrated some of the decisive final battles of the Chinese civil war in 1949. The company website describes the town as a \u201csacred place of revolution\u201d. Jingye, which employs 23,500 people and had annual revenues of about \u00a310bn in 2018, began making steel in 2002 and says in the video that it \u201cwants to go global\u201d. Nic Dakin, the Labour MP for Scunthorpe, said: \u201cThe workforce at British Steel have done an outstanding job continuing to make and sell steel through this difficult few months. \u201cIt looks as if we\u2019re coming to a point where a new owner may well be determined and that would be very good news for the business and the communities that are around it.\u201d Liberty House has not given up hope of snatching a deal from under the nose of Jingye. But its plan to convert Scunthorpe into an electric arc furnace, making recycled steel from scrap metal, would mean more immediate job losses, although some experts say it is a more sustainable strategy in the long-term.",

      "body": "<p>It was the moment that all romance fans look forward to at the end of a film, hearts bubbling with anticipation: the kiss. I was watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/29/the-edge-of-seventeen-review-hailee-steinfeld-coming-out-ball\" title=\"\">The Edge of Seventeen</a>, a smart coming-of-age movie, in which Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) had rushed to see her awkwardly endearing classmate (Hayden Szeto). After a bungled date and a crush on another man, she had decided Erwin was the one she wanted.</p> <p>And then, instead of any show of passion, there came \u2026 an affectionate pat on the back as he introduced her to his friends. Moments before, I had been delighted that a Canadian actor of Chinese descent had been cast as the love interest of a white American woman. As the credits rolled, I felt cheated.</p> <p>That was three years ago, however, and since then the landscape has completely shifted for east Asian actors in Hollywood. Now they don\u2019t just get the girl, they\u2019re allowed to kiss them, too. We have Henry Golding set to romance Emilia Clarke in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/06/last-christmas-review-emma-thompson-emilia-clarke\" title=\"\">Last Christmas</a> and the Asian American actor Randall Park out-charming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\" title=\"\">Keanu Reeves</a> in Always Be My Maybe.

Not only are east Asian actors finally leading films rather than playing supporting roles, their characters are relatable and desirable. \u201cIf you look at the east, you\u2019ve got lots of very famous, good-looking [Asian] leading men in romantic roles and playing heroes,\u201d says the actor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dtks888\" title=\"\">David Tse</a>, who has starred in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Spy Game. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unusual about it. But in the west, there is this bamboo ceiling. There\u2019s been this endemically racist trope that east Asian actors feel incredibly angry and resentful about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48a7e635ed33dc0d24e6022511bc3c81dc104bb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48a7e635ed33dc0d24e6022511bc3c81dc104bb6/0_16_3504_2103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hayden Szeto with Hailee Steinfeld in The Edge of Seventeen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hayden Szeto with Hailee Steinfeld in The Edge of Seventeen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sony Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0370564/\" title=\"\">Sessue Hayakawa</a>, a Japanese silent film star of the early 20th century, east Asian men have effectively been neutered in Hollywood movies. Frequently depicted as emasculated and asexual, they are more interested in martial arts or science than sex. Sure, they can be nice and handsome. But sexy? Sorry, no. That\u2019s why The Edge of Seventeen\u2019s Erwin is more hapless puppy dog than smouldering suitor. One of the worst instances of this was 2000\u2019s Romeo Must Die, which paired Aaliyah \u2013 at the time, one of the most famous singers in R&amp;B \u2013 with the Hong Kong action legend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/14/culture.features\" title=\"\">Jet Li</a>. The two superstars were trapped in a lifeless onscreen romance that was completely devoid of passion. A scene showing them kissing was shot, but left on the cutting room floor. It was replaced with one of them hugging instead.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielfyork\" title=\"\">Daniel York Loh</a>, who has appeared in The Beach and Rogue Trader, calls this stereotype \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d. \u201cEast Asian males tend to be dorky, unappealing, sometimes brutish and monosyllabic in films,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re an inarticulate oppressor of the east Asian female, who is generally vulnerable, fragile and sexually available. They can\u2019t be seen to be appealing romantically. We can\u2019t show east Asian men kissing women, because they don\u2019t have sex. The population of China shows that not to be true.\u201d</p> <p>For him, this cliche has its roots in the racist hysteria of the \u201cyellow peril\u201d, which for decades presented east Asian immigration as a danger to the western world. Scaremongering that the men would rape white women was rampant. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/20/yellow-peril-fu-manchu-rise-chinaphobia-review-factors-fear-china\" title=\"\">Cinema accentuated and mocked</a> the \u201cotherness\u201d of east Asian men, from Fu Manchu, the fiendish Chinese criminal mastermind, created in 1913, to Long Duk Dong, the foreign exchange student in 1984\u2019s Sixteen Candles played by Gedde Watanabe.

      "bodyText": "It was the moment that all romance fans look forward to at the end of a film, hearts bubbling with anticipation: the kiss. I was watching The Edge of Seventeen, a smart coming-of-age movie, in which Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) had rushed to see her awkwardly endearing classmate (Hayden Szeto). After a bungled date and a crush on another man, she had decided Erwin was the one she wanted. And then, instead of any show of passion, there came \u2026 an affectionate pat on the back as he introduced her to his friends. Moments before, I had been delighted that a Canadian actor of Chinese descent had been cast as the love interest of a white American woman. As the credits rolled, I felt cheated. That was three years ago, however, and since then the landscape has completely shifted for east Asian actors in Hollywood. Now they don\u2019t just get the girl, they\u2019re allowed to kiss them, too. We have Henry Golding set to romance Emilia Clarke in Last Christmas and the Asian American actor Randall Park out-charming Keanu Reeves in Always Be My Maybe. In 2021, Simu Liu, a Canadian actor who was born in China, will roundhouse kick his way into the Marvel Cinematic Universe as its first Asian superhero in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Suddenly, an \u201cinvisible minority\u201d is becoming part of cinema\u2019s mainstream. Not only are east Asian actors finally leading films rather than playing supporting roles, their characters are relatable and desirable. \u201cIf you look at the east, you\u2019ve got lots of very famous, good-looking [Asian] leading men in romantic roles and playing heroes,\u201d says the actor David Tse, who has starred in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Spy Game. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unusual about it. But in the west, there is this bamboo ceiling. There\u2019s been this endemically racist trope that east Asian actors feel incredibly angry and resentful about.\u201d Apart from Sessue Hayakawa, a Japanese silent film star of the early 20th century, east Asian men have effectively been neutered in Hollywood movies. Frequently depicted as emasculated and asexual, they are more interested in martial arts or science than sex. Sure, they can be nice and handsome. But sexy? Sorry, no. That\u2019s why The Edge of Seventeen\u2019s Erwin is more hapless puppy dog than smouldering suitor. One of the worst instances of this was 2000\u2019s Romeo Must Die, which paired Aaliyah \u2013 at the time, one of the most famous singers in R&amp;B \u2013 with the Hong Kong action legend Jet Li. The two superstars were trapped in a lifeless onscreen romance that was completely devoid of passion. A scene showing them kissing was shot, but left on the cutting room floor. It was replaced with one of them hugging instead. Daniel York Loh, who has appeared in The Beach and Rogue Trader, calls this stereotype \u201cabsolutely shocking\u201d. \u201cEast Asian males tend to be dorky, unappealing, sometimes brutish and monosyllabic in films,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re an inarticulate oppressor of the east Asian female, who is generally vulnerable, fragile and sexually available. They can\u2019t be seen to be appealing romantically. We can\u2019t show east Asian men kissing women, because they don\u2019t have sex. The population of China shows that not to be true.\u201d For him, this cliche has its roots in the racist hysteria of the \u201cyellow peril\u201d, which for decades presented east Asian immigration as a danger to the western world. Scaremongering that the men would rape white women was rampant. Cinema accentuated and mocked the \u201cotherness\u201d of east Asian men, from Fu Manchu, the fiendish Chinese criminal mastermind, created in 1913, to Long Duk Dong, the foreign exchange student in 1984\u2019s Sixteen Candles played by Gedde Watanabe. Each of his scenes was signalled by the loud crash of a gong. York Loh, who is of mixed British Chinese heritage, says he is one of many actors who have been asked to exaggerate their foreignness in auditions. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had this experience where the director has said: \u2018Can you make your accent stronger?\u2019 You make it strong to the point where you stop resembling a proper human being.\u201d Discrimination against east Asian men is as pervasive and damaging off screen. In 2014, a survey for the dating service OkCupid found that Asian men were ranked as 12%-14% less attractive than average by white, black and Latina women. Research into speed dating by Columbia University in New York found that they had the hardest time getting a second date, while another study it carried out estimated that Asian men would have to earn an additional $247,000 (\u00a3190,000) for white women to consider dating them over a white man. Even in China, men with western looks are considered more attractive, according to Yuan Ren, a former culture and events editor for Time Out Beijing. \u201cThere is that aspiration to date more western-looking guys,\u201d she says. \u201cSomeone who is tall and well-built will stand out. There is this perception that non-Asian men are more masculine.\u201d Golding, born to a Malaysian mother and an English father, is one of the few east Asian actors who has been able to move beyond roles that are defined by race. Rakishly handsome, affable and charming, he is a bona fide sex symbol. True, Crazy Rich Asians \u2013 the first blockbuster led by an all-Asian cast since 1993\u2019s The Joy Luck Club \u2013 was his breakthrough film. But he has also been involved in a tempestuous relationship with Blake Lively in the 2018 thriller A Simple Favour and is Clarke\u2019s mysterious love interest in Last Christmas, the festive romcom directed by Paul Feig. He is also part of the ensemble cast of Guy Ritchie\u2019s upcoming gangster thriller The Gentlemen. \u201cThis is an incredible turning point,\u201d says Tse, who was so disheartened by the lack of roles for British east Asian actors that he set up Yellow Earth Theatre and Chinese Arts Now to create more opportunities. \u201cHenry will challenge these centuries of colonial thinking about east Asian masculinity.\u201d Then there\u2019s Liu and his role in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. The decision to make an all-Asian superhero movie is truly groundbreaking as Hollywood wakes up to the fact that we live in a multicultural world full of ethnic minorities who will pay good money to see themselves represented on screen. Black Panther\u2019s success at the box office is proof of that. Last year\u2019s Searching, in which John Cho played a dad frantically trying to track down his missing daughter, was the first mainstream Hollywood thriller with an Asian American actor in the lead role. Always Be My Maybe, which features Fresh Off the Boat star Park in a touching romance with Ali Wong, has been a huge hit on Netflix. And The Farewell, a US comedy drama starring Awkwafina that is about a Chinese family dealing with the news of their grandmother\u2019s terminal illness, has been tipped to pick up Oscar nominations. Finally, it seems that east Asians are being depicted as authentic human beings rather than foreign caricatures. Liu and Golding are \u201cshining lights\u201d, says Tse. \u201cBut there are many other British east Asian actors out there that should be given a chance.\u201d York Loh is optimistic: \u201cIt\u2019s a better time to be a young east Asian male now than it ever has been. The more audiences get to see Asian actors in leading roles, the more accustomed they\u2019ll be to it, and the more they\u2019ll embrace it.\u201d",

Ahead of the general election in December, the Conservatives published a dossier over the weekend assessing the cost of Labour\u2019s plans. Here is an analysis of the costing document. How do the Conservatives arrive at the \u00a31.2tn figure? The Conservatives take Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto as the starting point for their analysis, saying the document implied extra spending of about \u00a3600bn over five years. They report that Labour has announced \u00a3590bn of new pledges since then.

About \u00a3201bn is for capital spending, the money spent on infrastructure projects such as road and rail. A significant chunk of the costing package comes from Labour\u2019s nationalisation proposals, based on the \u00a3196bn price tag estimated by the Confederation of British Industry. The lobby group has said, though, that it inflated its analysis by adding in the purchase of rail rolling stock, a plan it admitted was not Labour policy. Labour\u2019s plans for a 32-hour working week have a \u00a385bn price tag, while an idea for piloting a universal basic income would cost \u00a34.5bn, according to the Tories. Free bus travel for under 25s would cost \u00a37bn, while plans to help fund home insulation and refurbishment would cost \u00a330bn. Is \u00a31.2tn a realistic number? The eye-catching \u00a31.2tn figure appears to be due to the Tories adding together the additional cost of Labour\u2019s plans over a five-year period, a tactic that makes the sum much more dramatic than that for a single year. For context, the state currently spends about \u00a3840bn a year, which is about \u00a330bn more than the government receives in income from taxes. The Conservatives argue that Labour would raise spending by 30% from current levels, implying an additional annual spend of roughly \u00a3250bn a year. Though large, the figure is much less attention grabbing than \u00a31.2tn. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated in March that spending was already due to rise to more than \u00a3950bn a year by the early 2020s, before taking account of policy proposals made since Boris Johnson became prime minister. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, had previously said the 2017 manifesto plans would mean a \u00a348.6bn rise in annual spending, which amounts to about \u00a3240bn over five years, compared with the Tories\u2019 claim of a \u00a3600bn outlay. McDonnell also said those plans were fully costed, paid for entirely by tax increases. The \u00a385bn cost of Labour\u2019s 32-hour week policy comes from analysis by the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies thinktank. McDonnell has said the proposal to cut workers\u2019 hours would happen \u201cwithin a decade\u201d, indicating that the costs would potentially come over a longer period than the Tory analysis suggests. Part of the policy idea is to boost efficiency. But the analysis, which takes the upper-end of the CPS estimate, did not factor in an increase in productivity that could offset some of the cost.

      "bodyText": "Brian Mawhinney, Lord Mawhinney, was the first Ulsterman to join the cabinet in 59 years when he became transport secretary in 1994. Like many transport ministers, Mawhinney, who has died aged 79, lasted barely a year in the post. He inherited rail privatisation and moved Railtrack into the private sector more quickly than planned. He worked to build bridges with the environmental lobby and tried to stimulate a debate on the balance in transport policy between road and rail. He was intellectually demanding of \u2013 and sometimes sharp with \u2013 officials; his departure was met with some relief in the department. In July 1995, following his re-election as party leader by Conservative MPs, the beleaguered John Major appointed Mawhinney as party chairman. With less than two years of the parliament to run, his tasks were to restore morale, raise money and prepare the ground for a general election campaign. He was a tough operator \u2013 a quality Major thought was required given the dire political position \u2013 and was a dogged rather than a persuasive media spokesman for the party. And with the Conservatives divided and Labour under Tony Blair riding high, he had a poor hand. But he was close and loyal to Major; the two men and their wives often dined together. The 1997 general election campaign was a Tory disaster; the party was bitterly divided over Europe and the result was its worst in modern times. At the end of each campaign day he often brought bad news to Major, whose aides thought, unfairly, that Mawhinney was too eager to share problems with the leader, rather than lifting his spirits. Mawhinney saw his job as chairman as delivering what Major wanted \u2013 rather than be a strong, independent-minded operator doing things his way \u2013 and that is why he informed Major of the whole picture. When Major left No 10 for the last time, he had Mawhinney at his side. There remained little for him in politics after Blair brought Labour to power.

It also tots up spending increases for successive years, when usual practice in assessing the impact of policy on the public finances is to give an annual cost. The Conservatives may hope that like the \u00a3350m a week for the NHS that was widely questioned but still resonated with voters during the 2016 referendum campaign, the \u00a31.2tn figure will cut through to voters regardless. Both parties have promised significant increases in public investment, funded by government borrowing. That marks a dramatic change in approach for the Conservatives since the departure of Javid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, who was chancellor until July but has now stepped down from parliament. Theresa May\u2019s party dismissed Labour\u2019s plans for increased borrowing two years ago and said the party was relying on a \u201cmagic money tree\u201d. Javid, however, said last week he would be prepared to contemplate borrowing up to 3% of GDP to invest in infrastructure and other projects. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has said the Conservatives\u2019 investment plans would amount to an extra \u00a320bn a year, and Labour\u2019s to \u00a355bn a year. Neither of the main parties has yet set out its tax plans. Javid declined to say whether the Conservatives would implement promises made by Boris Johnson during his campaign to become leader, which included an increase in the threshold for higher-rate tax to \u00a380,000 a year. At one point, Marr challenged the chancellor, saying: \u201cYou seem uncannily more familiar with Labour\u2019s manifesto than your own manifesto.\u201d The Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng also sought to defend the Conservatives\u2019 calculations on Sunday, but refused to give an equivalent for his own party\u2019s spending plans. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bandy around figures,\u201d he told Sky News. Javid is reportedly keen to hold a head-to-head debate with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, about their parties\u2019 spending plans, which Labour sources said they were happy to see go ahead. After the Conservatives\u2019 disastrous campaign in 2017, Hammond complained that his party had not focused enough on the economy as an issue, contrasting a spendthrift Labour party with Tory fiscal rectitude. This time the Conservatives are determined to press Corbyn hard on economic competence, but with Johnson keen to increase spending on hospitals, schools and frontline police, Javid has adopted a considerably more relaxed approach to balancing the books than his predecessor. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 central spending pledge is a radical increase in childcare, which they said would be free for all working parents from when their child turns nine months old, at a cost of almost \u00a315bn a year.

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\">Turkey</a>&nbsp;and its allies.

Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died.

Understandably, these plans dominated the headlines \u2013 parents, and especially women, currently face extortionate bills just to take care of their children.

But a year and a half after the lid was blown on the Windrush scandal, the \u201chostile environment\u201d policy and the deep failings of the Home Office, no party and no candidate should be allowed to get away without answering the question: how are we going to fix this? How are we going to ensure that justice is afforded to everybody, not just those who catch the spotlight? \u2022 Satbir Singh is chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants",

      "bodyText": "John Bolton, the former national security adviser who is a key figure in the Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry, has a book deal. The hawkish Bush-era veteran, Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, left the White House in September over disagreements with the president. According to the Associated Press, which cited three publishing officials with knowledge of negotiations, he reached his book deal over the past few weeks with Simon &amp; Schuster. Two of the officials said the deal was worth about $2m. Bolton was represented by the Javelin literary agency, whose clients include the former FBI director James Comey and the anonymous Trump administration official whose book, A Warning, comes out on 19 November. Bolton\u2019s name has come up often recently during the House impeachment inquiry, which has focused on Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, the former vice-president. In a transcript of a closed-door interview released on Friday, a former national security official described how Bolton \u201cimmediately stiffened\u201d as EU ambassador Gordon Sondland \u201cblurted out\u201d that he had worked out a trade \u2013 a Ukrainian investigation for an Oval Office welcome for Ukraine\u2019s new president \u2013 with Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Fiona Hill said Bolton later told her \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up\u201d and asked her to relay that message to a White House lawyer. A letter from Bolton\u2019s attorney to the top lawyer for the House on Friday said Bolton was \u201cpart of many relevant meetings and conversations\u201d pertaining to the House impeachment inquiry that are not yet public. The attorney, Charles Cooper, suggested Bolton would appear before Congress only if a judge orders him to do so. On Saturday, Bloomberg News reported that Bolton was involved in freeing up part of nearly $400m in military aid to Ukraine allegedly frozen as part of the quid pro quo with Kyiv. According to the report, which cited five anonymous sources, \u201cPresident Donald Trump says he lifted his freeze on aid to Ukraine on 11 September, but the state department had quietly authorized releasing $141m \u2026 several days earlier.\u201d The reported added: \u201cShortly before 9 September, Bolton had relayed a message to the state department that the funding could go ahead. It\u2019s not clear whether Bolton, who resigned from the job a week later, did so with Trump\u2019s approval. \u201cBolton\u2019s handling of the funding struck officials in the White House as violating protocol and caught Mulvaney by surprise.\u201d A spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, formerly headed by Mulvaney, told Bloomberg Bolton could not have acted that way. Bloomberg posited that the aid issue could explain the letter from Bolton\u2019s lawyer. The publishing officials who spoke to the Associated Press about Bolton\u2019s book deal did not know the title or release date. Simon &amp; Schuster and Javelin did not comment. Bolton\u2019s 2007 book, Surrender is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad, was published by the conservative Simon &amp; Schuster imprint Threshold Editions. Appointed in April 2018, Bolton was Trump\u2019s third national security adviser and is known for advocating military action abroad, a viewpoint Trump has resisted. For example, in a speech in late September to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, given after he left the administration, Bolton offered a far more aggressive approach to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program than the one advocated by Trump, who has spoken warmly about the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cEvery day that goes by makes North Korea a more dangerous country,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cYou don\u2019t like their behavior today, what do you think it will be when they have nuclear weapons that can be delivered to American cities?\u201d",

Cars in Rotherham and Doncaster were almost completely submerged on Sunday morning, roads were closed and many trains cancelled in parts of the east Midlands because of flooded tracks. Water levels were still rising in some areas, such as along the Trent in Nottinghamshire, despite a marked improvement in weather conditions across the country after a month\u2019s worth of rain fell in only a few hours on Friday. According to the Met Office, Sheffield had 84mm (3.3 inches) of rain in just over 36 hours, almost the equivalent of the monthly average for Yorkshire. Derbyshire and South Yorkshire have been worst affected by the floods, which already claimed the life of a woman, who was swept away in Darley Dale early on Friday. Boris Johnson was criticised for declaring the floods \u201cnot like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency\u201d in comments made during a visit to Matlock in Derbyshire. The Met Office has forecast a largely dry and sunny Sunday across the UK, except for some rain on the east coasts of England and Scotland, but more rain is expected overnight and blustery showers will reach the west by Monday morning. Sophie Yeomans, a Met Office meteorologist, said a weather system moving across Europe would cause a fair amount of rainfall across England and Wales throughout the week. \u201cIt is going to be an unsettled week in terms of rain,\u201d she said.

Was it personal enthusiasm?</strong><br><strong>Gillian Wearing</strong>: No, I didn\u2019t know Eliot\u2019s work very well at all before doing this. Janet Lee [BBC executive producer] and Martina Hall [director] approached me in February 2018, seeing if I\u2019d like to do a biographical film on an author, and I jumped at the chance. The idea was really outside the zone of my thinking processes. I was asked to do Eliot specifically because I\u2019m from the Midlands, I think, but I found a connection with her quite quickly in her books, particularly in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot\" title=\"\">Middlemarch</a></em>. I loved her interest in giving a voice to so many different people. I think about that a lot in my work, especially in letting people speak without judgment.</p> <p><strong>What struck you most about Eliot while making the film?</strong><br>The extraordinary trajectory of her life. She began life as this judgmental, pious young girl who found fictional books frivolous, then met people in Coventry who had very radical ideas, which led her to leave religion behind completely. That\u2019s quite a change already.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to find people who felt protective of her because they're from where she\u2019s from</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Then there was her relationship with George Henry Lewes, a married man who was her partner for 24 years. That still feels quite radical today</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>It did \u2013 and she faced so much criticism for it. She was very sensitive about it. She had suffered from depression, headaches and kidney stones, which were very hard to treat then, so was often in great physical pain. But she also wrote stories full of empathy and reality and anger and all the emotions you can think of. She could properly speak of life from every side.</p> <p><strong>Did it help that she came from the Midlands</strong><strong> \u2013 from outside a big city?</strong><br>Yes, I\u2019m sure it did. It\u2019s also a place that was changing very much at the time, and you feel those changes in small towns.</p> <p><strong>Early on, the film takes us to places from Eliot\u2019s early life, such as </strong><strong>Griff House</strong><strong>, which is now Nuneaton\u2019s </strong><strong>Premier Inn</strong><strong>. The views of rolling fields Eliot once saw are now car parks. Were those journeys important to you?</strong><br>Yes, they changed the focus of the film. I\u2019d read Rebecca Mead\u2019s book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/16/road-to-middlemarch-review-rebecca-mead\" title=\"\">The Road To Middlemarch</a></em> [Mead is a consultant for the film, and features in it]. She writes about how the book changed her perspectives on life as she got older, and how she visited places from Eliot\u2019s life. I was interested to revisit them too, to find traces of George Eliot through the present day. I also wanted to find other connections from the present that could bring you back into Eliot\u2019s life, whether that be meeting people who had similar experiences to her, or people who were fans of her work, or people who feel very protective of her because they are from where she\u2019s from.</p> <p><strong>Which encounter meant the most to you?</strong><br>Meeting Ahmed, the teacher from Syria who works in the Bangladesh Centre [which is housed in the building in Coventry where Eliot lived in the 1840s]. We\u2019d gone to film someone else there, but then Ahmed told us he\u2019d read George Eliot in Syria, so we filmed him too. He recalled Eliot writing about how everyone should have an education so that they could make their own decisions \u2013 that had really stayed with him. It was such a lovely moment, as it was to know that he\u2019s working in her old home, inspired by what she taught him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faa9a9d599196b56891c335a32a6a36d988ec97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/faa9a9d599196b56891c335a32a6a36d988ec97d/0_204_2559_1033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ahmed, a Syrian refugee, discusses Eliot at her former Coventry home, now the city\u2019s Bangladesh Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"404\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmed, a Syrian refugee, discusses Eliot at her former Coventry home, now the city\u2019s Bangladesh Centre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Studios/The Documentary Unit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How did it feel making the film as a Midlander?</strong><br>I did feel the connections. My family are all still in Birmingham \u2013 I\u2019m the only person who came to London. Coventry I used to know too, but it\u2019s a place I hadn\u2019t really been to since my teens. Then it was a very concrete place, but unfortunately they\u2019re demolishing a lot of those beautiful brutalist buildings. I wanted to evoke something about that memory for me, though, that might not be read by anyone else, to help me connect with it. And Adrian Utley [from the band Portishead] working on the music to make it sound like it came from the 60s and 70s helped with that.</p> <p><strong>As someone who has worked with film in galleries and cinemas, did you find anything daunting about working for TV?</strong><br>Not exactly. I knew I was asked to do the film because I was an artist, because I\u2019d give a different perspective. Also, <em>Arena</em> has a great history of experimental documentaries. The first I saw as a teenager had a big effect on me: it was on the song My Way [<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074lx2\" title=\"\">this renowned film</a> was made by the director Nigel Finch in 1979]. It just featured lots of people singing the song, which was very simple, but I remember thinking, wow, this is quite radical. What I did find daunting, though, was trying to tell the story of an author\u2019s whole life through all of her writing. It\u2019s different to just making a film about a book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"55ef49ba1fdd6078d8fbccda5caba3c17fba9800\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55ef49ba1fdd6078d8fbccda5caba3c17fba9800/0_208_2553_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mannequin of Eliot in Nuneaton museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"401\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from <em>Everything is Connected</em> showing a mannequin of Eliot in Nuneaton museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Studios/The Documentary Unit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The films seem to be showing, through Eliot\u2019s writing, all the things that people have in common despite coming from different historical periods or cultural backgrounds.

      "body": "<p>At a time when hateful, divisive and xenophobic politics are being pursued in parts of Europe in the name of defending \u201cChristian culture\u201d, this is a timely and uplifting book. Before the Rev Fergus Butler-Gallie embarks on a whistlestop tour of saints and martyrs who fought the good fight against Hitler and fascism, he recalls the words of St Paul: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male or female: all are one in Christ.\u201d Take note, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski and Matteo Salvini.</p> <p>What follows is an hugely enjoyable if slightly eccentric account of clerical heroism in the face of evil. One would be tempted to call it a romp, were it not for the depth of moral seriousness that motivated the priests and nuns whose stories are recounted. Butler-Gallie starts off with Canon F\u00e9lix Kir in what is billed as a tale of \u201cwhite wine and espionage\u201d.</p> <p>Kir, a priest and politician in the Burgundian town of Dijon, helped more than 5,000 PoWs to escape during the course of the war through a slave labour scam. He miraculously survived an assassination attempt, went on the run and reappeared atop an American tank as it rolled into his liberated home town. Apparently, this bit of showmanship infuriated General de Gaulle, who thought it stole some of his limelight.</p> <p>As with the other heroes of his book, Butler-Gallie is keen to offset Kir\u2019s moral courage by fondly chronicling his flaws, notably a love of alcohol. \u201cWell into his late 80s,\u201d he writes, \u201cKir would take several hours over lunch, almost always washed down by a blanc-cassis, a whole bottle of red and a slurp of sparkling white to finish, before \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 returning to his desk for an afternoon\u2019s work.\u201d After the war, producers of the national hero\u2019s favourite drink successfully sought permission to name it after him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He achieves an inspiring effect through the sheer cumulative impact of so many brave decisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Butler-Gallie\u2019s humorous, rollicking approach works well with a character such as Canon Kir, but occasionally the jauntiness is a bit wearing. In a chapter on the great theologian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/02/religion.uk\" title=\"\">Dietrich Bonhoeffer</a>, hanged in Flossenb\u00fcrg for his part in the plot to kill Hitler, he includes a slightly off-colour joke about the sexual voracity of the Lutheran minister\u2019s father. The chain-smoking Sister S\u00e1ra Salkah\u00e1zi, who died at the hands of Hungarian fascists after hiding Jews and others at risk of deportation to the camps, is described as \u201cthe feisty nicotine nun\u201d. Her life, the author tells us unhelpfully, proves that \u201cunlikely nuns are not just figures of the fervid and lusty male imagination\u201d.</p> <p>This book is Butler-Gallie\u2019s follow-up to the well-received <em>A Field Guide to the English Clergy</em>. Those who read that will recognise the jaunty joviality of this volume dedicated to \u201cloose canons\u201d. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>But occasional lapses in tone and a certain <em>Boy\u2019s Own</em> quality to some of the prose (one priest\u2019s resistance tale is described as \u201ca story of daring escapes from stormtroopers, of late-night rendezvous and of cross-dressing clergy\u201d) are forgivable in a book bursting with such generosity of spirit.

      "bodyText": "At a time when hateful, divisive and xenophobic politics are being pursued in parts of Europe in the name of defending \u201cChristian culture\u201d, this is a timely and uplifting book. Before the Rev Fergus Butler-Gallie embarks on a whistlestop tour of saints and martyrs who fought the good fight against Hitler and fascism, he recalls the words of St Paul: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male or female: all are one in Christ.\u201d Take note, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski and Matteo Salvini. What follows is an hugely enjoyable if slightly eccentric account of clerical heroism in the face of evil. One would be tempted to call it a romp, were it not for the depth of moral seriousness that motivated the priests and nuns whose stories are recounted. Butler-Gallie starts off with Canon F\u00e9lix Kir in what is billed as a tale of \u201cwhite wine and espionage\u201d. Kir, a priest and politician in the Burgundian town of Dijon, helped more than 5,000 PoWs to escape during the course of the war through a slave labour scam. He miraculously survived an assassination attempt, went on the run and reappeared atop an American tank as it rolled into his liberated home town. Apparently, this bit of showmanship infuriated General de Gaulle, who thought it stole some of his limelight. As with the other heroes of his book, Butler-Gallie is keen to offset Kir\u2019s moral courage by fondly chronicling his flaws, notably a love of alcohol. \u201cWell into his late 80s,\u201d he writes, \u201cKir would take several hours over lunch, almost always washed down by a blanc-cassis, a whole bottle of red and a slurp of sparkling white to finish, before \u2013 astonishingly \u2013 returning to his desk for an afternoon\u2019s work.\u201d After the war, producers of the national hero\u2019s favourite drink successfully sought permission to name it after him. Butler-Gallie\u2019s humorous, rollicking approach works well with a character such as Canon Kir, but occasionally the jauntiness is a bit wearing. In a chapter on the great theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, hanged in Flossenb\u00fcrg for his part in the plot to kill Hitler, he includes a slightly off-colour joke about the sexual voracity of the Lutheran minister\u2019s father. The chain-smoking Sister S\u00e1ra Salkah\u00e1zi, who died at the hands of Hungarian fascists after hiding Jews and others at risk of deportation to the camps, is described as \u201cthe feisty nicotine nun\u201d. Her life, the author tells us unhelpfully, proves that \u201cunlikely nuns are not just figures of the fervid and lusty male imagination\u201d. This book is Butler-Gallie\u2019s follow-up to the well-received A Field Guide to the English Clergy. Those who read that will recognise the jaunty joviality of this volume dedicated to \u201cloose canons\u201d. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work. But occasional lapses in tone and a certain Boy\u2019s Own quality to some of the prose (one priest\u2019s resistance tale is described as \u201ca story of daring escapes from stormtroopers, of late-night rendezvous and of cross-dressing clergy\u201d) are forgivable in a book bursting with such generosity of spirit. Butler-Gallie necessarily races through the biographies in what is a slim paperback. But he achieves an inspiring effect through the sheer cumulative impact of so many brave decisions taken when it would have been easier to do otherwise. From the searing indictments of Nazism delivered from the pulpit by Clemens von Galen, the bishop of Munster, in wartime Germany, to the safe networks established by St Maximilian Kolbe, which successfully hid nearly 2,000 Polish Jews, individual acts of courage confounded Hitler\u2019s expectation that he would one day \u201chave the Church on the ropes\u201d.

      "body": "<p>My family refer to cotton wool as CW when I\u2019m around. It\u2019s their little way of acknowledging my odd phobia and that I don\u2019t even like hearing the words cotton wool, let alone coming into contact with the stuff. My heart races, saliva rushes into my mouth, the hairs on my arms and neck stand up, I get goose bumps, my toes curl, my hands become fists. I feel sick at the thought of the very particular way in which it would feel and squeak between my fingers. I\u2019ve learned not to scream in horror, but inside I\u2019m churning.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had this phobia \u2013 bambakomallophobia, to give it its suitably ludicrous official name \u2013 for as long as I can remember. When I was a young boy I wouldn\u2019t have certain cuddly toys because of their similarity to cotton wool (I had a rubber rabbit instead of fluffy ones). At school, my Father Christmas card had a shredded paper beard, and in my paintings, little fluffy clouds made of cotton wool gave way to clear blue skies. I can remember accidentally cutting myself with a penknife when I was about 10 and being more scared that someone would use cotton wool to wipe the cut clean than I was of bleeding heavily. Visits to the dentist or doctor were just as bad, fearing the swabs in my mouth or cotton wool being used after an injection more than needles or drills. I remember one Christmas when my grandmother produced a lovingly made cardboard house wrapped in red cr\u00eape paper in which she had placed our presents \u2013 but it had a cotton-wool roof. Arghh!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve learned not to scream in horror, but inside my mind is I\u2019m churning</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So began a lifelong pattern of avoidance. When I have an injection now I\u2019ll request cotton gauze and, luckily, the dentist no longer uses cotton-wool swabs. It was relatively easy to avoid cotton wool until my children started arriving. There\u2019s really no avoiding it when you have a baby\u2019s bottom to clean and wipes result in a rash. That was the first time in decades that I\u2019d been able to touch the stuff, and only after my girlfriend had first made the cotton wool wet for me and squished it flat.</p> <p>I have worried that I could pass on this aversion to my children \u2013 we have three, aged 17, 11 and 5 \u2013 but they\u2019re fine with it. Along with pretty much everyone else I\u2019ve met, they find it bizarre and ridiculous and tease me about it \u2013 including my youngest, who rolls her eyes exaggeratedly when I ask her to remove any cotton-wool pads I\u2019ve seen on the floor. I\u2019ve started to think that, at 48, it\u2019s really something I should confront and get treatment for. How can I expect my children to overcome any worries or fears they may have when I\u2019m not willing to overcome mine?</p> <p>I recently chatted to my mother and she told me that when I was two, and my brother was born, I carefully placed all of my soft cuddly toys at the foot of his travel cot the day he arrived home from hospital. I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d given away my toys \u2013 and certainly not in this way. My parents thought this was a sweet gesture, but I think in hindsight it was probably more out of a dislike of their cotton wool-like textures than any altruism. There I was, in some sense throwing my toys out of my pram just at the moment my brother arrived.</p> <p>According to Cary Cooper, a clinical adviser for the mental health charity <a href=\"https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Anxiety UK</a> and a professor of organisational psychology and health, my phobia may have had its origins in sibling rivalry. \u201cYour brother\u2019s birth is quite significant,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cIt takes the limelight off you; you\u2019re giving up something soft and the metaphor for that could be cotton wool. When it\u2019s a rare phobia like this one, it\u2019s usually associated with a traumatic event. So your brother\u2019s born, attention is off you, you feel like you have to give your toys up.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Where do phobias come from? In many cases they come from the parents or significant other when you\u2019re a kid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps in later avoiding the soft toys, I was avoiding unpleasant feelings of envy. However, knowing the origins of a phobia doesn\u2019t necessarily make it any easier to address. The fact remains that, 46 years later, the stuff still gives me \u2013 in David Foster Wallace\u2019s memorable phrase \u2013 the howling fantods.</p> <p>I ask Cooper if my phobia is clinically recognised. \u201cYes,\u201d he explains. \u201cA phobia is an irrational fear of an object or a particular situation that elicits an anxiety response, so it could be anything.\u201d It\u2019s not just the understandable, relatable ones, such as spiders or heights; it can be a fear of sponge cake, fresh fruit, knees, even yellow things. In a way, because these are such everyday, benign and faintly amusing objects, this makes them somehow more stressful and certainly more embarrassing.</p> <p>Where do phobias come from? \u201cIn many cases they come from the parents or significant other when you\u2019re a kid \u2013 you pick up their phobia,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cOr it\u2019s an anxiety associated with something.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/get-help/anxiety-information/frequently-asked-questions/\" title=\"\">According to one UK study</a>, 13% of the adult population will develop a phobia<strong> </strong>at some point. Simple phobias most often develop during childhood, but it\u2019s not known for certain why some people are more susceptible to phobias.</p> <p><em><strong>Microbiologist Dr Lisa Cross,</strong></em> 42, has a phobia of buttons that started when she was about seven, but she has no idea why. \u201cButtons have always made me feel revulsion. They are disgusting. They make me feel sick,\u201d she says. There is a strict hierarchy to her phobia, too. \u201cA toggle on a duffel coat is fine, the metal ones on jeans are fine, but anything else on a shirt or similar is awful. Worse than that would be one on the floor, not attached to the garment \u2013 even worse if it has a bit of cotton in it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbbe4ab9b3b4a6b858c67410ff72c58748a250a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbbe4ab9b3b4a6b858c67410ff72c58748a250a5/0_503_7216_4330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I know it\u2019s ridiculous, but buttons make me sick.

They\u2019re disgusting\u2019: Lisa Cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liz McBurney/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For this reason, Cross doesn\u2019t wear blouses and all her coats have zips. She will cross to the other side of the street if there\u2019s a button on the pavement. She has managed to hide any extreme reaction from her eight-year-old son, who has not picked up her phobia, and her method of coping is like mine: \u201cAvoid, avoid, avoid.\u201d</p> <p>Cross, who lives in Dorset, says she\u2019s had one attempt at therapy, but she couldn\u2019t go through with it. \u201cI\u2019m hugely embarrassed by my phobia, I just feel ridiculous,\u201d she says. The fact that Steve Jobs had a button phobia too (which explains all those roll-necks) and that he did all right, gives her some solace. Also, she\u2019s survived the worst experience she\u2019s ever likely to have with buttons: stumbling across a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2015/sep/28/londons-other-royalty-pearly-kings-and-queens-mark-the-harvest-festival-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Pearly Kings and Queens</a> show in London. \u201cThat was horrific. Why would anyone <em>do</em> that?\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Unlike Cross, Rowan Moodie</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em> </em>a media relations manager from Buckinghamshire, remembers exactly when her phobia started. \u201cI was stuck in a lift in India in my early teens,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very hot and they said, \u2018This has never happened before,\u2019 which was not a great thing to hear. I wanted them to say, \u2018This happens all the time and we\u2019ll fix it!\u2019 That experience cemented my phobia of lifts. I just think I\u2019m going to get stuck in a lift for ever,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019s no way out. Bizarrely, I can go in transparent glass lifts, because people can see me and I\u2019d be OK. I\u2019d be saved.\u201d</p> <p>Moodie admits, \u201cIt can be embarrassing. I\u2019ve been at a tube station and I\u2019ve had to ask London Underground officials to take things down in the lift for me, including a buggy with my children in it, even though it\u2019s only one level. I had an interview once at a place where I really wanted to work and I was unable to get into the lift even to go up a couple of floors.\u201d</p> <p>When it came to the birth of her daughter, five years ago, there was a serious problem. \u201cOn my birth plan I put that \u2018I will refuse to use a lift even if I\u2019m made to.\u2019 But when it came to it, I had to go in a lift to be transported between two wards. I was told that if I didn\u2019t, then I\u2019d be putting my baby at risk, and I was screaming. Looking back, it\u2019s quite amusing that my biggest fear about giving birth was having to go in a lift, but it was an absolute nightmare.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Vix Proctor, 38, is head</strong></em> of marketing for a charity, and someone who has also tried to find the funny side of her phobia despite it being extremely distressing. Over the years, she has had many \u201cbanana dramas\u201d, as she refers to her phobic reaction to the fruit. \u201cOne incident took me two weeks to recover from, after I found a banana slice in a cake,\u201d she says. \u201cI was shivering, the panic attack was so bad. My friend had to kick down the toilet door to get to me, because I\u2019d fainted.\u201d Her friend had bitten into the cake to show her that it was OK, but it turned out there was some banana hiding in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e07f72e2202814bc5c327f3d270a866a59a8726\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e07f72e2202814bc5c327f3d270a866a59a8726/0_1071_3744_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Full Frame Shot Of Bananas For Sale In MarketGettyImages-700832971\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One incident took me two weeks to recover from, after I found a banana slice in a cake\u2019: Vix Proctor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Kaesler/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Proctor, who lives in south London, believes that her phobia probably comes from her grandmother. She didn\u2019t have a phobia of bananas, but she disliked them so much she banned them from her house. Proctor, who is expecting a child this month, started seeing a CBT therapist as soon as she knew she was pregnant, because she doesn\u2019t want to pass on her phobia to her child. \u201cI want to get to the stage where I can have bananas in the house,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I could ever feed a baby with a banana. Maybe to have one in the house is a realistic target.\u201d</p> <p>Funnily enough, Proctor\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is a bodybuilder. Bananas are part of his regime \u2013 he eats at least two a day \u2013 but they have to be eaten at work because of her strict house rules. Proctor says she is now making progress with her therapy, so one day he may be able to fuel up at home. \u201cI\u2019m very competitive,\u201d she says, \u201cand I want to try to challenge myself as much as I can.\u201d</p> <p>Hearing these stories and reading about the efficacy of CBT for treating phobias, I decided to go along for a short CBT assessment with psychologist Kasia Szymanska, co-author of <em>Understanding CBT: Develop </em><em>Your </em><em>Own Toolkit </em><em>To Reduce Stress and Increase Well-being</em>. Szymanska, who has worked with phobias ranging from a fear of heights to a fear of storms, says that avoiding cotton wool for all these years has simply reinforced the idea it\u2019s to be avoided in the first place. \u201cBy avoiding it, you keep the phobia going.\u201d Her recommended strategy is that I build up exposure to cotton wool and learn to challenge my negative thinking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By avoiding it, you keep the phobia going</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Szymanska gives me a sheet listing 20 categories of distorted automatic thoughts (unhelpful or problematic thoughts). She has highlighted two areas she thinks I may need to work on most: Catastrophising (where you believe what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable you won\u2019t be able to stand it) and Shoulds (you interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than focusing on what is).</p> <p>She thinks it could take six to eight sessions of therapy for me to manage my cotton-wool phobia and that I will need to do a lot of work between them to challenge my thinking. She asks me to write down a hierarchy of fears, in which I rate the distress of various situations from 0 to 100 \u2013 eg, seeing a picture of cotton wool (20), watching a video of cotton wool being pulled and squeaking (95!) \u2013 and deal with the lowest-ranking ones first.</p> <p><em><strong>Over the past </strong></em>few weeks I\u2019ve been trying out a few of her suggestions, the first of which is to switch from referring to CW and to call it what it is. Although this has been met with mock incredulity from my family, it genuinely feels quite liberating to have now broken this particular ingrained habit. Cotton wool, cotton wool, cotton wool! There.</p> <p>I\u2019ve now managed to hold one of my girlfriend\u2019s cosmetic pads between my thumb and index finger \u2013 without moving them, mind \u2013 and pushing on through my usual reaction for 30 seconds. I can see how this slow exposure may work, eventually.</p> <p>I\u2019m really looking forward to my children seeing me start to manage my phobia, to slowly improve, to have \u2013 however belatedly \u2013 faced a problem and overcome it. Perhaps it will have some other, unforeseen effects. Perhaps I will see that all those other uncomfortable things in life we avoid can be addressed, too.</p> <p><em>If you are affected by any of these issues, contact <a href=\"https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/anxiety-type/fear-of-flying/\" title=\"\">Anxiety UK</a></em></p>",

I remember one Christmas when my grandmother produced a lovingly made cardboard house wrapped in red cr\u00eape paper in which she had placed our presents \u2013 but it had a cotton-wool roof. Arghh! So began a lifelong pattern of avoidance. When I have an injection now I\u2019ll request cotton gauze and, luckily, the dentist no longer uses cotton-wool swabs. It was relatively easy to avoid cotton wool until my children started arriving. There\u2019s really no avoiding it when you have a baby\u2019s bottom to clean and wipes result in a rash. That was the first time in decades that I\u2019d been able to touch the stuff, and only after my girlfriend had first made the cotton wool wet for me and squished it flat. I have worried that I could pass on this aversion to my children \u2013 we have three, aged 17, 11 and 5 \u2013 but they\u2019re fine with it. Along with pretty much everyone else I\u2019ve met, they find it bizarre and ridiculous and tease me about it \u2013 including my youngest, who rolls her eyes exaggeratedly when I ask her to remove any cotton-wool pads I\u2019ve seen on the floor. I\u2019ve started to think that, at 48, it\u2019s really something I should confront and get treatment for. How can I expect my children to overcome any worries or fears they may have when I\u2019m not willing to overcome mine? I recently chatted to my mother and she told me that when I was two, and my brother was born, I carefully placed all of my soft cuddly toys at the foot of his travel cot the day he arrived home from hospital. I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d given away my toys \u2013 and certainly not in this way. My parents thought this was a sweet gesture, but I think in hindsight it was probably more out of a dislike of their cotton wool-like textures than any altruism. There I was, in some sense throwing my toys out of my pram just at the moment my brother arrived. According to Cary Cooper, a clinical adviser for the mental health charity Anxiety UK and a professor of organisational psychology and health, my phobia may have had its origins in sibling rivalry. \u201cYour brother\u2019s birth is quite significant,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cIt takes the limelight off you; you\u2019re giving up something soft and the metaphor for that could be cotton wool. When it\u2019s a rare phobia like this one, it\u2019s usually associated with a traumatic event. So your brother\u2019s born, attention is off you, you feel like you have to give your toys up.\u201d Perhaps in later avoiding the soft toys, I was avoiding unpleasant feelings of envy. However, knowing the origins of a phobia doesn\u2019t necessarily make it any easier to address. The fact remains that, 46 years later, the stuff still gives me \u2013 in David Foster Wallace\u2019s memorable phrase \u2013 the howling fantods. I ask Cooper if my phobia is clinically recognised. \u201cYes,\u201d he explains. \u201cA phobia is an irrational fear of an object or a particular situation that elicits an anxiety response, so it could be anything.\u201d It\u2019s not just the understandable, relatable ones, such as spiders or heights; it can be a fear of sponge cake, fresh fruit, knees, even yellow things. In a way, because these are such everyday, benign and faintly amusing objects, this makes them somehow more stressful and certainly more embarrassing. Where do phobias come from? \u201cIn many cases they come from the parents or significant other when you\u2019re a kid \u2013 you pick up their phobia,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cOr it\u2019s an anxiety associated with something.\u201d According to one UK study, 13% of the adult population will develop a phobia at some point. Simple phobias most often develop during childhood, but it\u2019s not known for certain why some people are more susceptible to phobias. Microbiologist Dr Lisa Cross, 42, has a phobia of buttons that started when she was about seven, but she has no idea why. \u201cButtons have always made me feel revulsion. They are disgusting. They make me feel sick,\u201d she says. There is a strict hierarchy to her phobia, too. \u201cA toggle on a duffel coat is fine, the metal ones on jeans are fine, but anything else on a shirt or similar is awful. Worse than that would be one on the floor, not attached to the garment \u2013 even worse if it has a bit of cotton in it.\u201d For this reason, Cross doesn\u2019t wear blouses and all her coats have zips. She will cross to the other side of the street if there\u2019s a button on the pavement. She has managed to hide any extreme reaction from her eight-year-old son, who has not picked up her phobia, and her method of coping is like mine: \u201cAvoid, avoid, avoid.\u201d Cross, who lives in Dorset, says she\u2019s had one attempt at therapy, but she couldn\u2019t go through with it. \u201cI\u2019m hugely embarrassed by my phobia, I just feel ridiculous,\u201d she says. The fact that Steve Jobs had a button phobia too (which explains all those roll-necks) and that he did all right, gives her some solace. Also, she\u2019s survived the worst experience she\u2019s ever likely to have with buttons: stumbling across a Pearly Kings and Queens show in London. \u201cThat was horrific. Why would anyone do that?\u201d Unlike Cross, Rowan Moodie, a media relations manager from Buckinghamshire, remembers exactly when her phobia started. \u201cI was stuck in a lift in India in my early teens,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very hot and they said, \u2018This has never happened before,\u2019 which was not a great thing to hear. I wanted them to say, \u2018This happens all the time and we\u2019ll fix it!\u2019 That experience cemented my phobia of lifts. I just think I\u2019m going to get stuck in a lift for ever,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019s no way out. Bizarrely, I can go in transparent glass lifts, because people can see me and I\u2019d be OK. I\u2019d be saved.\u201d Moodie admits, \u201cIt can be embarrassing. I\u2019ve been at a tube station and I\u2019ve had to ask London Underground officials to take things down in the lift for me, including a buggy with my children in it, even though it\u2019s only one level. I had an interview once at a place where I really wanted to work and I was unable to get into the lift even to go up a couple of floors.\u201d When it came to the birth of her daughter, five years ago, there was a serious problem. \u201cOn my birth plan I put that \u2018I will refuse to use a lift even if I\u2019m made to.\u2019 But when it came to it, I had to go in a lift to be transported between two wards. I was told that if I didn\u2019t, then I\u2019d be putting my baby at risk, and I was screaming. Looking back, it\u2019s quite amusing that my biggest fear about giving birth was having to go in a lift, but it was an absolute nightmare.\u201d Vix Proctor, 38, is head of marketing for a charity, and someone who has also tried to find the funny side of her phobia despite it being extremely distressing. Over the years, she has had many \u201cbanana dramas\u201d, as she refers to her phobic reaction to the fruit. \u201cOne incident took me two weeks to recover from, after I found a banana slice in a cake,\u201d she says. \u201cI was shivering, the panic attack was so bad. My friend had to kick down the toilet door to get to me, because I\u2019d fainted.\u201d Her friend had bitten into the cake to show her that it was OK, but it turned out there was some banana hiding in it. Proctor, who lives in south London, believes that her phobia probably comes from her grandmother. She didn\u2019t have a phobia of bananas, but she disliked them so much she banned them from her house. Proctor, who is expecting a child this month, started seeing a CBT therapist as soon as she knew she was pregnant, because she doesn\u2019t want to pass on her phobia to her child. \u201cI want to get to the stage where I can have bananas in the house,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I could ever feed a baby with a banana. Maybe to have one in the house is a realistic target.\u201d Funnily enough, Proctor\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is a bodybuilder. Bananas are part of his regime \u2013 he eats at least two a day \u2013 but they have to be eaten at work because of her strict house rules. Proctor says she is now making progress with her therapy, so one day he may be able to fuel up at home. \u201cI\u2019m very competitive,\u201d she says, \u201cand I want to try to challenge myself as much as I can.\u201d Hearing these stories and reading about the efficacy of CBT for treating phobias, I decided to go along for a short CBT assessment with psychologist Kasia Szymanska, co-author of Understanding CBT: Develop Your Own Toolkit To Reduce Stress and Increase Well-being. Szymanska, who has worked with phobias ranging from a fear of heights to a fear of storms, says that avoiding cotton wool for all these years has simply reinforced the idea it\u2019s to be avoided in the first place. \u201cBy avoiding it, you keep the phobia going.\u201d Her recommended strategy is that I build up exposure to cotton wool and learn to challenge my negative thinking. Szymanska gives me a sheet listing 20 categories of distorted automatic thoughts (unhelpful or problematic thoughts). She has highlighted two areas she thinks I may need to work on most: Catastrophising (where you believe what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable you won\u2019t be able to stand it) and Shoulds (you interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than focusing on what is). She thinks it could take six to eight sessions of therapy for me to manage my cotton-wool phobia and that I will need to do a lot of work between them to challenge my thinking. She asks me to write down a hierarchy of fears, in which I rate the distress of various situations from 0 to 100 \u2013 eg, seeing a picture of cotton wool (20), watching a video of cotton wool being pulled and squeaking (95!) \u2013 and deal with the lowest-ranking ones first. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve been trying out a few of her suggestions, the first of which is to switch from referring to CW and to call it what it is. Although this has been met with mock incredulity from my family, it genuinely feels quite liberating to have now broken this particular ingrained habit. Cotton wool, cotton wool, cotton wool! There. I\u2019ve now managed to hold one of my girlfriend\u2019s cosmetic pads between my thumb and index finger \u2013 without moving them, mind \u2013 and pushing on through my usual reaction for 30 seconds. I can see how this slow exposure may work, eventually. I\u2019m really looking forward to my children seeing me start to manage my phobia, to slowly improve, to have \u2013 however belatedly \u2013 faced a problem and overcome it. Perhaps it will have some other, unforeseen effects. Perhaps I will see that all those other uncomfortable things in life we avoid can be addressed, too.

But it was echoed in a Wall Street Journal editorial, and in a New York Times opinion piece that called for an \u201cIraq-style \u2018surge\u2019 to save Mexico\u201d. Previous US efforts to help Mexico fight crime have often been developed without serious diagnosis of the situation on the ground. And even when crime-fighting aid has been designed with care and good intentions, success has been limited. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand US collaboration with a Mexican filter, you have to read it with a Washington filter,\u201d says Javier Oliva, a national security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cMexico just isn\u2019t important [to the US] in its own right.\u201d The result has often been US political objectives driving actions in Mexico \u2013 with little thought for the consequences on the ground. When an undercover DEA agent called Kiki Camarena was abducted in Guadalajara and tortured to death in 1985, the Reagan administration came close to shutting down the border, and piled intense pressure on the Mexican authorities to take down the country\u2019s top tier of traffickers. For the US, the crackdown sent a message to the world not to mess with the DEA. In Mexico, meanwhile, it sparked a generational power struggle within the cartels and the emergence of regional organizations that took trafficking to new heights \u2013 and triggered a round of bitter turf wars. When President Felipe Calder\u00f3n took office in 2006 he launched a military-led offensive to control these escalating conflicts. He sought US backing for this strategy, negotiating an agreement called the M\u00e9rida Initiative with George W Bush that was signed in 2007. That deal opened an unprecedented period of bilateral security collaboration \u2013 but it proved no more helpful in bringing cartels to heel than ad hoc US pressure had done before. Under Bush, the M\u00e9rida Initiative channelled military hardware into Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war, prompting a backlash that sent violence spiralling and encouraged cartels to embed themselves ever more deeply into corrupt political and business networks. Then, with Barack Obama in the White House, resources were refocused on an overhaul of Mexico\u2019s abusive criminal justice system. This did make miscarriages of justice slightly less routine \u2013 but it did nothing to ensure more criminals were charged and convicted. \u201cThe main reason the armed conflict in Mexico has become ever more lethal and difficult to control in the last 15 years is impunity,\u201d says Falko Ernst, Mexico analyst with the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt is still more than 95%,\u201d meaning the vast majority of violent crimes go unpunished. The one aspect of US support that has clearly fulfilled its brief has been the pursuit of top narcos under the \u201ckingpin strategy\u201d that was wholeheartedly embraced by Calder\u00f3n and his successor President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who left office last year. Their administrations typically took credit for a constant trickle of high-profile arrests, though DEA involvement was often key. But even the capture and eventual extradition of the man described as the world\u2019s biggest drug dealer \u2013 Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n\u201d \u2013 barely dented the power of organized crime back in Mexico. El Chapo\u2019s own Sinaloa cartel proved itself strong enough to besiege the entire northern city of Culiac\u00e1n last month, forcing soldiers to back down after they briefly detained one of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons. Which is why M\u00f3nica Serrano, a security expert from the Colmex thinktank, argues that if Trump really wants to help, his priorities should be \u201cmore enlightened\u201d drug policies that slash cartel profits, and new gun laws that restrict their ability to build up terrifying arsenals. \u201cWithout in any way understating the policy failures in Mexico that have aggravated and exacerbated the situation, the truth is that it is the US that creates the monsters.\u201d she says. \u201cAnd monstrous situations.\u201d",

Believe me, if I was Julia Roberts, I would not be working this hard.\u201d Over the past two decades, Banks has been working very hard indeed. And if her name isn\u2019t instantly familiar, her body of work certainly is. She has been a regular in commercial comedy films \u2013 <em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em> (2005), <em>What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting</em> (2012) \u2013 and a recurring guest star on TV shows such as <em>30 Rock</em> and <em>Modern Family</em>, for which she received Emmy nominations.

It wasn\u2019t permitting me to tell the stories I wanted to tell.\u201d Julia Roberts never has those problems. \u201c<em>She</em> decides what <em>she</em> wants to do, when <em>she</em> wants to. You have to make your own opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>In 2013, Banks was on the lookout for a romcom to direct when <em>Pitch Perfect 2</em> came along. The opportunity was unexpected. She\u2019d been following her own path for a while. She\u2019d directed and starred in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JI487DlgTA\" title=\"\">public service announcement</a> for the American Heart Association that \u201cwent very viral\u201d and a funny short film with the actor Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz. Banks had already set up a production company, Brownstone, with her husband, the sportswriter Max Handelman. When the director of <em>Pitch Perfect</em> declined to take on a sequel, Banks considered it a no-brainer to take the job. She\u2019d been a producer on the franchise already; she had all the intel she needed. I suggest Banks has been a frustrated director on set her whole career and she shrieks: \u201cI\u2019m not the only one!\u201d</p> <p>She learned everything she knows on the job, Banks says. \u201cBut that means you recognise pretty quickly when you\u2019re in a process with somebody who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. And when you\u2019re trusting your performance with someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s terrifying. It happens to everybody. We all work with people who are not up to the job.\u201d</p> <p>Banks recalls going into a meeting at Sony to announce, simply: \u201c\u2018I want to direct a <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels</em> movie.\u2019 To be able to work for a big studio with a big budget? They don\u2019t usually just hand that out. But I felt ready and confident.\u201d <em>Pitch Perfect 2</em> earned $69m on opening weekend, setting a record for a first-time director, bringing Banks accolades as a filmmaker. Suddenly she was in demand in a way she hadn\u2019t quite been previously: to realise a film\u2019s larger vision, rather than play a smaller, acting role within it. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I could have directed whatever I wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I definitely had leeway to have some autonomy over what I was going to do next.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0fdc7aed31e3aaee511825fcbee8337bbfd917a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fdc7aed31e3aaee511825fcbee8337bbfd917a9/302_290_2198_1319/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New generation Charlie\u2019s Angels 2019: from left, Naomi Scott, Kristen Stewart, Ella Balinska, Elizabeth Banks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New generation Charlie\u2019s Angels 2019: (from left) Naomi Scott, Kristen Stewart, Ella Balinska, Elizabeth Banks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lifestyle pictures/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watching <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels</em>, it\u2019s impossible to question her ambition. Charles Townsend\u2019s investigative agency has expanded and there are now groups of Angels \u2013 all smart, highly trained women \u2013 across the world. Banks plays a key role: Bosley to the Angels Sabina (Kristen Stewart), Elena (Naomi Scott) and Jane (Ella Balinska).</p> <p>Some of the film\u2019s details \u2013 for example, a female employee discovers a sinister plot in a large tech company, but is dismissed by her male bosses \u2013 might be construed as political. Is that impossible to avoid in 2019? \u201cI\u2019m not making any grand statements,\u201d she says. \u201cI happened to make an action movie about corporate malfeasance that also happens to star women and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What a political statement!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Is it?\u2019 If they were all men and it was the exact same story, it wouldn\u2019t be very political, would it? I wanted to make a broader, appealing movie rather than something actually political.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I happened to make an action movie that also happens to star women and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What a political statement!\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She finds it interesting that \u201csimply because I made a movie that stars women, that it\u2019s feminist enough. That\u2019s something I heard when I was putting the movie together. Like, \u2018You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re getting to make it, it\u2019s feminist enough. You don\u2019t have to push it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m pushing it at all!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Banks has ditched the male gaze of <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels</em> past and has loaded the film with \u201csneaky feminist ideas\u201d. \u201cLittle things,\u201d she says, \u201clike, \u2018Don\u2019t forget to smile!\u2019\u201d Because the reality for female directors, she says, is that they are still not afforded the same opportunities as men. Even those who get to direct a juggernaut like <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels</em>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever heard anyone say to a man, \u2018You can\u2019t direct that story because it\u2019s about a woman,\u2019 and yet I have been told \u2013 I\u2019m not going to tell you who said it \u2013 that I couldn\u2019t direct men because they \u2018wouldn\u2019t follow me\u2019 as a director. Directing is all about leadership. So basically they were saying I couldn\u2019t lead. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of difficult men as an actor and it\u2019s never been a problem. A good leader is a good leader. I did not take to heart what that gentleman said to me, but I\u2019m also positive he\u2019s never said that to a man.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"393495babaf6a1ad152a8bd39fa4d4cf91dd0d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/393495babaf6a1ad152a8bd39fa4d4cf91dd0d30/206_82_2795_4506/620.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019re being bad Jews this year because we decided to take the kids to Disneyland.\u2019 Elizabeth Banks with her husband Max Handelman.\" width=\"620\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re being bad Jews this year because we decided to take the kids to Disneyland.\u2019 Elizabeth Banks with her husband Max Handelman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picture Perfect/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to a bank clerk and a factory worker. The eldest of four children, she grew up in a close-knit family that \u201cdid a wonderful job raising me and have been completely supportive my whole life\u201d. But things were not always easy. \u201cMy upbringing was socio-economically tough,\u201d she says, which \u201cmeant that you had to make decisions about what you could afford.\u201d</p> <p>How bad did things get? \u201cIt\u2019s what Kamala Harris talks about a lot now. A $500 emergency will put a lot of families into bankruptcy, basically. That\u2019s what it was like. When I was growing up, if the car broke down, it was a state of emergency. My parents did an excellent job shielding us from it. But to me, a big part of success is not worrying if the car breaks down.\u201d</p> <p>Banks met her husband on her first day at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. She went on to study at the American Conservatory Theater, before the couple settled in LA and married in 2003. They are now parents to two boys, both born via gestational surrogacy because of a womb issue, or what Banks refers to on her personal <a href=\"http://elizabethbanksblog.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">blog</a> as her \u201cbroken belly\u201d. \u201cWe make a \u2018baby cake,\u2019\u201d she explained at the time, \u201cand bake it in another woman\u2019s \u2018oven\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The family practise Judaism, though Banks has never formally converted. When we meet, Jewish New Year is just a few days away. \u201cWe\u2019re being bad Jews this year because we decided to take the kids to Disneyland,\u201d Banks says, her eyes lighting up. \u201cThey don\u2019t know we\u2019re going. It\u2019s a surprise! They have the day off school and I felt like if we stayed here I would get pulled into work, but this way I\u2019m out for the day. I\u2019m taking my youngest on his first rollercoaster and I\u2019m so excited.\u201d</p> <p>After a decade in the same home, the Banks clan recently upgraded to a sizeable property in Sherman Oaks and she\u2019s enjoying doing the \u201cnesting, decorating and organising\u201d that the past 10 years have not exactly allowed for. She\u2019s getting better, Banks says, at taking time out. \u201cI want to be available for my kids as much as I can be. We might try and do a Saturday date night, but we don\u2019t leave the house until the kids are in bed so they don\u2019t miss a minute with us on the weekend. I decide when I have to work. That provides comfort and space for the other things I love, which is my family and my friends. I have control over my time. If I don\u2019t want to do something, I say no.\u201d</p> <p>Talk turns to pay parity. Michelle Williams has just broached the issue in a speech at the Emmys. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the greatest actors of her generation,\u201d Banks says. \u201cAnd she works so hard on every job and yet, in <em>Venom</em>, Tom Hardy made way more money than her. It\u2019s hard to be, like: \u2018You guys, you know sometimes just paying us tells us that you like us!\u2019 You can show that you value us in many ways. One is by giving us awards, one is by letting us play really cool roles, another one is to pay us.\u201d She\u2019s deadpanning. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we\u2019re expected as women not to value money as a factor in our worth when it\u2019s a factor in everyone\u2019s worth.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be3214e6024c88beb90ac739c9824e0d8437d013\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3214e6024c88beb90ac739c9824e0d8437d013/0_770_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Honestly, I\u2019m having a hard time feeling optimistic in the world we\u2019re living in today\u2019: Elizabeth Banks.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Honestly, I\u2019m having a hard time feeling optimistic in the world we\u2019re living in today\u2019: Elizabeth Banks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramona Rosales/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Does she feel that things are starting to improve at all? \u201cI don\u2019t know.

Whether that\u2019s about women being directors or women having autonomy over their bodies, I feel like every step forward we\u2019re looking over our shoulder waiting to see if they\u2019re going to come for us.\u201d How long has she been feeling like this \u2013 since Trump was elected? \u201cUh huh.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 Banks gave a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention in support of Hillary Clinton, where she famously parodied the soon-to-be-president. \u201cSome of you know me from <em>The Hunger Games</em>, in which I play Effie Trinket, a cruel, out-of-touch reality TV star who wears insane wigs while delivering long-winded speeches to a violent dystopia,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when I tuned into Cleveland last week, I was like, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s my act!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her show of support for Hillary was \u201ca no-brainer if you\u2019re a feminist,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m here for more justice in the world, generally. There was all this anecdotal evidence that the system works against us. And now the system is openly and actively working against us. I\u2019m a white lady and it\u2019s so much worse for people of colour and non-cisgendered people and I\u2019m totally aware of that. That\u2019s depressing to me because I\u2019m someone who believes in the more the merrier at the table. We are living globally and we can\u2019t put that genie back in the bottle, so let\u2019s help each other.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d pick her brain on this more if we had longer. But as soon as our meeting ends there\u2019s a blacked out SUV waiting for her. There\u2019s no let-up, but I\u2019m certain Banks wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cI have to figure out what I\u2019m going to do next,\u201d she muses, before heading off. \u201cI have to get pitching. And reading. And coalescing things into reality.\u201d</p> <p><em>Charlie\u2019s Angels is released on 29 November</em></p> <p><em>Hair by Mark Townsend at Starworks; makeup by Fiona Stiles at Starworks; stylists Wendi &amp; Nicole at Forwards Artists.

You have to make your own opportunities.\u201d In 2013, Banks was on the lookout for a romcom to direct when Pitch Perfect 2 came along. The opportunity was unexpected. She\u2019d been following her own path for a while. She\u2019d directed and starred in a public service announcement for the American Heart Association that \u201cwent very viral\u201d and a funny short film with the actor Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz. Banks had already set up a production company, Brownstone, with her husband, the sportswriter Max Handelman. When the director of Pitch Perfect declined to take on a sequel, Banks considered it a no-brainer to take the job. She\u2019d been a producer on the franchise already; she had all the intel she needed. I suggest Banks has been a frustrated director on set her whole career and she shrieks: \u201cI\u2019m not the only one!\u201d She learned everything she knows on the job, Banks says. \u201cBut that means you recognise pretty quickly when you\u2019re in a process with somebody who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. And when you\u2019re trusting your performance with someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s terrifying. It happens to everybody. We all work with people who are not up to the job.\u201d Banks recalls going into a meeting at Sony to announce, simply: \u201c\u2018I want to direct a Charlie\u2019s Angels movie.\u2019 To be able to work for a big studio with a big budget? They don\u2019t usually just hand that out. But I felt ready and confident.\u201d Pitch Perfect 2 earned $69m on opening weekend, setting a record for a first-time director, bringing Banks accolades as a filmmaker. Suddenly she was in demand in a way she hadn\u2019t quite been previously: to realise a film\u2019s larger vision, rather than play a smaller, acting role within it. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I could have directed whatever I wanted,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I definitely had leeway to have some autonomy over what I was going to do next.\u201d Watching Charlie\u2019s Angels, it\u2019s impossible to question her ambition. Charles Townsend\u2019s investigative agency has expanded and there are now groups of Angels \u2013 all smart, highly trained women \u2013 across the world. Banks plays a key role: Bosley to the Angels Sabina (Kristen Stewart), Elena (Naomi Scott) and Jane (Ella Balinska). Some of the film\u2019s details \u2013 for example, a female employee discovers a sinister plot in a large tech company, but is dismissed by her male bosses \u2013 might be construed as political. Is that impossible to avoid in 2019? \u201cI\u2019m not making any grand statements,\u201d she says. \u201cI happened to make an action movie about corporate malfeasance that also happens to star women and everyone\u2019s like, \u2018What a political statement!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Is it?\u2019 If they were all men and it was the exact same story, it wouldn\u2019t be very political, would it? I wanted to make a broader, appealing movie rather than something actually political.\u201d She finds it interesting that \u201csimply because I made a movie that stars women, that it\u2019s feminist enough. That\u2019s something I heard when I was putting the movie together. Like, \u2018You\u2019re lucky you\u2019re getting to make it, it\u2019s feminist enough. You don\u2019t have to push it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m pushing it at all!\u2019\u201d Banks has ditched the male gaze of Charlie\u2019s Angels past and has loaded the film with \u201csneaky feminist ideas\u201d. \u201cLittle things,\u201d she says, \u201clike, \u2018Don\u2019t forget to smile!\u2019\u201d Because the reality for female directors, she says, is that they are still not afforded the same opportunities as men. Even those who get to direct a juggernaut like Charlie\u2019s Angels. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever heard anyone say to a man, \u2018You can\u2019t direct that story because it\u2019s about a woman,\u2019 and yet I have been told \u2013 I\u2019m not going to tell you who said it \u2013 that I couldn\u2019t direct men because they \u2018wouldn\u2019t follow me\u2019 as a director. Directing is all about leadership. So basically they were saying I couldn\u2019t lead. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of difficult men as an actor and it\u2019s never been a problem. A good leader is a good leader. I did not take to heart what that gentleman said to me, but I\u2019m also positive he\u2019s never said that to a man.\u201d Banks was born Elizabeth Mitchell in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, to a bank clerk and a factory worker. The eldest of four children, she grew up in a close-knit family that \u201cdid a wonderful job raising me and have been completely supportive my whole life\u201d. But things were not always easy. \u201cMy upbringing was socio-economically tough,\u201d she says, which \u201cmeant that you had to make decisions about what you could afford.\u201d How bad did things get? \u201cIt\u2019s what Kamala Harris talks about a lot now. A $500 emergency will put a lot of families into bankruptcy, basically. That\u2019s what it was like. When I was growing up, if the car broke down, it was a state of emergency. My parents did an excellent job shielding us from it. But to me, a big part of success is not worrying if the car breaks down.\u201d Banks met her husband on her first day at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. She went on to study at the American Conservatory Theater, before the couple settled in LA and married in 2003. They are now parents to two boys, both born via gestational surrogacy because of a womb issue, or what Banks refers to on her personal blog as her \u201cbroken belly\u201d. \u201cWe make a \u2018baby cake,\u2019\u201d she explained at the time, \u201cand bake it in another woman\u2019s \u2018oven\u2019.\u201d The family practise Judaism, though Banks has never formally converted. When we meet, Jewish New Year is just a few days away. \u201cWe\u2019re being bad Jews this year because we decided to take the kids to Disneyland,\u201d Banks says, her eyes lighting up. \u201cThey don\u2019t know we\u2019re going. It\u2019s a surprise! They have the day off school and I felt like if we stayed here I would get pulled into work, but this way I\u2019m out for the day. I\u2019m taking my youngest on his first rollercoaster and I\u2019m so excited.\u201d After a decade in the same home, the Banks clan recently upgraded to a sizeable property in Sherman Oaks and she\u2019s enjoying doing the \u201cnesting, decorating and organising\u201d that the past 10 years have not exactly allowed for. She\u2019s getting better, Banks says, at taking time out. \u201cI want to be available for my kids as much as I can be. We might try and do a Saturday date night, but we don\u2019t leave the house until the kids are in bed so they don\u2019t miss a minute with us on the weekend. I decide when I have to work. That provides comfort and space for the other things I love, which is my family and my friends. I have control over my time. If I don\u2019t want to do something, I say no.\u201d Talk turns to pay parity. Michelle Williams has just broached the issue in a speech at the Emmys. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the greatest actors of her generation,\u201d Banks says. \u201cAnd she works so hard on every job and yet, in Venom, Tom Hardy made way more money than her. It\u2019s hard to be, like: \u2018You guys, you know sometimes just paying us tells us that you like us!\u2019 You can show that you value us in many ways. One is by giving us awards, one is by letting us play really cool roles, another one is to pay us.\u201d She\u2019s deadpanning. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that we\u2019re expected as women not to value money as a factor in our worth when it\u2019s a factor in everyone\u2019s worth.\u201d Does she feel that things are starting to improve at all? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope. Honestly, I\u2019m having a hard time feeling optimistic in the world we\u2019re living in today in general. Whether that\u2019s about women being directors or women having autonomy over their bodies, I feel like every step forward we\u2019re looking over our shoulder waiting to see if they\u2019re going to come for us.\u201d How long has she been feeling like this \u2013 since Trump was elected? \u201cUh huh.\u201d In 2016 Banks gave a powerful speech at the Democratic National Convention in support of Hillary Clinton, where she famously parodied the soon-to-be-president. \u201cSome of you know me from The Hunger Games, in which I play Effie Trinket, a cruel, out-of-touch reality TV star who wears insane wigs while delivering long-winded speeches to a violent dystopia,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when I tuned into Cleveland last week, I was like, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s my act!\u2019\u201d Her show of support for Hillary was \u201ca no-brainer if you\u2019re a feminist,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019m here for more justice in the world, generally. There was all this anecdotal evidence that the system works against us. And now the system is openly and actively working against us. I\u2019m a white lady and it\u2019s so much worse for people of colour and non-cisgendered people and I\u2019m totally aware of that. That\u2019s depressing to me because I\u2019m someone who believes in the more the merrier at the table. We are living globally and we can\u2019t put that genie back in the bottle, so let\u2019s help each other.\u201d I\u2019d pick her brain on this more if we had longer. But as soon as our meeting ends there\u2019s a blacked out SUV waiting for her. There\u2019s no let-up, but I\u2019m certain Banks wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cI have to figure out what I\u2019m going to do next,\u201d she muses, before heading off. \u201cI have to get pitching. And reading. And coalescing things into reality.\u201d Charlie\u2019s Angels is released on 29 November Hair by Mark Townsend at Starworks; makeup by Fiona Stiles at Starworks; stylists Wendi &amp; Nicole at Forwards Artists.

He knows that the toxic vapors can<strong> </strong>stick in his system long after the flames have died down and the adrenaline has faded.</p> <p>Over the past decade, scientists have been working to better understand how firefighters\u2019 exposure to smoke and chemical vapors affects their long-term health. In California, the researchers\u2019 work has taken on a new urgency as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/nov/05/california-wildfires-what-role-has-climate-crisis-played-video-explainer/\">increasingly ferocious fires</a> burn through wilderness and development alike, unleashing<strong> </strong>unprecedented amounts of gases and particulate upon those battling the blazes.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that firefighters have pretty intense exposures under those conditions,\u201d said Rachel Morello-Frosch, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. An analysis she released in July found that firefighters who fought the October 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/19/californias-tubbs-fire-then-and-now\">Tubbs fire</a>, which raged for more than three weeks through nearly 37,000 acres in California\u2019s wine country and killed 22, came home with heightened levels of mercury and other toxic chemicals in their blood.<strong> </strong>Blood samples from 149 firefighters deployed to Tubbs showed higher rates of mercury compared not only with members of the general public, but also with other firefighters who weren\u2019t deployed.</p> <p>\u201cThis was just an initial, pilot study,\u201d Morello-Frosch said. Still, it seemed to validate what many firefighters already suspected: those working in regions referred to as wildland-urban interface, where residential areas blend into wilderness, face elevated health risks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4cefaf1dfd3d9e18d06431023a563d0632d7b24e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cefaf1dfd3d9e18d06431023a563d0632d7b24e/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting wildfires in suburban areas creates a unique health hazard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fighting wildfires in suburban areas creates a unique health hazard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apu Gomes/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Risks of firefighting are changing</h2> <p>Wildland firefighters are often exposed to smoke for longer periods of time, working 40-, 50- or 60-hour shifts, even camping and sleeping amid the fumes. \u201cThey\u2019re doing backbreaking work,\u201d said Morello-Frosch, digging lines, trimming trees and hiking for miles.</p> <p>They tend to wear relatively lightweight gear so they can stay nimble. Whereas the responders running into burning buildings wear heavy-duty masks that feed them clean air, wildland firefighters might use a handkerchief.</p> <p>And a simple handkerchief might do, if all that was burning was vegetation. \u201cBut the dynamics of wildfire have changed,\u201d said Matt Alba, a fire captain who led his San Francisco-based strike team to the Camp fire last year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was this awful taste to it.

Several studies have established that urban firefighters have higher rates of cancer than the general population. A <a href=\"https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2017/05/10/ff-cancer-facts/\">study</a> of nearly 30,000 firefighters from 1950-2009 by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found that those who fight urban fires have higher rates of certain types of cancers \u2013 including digestive, lung, throat, and urinary cancers. It also found that firefighters experience 14% more cancer deaths than the general public.</p> <p>Federal researchers are encouraging firefighters across the nation <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p0328-firefighter-registry.html\">to register</a> for the largest-to-date study of firefighters and cancer. They\u2019re also looking into whether firefighters\u2019 work affects their risk for heart disease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/01/california-wildfire-season-2019\">California's fire season has been bad.

He\u2019s taken precautions: he tries to keep himself and his crew upwind of smoke while working. Afterward, he makes sure to clean off, the best he can, before going back home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to expose my family to anything toxic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Otherwise, he accepts the risks of the job. \u201cYou know, nobody gets out of this profession without some damage along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t a firefighter around who doesn\u2019t have that drive to help people despite everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly said that \u201cmost of the houses in Paradise were prefabricated\u201d. The position is that many of the houses were prefabricated.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Searching for survivors in the wreckage of last year\u2019s deadly Camp fire, the Marin county battalion chief, Jeremy Pierce, had to hear and feel his way through the debris. Black, murky smoke had disappeared entire streets in and near the small California town of Paradise. \u201cIt was daytime but you thought it was night,\u201d he said. Pierce, who has been fighting wildland fires for 28 years, knows how to navigate around smoke. \u201cYou have to find pockets of clean air,\u201d he said, \u201cand keep going until you can\u2019t any more.\u201d Pierce has used this technique at the Camp fire, the Carr fire before that, and the Kincade fire he\u2019s been battling in the past weeks. He knows that the toxic vapors can stick in his system long after the flames have died down and the adrenaline has faded. Over the past decade, scientists have been working to better understand how firefighters\u2019 exposure to smoke and chemical vapors affects their long-term health. In California, the researchers\u2019 work has taken on a new urgency as increasingly ferocious fires burn through wilderness and development alike, unleashing unprecedented amounts of gases and particulate upon those battling the blazes. \u201cWe know that firefighters have pretty intense exposures under those conditions,\u201d said Rachel Morello-Frosch, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. An analysis she released in July found that firefighters who fought the October 2017 Tubbs fire, which raged for more than three weeks through nearly 37,000 acres in California\u2019s wine country and killed 22, came home with heightened levels of mercury and other toxic chemicals in their blood. Blood samples from 149 firefighters deployed to Tubbs showed higher rates of mercury compared not only with members of the general public, but also with other firefighters who weren\u2019t deployed. \u201cThis was just an initial, pilot study,\u201d Morello-Frosch said. Still, it seemed to validate what many firefighters already suspected: those working in regions referred to as wildland-urban interface, where residential areas blend into wilderness, face elevated health risks. Risks of firefighting are changing Wildland firefighters are often exposed to smoke for longer periods of time, working 40-, 50- or 60-hour shifts, even camping and sleeping amid the fumes. \u201cThey\u2019re doing backbreaking work,\u201d said Morello-Frosch, digging lines, trimming trees and hiking for miles. They tend to wear relatively lightweight gear so they can stay nimble. Whereas the responders running into burning buildings wear heavy-duty masks that feed them clean air, wildland firefighters might use a handkerchief. And a simple handkerchief might do, if all that was burning was vegetation. \u201cBut the dynamics of wildfire have changed,\u201d said Matt Alba, a fire captain who led his San Francisco-based strike team to the Camp fire last year. As communities have built and expanded into the wild areas, \u201cit\u2019s not just plants and leaves burning, it\u2019s homes and structures too,\u201d Alba said. Paradise didn\u2019t smell like wildfire smoke, he recalled. \u201cThere was this awful taste to it. We just knew it was wrong.\u201d His crew fought through stinging eyes and headaches. Many of the houses in Paradise were prefabricated, and when they burned so did a noxious mix of plastics, metals, household cleaning chemicals and who knows what else. \u201cThere were charred piles of just open cans, and lots of burned out cars,\u201d he said \u2013 some with bodies in them. \u201cIt was apocalyptic.\u201d Afterward, he said, \u201cwe got all new boots, because ours were just covered in a lot of toxic content.\u201d Scientists still don\u2019t know what exactly that \u201ccontent\u201d contains \u2013 and how toxic it may be. \u201cThat\u2019s always the 50-million-dollar question,\u201d said Morello-Frosch. Fumes from anything and everything that burns have the potential to cause harm, but so do PFAS \u2013 a controversial class of chemicals used in firefighters\u2019 turnout gear \u2013 and so does the neon-pink fire retardant that responders blanket over blazes, she said. Does firefighting cause cancer? Researchers are working to understand how exposure to a noxious cocktail of fumes and particulate will affect firefighters\u2019 bodies. Several studies have established that urban firefighters have higher rates of cancer than the general population. A study of nearly 30,000 firefighters from 1950-2009 by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found that those who fight urban fires have higher rates of certain types of cancers \u2013 including digestive, lung, throat, and urinary cancers. It also found that firefighters experience 14% more cancer deaths than the general public. Federal researchers are encouraging firefighters across the nation to register for the largest-to-date study of firefighters and cancer. They\u2019re also looking into whether firefighters\u2019 work affects their risk for heart disease. In the meantime, groups like the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention Foundation (SFFCPF) are campaigning to phase out the use of PFAS chemicals and develop better, lightweight protective equipment. \u201cWhen I entered the SF fire department in 1974, we didn\u2019t really consider cancer a major cause of death,\u201d said Toni Stefani, the president of the SFFCPF. Back then, he saw young, seemingly healthy friends and colleagues succumbing to cancer. \u201cWe were going to funerals all the time for a lot of the retired firefighters,\u201d he said. Stefani himself was only 49 when he was diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma in 2001. The problem hasn\u2019t gone away. \u201cEven now, the numbers keep piling up,\u201d he said. But fire departments are a lot more careful now. \u201cHopefully, as we learn more, we can develop new standard operating procedures that\u2019ll better protect these men and women,\u201d he said. In Santa Rosa, California, after toiling to beat back the Kincade fire for days, Jeremy Pierce said he was aware of these local and national conversations about the physical toll of the job. He\u2019s taken precautions: he tries to keep himself and his crew upwind of smoke while working. Afterward, he makes sure to clean off, the best he can, before going back home. \u201cI don\u2019t want to expose my family to anything toxic,\u201d he said. Otherwise, he accepts the risks of the job. \u201cYou know, nobody gets out of this profession without some damage along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t a firefighter around who doesn\u2019t have that drive to help people despite everything.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 November 2019 because an earlier version incorrectly said that \u201cmost of the houses in Paradise were prefabricated\u201d. The position is that many of the houses were prefabricated.",

Hard to get more deserving than that - as she backed up her brilliance against Barty to close out the doubles rubber with Caroline Garcia.</p> <p>Elsewhere there were wins in the WBBL for the Adelaide Strikers and the Melbourne Renegades, while in T20 internationals England beat New Zealand in another Super Over.</p> <p>A win in the A-League for Adelaide United, with Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix sharing the points, while Cate Campbell also starred in the pool in Doha to net a huge payday.</p> <p>And that\u2019s Sportswatch!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dc7e3068f08be4a102e65ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T10:17:20.439Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A tough ceremony for a dejected Team Australia.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave Sportwatch for this Sunday. A sad way to end a heroic year for Ash Barty, and for the veteran Sam Stosur and the passionate team captain Alice Molik it\u2019s a disappointing end to a fine Fed Cup campaign. France too good over the five rubbers. Kristina Mladenovic - the three-times doubles Grand Slam winner getting the decisive win, in the singles, against the reigning World No 1 singles player. Hard to get more deserving than that - as she backed up her brilliance against Barty to close out the doubles rubber with Caroline Garcia. Elsewhere there were wins in the WBBL for the Adelaide Strikers and the Melbourne Renegades, while in T20 internationals England beat New Zealand in another Super Over. A win in the A-League for Adelaide United, with Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix sharing the points, while Cate Campbell also starred in the pool in Doha to net a huge payday. And that\u2019s Sportswatch! A tough ceremony for a dejected Team Australia. Shy acknowledgements to the crowd from Sam Stosur and Ash Barty, the latter in streams of tears, hiding under a cap during the presentation. She said 2019 had been a year of ups and downs last week after winning the WTA finals, and finishing the year as World No 1. It was hard to think of too many downs - but you know the proud Aussie will see this as a huge low point. In contrast it\u2019s tears of joy for Kristina Mladenovic and the French team. Garcia beaming alongside her - and they hold their trophies aloft. Congratulations, France. Don\u2019t forget, Fed Cup is not just one weekend - this has been a tournament that\u2019s been happening since February. It was Ash Barty, Daria Gavrilova and Priscilla Hon who stunned a Madison Keys-led USA in the quarter finals, before Barty and Stosur got home over five rubbers against Belarussian duo Victoria Azarenka and Aryna Sabalenka in Brisbane in April. Did Stosur suffer from not playing any tennis this final weekend? Could the Australian team have thrown her in against Mladenovic in the singles even just to study her game a little and blow out some cobwebs? As the only one of the four not in action, she did appear to be at a disadvantage in a fast start to the doubles final rubber. Still, hard to argue that on balance it wasn\u2019t a deserved win for France. A third ever victory, and their first in 16 years. What a rollercoaster. This French duo fell in the final three years ago - but they\u2019ve been unbelievable today when they needed to. Imagine the nerves for Caroline Garcia - she was taken apart yesterday by Ash Barty in the reverse singles, 6-0, 6-0. To pick herself up, believe in herself, and play some of the tennis she did today, is quite remarkable. Not much more you can say about Kristina Mladenovic. She was imperious today. She dismantled Alja Tomljanovic in the first rubber 6-1, 6-1, then beat the World No 1 singles player, Ash Barty, coming off that huge WTA finals win, and an incredible 2019, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6. And when France needed her most, she played near faultless doubles tennis. Composure at the net - the pace and heat on her forehand returns were something else. Worthy winners - they came with a game plan to tackle Barty\u2019s strengths and out-thought and out-hit the Australian duo. It\u2019s a cool first serve first up, but Mladenovic tightens a little and a wild second serve invites the pressure from the Australia duo. 15-30 and on a second serve, but she produces a huge second serve that Barty can\u2019t fire back. Stosur misses the next return before Garcia produces one of the volleys of the match! That came at her with heat, and she swatted it with venom. Unbelievable point, unbelievable match. France are the 2019 Fed Cup champions! Take a bow Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia and the whole French team. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 3-5 Stosur to serve to stay in the match. Ooph - the pace on that return from Mladenovic. That was rocketing. Garcia then misses the forehand for 15-15. Another inch perfect return from Mladenovic and Garcia thumps a terrific volley, before Barty shows unbelievable hands at the net! Mladenovic draws Stosur into a baseline duel, and brings up a first Fed Cup point. Stosur saves it with a strong serve, before Barty again pounces with the volley. Garcia does brillianty on return, and we\u2019re back at deuce. A second Fed Cup point as Mladenovic produces a sublime return, but her improvised volley floats long. Stosur pins her with the serve before Barty fires a sharp volley at the French star. A huge game - Australia make Mladenovic serve for it. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 2-5 Stosur with a key first win, but she blinks first in a net battle with Mladenovic and the Frenchwoman keeps her nerve to volley brilliantly. Garcia holds a settler, before Barty forces Mladenovic with a sharp return for 30-30. Huge return down the line from Stosur - she picked the wide one and thumps it down the line! 30-40 and a break point for Australia. But then she misses the volley! Brilliant defensive play from Garcia - she was up against it there. Mladenovic too good at the net once again, and Stosur yells with frustration. Barty clips the tape, and the French duo celebrate. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 2-4 Oh my. Don\u2019t get me wrong - these two are excellent players - but at 15-0 up it\u2019s a framed return that just drops over the head of Stosur! They\u2019ve had some fortune today on massive points, but Barty and Stosur put their heads down and dig deep once again. A huge serve just clips the tee from Barty, and they eventually hold. It\u2019s new balls which should help Caroline Garcia - but you get the feeling - if it\u2019s to happen for Australia it has to come on this service game. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 1-4 She\u2019s firing scud missiles, \u201cKiki\u201d Mladenovic, but Barty pounces on a second serve for 15-15. Stosur wins a baseline duel for 15-30 before Barty misses the second serve, which jams her well. Mladenovic finishes the game strongly, and suddenly its approaching last-chance saloon for the Aussie duo. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 1-3 A strong first serve from Stosur, and Barty slams a volley at Garcia. Then it\u2019s the former US Open winner with a fierce crosscourt forehand winner. Stosur then fires a super forehand - it\u2019s called out, but it catches the line. Ach - they replay, but Mladenovic is good enough on second asking. Then a terrific point from both Stosur and Barty, and they hold, and are on the board in the second set. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 0-3 Big point from Stosur, as Australia put Garcia\u2019s serve under pressure. The veteran then shows sharp hands and for once Mladenovic misses her volley to bring up two break points. Garcia then hits a sublime shot down the line - she had almost no room to work with, but she hit it! What a pressure play. And then fires an even better one cross court past Stosur! Oh my. The replay shows it\u2019s a mishit - the luck of the French - on two of the biggest points on the match so far! Australia bring up another break point, but Mladenovic leaps onto the volley to save it. And after a huge rally, they eventually hold. Big game. Could that prove decisive? Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 0-2 How good is Mladenovic at the net. She\u2019s not ranked best in the world for nothing - she pounces like a big cat on that volley as the French duo race to four straight games. It\u2019s a hold to love to start the second set from Mladenovic, before they pick off the Stosur serve once again. And suddenly, you wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s a home fixture, as the cries of Allez, allez ring out around the Perth stadium. It finishes 1-0, McGree\u2019s third goal in three games enough to secure the three points for the home side, as the Gertjan Verbeek revolution continues. Adelaide skip up to fifth on the ladder, while the Roar join Wellington and Newcastle in the \u201cour win will come\u201d band. Pressure on Barty on the serve. She powers a strong first effort, before Garcia pins Stosur at the net. Barty forces the winner and it just drags long to make 15-30 before Mladenovic clips the tape with a volley that drops over! Oh my, possibly the most crucial point of the game, and lady luck favours the French! They win the next point to a huge roar from the visiting fans. They\u2019re going to have to do it the hard way, Australia. What a test of character for the veteran champ and the World No 1 singles star. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-5 Huge hands from Mladenovic at the net, as she monsters a volley that flies past Stosur and just clips the line. Garcia drags one long to bring up 40-15, but the French duo hold with a thumping ace to the pocket. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) tie Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-4 Australia open with a sharp double volley from Barty before Stosur fires a great first serve in at Garcia. Barty pulls of a reverse overhead with balletic poise before Stosur fires a fierce forehand down the line. Four big first serves, and that\u2019s a much more confident service game - Stosur holds to love. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 3-4 A wild double fault undermines early good work from Mladenovic, and Australia pull back to 30-30. A huge first serve digs the World No 1 ranked doubles star out of danger, and she eventually holds again. A-League - Goal! Adelaide 1-0 Brisbane (McGree) It\u2019s the home-town boys that combine, as James Troisi cuts to the byline before picking out the \u201cbrawler from Gawler\u201d Riley McGree , and finally the Reds have broken the deadlock. Game on. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) tie Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 3-3 A better hold from Australia. Barty volleys well down the line before Mladenovic scrambles on the return of serve. They hold to love, and the crowd rise in appreciation. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 2-3 A tighter service game once again, as Barty goes down the tram lines with a clever return of serve to lock up at 30-30. Garcia pins the body of Stosur before a sharp volley from Mladenovic clinches the game, and Garcia holds on serve. She\u2019s a former World No 1 ranked doubles player, the veteran Stosur. She\u2019ll need to call on all her experience and guile here. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) tie Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 2-2 And that\u2019s a much more composed service game from the French, as Mladenovic holds her serve to love. And they come after Stosur\u2019s serve early on, passing Barty at the net with a fine winner down the tram tracks. Barty with a series of tight volleys but it\u2019s a missed forehand from deep from Sam and they\u2019ve broken back, the French! Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) lead Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 2-0 And we\u2019re underway in Perth, and it\u2019s a terrific start for the home duo - as Barty and Stosur fly out of the blocks and win an early break point on Garcia\u2019s serve! Four straight points to secure the game, before Ash Barty holds her first service game. Better from the French, who trade points, but a fine overhead from Stosur helps the Aussie duo hold. Great start. NBL: Sydney Kings sink defending champions Perth A few results from the NBL to update on. Quite the showdown in Sydney by all accounts, here\u2019s the Australian Associated Press\u2019 report: A three-point barrage from import Didi Louzada has inspired NBL leaders Sydney to a 104-85 victory over defending champions Perth in their top-of-the-table clash. Louzada hit seven of his 11 long-range attempts on Sunday at Qudos Bank Arena, including three in a row in a stunning third-quarter burst. The No 35 pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft finished the game with a career-high 28 points to help the Kings to maintain top spot on the ladder. Sydney\u2019s evening was soured, however, when Louzada limped off the court with cramps midway through the final quarter. He finished with six rebounds, two assists and two steals. The 20-year-old swingman was outpointed by Wildcats star Bryce Cotton, who single-handedly kept his team in the contest with 36 points. But the former league MVP was left to fight the battle alone with big man Nick Kay the only other Perth player to reach double figures. For Sydney, star guard Casper Ware chimed in with 25 points, while Brad Newley and Jae\u2019Sean Tate added 23 and 13 respectively. Earlier, Melbourne United also won well against the Adelaide 36ers 109-90, with Melo Trimble raining threes. 32 points from the American point guard, as United go four straight themselves. So - a huge fifth winner-takes-all rubber to come: it\u2019s doubles and it\u2019s the veteran Sam Stosur who will join Ash Barty to try and win a first Fed Cup for Australia since 1974. Standing in their way is Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic. Two one-time World top-ten players, so we know their pedigree. While Mladenovic has been in imperious form this week already. 6-1, 6-1 against Tomaljanovic in the reverse singles, before stunning Ash Barty 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 in a two-and-a-half hour thriller. Can the veteran and the World No 1 be the first to lift the trophy since Evonne Goolagong? Find out shortly. A-League - half-time: Adelaide United 0-0 Brisbane Roar An arm-wrestle in Adelaide, who did think they\u2019d taken the lead, only for Michael Maria\u2019s effort to be scratched off for offside. It\u2019s a more defensively resolute Brisbane this season (after they leaked 71 goals in 27 games last year), but the front third isn\u2019t quite clicking yet. Roy O\u2019Donovan with little to get excited about - but this one may yet open up second half. It\u2019s a crucial first point win for Tomljanovic before the Frenchwoman Parmentier shows all her experience to level at 15-15. A big winner and suddenly the crowd reaches fever pitch. The 26-year-old brings up two match points, but she only needs one. Parmentier drags her backhand wide, and what an epic win! Australia are right back in it, what a tense hold - and we\u2019re set for a huge fifth rubber doubles showdown! What a match. Tomljanovic\u2019s first ever Fed Cup rubber for Australia! Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 6-5 A tight one, but a huge down the line winner gets a fist punch from the Australian team captain on the sideline, Alicia Molik. Tomljanovic wins it 40-15, but the crowd gets going after that big winner. Can she carry this momentum to break ahead of a potential tie-break? Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 5-5 A great rally to open the game, Parmentier comes to the net to close it, but is almost caught with the ball over the top. She lands the smash and goes on a mini-run. A big hold to love. Is the veteran finishing this set with better momentum/morale? A close up of Ash Barty looking on - she doesn\u2019t give much away, the World No 1, but there\u2019s a look of tension across her face. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 5-4 One of the better service games from Parmentier. She may only be ranked 121 in the world, but its been an Indian summer for the French veteran who won two WTA titles in 2018, ten years after her first. She pushes Tomljanovic right to the wire on her own serve - bringing up back-to-back break points, before a huge ace gets the Aussie out of a hole. A big backhand winner to clinch it: just one game needed to clinch the rubber! And a heads up, we do have a second match of A-League action, where we\u2019re away to Adelaide where its the Reds playing host to Robbie Fowler\u2019s Brisbane Roar. A first home start for Adelaide boy, James Troisi - but there\u2019s no goals early on. About 20 min played so far. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 4-3 Parmentier breaks back! Ooph. It\u2019s all happening now. Up 30-0 it was looking okay, but Tomljanovic really tightened up from there - a wild forehand missing by some distance and she invited Parmentier right back into it. The Frenchwoman then landed a big smash to force deuce, before the Australian\u2019s second serve finally failed her. A first double fault of the game to seal it- and now it\u2019s match back on. Tense stuff. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 4-2 And Tomljanovic breaks! How crucial was that missed smash? The momentum has swung sharply this second set - just as Parmentier looked to have a foothold back in the match she lets herself down. Tomljanovic with some sharp winners, even a trip to the net to secure the break. A big service game here - if she wins this you might start to imagine she\u2019s home and we could be set for a winner-takes-all crunch fifth rubber decider! Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 3-2 Ooph. Big point. Parmentier holds her first service game to love, and comes out after Tomljanovic as the French supporters inside the arena come to life. She grabs the first point, and then in an epic rally has Tomljanovic scrambling, before missing the overhead smash! A big let off, 0-30 would have made things interesting. A big ace down the tee lifts the home crowd, before the Zagreb-born Aussie holds. A nervy game - this is the most tense this match has got; yet. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 2-1 A real inquisition on Parmentier\u2019s first service game - as she was again pushed to deuce, but the Frenchwoman held strong eventually. Ominously for Australian supporters she then also made a much better fist of things on Tomljanovic\u2019s serve, but the home favourite held comfortably enough in the end. A first hint of some nerves? Some poor shot selections - this could be an interesting little patch. It became a hard-earned point in the end, with the visitors perhaps the happier, despite giving up their early lead. Both coaches will be disappointed ultimately, given their struggles to accumulate points thus far, but it\u2019s a first point for Ufuk Talay\u2019s Phoenix, and just a fifth point for the Victory. VAR with a few decisive interventions, while Lawrence Thomas produced a stunning double save late on to deny Alex Rufer a first ever A-League goal. Ola Toivonen the X-factor at both ends for Victory - he conceded the early penalty, but more than made amends with a brilliant solo effort in a much-improved second half. What a game that was! Again it was the Parmentier serve under pressure, but she made Tomljanovic work for it with terrific athleticism. A special final point rally - one of the points of the game as the Australian looked to pounce on a second serve. She forced the Frenchwoman wide, but she was good enough to run it down, a drop shot looked to have invited Parmentier back into the point, but as she scrambled she forced her final passing shot wide. A big win - and the home crowd - a packed 26,000+ in attendance here in Perth - are right in this. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 5-4 First real test of the Parmentier serve in the eighth game, as she is forced to 30-40 before recovering via second deuce. Two big aces at crucial times to dig herself out, but good signs for Tomljanovic. Remarkably, having won her last three service games to nil, she\u2019s only getting around a third of first serves in. Thankfully she\u2019s 100% on her second serve, and winning near 90% of those. Which bodes well if she can get the first going, no? A-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 1-1 Wellington (Toivonen) - 67\u2019 And who else! They\u2019re short so much firepower with Robbie Kruse and Andrew Nabbout still sidelined, but when they need something, the Big Swede delivers. It was a fortuitous ball that arrived at the feed of Ola Toivonen courtesy a deflected clearance, but the sharpness of feet, the coolness of mind to jink past two defenders and beat Stefan Marinovic was sublime. 1-1, and we\u2019re game on! Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 3-2 We\u2019re on serve so far, although it was a wobbly first service game from the Australian who was down 15-40 before fighting back to two deuces and holding. Two service games to love after that to the delight of the home fans. It\u2019s nicely poised, this. Now - we\u2019ve still got a stack of action going on round the grounds, but let\u2019s try and get back to the Fed Cup Tennis final, third rubber which has just got underway in Perth. It\u2019s Alja Tomljanovic with the weight of a nation on her shoulders, as she must win this match against Pauline Parmentier to send this to a fifth and final rubber. A reminder - Australia haven\u2019t won the cup since 1974. Will the drought continue? And you can\u2019t script this stuff. Would you believe, in a rain-soaked finish to a much anticipated World Cup final rematch, England have claimed the honours against New Zealand.. in a Super Over. It\u2019s probably a cursed concept across the ditch after Ben Stokes\u2019 trophy-winning heroics in July. Won\u2019t have helped the mood after England bundled the All Blacks out at the Rugby World Cup, ending the storied careers of Steve Hansen and Kieran Read on a bum note. This time it was Chris Jordan with the heroics, firstly with the bat to earn the tie after a rain-reduced 11 overs, and then with the ball to deny first Seifert, then Grandhomme and Guptill. Tanya Aldred had all the action there - feel free to relive that. (If you\u2019re English, presumably). It was New Zealand v South Africa in the womens\u2019 T2o today, but it\u2019s Sophie Devine who emerges with the last laugh. An unbeaten 85* off 56 from the Kiwi opener put the Strikers in the box seat as they fired 4-164 (20) with Suzie Bates also chiming in with a handy 36 off 30. After Elyse Villani fell cheaply, it was down to the South African duo Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez to run it down. They put on an impressive 113-run stand before Bates and Amanda Wellington struck with the ball. 17 runs the margin in the end after a big batting collapse, and the Stars stay bottom. A-League - Melbourne Victory 0-1 Wellington - half-time: They\u2019re winless, pointless and currently propping up the league ladder, but they\u2019ve been awfully unfortunate in recent weeks, the Phoenix, with Marco Kurz admitting pre-game he thought they were the better side during their loss against the high flying Sydney FC, and several contentious VAR calls going against them - the silver lining being that the outrageous call on Louis Fenton last week gave rise to a vintage David Squires column. VAR has come to their rescue today though, Wellington, who lead through an early Ulises Davila penalty after Ola Toivonen was adjudged to have handled in the box. The big Swede didn\u2019t think it was, but it was given nevertheless. Morning Rich, morning all. (That\u2019s my best Bill Lawry voice). Cheers Scott, very kind - and another sterling turn from your good self. A fair bit going on, I\u2019ll try and ease gently into my floating water chair and get the sixteen screens firing. But first a look at the A-League where there\u2019s a little bit of a result threatening to bubble down in Melbourne. And that is me for today. I\u2019m off for a bex and a lie-down after that Fed Cup rubber. I hand you over to the safest gloves in the business, Richard Parkin. Over to you, great man... Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Ashleigh Barty (Aus) loses to Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) 6-2, 4-6, 6-7 Incredible comeback from Mladenovic to peg back Barty and finish all over the top of the world No 1. The Frenchwoman was unstoppable in the tie-breaker, barely giving Barty a sniff. France now hold a 2-1 lead in the Fed Cup final. Up next is Tomljanovic against Garcia. If Tomljanovic can\u2019t win that one for Australia, the Fed Cup will belong to France. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set tie-break: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 6-6 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty finds the net to hand Mladenovic a 2-1 lead in the tie-break Mladenovic cracks a cross-court winner to make it 3-1 to the Frenchwoman Now it\u2019s 4-1 to Mladenovic after a mini-break of Barty\u2019s serve Barty\u2019s return of serve crashes into the net, making it 5-1 to Mladenovic 5 match points to Mladenovic GAME OVER - Barty finds the net to go down in three sets. France take a 2-1 lead. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 6-6 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Mladenovic holds with ridiculous ease and we are off to a tie-break... Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 6-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty stares down three break points to hold her serve and move to within one game of victory. If Mladenovic is broken next game, there\u2019s no way back. Upon winning the final point, Barty punches the air with the mightiest backswing you\u2019ve ever seen. Super stuff. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 5-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty breaks back! Top-class tennis, coupled with bucketsful of mental fortitude, from Barty to break the Frenchwoman to love and restore parity to the third-set scoreline. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 4-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty is broken! And to love, no less. You never want to drop a service game, but least of all when the score is 4-4. Now Mladenovic will serve for the match and a 2-1 Fed Cup final lead for France. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 4-4 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty holds, and then Mladenovic follows suit after the Australian sprays her shot down the line. Down to the wire we go. A-League: 5 mins: Goal! Melbourne Victory 0-1 Wellington Phoenix Didn\u2019t take long for VAR to have its say at AAMI Park, with a handball ruled to have taken place in the Victory box leading to a penalty. Up steps Davila, the first Mexican to play in the A-League, to slot home the spot kick. Controversial! Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 3-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty breaks back! The Australian cruises to a 0-40 lead but Mladenovic has shown today she has courage in spades, winning the next two points before fluffing a cross-court shot to hand Barty the break. We\u2019re all tied up. And now I\u2019m onto my toenails. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 2-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Mladenovic, playing with renewed vigour and verve, grabs a break point and looks all over Barty, but somehow the world No.1 fights back to hold serve. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 1-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty has her chance, but she squanders a break point and it\u2019s again the Frenchwoman who displays better composure in the clinches. The Australian needs to dig deep and find something. The question is, after the year she\u2019s had, what is left? Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 1-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty has been broken! Okay, it\u2019s officially game on. Mladenovic has found another gear, now running Barty around the court and forcing errors from the world No.1. Show us what you\u2019ve got, Ash. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 1-1 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Games go to serve in the opening exchanges of the deciding set but, after holding a 40-0 lead, Mladenovic is brought back to a deuce game and has to pull out all stops to hold. Still on tennis, and things didn\u2019t pan out as planned for Alex de Minaur in Milan, reports AAP. Alex de Minaur has only lost two of his 10 matches in two editions of the Next Gen ATP Finals but unfortunately for the Australian No.1 they were both finals. On Saturday, the top seed was unable to capitalise on a stack of break-point chances as Italian teenager Jannik Sinner stormed to victory to secure his maiden ATP title. Tournament wildcard Sinner thumped winners with incredible regularity off both wings and overpowered world No.18 de Minaur 4-2, 4-1, 4-2 in one hour and four minutes, to the delight of the crowd in Milan. For the second consecutive year de Minaur rolled into the decider with a perfect 4-0 record at the season-ending tournament for top under-21 players. But again, the 20-year-old will have to be content with a runner-up finish - and $295,000 ($A430,000) in prize money - after losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas 12 months ago. De Minaur said the match against Sinner was one of missed opportunities. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty simple match to evaluate,\u201d he said. \u201cI had nine break points and I wasn\u2019t able to convert any of them.\u201d Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty races to a 15-30 lead but that\u2019s as close as she gets to Mladenovic, who holds her nerve to win the set and take the match to a decider. Whatever you\u2019ve got on for the next hour or so, cancel it. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty has been broken! After letting six break points in the match go begging, Mladenovic makes the seventh one count to take a 5-4 lead ... meaning she will be serving for the set. Oh, how this wonderful sport can spin on a dime. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-4 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The crunch game, the one Mladenovic didn\u2019t want to drop. And, after an interminably long game featuring more deuces than my Nutribullet, drop it she doesn\u2019t. Meaning Barty, whose unforced error hands Mladenovic the game, won\u2019t be serving for the match just yet. Yep, Ivymantled, stranger things have happened. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Mladenovic has a chance to arrive at another break point on Barty\u2019s serve, but she commits another unforced error and the gate slams shut. A little like looking a gift horse in the mouth, you don\u2019t ask Ashleigh Barty for two bites of the cherry. I\u2019ll be honest with you, I have no idea what either of those things mean. I mean, would the horse mind and why do you have to neck the cherry whole? If you\u2019re thirsty, drinks are on Cate Campbell tonight. Or, if you\u2019re an internet scammer, please help yourself to her personal email address: iwouldnthaveacluewhatitis@nfi.com Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 3-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty again holds to love, meaning that after saving five break points in the opening game of the second set she has won eight straight points off her serve. Kind of like me on the golf course last week. I birdied the 8th but then found the drink (twice) and the bunker (twice) before carding a 15 on the 9th. It\u2019s kind of like that, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it? Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 2-1 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The difficulties that have been besetting her service game (strange to say that seeing as she hasn\u2019t been broken today) look to be ironed out as Barty hold to love, games going to serve thus far in the second set. Nine-winners-to-five so far in Barty\u2019s favour. Terribly sad news about the death of boxer Dwight Ritchie. Goes without saying that he was taken way too soon at the tender age of 27. Our hearts and condolences go out to his family, friends and associates in the Australian boxing fraternity. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 1-0 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) What was that about pressure? Mladenovic had Barty squarely and fairly on the ropes in this opening game of the second set, but Barty holds serve after the Frenchwoman squandered five break points. Sacr\u00e9 bleu! Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The Frenchwoman serves for the game but a backhand error takes it to deuce, and well, that was as good as game over for Mladenovic. The pressure, or perceived pressure, that Barty places on her opponents must be enormous, and the world No.1 promptly closes out the set in Australia\u2019s favour. Would you Adam\u2019n\u2019Eve it, they\u2019re actually playing in rain-soaked Auckland? They must love their cricket over there. Click below to see what\u2019s going on in this 11-overs-a-side slog-fest. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 5-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Again, not the most convincing of service games from Barty but she holds nonetheless, meaning games have gone to serve since the world No.1 broke Mladenovic in the second game of the set. Most stats (apart from the score) say this is a fairly close encounter. This from our wonderfully accommodating partners at Australian Associated Press: Socceroos legend Harry Kewell has been linked with the vacant manager\u2019s position at Scottish Premiership club Hibernian. Kewell was spotted in the crowd as Hibs accoutned for St Johnstone 4-1 t McDiarmid Park on Saturday. The 41-year-old refused to deny he was interested in the Hibernian role outside the ground. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fantastic club,\u201d Kewell told Sky Sports Scotland. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of clubs up for new managers and all that and obviously being out of work you\u2019re always speculated and all that. I\u2019m just here to enjoy the game.\u201d Kewell has been out of work since he was axed by English club Notts County in November last year but has repeatedly stated he wants to pursue a coaching career. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 4-1 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The Frenchwoman does much better in Barty\u2019s third service game, taking the world No.1 to deuce, but the Australian closes out the game easily to take a commanding lead in the opening set. Ripper of a piece here from Clare Watson about a topic that is still something of a taboo in elite women\u2019s sport - breast injury. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 2-0 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty holds her serve without much fuss in the opening game before breaking Mladenovic at the first opportunity. With the final scores tied at 1-1, this is the ideal beginning for Australia ... and entirely what one has come to expect of the world No.1. The giant-slaying Perth Scorchers have made it two wins from as many WBBL games in their weekend double-header after upsetting Sydney Thunder by seven runs. After surviving a last-ball thriller against the second-placed Adelaide Strikers on Saturday, the Scorchers held their nerve to down the top-placed Thunder on Sunday at Karen Rolton Oval. All-rounder Heather Graham was the star with bat and ball. After thumping two sixes in her undefeated 33 off 20 balls to lift the Scorchers to 5-151, player-of-the-match Graham snared 3-22 off four overs, her batting and bowling in the clutch crucial in each innings. * * Thanks, AAP Good afternoon, sports fans. How\u2019s your Sunday treating you? I spent my morning sleeping in until 8am (with kids, that is a lie-in), walking the dog and catching the train to Guardian Towers. Now that I\u2019m safely ensconced at my workstation, I\u2019m looking forward to what should be, and already is, a tasty afternoon of sport. The WBBL is already under way, the sooner the Fed Cup final resumes the better (go Ashleigh!), the final T20 between New Zealand and England in rainy Auckland is trying to get off the ground, plus there will no doubt be more VAR drama in today\u2019s two A-League games. Let\u2019s get the (Barty) party started, shall we?",

If polls are to be believed, the party\u2019s strategy \u2013 less dog whistle and more canine klaxon \u2013 seems to be paying off.

But for many, the attacks on unaccompanied migrant children are repellent at best and dangerous at worst. Emilio Delgado, a member of the Madrid regional parliament for the leftwing M\u00e1s Madrid party, points out that the Hortaleza centre is desperately overcrowded and under-resourced.</p> <p>\u201cThe kids there are fighting over who gets a mattress so they don\u2019t have to sleep on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s happening in a public facility run by the richest regional government in Spain. There are 70 or 80 or 100 kids there when there should only be 30 or 40. That obviously brews conflict between the kids themselves and for staff and neighbours.\u201d</p> <p>The centre\u2019s residents have also been attacked twice in a fortnight by people armed with oars and clubs.</p> <p>Delgado acknowledges that some of the young people cause problems in the neighbourhood but said he was disgusted by Abascal\u2019s words. \u201cI get along fine with politicians with whom I disagree on a lot of things, but it\u2019s really hard to do that with Vox when they\u2019re painting targets on the chests of very vulnerable boys and girls,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re crossing all the red lines, and the PP and Citizens are along for the ride.\u201d</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Miguel Arag\u00f3n, who has been working with homeless young people in Hortaleza for 30 years as part of the Olivar association, also admits there is a problem.

      "bodyText": "Santiago Abascal\u2019s least favourite neighbours sit \u2013 young and bored \u2013 on benches outside their temporary home, their coats zipped up against the cold of a Madrid November. On the other side of the fence, beneath the plane trees, the people of Hortaleza go about their business, pushing buggies, walking dogs and casting the occasional glance at the reception centre for menas, or unaccompanied foreign minors. If the centre has long been infamous locally, it acquired national notoriety last week when Abascal, leader of Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party, singled it out in a TV debate before Sunday\u2019s general election. \u201cI live in a working-class Madrid neighbourhood \u2013 Hortaleza,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every time I\u2019m on the street \u2013 and there\u2019s a menas centre there \u2013 I run into women who come and tell me that the police tell them not to wear their jewellery on the street; and mothers who are worried that their daughters are coming home late and are scared of being assaulted.\u201d Neither Vox\u2019s messaging nor its targets have been hard to make out in the last days of the campaign. In Monday\u2019s debate, Abascal falsely suggested that 70% of gang rapes in Spain were committed by foreigners. Earlier the same day, Roc\u00edo Monasterio, Vox\u2019s leader in Madrid, descended on the gates of another centre for unaccompanied minors, in Seville, arguing that menas made the streets unsafe and posed \u201ca serious problem in our neighbourhoods\u201d. Monasterio\u2019s husband, Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros, a Vox spokesman, joined in the following day, claiming that foreigners were three times more likely to commit rape than Spaniards. If polls are to be believed, the party\u2019s strategy \u2013 less dog whistle and more canine klaxon \u2013 seems to be paying off. Vox\u2019s defence of what it sees as traditional Spanish values, bolstered by its uncompromising stance on Catalan independence, puts it in a position to finish third in Spain\u2019s fourth general election in as many years. Not bad for a party that won its first seats in congress less than seven months ago. Even more notable has been its effect on its rightwing rivals, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party. Both shifted further right before April\u2019s election, hoping to compete with Vox, and both have enlisted the support of Abascal\u2019s grouping to win power in Andaluc\u00eda and Madrid. The new triple-right \u2013 unaffectionately known by some as the trifachito (facha being slang for fascist) \u2013 has filled the political space that used to be the sole territory of the PP. A recent cover of the satirical magazine El Jueves showed Vox, the PP and Citizens emerging from General Franco\u2019s grave in the Valley of the Fallen, with the PP leader Pablo Casado crying: \u201cHa ha! We are the true remains of Franco!\u201d Abascal appeared to acknowledge the party\u2019s inspiration during the debate, when he paraphrased the fascist philosopher Ramiro Ledesma Ramos, saying: \u201cOnly the rich can permit themselves the luxury of not having a homeland.\u201d The party went on to address the question of homelands within Spain on Thursday. In a symbolic proposal backed by Citizens and the PP in Madrid\u2019s regional parliament, Vox called for a ban \u201cof separatist parties that threaten the unity of Spain\u201d. Vox also has a blacklist of media outlets it views as critical and bans them from its offices and events. They include the newspaper El Pa\u00eds, radio network Cadena Ser and the online newspaper Eldiario.es. The acting prime minister and socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez, was not slow to acknowledge the parallels with the past. \u201cFixing on homosexuals, blaming women for gender-based violence, suggesting a ban on political parties \u2013 all that has a name that doesn\u2019t need to be spelt out,\u201d he said. Like most rightwing populist parties, Vox delights in provoking outrage by spewing provocative messages regardless of their veracity. But for many, the attacks on unaccompanied migrant children are repellent at best and dangerous at worst. Emilio Delgado, a member of the Madrid regional parliament for the leftwing M\u00e1s Madrid party, points out that the Hortaleza centre is desperately overcrowded and under-resourced. \u201cThe kids there are fighting over who gets a mattress so they don\u2019t have to sleep on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s happening in a public facility run by the richest regional government in Spain. There are 70 or 80 or 100 kids there when there should only be 30 or 40. That obviously brews conflict between the kids themselves and for staff and neighbours.\u201d The centre\u2019s residents have also been attacked twice in a fortnight by people armed with oars and clubs. Delgado acknowledges that some of the young people cause problems in the neighbourhood but said he was disgusted by Abascal\u2019s words. \u201cI get along fine with politicians with whom I disagree on a lot of things, but it\u2019s really hard to do that with Vox when they\u2019re painting targets on the chests of very vulnerable boys and girls,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re crossing all the red lines, and the PP and Citizens are along for the ride.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Arag\u00f3n, who has been working with homeless young people in Hortaleza for 30 years as part of the Olivar association, also admits there is a problem. Four years ago, his mother had a necklace torn from her throat in the area. But he argues that the current thefts and robberies are nothing compared with the \u201cheroin years\u201d of the 1970s and 1980s when drug disputes in Hortaleza were settled with knives and pistols. \u201cThis is a problem that\u2019s been going on for quite a few years,\u201d he said. With the centre overwhelmed, some young people had taken to sleeping on the streets to avoid the conflicts and overcrowding, while others escaped by sniffing glue. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of care: lots of these kids are cold and hungry and have been on the streets for hours.\u201d After the economic crisis, and with the rise of Vox, Arag\u00f3n said, old xenophobic narratives had begun to resurface. And some agendas, he added, were better served by demonising people and focusing on problems rather than accepting responsibility.\u201cThere are people in this neighbourhood who are helping, by giving boxing lessons and organising football matches,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people doing all that but other people are interested in telling a different story. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about here is adolescent kids who are bored, alone and have no future. That normally means things are going to happen. It would be odd if they didn\u2019t.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The seemingly never-ending trade dispute between China and the US often seems like a game of snakes and ladders. Last week China signaled a breakthrough on a quarrel that has roiled economies around the world \u2013 only for the Trump administration to issue a denial. The sticking point, for some, appears to be the US opioid crisis. America is in the grip of its worst drugs crisis in a generation. About 130 people die each day in the US from opioid-related overdoses and many \u2013 including Donald Trump \u2013 blame imports of cheap drugs from China. Beijing\u2019s acknowledgment of the issue\u2019s importance to the US came on Thursday when China\u2019s National Narcotics Control Commission held a press conference about a fentanyl smuggling case cracked in a joint operation between US and Chinese authorities. The trial, which culminated in three Chinese nationals being sentenced to maximum punishments for smuggling fentanyl to the US and six others sentenced for up to two years, is one of China\u2019s highest-profile cases aimed at curbing the illicit flow of opioids. Chinese-produced fentanyl or Chinese-produced ingredients for the drug have been repeatedly blamed by Trump for the soaring number of US opioid-related deaths. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 28,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths were recorded in 2017 alone, and fentanyl-laced pills have been blamed for several high-profile deaths, including the musicians Prince and Tom Petty. The emergence of fentanyl as an underlying reason for trade tensions is not new, say observers of the on-again, off-again negotiations, but it has gained importance as a political issue as Trump heads into an election year. \u201cFentanyl matters a lot in US politics, because it could be politically devastating among suburban housewives in swing states if fentanyl-related deaths are blamed on Trump\u2019s political inaction on the issue,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a scholar with the pro-market American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe administration knows they have to neutralize fentanyl as a political issue to make a deal with China, and the Chinese have figured out they have to cooperate on this if they want a deal with the US,\u201d Scissors said. \u201cThere has to be progress or a deal can\u2019t hold together.\u201d US pressure on China to crack down on fentanyl first emerged in trade negotiations in November 2017 when Trump warned the Chinese leader Xi Jinping, on a trip to Beijing, that he would make stopping the \u201cflood of cheap and deadly\u201d fentanyl \u201cmanufactured in China\u201d a \u201ctop priority\u201d. \u201cA special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomenon \u2013 fentanyl \u2013 destroying lives by the millions. We\u2019re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the president and myself,\u201d Trump said at the time. But it was not until the G20 summit of world leaders in Buenos Aires last year, where Trump pressed Xi on the issue at a steak dinner that capped the conference, that China agreed to list fentanyl and its derivatives as a controlled substance, according to CNN. That move came after the White House reportedly sent a copy to Xi of a Los Angeles Times article headlined \u201cFentanyl smuggled from China is killing thousands of Americans\u201d with \u201cyou have to help us with this\u201d scribbled on it. In August, Trump again accused Xi of failing to crack down on the flow of Chinese-produced fentanyl. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, China is responsible for the precursor chemicals for fentanyl, while most of the production is now through Mexico, a marked shift from recent years when shipments went largely unchecked from China to the US. In congressional testimony last year, the DEA deputy chief, Paul Knierim, described China as \u201cone of the world\u2019s top producers of the precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine and fentanyl, as well as the chemicals used to process heroin and cocaine. \u201cCombating illicit fentanyl is a top priority of this administration,\u201d Knierim said, welcoming \u201cpositive actions being taken by the Chinese government over the last year. Their actions are steps in the right direction, but more can be done.\u201d While US opioid-related deaths, estimated at 400,000 since 2000, appear to have peaked, China\u2019s agreement to put controls on all fentanyl substances came only after years of bilateral dialog, according to the DEA. \u201cIt is a very significant step for them and we appreciate China\u2019s efforts,\u201d a DEA spokeswoman, Katherine Pfaff, told the Guardian. But the effectiveness of China\u2019s crackdown is unclear. \u201cBased on past actions, whenever China has put controls into place we have seen a difference in what is coming into the US from China, or sourced from China,\u201d Pfaff added. While the smuggling trial, which was broadcast on television, is widely held to be a signal that China is prepared to go some way to meet Trump\u2019s demands, Beijing maintains it is not responsible for the fentanyl aspect of the US opioid epidemic. In the past, Beijing has described the US holding China responsible for fentanyl production as political \u201cfantasy\u201d. That position was repeated on Thursday when Yu Haibing, deputy secretary general of the China National Narcotics Control Commission, said: \u201cChina\u2019s control of fentanyl has become more strict, but the number of deaths in the US from fentanyl have risen. This shows that China is not the source of the problem,\u201c said Yu, reported Bloomberg. Still, the trial was heralded as an important step by US authorities. \u201cAs the success of the joint investigation demonstrates, Chinese and American investigators have the capacity to collaborate across international borders,\u201d said Austin Moore, an attache with the Department of Homeland Security in Beijing, said at a briefing.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of pounds of UK taxpayers\u2019 money has been spent on equipping badger cull marksmen and women with tracking devices so that their movements could be mapped by co-ordinators and police. Anti-cull activists have criticised the expense, arguing that the cost of the cull should be met by farmers rather than the public purse. The tracking devices were intended to keep the shooters safe during this autumn\u2019s cull. But it has emerged that saboteurs were able to use a security flaw in the devices to locate shooters and disrupt their activities. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) revealed that more than \u00a3300,000 has been spent on the tracking devices. Defra accepted that farmers were expected to fund the cost of the cull but said that on the advice of the police in order to keep shooters safe it had bought the devices. In 2017, it emerged that almost \u00a3500,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money went on buying radios to link shooters with police in remote areas where there is little mobile phone coverage. Then, too, saboteurs turned the tables by investing in equipment that enabled them to trace the signals produced by the radios, pinpointing the position of marksmen and giving activists the chance to disrupt the shooting. Jay Tiernan, of Stop the Cull, said: \u201cOnce again we have found clear evidence that the killing of badgers which the government told us would be paid for by farmers, is in fact paid for by the British taxpayer. \u201cTracking devices that are used by the shooters so that their movements can be coordinated by a central ops room are supposed to be paid for by farmers not coming out of an already overburdened public purse. \u201cAs in previous years, the devices chosen by experts have once again shown to have serious security flaws and have made life much easier for activists to find and neutralise any shooting efforts.\u201d In September, it emerged that ministers had approved 11 new areas for culling, taking the total up to 43 with up to 64,000 animals likely to be killed. Badger culling has been the mainstay of the government\u2019s attempt to tackle bovine TB since 2011, with a system of licensed shooting introduced in Gloucestershire and Somerset two years later. Meanwhile, a man who ran a field sports business in Cornwall has been given a suspended jail sentence after the carcasses of 28 badgers were found in freezers on his home and at an industrial unit in July. Scott Milne, 42, from Bodmin, admitted killing the badgers outside the time of the authorised cull and passing them off as animals legally shot during the permitted period. Defending Milne at Bodmin magistrates, Michael Green said: \u201cThis is an unusual case in many ways. He felt a pressure to meet badger cull targets to keep his licence, which contributed to him making the stupid decision to shoot badgers outside the cull period.\u201d Sentencing Milne, the chairman of the magistrates\u2019 bench told him: \u201cAlthough you were licensed to cull badgers these actions were done entirely outside of any licence period.\u201d Milne received an 18-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months.

Breathless investor reports about wearables focus mostly on the popularity of headphones and earbuds. The number of smart watches sold worldwide in 2018 was 45 million, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/27/apple-watch-sales-2018/\" title=\"\">a tiny number</a> compared with the 1.43 billion smartphones sold in the same year.

I remember once I called my sister on a Sunday night when I was walking round the sofa getting steps. She said, \u2018you know Meital is walking round the sofa to beat you this week\u2019? But I was ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis admits he scaled things back two years ago, when he was doing well over 25,000 steps a day. \u201cIt was controlling my life too much. I would say, \u2018well, we can\u2019t go out there because I won\u2019t get my steps in\u2019.

      "body": "<p>Whatever I think about my son\u2019s variable affections for me, it makes me feel better that he can at least be demonstrably rude to other people, too. This reflection has been prompted by his reactions to being handed around. Like all parents, we began being quite careful about who we handed him to, but now we do it just for somewhere to put him. Were it socially acceptable, we\u2019d probably rest him on the bonnet of an idling taxi if it gave us a second to grab our wallets. But, although he spent the first nine months of his life unmoved by anything less eventful than a building collapse, he\u2019s now more discerning about who holds him, not to mention heavier, squirmier and more of a handful in every sense.</p> <p>\u2018Oh, right, wow,\u2019 people say as they hold him, wincing as if we\u2019ve handed them a lorry engine. \u2018Unnngh. Yep. He\u2019s, er, really grown.\u2019 It\u2019s not that he\u2019s particularly big for a toddler, of course, it\u2019s just that since he\u2019s not walking yet and has very fair hair, he\u2019s something of an optical illusion; a child who bears the essence of being a baby, but without their pleasingly compact size. We try to think of it as an upgrade on the usual baby package, a little bit of extra baby for our money, the maxi-baby plan, perhaps, or Baby+. Having a toddler who can\u2019t, well, toddle, is not without its challenges. I worry that our friends have started to dread visiting us, the way I would if every time I went round to their house I was expected to lift <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2019/aug/08/gregg-wallace-and-paul-hollywood-your-tv-chef-midlife-crisis-roundup\" title=\"\">Gregg Wallace</a> out of a high chair.</p> <p>Then there are his moods. Though ordinarily a very even-natured child, he\u2019s getting a bit of an attitude, so roughly one in five times he meets someone, he\u2019ll either start crying or just slap them in the face. \u2018Oh,\u2019 my wife will say, aghast, \u2018he\u2019s just tired.\u2019 I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m similarly courteous, but I\u2019ve been known to rub it in. \u2018That\u2019s so weird,\u2019 I\u2019ll say. \u2018I mean, seriously, this kid likes <em>everyone.</em>\u2019 There are probably some reasons not to use my infant son as an emotional cudgel with which to beat my enemies, but I can\u2019t recall any right now.</p> <p>Fortunately, I don\u2019t spend much time with people I hate but, unfortunately, this means the occasions when he does this to a deserving recipient are infrequent, so I usually find myself resenting his pleasantness to some guy I hated from four jobs ago. \u2018Seriously?

      "bodyText": "Whatever I think about my son\u2019s variable affections for me, it makes me feel better that he can at least be demonstrably rude to other people, too. This reflection has been prompted by his reactions to being handed around. Like all parents, we began being quite careful about who we handed him to, but now we do it just for somewhere to put him. Were it socially acceptable, we\u2019d probably rest him on the bonnet of an idling taxi if it gave us a second to grab our wallets. But, although he spent the first nine months of his life unmoved by anything less eventful than a building collapse, he\u2019s now more discerning about who holds him, not to mention heavier, squirmier and more of a handful in every sense. \u2018Oh, right, wow,\u2019 people say as they hold him, wincing as if we\u2019ve handed them a lorry engine. \u2018Unnngh. Yep. He\u2019s, er, really grown.\u2019 It\u2019s not that he\u2019s particularly big for a toddler, of course, it\u2019s just that since he\u2019s not walking yet and has very fair hair, he\u2019s something of an optical illusion; a child who bears the essence of being a baby, but without their pleasingly compact size. We try to think of it as an upgrade on the usual baby package, a little bit of extra baby for our money, the maxi-baby plan, perhaps, or Baby+. Having a toddler who can\u2019t, well, toddle, is not without its challenges. I worry that our friends have started to dread visiting us, the way I would if every time I went round to their house I was expected to lift Gregg Wallace out of a high chair. Then there are his moods. Though ordinarily a very even-natured child, he\u2019s getting a bit of an attitude, so roughly one in five times he meets someone, he\u2019ll either start crying or just slap them in the face. \u2018Oh,\u2019 my wife will say, aghast, \u2018he\u2019s just tired.\u2019 I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m similarly courteous, but I\u2019ve been known to rub it in. \u2018That\u2019s so weird,\u2019 I\u2019ll say. \u2018I mean, seriously, this kid likes everyone.\u2019 There are probably some reasons not to use my infant son as an emotional cudgel with which to beat my enemies, but I can\u2019t recall any right now. Fortunately, I don\u2019t spend much time with people I hate but, unfortunately, this means the occasions when he does this to a deserving recipient are infrequent, so I usually find myself resenting his pleasantness to some guy I hated from four jobs ago. \u2018Seriously? You like this turd?\u2019 I say to myself, telepathically willing him to be sick on their tie. And then he\u2019s often unkind to a child with whom we\u2019re forcing him to bond. This new independence is good, but it\u2019s sad that our former inducements just don\u2019t take any more.

Thirty years on, I know people who were there and whose eyes fill with tears when they try to talk about it. Seamus Heaney understood how the \u201cmoment of rhyme\u201d, when the right thing suddenly and unexpectedly and enormously happens, can last for a lifetime. The unrepeatable shock of recognition.</p> <p>I have always liked the story of the English girl who flew to Berlin one winter evening to see her German lover. He lived in Kreuzberg, in the west part of the city but near the wall. After a happy night and day, she said: \u201cAren\u2019t you starving? I must go out and find us something to eat.\u201d It was late and dark. But she was back in a few minutes, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s weird. The street\u2019s full of shabby people all laughing and eating bananas.\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d said her man. \u201cOh, my God! I know what\u2019s happened\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Some voices, print and broadcast, have started talking about how the wall was overthrown by a popular rising. They use the pictures from the next days and nights, as delirious young men and women took pickaxes and hammers to the wall while the guards looked on. But it wasn\u2019t quite like that. It was Heaney\u2019s \u201clonged-for tidal wave\u201d, brimming up, overflowing obstacles and sea-walls, seeping into steel-hard party minds and turning them to waterlogged bundles of uncertainty.</p> <p>When the government spokesman G\u00fcnter Schabowski gave his idiotic press conference that day, mumbling to the foreign correspondents that new orders sort of meant that new crossing-points from the German Democratic Republic were probably sort of open, he was already afloat in that wave. Everything was disintegrating around him. Who\u2019s in charge? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s up to me now. But the labels were washing off all the tins. There had indeed been a popular rising, but earlier and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of people had defied the state with weekly protest <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_demonstrations_in_East_Germany\" title=\"\">marches </a>through the main streets of Leipzig. \u201cWe are the people!\u201d The state\u2019s armed forces turned out. Once, they would have obeyed the order to open fire. This time, they didn\u2019t. Somebody decided not to give the order. Soon, millions were gathering in Berlin, talking about free speech, free elections, punishment for criminal tyrants. Some had begun to chant: \u201cWe are one people!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6bd72c299adc9cce0d55aa2966d52be2a49f4cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6bd72c299adc9cce0d55aa2966d52be2a49f4cb/3_288_3709_2225/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators form a human chain in Leipzig in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators form a human chain in Leipzig, then part of East Germany, in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus / Tar / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tide was European. Long before the wall opened, the Soviet empire had begun to liquefy. In Poland that June, the Communist party had been defeated in almost-free elections and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/tadeusz-mazowiecki\" title=\"\">a gentle Catholic intellectual </a>had become prime minister. In August, the peoples of the Baltic republics formed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/protest-berlinwall\" title=\"\">human chain from Vilnius to Tallinn</a>, calling for independence. The astute Communist leadership in Hungary had seen what was coming and \u2013 for a time \u2013 hijacked the movement for change; they surfed the rising tide in a hasty ark built to carry liberal dissidents as well as repentant Stalinists.</p> <p>But the moon that dragged the tide forward was Mikhail Sergeyevich <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mikhail-gorbachev\" title=\"\">Gorbachev</a>. \u201cLife itself teaches,\u201d he loved to say. Life was teaching him that the gigantic Soviet presence in eastern Europe, military and political, was nothing but an obstacle to his plans to end the arms race and reform the Soviet Union. Life itself, on the other hand, seemed to be teaching some Communist leaders absolutely nothing.</p> <p>What creeps they were, Gorbachev plainly thought: Erich Honecker, General <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/general-wojciech-jaruzelski\" title=\"\">Jaruzelski</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,12269,1092153,00.html\" title=\"\">Milo\u0161 Jake\u0161</a>\u2026 ? By making it clear that the Soviet Union would no longer rescue them if they got into trouble, he doomed them to open their societies or perish. Some did both, drowned by reforms they had permitted. Others, like the Czech and East German leaderships, merely perished.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d98628551b7219f3c99ff388f24fad0f6fa8152c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d98628551b7219f3c99ff388f24fad0f6fa8152c/1156_965_1534_920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikhail Gorbachev and Angela Merkel join a crowd commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall on the Berlin Wall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikhail Gorbachev, centre, and Angela Merkel join the commemorations on the 20th anniversary of the fall on the Berlin Wall on 9 November 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Herbert Knosowski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the wall went up in August 1961, the western allies \u2013 the US, Britain and France \u2013 were hotly criticised for doing nothing to knock it down. In reality, they were vastly relieved. The sheer cruelty of the wall, dividing families and holding a population captive, made excellent propaganda. But, more importantly, the west\u2019s nightmare had been that flight through the open Berlin frontier would lead to the collapse of the East German state. Then the West Germans would try to intervene, which would draw in Soviet armed forces, then Nato\u2026 then Armageddon. When the East Germans odiously boasted that their \u201cantifascist defence wall\u201d was preserving the peace of Europe, western diplomats \u2013 deep in their souls \u2013 didn\u2019t entirely disagree.</p> <p>Nobody likes to remember that. In the same way, nobody likes the suggestion that within the cold war there was a cold civil war \u2013 between the two nations. The Berlin Wall only helped the slow alienation of one Germany from the other. The easterners (<em>Ossis</em>) longed to travel to the west but, after 40 years under a different social system, had only a diminishing wish to live there. West Germans grew increasingly ignorant and patronising about the east. It was as if two nations were emerging: twins, but not identical twins.</p> <p>Unification in 1990 only intensified the \u201ccold civil war\u201d parallel. It recalled \u2013 eerily \u2013 the \u201creconstruction\u201d period after the American civil war: the West German \u201cvictors\u201d took over and exploited the \u201closers\u201d until it felt more like an annexation than a reunification. The whole economy and social structure were purged and pillaged. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-5449,00.html\" title=\"\">Carpetbaggers</a>\u201d crowded in from Hamburg and Frankfurt to loot the closing factories and public utilities of East Germany, decayed and unsustainable as they were. Even the local trade unions were now staffed by bright young things flown in from the DGB, West Germany\u2019s union confederation.</p> <p>I remember travelling about Mecklenburg in those months. Big Audi and BMW saloons rushed past on the potholed roads, carrying pink-cheeked young men and women on their way to shut down another power station. Silently watching in the rain stood men and women holding their bicycles \u2013 people who until a few weeks ago had been in secure work.</p> <p>Is it any wonder that, like the American south, the German east has settled into sullen alienation? Extreme rightwing politics flourish. There\u2019s a sense of a lost social culture, which was certainly founded on lies and a police state but offered a sort of identity. What remains is resentment, a sense of disrespected difference, a deeply conservative worldview. Willy Brandt, when mayor of West Berlin, said that walls might come down but walls in the mind took much longer to demolish.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Neal Ascherson reported on the events of 1989 for </em><em>the </em>Observer</p>",

But she was back in a few minutes, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s weird. The street\u2019s full of shabby people all laughing and eating bananas.\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d said her man. \u201cOh, my God! I know what\u2019s happened\u2026\u201d Some voices, print and broadcast, have started talking about how the wall was overthrown by a popular rising. They use the pictures from the next days and nights, as delirious young men and women took pickaxes and hammers to the wall while the guards looked on. But it wasn\u2019t quite like that. It was Heaney\u2019s \u201clonged-for tidal wave\u201d, brimming up, overflowing obstacles and sea-walls, seeping into steel-hard party minds and turning them to waterlogged bundles of uncertainty. When the government spokesman G\u00fcnter Schabowski gave his idiotic press conference that day, mumbling to the foreign correspondents that new orders sort of meant that new crossing-points from the German Democratic Republic were probably sort of open, he was already afloat in that wave. Everything was disintegrating around him. Who\u2019s in charge? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s up to me now. But the labels were washing off all the tins. There had indeed been a popular rising, but earlier and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of people had defied the state with weekly protest marches through the main streets of Leipzig. \u201cWe are the people!\u201d The state\u2019s armed forces turned out. Once, they would have obeyed the order to open fire. This time, they didn\u2019t. Somebody decided not to give the order. Soon, millions were gathering in Berlin, talking about free speech, free elections, punishment for criminal tyrants. Some had begun to chant: \u201cWe are one people!\u201d The tide was European. Long before the wall opened, the Soviet empire had begun to liquefy. In Poland that June, the Communist party had been defeated in almost-free elections and a gentle Catholic intellectual had become prime minister. In August, the peoples of the Baltic republics formed a human chain from Vilnius to Tallinn, calling for independence. The astute Communist leadership in Hungary had seen what was coming and \u2013 for a time \u2013 hijacked the movement for change; they surfed the rising tide in a hasty ark built to carry liberal dissidents as well as repentant Stalinists. But the moon that dragged the tide forward was Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev. \u201cLife itself teaches,\u201d he loved to say. Life was teaching him that the gigantic Soviet presence in eastern Europe, military and political, was nothing but an obstacle to his plans to end the arms race and reform the Soviet Union. Life itself, on the other hand, seemed to be teaching some Communist leaders absolutely nothing. What creeps they were, Gorbachev plainly thought: Erich Honecker, General Jaruzelski, Milo\u0161 Jake\u0161\u2026 ? By making it clear that the Soviet Union would no longer rescue them if they got into trouble, he doomed them to open their societies or perish. Some did both, drowned by reforms they had permitted. Others, like the Czech and East German leaderships, merely perished. When the wall went up in August 1961, the western allies \u2013 the US, Britain and France \u2013 were hotly criticised for doing nothing to knock it down. In reality, they were vastly relieved. The sheer cruelty of the wall, dividing families and holding a population captive, made excellent propaganda. But, more importantly, the west\u2019s nightmare had been that flight through the open Berlin frontier would lead to the collapse of the East German state. Then the West Germans would try to intervene, which would draw in Soviet armed forces, then Nato\u2026 then Armageddon. When the East Germans odiously boasted that their \u201cantifascist defence wall\u201d was preserving the peace of Europe, western diplomats \u2013 deep in their souls \u2013 didn\u2019t entirely disagree. Nobody likes to remember that. In the same way, nobody likes the suggestion that within the cold war there was a cold civil war \u2013 between the two nations. The Berlin Wall only helped the slow alienation of one Germany from the other. The easterners (Ossis) longed to travel to the west but, after 40 years under a different social system, had only a diminishing wish to live there. West Germans grew increasingly ignorant and patronising about the east. It was as if two nations were emerging: twins, but not identical twins. Unification in 1990 only intensified the \u201ccold civil war\u201d parallel. It recalled \u2013 eerily \u2013 the \u201creconstruction\u201d period after the American civil war: the West German \u201cvictors\u201d took over and exploited the \u201closers\u201d until it felt more like an annexation than a reunification. The whole economy and social structure were purged and pillaged. \u201cCarpetbaggers\u201d crowded in from Hamburg and Frankfurt to loot the closing factories and public utilities of East Germany, decayed and unsustainable as they were. Even the local trade unions were now staffed by bright young things flown in from the DGB, West Germany\u2019s union confederation. I remember travelling about Mecklenburg in those months. Big Audi and BMW saloons rushed past on the potholed roads, carrying pink-cheeked young men and women on their way to shut down another power station. Silently watching in the rain stood men and women holding their bicycles \u2013 people who until a few weeks ago had been in secure work. Is it any wonder that, like the American south, the German east has settled into sullen alienation? Extreme rightwing politics flourish. There\u2019s a sense of a lost social culture, which was certainly founded on lies and a police state but offered a sort of identity. What remains is resentment, a sense of disrespected difference, a deeply conservative worldview. Willy Brandt, when mayor of West Berlin, said that walls might come down but walls in the mind took much longer to demolish. \u2022 Neal Ascherson reported on the events of 1989 for the Observer",

We\u2019re talking Viktor Orb\u00e1n-style politics at that point. But Milan will stay as it is. There\u2019s too much money here for that not to be the case. And then we will be even more different from the rest of Italy. But that\u2019s fine by me. Better that way, in fact.\u201d</p> <p>Dialuce is a thirtysomething financial consultant with one of the myriad multinational organisations that have made Milan a service hub for international capital. He grew up in Rome, but came north 13 years ago to read economics at the famous Bocconi University. For a while he worked for Barclays bank and then had a few brief spells abroad. Now he intends to stay in Italy\u2019s richest, most cosmopolitan city.</p> <p>\u201cThis place has changed enormously in recent years. It\u2019s much more international,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much investment and there\u2019s so much culture going on. Stuff that you won\u2019t find in the rest of Italy. The \u2018Milanese\u2019 don\u2019t exist anymore. Milan is made up of the professionals who have come here because there are opportunities that don\u2019t exist back home. They\u2019re the best of Italy. It\u2019s a kind of natural selection that goes on, creating a community which is much more European, open and tolerant in its mindset. Milan is not Italy.\u201d</p> <p>Dialuce\u2019s confidence is borne out by <a href=\"https://www.eumetramr.com/it/il-%C2%ABmodello-milano%C2%BB\" title=\"\">a poll carried out last year</a> which found that 85% of residents would not wish to live anywhere else, while 81% believed that their city should be seen as an economic role model to emulate.

It\u2019s become fashionable as well as rich. In 2020, the city will host the World Cities Culture Summit. In 2026, the Winter Olympics will be based here, shared with the Alpine town of Cortina. Unprecedented levels of foreign investment are driving new developments across the city. Over 40 major construction projects worth $21bn will be undertaken over the next 15 years. The left-of-centre mayor, Giuseppe Sala, has presided over a 50% rise in tourism based on aggressive promotion of the city\u2019s cultural assets, from the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci to the attractions of the city\u2019s thriving LGBT quarter in Porta Venezia. </p> <p>Only the city\u2019s two football teams, Internazionale and AC Milan, have failed to keep up with the city\u2019s pace of growth and development, though Inter, now under Chinese ownership, lie a respectable second in the national championship. And the more the money flows in, the more ambitious and talented young Italians arrive, and the more foreign investors bet on the future. Across the city monuments to prosperity have sprung up such as Zaha Hadid\u2019s \u201ctwisting tower\u201d, which overlooks a park and gated communities of luxury condominiums designed by Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Welcome to Milan, a truly global city. But, as elsewhere in Europe, this metropolitan success story is coming at a high price.</p> <p>Last May the Centre for European Reform, a Brussels-based thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.cer.eu/publications/archive/policy-brief/2019/big-european-sort-diverging-fortunes-europes-regions\" title=\"\">published a paper</a> entitled <em>The </em><em>Big European Sort? The diverging fortunes of Europe\u2019s regions</em>. The \u201csort\u201d refers to a sifting process that is steadily transforming the demography of EU member states, and driving the polarisation that increasingly defines politics in Europe and beyond.</p> <p>The post-industrial city, say the study\u2019s authors, is a success story based on the clustering of high-end services in the great metropolises. \u201cIn the 1980s and 90s,\u201d they write, \u201cindustrial heartlands such as the Ruhr in Germany suffered from relative \u2013 and in some cases absolute \u2013 decline in industrial output. The largest cities \u2013 often capitals such as Paris or London \u2013 were able to replace a declining industrial production with high-value services.\u201d</p> <p>By the 21st century, these reinvented metropolises needed a new kind of population, which was \u201cyounger, more highly educated and richer than Europeans who live in less successful cities and towns,\u201d the report says. \u201cLess successful places are losing people, especially in countries with ageing demographics.\u201d</p> <p>The consequence, the report concludes, is a damaging divide between ageing towns and rural areas and the great cities. \u201cThe political effects of regional sorting are predictable: frustration at relative economic decline in poorer regions, a sense of loss of community as younger people leave, and grievance about metropolitan \u2018elites\u2019 running the country for their own benefit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7cae09d7c03c65b9f1567f1b56b516586e6d441\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7cae09d7c03c65b9f1567f1b56b516586e6d441/0_446_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Across Europe, less successful towns with ageing demographics are in decline.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Across Europe, less successful towns with ageing demographics are in decline.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These themes have also preoccupied thinkers such as Christophe Guilluy and Guillaume Faburel in France. Both are geographers, reflecting the new reality that the politics of place is becoming as important as class, race and gender in understanding the signs of turbulent times.</p> <p>Guilluy, the author of <em>La France p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique</em>, is a trenchant critic of what he describes as 21st century \u201ccitadels\u201d, which have become the \u201cshop window of happy globalisation\u201d. Superstar cities, he argues, are the preserve of an inner-city elite, whose everyday needs are catered for by a low-paid precariat, living on the peripheries of the urban sprawl. \u201cThe traditional working classes no longer live where the good jobs and wealth are created,\u201d says Guilluy.</p> <p>Having grown up in Milan, Prof Roberto Camagni has watched it boom in recent years with a mixture of admiration and trepidation. Camagni is a professor of urban economics at the Politecnico di Milano. \u201cI thought it would peak, but it keeps on going,\u201d he says. He has calculated that between 2000 and 2016, Milan increased its share of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product by an astonishing 17.7%. Only four other cities registered increases, and the next highest was Rome at 4.4%. Everywhere else lost out as the country\u2019s economy flatlined.</p> <p>\u201cIt was big cities like Milan, not nation states, which benefited most from the great wave of integration that came with the European single market,\u201d Camagni says.</p> <p>\u201cThe city provides financiers, lawyers, designers, artists, culture, everything required to be a modern international hub. It has a monopoly on the high-end services that command the highest prices, and the rest of Italy has to pay those prices. In fashion it sits on top of a long global chain that has low-paid garment workers in Vietnam at the bottom. The problem is that this miracle in Milan only really involves the million or so people at its very heart. The city has shaken off the industrial hinterland that made it great in the 20th century. In the end this creates a problem of dignity for other places.\u201d</p> <p>Places like Melzo, for example. The small Lombard town lies about 12 miles north-west of Milan and no more than 20 minutes away on the train. Leaving the station, travellers are confronted by a stretch of wasteland and a huge, crumbling monument to a distinguished past, when Melzo\u2019s dairy industry enjoyed national fame. This melancholy edifice is what remains of the famous old Galbani offices, the HQ of the firm producing the original Bel Paese cheese at the beginning of the 20th century. Abandoned in the mid-80s, it has, say locals, become a public health hazard. The industrial ruins serve to underline the sense of a loss of vocation in a proud town, where the metalworking industry has also disappeared. In the summer metalworkers from Melzo were among thousands of demonstrators in Milan, protesting against the possible loss of 2,000 steelworking jobs in Lombardy. Deindustrialisation has turned Melzo into a dormitory town.</p> <p>Antony Bottani works as a lab technician for a firm producing chemical products 15 miles away. Now on the verge of retirement, he was born and grew up in Melzo. \u201cThe town has lost a lot of its life,\u201d he says sadly. \u201cBig firms like Galbani were powering ahead here and the town thrived. That\u2019s all gone and much of the countryside around here is now used for agri-tourism, not farming, so there aren\u2019t the jobs on the land. And the town is getting older and older.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72058e20a74333965741b1aa608834c4a0f9cf13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72058e20a74333965741b1aa608834c4a0f9cf13/0_234_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outside of Italy\u2019s more liberal cities, voters in  towns and rural areas are turning to Matteo Salvini\u2019s right-wing Lega party.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside of Italy\u2019s more liberal cities, voters in towns and rural areas are turning to Matteo Salvini\u2019s right-wing Lega party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Masiello/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bottani\u2019s son Gabriele is 18 and goes to college in the nearby town of Gorgonzola. \u201cHe\u2019s studying IT,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully that way he\u2019ll find work in Milan. But it\u2019s not good the way that towns like Melzo are going. This used to be a Communist town in the old days. Now it\u2019s become a town of the right. People want change. They\u2019re pissed off.\u201d</p> <p>In last May\u2019s European elections Milan voted for the Democratic party. The rest of Lombardy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/matteo-salvini-far-right-league-party-tops-italy-eu-election-polls\" title=\"\">voted for Salvini\u2019s League</a>. Afterwards Pietro Bussolati, a Milanese Democratic party official on Lombardy\u2019s regional council, sat down with colleagues and drew up a novel map of metropolitan Milan. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just of the city,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut also of the surrounding area. What we found was that the proportion of centre-left votes in a place was directly related to the availability of fast means of transport to Milan itself. In all the places where people didn\u2019t have that, and frequent contact with Milan was more difficult, the vote went to the centre-right.</p> <p>\u201cIn my opinion this is not about salaries; it\u2019s about how much direct knowledge one has of how innovation and openness help bring about economic growth. The more you can see that the universities, the research institutes and openness to the rest of the world bring about opportunities you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have, the more you are likely to vote centre-left and express liberal values. And by the same token, the less you see of that, the more likely you are to fall for myths about migrants who steal and so on, and vote for the League.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Bussolati is realistic enough to concede that better transport links will not truly bridge the yawning economic and cultural divide between Europe\u2019s flourishing mega-cities and angry towns. \u201cThere is no rabbit to pull out of the hat which can solve a problem which has been developing for years,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cThe future is going to be less and less about nation states and more and more about the great cities. They have the wealth of the future in their hands. The goal has to be to make sure that wealth doesn\u2019t just stay in those cities but is dispersed outside the city gates.

      "bodyText": "Night-time haunts go in and out of fashion, but the Bar Basso in Milan, which opened in 1967, remains one of the city\u2019s most venerable social institutions. Embodying a very Milanese combination of stylish prosperity and tasteful design, it is a favourite destination for the area\u2019s creative elite and the discreetly wealthy. Tucked away in a corner, Pierluigi Dialuce is explaining why, if a political nightmare unfolds in the rest of Italy, the city he has made his home will be able to cope. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible that the country is heading for a moment when the hard right and Matteo Salvini take power,\u201d he says, \u201cPerhaps in an alliance with the Brothers of Italy party. We\u2019re talking Viktor Orb\u00e1n-style politics at that point. But Milan will stay as it is. There\u2019s too much money here for that not to be the case. And then we will be even more different from the rest of Italy. But that\u2019s fine by me. Better that way, in fact.\u201d Dialuce is a thirtysomething financial consultant with one of the myriad multinational organisations that have made Milan a service hub for international capital. He grew up in Rome, but came north 13 years ago to read economics at the famous Bocconi University. For a while he worked for Barclays bank and then had a few brief spells abroad. Now he intends to stay in Italy\u2019s richest, most cosmopolitan city. \u201cThis place has changed enormously in recent years. It\u2019s much more international,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much investment and there\u2019s so much culture going on. Stuff that you won\u2019t find in the rest of Italy. The \u2018Milanese\u2019 don\u2019t exist anymore. Milan is made up of the professionals who have come here because there are opportunities that don\u2019t exist back home. They\u2019re the best of Italy. It\u2019s a kind of natural selection that goes on, creating a community which is much more European, open and tolerant in its mindset. Milan is not Italy.\u201d Dialuce\u2019s confidence is borne out by a poll carried out last year which found that 85% of residents would not wish to live anywhere else, while 81% believed that their city should be seen as an economic role model to emulate. But while the likes of Paris, Amsterdam, Munich and Berlin might reasonably aspire to compete with Milan, the rest of Italy, after 20 years of economic stagnation, can only dream. Milan now moves in its own orbit, reaping rich rewards from an economy centred on finance, tech, design and innovation. It\u2019s become fashionable as well as rich. In 2020, the city will host the World Cities Culture Summit. In 2026, the Winter Olympics will be based here, shared with the Alpine town of Cortina. Unprecedented levels of foreign investment are driving new developments across the city. Over 40 major construction projects worth $21bn will be undertaken over the next 15 years. The left-of-centre mayor, Giuseppe Sala, has presided over a 50% rise in tourism based on aggressive promotion of the city\u2019s cultural assets, from the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci to the attractions of the city\u2019s thriving LGBT quarter in Porta Venezia. Only the city\u2019s two football teams, Internazionale and AC Milan, have failed to keep up with the city\u2019s pace of growth and development, though Inter, now under Chinese ownership, lie a respectable second in the national championship. And the more the money flows in, the more ambitious and talented young Italians arrive, and the more foreign investors bet on the future. Across the city monuments to prosperity have sprung up such as Zaha Hadid\u2019s \u201ctwisting tower\u201d, which overlooks a park and gated communities of luxury condominiums designed by Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and the Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. Welcome to Milan, a truly global city. But, as elsewhere in Europe, this metropolitan success story is coming at a high price. Last May the Centre for European Reform, a Brussels-based thinktank, published a paper entitled The Big European Sort? The diverging fortunes of Europe\u2019s regions. The \u201csort\u201d refers to a sifting process that is steadily transforming the demography of EU member states, and driving the polarisation that increasingly defines politics in Europe and beyond. The post-industrial city, say the study\u2019s authors, is a success story based on the clustering of high-end services in the great metropolises. \u201cIn the 1980s and 90s,\u201d they write, \u201cindustrial heartlands such as the Ruhr in Germany suffered from relative \u2013 and in some cases absolute \u2013 decline in industrial output. The largest cities \u2013 often capitals such as Paris or London \u2013 were able to replace a declining industrial production with high-value services.\u201d By the 21st century, these reinvented metropolises needed a new kind of population, which was \u201cyounger, more highly educated and richer than Europeans who live in less successful cities and towns,\u201d the report says. \u201cLess successful places are losing people, especially in countries with ageing demographics.\u201d The consequence, the report concludes, is a damaging divide between ageing towns and rural areas and the great cities. \u201cThe political effects of regional sorting are predictable: frustration at relative economic decline in poorer regions, a sense of loss of community as younger people leave, and grievance about metropolitan \u2018elites\u2019 running the country for their own benefit.\u201d These themes have also preoccupied thinkers such as Christophe Guilluy and Guillaume Faburel in France. Both are geographers, reflecting the new reality that the politics of place is becoming as important as class, race and gender in understanding the signs of turbulent times. Guilluy, the author of La France p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, is a trenchant critic of what he describes as 21st century \u201ccitadels\u201d, which have become the \u201cshop window of happy globalisation\u201d.

It is, in fact, the first week in what many have called the most significant general election in a generation. A snap poll called to solve the parliamentary impasse over Britain\u2019s most important policy decision since the war has quickly turned into a competition to see who can go longest between gaffes. \u201cIt shows a December election isn\u2019t good for anyone,\u201d said one downhearted and cold candidate, shivering on the campaign trail. \u201cThen, on top of that, we\u2019ve got the general state of politics. It is thoroughly depressing.\u201d</p> \n<p>So what has been going wrong? According to insiders from across the parties, a mixture of distractions inside the campaigns, the rush of an unscheduled election and a generous dollop of personal stupidity are to blame. The question they are all nervously asking themselves is: which of the gaffes, if any, will end up making a difference?</p> \n<p>Tory insiders were feeling rattled by midweek. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s claim that the Grenfell victims had not used \u201ccommon sense\u201d by heeding fire service advice to stay in the building was a straightforward disaster.

      "bodyText": "First a cabinet minister apologises for suggesting the Grenfell Tower fire victims did not use \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Another senior minister then quits over claims he misled the public over what he knew about a former aide\u2019s role in the alleged sabotage of a rape trial. Meanwhile, the deputy leader of the opposition walks out, several election candidates either quit or are ousted before they\u2019ve even got going \u2013 and one appears to compare celebrating the death of Tony Blair with the cheers that met the death of Hitler. And it\u2019s all rounded off by a wine-swilling prime minister publicly disagreeing with his Brexit secretary over how Northern Ireland will trade with the rest of the UK. This is not an unpublished script for a political farce, rejected by producers for its implausibility. It is, in fact, the first week in what many have called the most significant general election in a generation. A snap poll called to solve the parliamentary impasse over Britain\u2019s most important policy decision since the war has quickly turned into a competition to see who can go longest between gaffes. \u201cIt shows a December election isn\u2019t good for anyone,\u201d said one downhearted and cold candidate, shivering on the campaign trail. \u201cThen, on top of that, we\u2019ve got the general state of politics. It is thoroughly depressing.\u201d So what has been going wrong? According to insiders from across the parties, a mixture of distractions inside the campaigns, the rush of an unscheduled election and a generous dollop of personal stupidity are to blame. The question they are all nervously asking themselves is: which of the gaffes, if any, will end up making a difference? Tory insiders were feeling rattled by midweek. Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s claim that the Grenfell victims had not used \u201ccommon sense\u201d by heeding fire service advice to stay in the building was a straightforward disaster. It was not only insensitive, but played straight into the negative perception of the party as being aloof and out of touch.

But in the distance squats a five-storey building with all its windows illuminated like some modern apartment block.

This is what the anthropologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/21/books-interview-david-graeber-the-utopia-of-rules\" title=\"\">David Graeber</a> calls the contemporary \u201cbullshit job\u201d: keeping busy just for the sake of maintaining appearances.</p> <p>A better vision of insomnia comes in the Swiss artist Roman Signer\u2019s video of himself lying in bed as a model helicopter circles noisily above like some infuriating insect, unravelling the bedclothes with its wings.

Alan Warburton\u2019s marvellous <em><a href=\"https://alanwarburton.co.uk/sprites\" title=\"\">Sprites I-IV</a></em>, one of those lenticular prints that gives the illusion of movement, shows four versions of himself desperately trying to catch 40 winks at his Beijing desk: slumped on the keyboard, coiled on his chair, curled uncomfortably beneath. The artist was working for a video effects studio regularly used by Hollywood for outsourcing. At lunchtime, the 100 Chinese workers would rapidly nap on pillows before resuming work for another eight hours until Los Angeles opened.</p> <p>Working round the clock: the phrase is telling. Ted Hunt\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://senseoftime.info/\" title=\"\">Sense of Time</a></em> presents a series of alternative watch faces showing celestial, seasonal and solar time. Each is ingenious, and each shows time as tyrannically circular, instead of linear, as we experience it. Or do we? Old-fashioned punch-the-clock machines in this show emphasise the terrible repetitiveness of workers\u2019 lives, while the<a href=\"https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/objects/co423341/empire-type-world-clock-for-indicating-time-around-the-globe-terrestrial-globe\" title=\"\"> 1909 Empire Clock globe</a> was devised to show the time at every outpost of empire, where the sun never sets. Now we fly the time zones, battling jet lag.</p> <p>This aptly restless show can\u2019t quite settle on its theme. There are photographs of neon-lit night bars and an airport destination board that ceaselessly clatters up random search terms from round the world. In a Japanese teahouse you\u2019re invited to drink time instead of tea, random LED numbers cascading down the walls.

      "body": "<p>Scientific research is a largely ignored consumer of single-use plastics, with the biomedical sciences a particularly high-volume offender. Plastic petri dishes, bottles of various shapes and sizes, several types of glove, a dizzying array of pipettes and pipette tips, a hoard of sample tubes and vials: they have all become an everyday part of scientific research. Most of us will never use such equipment, but without it, we wouldn\u2019t have the knowledge, technologies, products and medicines we all rely on. It is vital to 21st-century lives, but it is also extremely polluting.</p> <p>In 2015, researchers at the University of Exeter weighed up their bioscience department\u2019s annual plastic waste, and extrapolated that biomedical and agricultural laboratories worldwide could be responsible for <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_488903_en.html\" title=\"\">5.5m tonnes of plastic waste a year</a>. To put that in context, they pointed out that this was equal to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/528479c\" title=\"\">83% of the plastic recycled worldwide in 2012</a>.</p> <p>Modern science has grown up with the idea that plastic is disposable, but times are changing. This autumn, the first wave of young people to follow the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and go on \u201cschool strike for the climate\u201d started undergraduate degrees. Universities can expect these young people to bring fresh and sometimes challenging questions about how scientific research is conducted. At the same time, many of those from Generation Z (those born from the mid-1990s onwards) are now starting PhDs, and millennials (born from the early 1980s) are leading more and more laboratories. As more universities challenge themselves to eradicate plastic waste, notably in their canteens, as well as to go zero-carbon, scientific waste is increasingly coming under the microscope.</p> <p>In November last year the University of Leeds pledged to go single-use-plastic-free by 2023. Recently, University College London has announced it will follow suit, with a target date of 2024. These new policies won\u2019t just banish disposable coffee cups from campuses, but a lot of everyday scientific equipment too.</p> <p>Lucy Stuart, a sustainability project officer at Leeds, says that reaction among researchers has been mixed, but the institution is gradually making progress.</p> <p>\u201cFor us, as a university, we are here to inspire the next generation,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, we are a research-based institution that is creating groundbreaking innovation every day. So we didn\u2019t want to say the solutions aren\u2019t possible, because we are the people that help create those solutions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The contamination we deal with is probably less dangerous than a mouldy tin of beans in your recycling after a few weeks</p> <footer> <cite>David Kuntin, University of York</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One reason laboratory plastics are such a sticky problem is that they can get contaminated with the biological or chemical matter being researched. You can\u2019t simply put them in the campus recycling bins with your coffee cup.</p> <p>Usually, laboratory waste plastics are bagged and \u201cautoclaved\u201d \u2013 an energy- and water-intensive sterilisation process often using pressurised steam \u2013 and then they are sent to landfill. But David Kuntin, a biomedical researcher at the University of York, says, not all plastic waste is too contaminated to recycle. In fact, says Kuntin, \u201cthe contamination we deal with is probably less dangerous than a mouldy tin of beans you might have in your recycling after a few weeks\u201d. Accordingly he and his colleagues set to work. They developed a \u201cdecontamination station\u201d with a 24-hour soak in a high-level disinfectant, followed by a rinse for chemical decontamination. They also looked at the plastics they were buying, to pick ones that would be easier to recycle. As a result of these measures, they have <a href=\"https://thebiologist.rsb.org.uk/biologist-features/158-biologist/features/2072-how-to-reduce-your-lab-s-plastic-waste\" title=\"\">reduced the plastic they were previously sending to landfill by about a tonne a year</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s 20 workers, 20 of us,\u201d he says, sounding as if he still doesn\u2019t quite believe that so few researchers could pile up so much waste.</p> <p>\u201cWe used a tonne of plastic that we can recycle.\u201d</p> <p>They worked out that it was enough to fill 110 bathtubs. And because they have also cut down how much equipment has to be autoclaved, they are saving energy and water, too.</p> <p>\u201cI think, as scientists, we need to be responsible about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Kuntin says. Not least, he argues, because it is public money that they are spending. \u201cYou can\u2019t, with a clean conscience, just be using a tonne of plastic.\u201d</p> <p>At the University of Bristol, two technicians, Georgina Mortimer and Saranna Chipper-Keating, have also set up <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/translational-health-sciences/research/diabetes/news/\" title=\"\">schemes for sorting and recycling lab waste</a>. \u201cThe waste in the lab was very easy for people to see,\u201d says Mortimer. \u201cThey were like, \u2018I do this at home\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"06be9192c08de6065191d58dc55f803246b875dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06be9192c08de6065191d58dc55f803246b875dd/0_0_2834_3543/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bottles used to store chemical and biological materials.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bottles used to store chemical and biological materials are particularly difficult for researchers to recycle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Stier at Twenty Twenty and Miren Mara\u0144\u00f3n at East Photographic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They have been trialling glove and ice pack recycling through a company that specialises in hard-to-recycle waste, including contact lenses, crisp packets and cigarette butts, as well as the sorts of plastics that come out of labs.</p> <p>They are keen to think more about reuse and reduction, too, knowing that recycling can only take them so far. They have worked out how they can bulk buy whenever possible, to cut down on packaging waste, for example.</p> <p>Plastic is only part of the sustainable laboratory puzzle for them. \u201cWe have a lot of ultra-low temperature freezers,\u201d Mortimer says. The freezers \u201chave thousands, thousands of samples going back more than 20 years\u201d. And they are all stored at minus 80\u00b0C. Or at least they used to be. Anna Lewis, a sustainable science manager at Bristol, showed them some research from the University of Colorado Boulder, demonstrating that most samples <a href=\"https://www.labcompare.com/342365-The-80-Takedown/\" title=\"\">can be safely stored at minus 70\u00b0C</a>, saving up to a third of the energy required. They have now raised the temperature of their ultra-low temperature freezers.</p> <p>The Bristol technicians have also been thinking about what they are storing in these freezers, how they are storing it, and whether it needs to be there at all.</p> <p>\u201cThere are samples that have been left there for years,\u201d says Mortimer. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discovering what these actually are, if they\u2019re still usable, and consolidating the space.\u201d</p> <p>This hasn\u2019t just saved energy and money, it has also made working with the freezers more manageable. It is simply easier to find things.</p> <p>Martin Farley became the UK\u2019s first laboratory sustainability officer when he was appointed to the role by the <a href=\"https://www.sustainabilityexchange.ac.uk/green_gown_award_winner_martin_farley_discusses\" title=\"\">University of Edinburgh in 2013</a>. He now specialises in finding ways that research laboratories can become more sustainable, working in a similar role to Lewis in London. He first got into the field because of plastics, but quickly found a whole range of issues to work on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Depending on your research area, your impact on the environment is 100 to 125 times more than at home</p> <footer> <cite>Martin Farley, sustainability officer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Farley points out that ultra-low temperature freezers can use as much energy as a house. So if you worry about energy usage in houses in your street, you should be worried about it in the fridges in your university, too. Ultimately, as the climate emergency intensifies, Farley argues, \u201cevery facet of society needs to change\u201d.</p> <p>Laboratories might not be a \u201cbehemoth\u201d, like the oil and gas industry, he says, but they have a significant and often ignored environmental impact. In a research-intensive university, Farley reckons the laboratories will account for about two-thirds of the energy bill. If a university is looking to reduce its energy use, research sciences are a good place to start.</p> <p>\u201cWe have people recycling at home, and doing nothing in their labs. I did a rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation,\u201d Farley says, and, depending on your research area, \u201cyour impact on the environment is 100 to 125 times more than at home.\u201d</p> <p>For those looking for a plastic-free future for science, a technological fix could well be found in history. In Bristol, Mortimer has been eyeing up the contents of the old glass cabinets. She says: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get back into glassware, trying to make it cool again within our department.\u201d</p> <p>Many people perceive plastic as indispensable to modern science. It can keep materials protected, even when we transport them. It keeps us out of them (for materials we don\u2019t want to contaminate) and it keep them out of us (for hazardous materials that might hurt us). It can also be easily moulded into a range of shapes. Some areas of science \u2013 not least DNA research \u2013 have grown up in an era of single-use plastic. Yet in some cases a return to glass might be the answer.</p> <p>\u201cUse glassware \u2013 it\u2019s there, it\u2019s available, it\u2019s sterilised,\u201d urges Mortimer. \u201cAll universities have a glass room just full to the ceilings of stuff that we can be using rather than plastics.\u201d</p> <p>Along with Chipper-Keating, she has been tasked with producing a whole-life costing exercise on glass versus plastics. In theory, it should be cheaper to reuse glass than to buy plastics again and again, especially as there are often costs associated with dumping these plastics.</p> <p>But reusing glass means it must be washed and sterilised, and that takes resources, too. This is a concern for Stuart in Leeds; the university doesn\u2019t want its plastic-free pledge to simply replace one environmental problem with another.</p> <p>In York, Kuntin is also concerned about the knock-on effects of switching back to glass. He says: \u201cEvery day, we use reagents like cell culture media \u2013 a nutrient broth that cells thrive in. These broths have been developed for decades, and since most cells are grown on plastic, that\u2019s what the reagents have been optimised for.\u201d</p> <p>On top of this, researchers such as Kuntin are interested in the finest details of cell behaviour \u2013 and what they\u2019re grown on could have an influence on how they behave.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that cells are very responsive to their environment, and can sense things like the roughness or stiffness of the surface they grow on,\u201d he explains. Unexpected changes in behaviour could be misinterpreted as a consequence of an experiment, when really it is just that the cells are behaving differently on glass.</p> <p>Another problem is how much time reusing glass could take. Time, along with water and heat, can cost a laboratory money.

      "bodyText": "Scientific research is a largely ignored consumer of single-use plastics, with the biomedical sciences a particularly high-volume offender. Plastic petri dishes, bottles of various shapes and sizes, several types of glove, a dizzying array of pipettes and pipette tips, a hoard of sample tubes and vials: they have all become an everyday part of scientific research. Most of us will never use such equipment, but without it, we wouldn\u2019t have the knowledge, technologies, products and medicines we all rely on. It is vital to 21st-century lives, but it is also extremely polluting. In 2015, researchers at the University of Exeter weighed up their bioscience department\u2019s annual plastic waste, and extrapolated that biomedical and agricultural laboratories worldwide could be responsible for 5.5m tonnes of plastic waste a year. To put that in context, they pointed out that this was equal to 83% of the plastic recycled worldwide in 2012. Modern science has grown up with the idea that plastic is disposable, but times are changing. This autumn, the first wave of young people to follow the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and go on \u201cschool strike for the climate\u201d started undergraduate degrees. Universities can expect these young people to bring fresh and sometimes challenging questions about how scientific research is conducted. At the same time, many of those from Generation Z (those born from the mid-1990s onwards) are now starting PhDs, and millennials (born from the early 1980s) are leading more and more laboratories. As more universities challenge themselves to eradicate plastic waste, notably in their canteens, as well as to go zero-carbon, scientific waste is increasingly coming under the microscope. In November last year the University of Leeds pledged to go single-use-plastic-free by 2023. Recently, University College London has announced it will follow suit, with a target date of 2024. These new policies won\u2019t just banish disposable coffee cups from campuses, but a lot of everyday scientific equipment too. Lucy Stuart, a sustainability project officer at Leeds, says that reaction among researchers has been mixed, but the institution is gradually making progress. \u201cFor us, as a university, we are here to inspire the next generation,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso, we are a research-based institution that is creating groundbreaking innovation every day. So we didn\u2019t want to say the solutions aren\u2019t possible, because we are the people that help create those solutions.\u201d One reason laboratory plastics are such a sticky problem is that they can get contaminated with the biological or chemical matter being researched. You can\u2019t simply put them in the campus recycling bins with your coffee cup. Usually, laboratory waste plastics are bagged and \u201cautoclaved\u201d \u2013 an energy- and water-intensive sterilisation process often using pressurised steam \u2013 and then they are sent to landfill. But David Kuntin, a biomedical researcher at the University of York, says, not all plastic waste is too contaminated to recycle. In fact, says Kuntin, \u201cthe contamination we deal with is probably less dangerous than a mouldy tin of beans you might have in your recycling after a few weeks\u201d. Accordingly he and his colleagues set to work. They developed a \u201cdecontamination station\u201d with a 24-hour soak in a high-level disinfectant, followed by a rinse for chemical decontamination. They also looked at the plastics they were buying, to pick ones that would be easier to recycle. As a result of these measures, they have reduced the plastic they were previously sending to landfill by about a tonne a year. \u201cThat\u2019s 20 workers, 20 of us,\u201d he says, sounding as if he still doesn\u2019t quite believe that so few researchers could pile up so much waste. \u201cWe used a tonne of plastic that we can recycle.\u201d They worked out that it was enough to fill 110 bathtubs. And because they have also cut down how much equipment has to be autoclaved, they are saving energy and water, too. \u201cI think, as scientists, we need to be responsible about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Kuntin says. Not least, he argues, because it is public money that they are spending. \u201cYou can\u2019t, with a clean conscience, just be using a tonne of plastic.\u201d At the University of Bristol, two technicians, Georgina Mortimer and Saranna Chipper-Keating, have also set up schemes for sorting and recycling lab waste. \u201cThe waste in the lab was very easy for people to see,\u201d says Mortimer. \u201cThey were like, \u2018I do this at home\u2019.\u201d They have been trialling glove and ice pack recycling through a company that specialises in hard-to-recycle waste, including contact lenses, crisp packets and cigarette butts, as well as the sorts of plastics that come out of labs. They are keen to think more about reuse and reduction, too, knowing that recycling can only take them so far. They have worked out how they can bulk buy whenever possible, to cut down on packaging waste, for example. Plastic is only part of the sustainable laboratory puzzle for them. \u201cWe have a lot of ultra-low temperature freezers,\u201d Mortimer says. The freezers \u201chave thousands, thousands of samples going back more than 20 years\u201d. And they are all stored at minus 80\u00b0C. Or at least they used to be. Anna Lewis, a sustainable science manager at Bristol, showed them some research from the University of Colorado Boulder, demonstrating that most samples can be safely stored at minus 70\u00b0C, saving up to a third of the energy required. They have now raised the temperature of their ultra-low temperature freezers. The Bristol technicians have also been thinking about what they are storing in these freezers, how they are storing it, and whether it needs to be there at all. \u201cThere are samples that have been left there for years,\u201d says Mortimer. \u201cWe\u2019ve been discovering what these actually are, if they\u2019re still usable, and consolidating the space.\u201d This hasn\u2019t just saved energy and money, it has also made working with the freezers more manageable. It is simply easier to find things. Martin Farley became the UK\u2019s first laboratory sustainability officer when he was appointed to the role by the University of Edinburgh in 2013. He now specialises in finding ways that research laboratories can become more sustainable, working in a similar role to Lewis in London. He first got into the field because of plastics, but quickly found a whole range of issues to work on. Farley points out that ultra-low temperature freezers can use as much energy as a house. So if you worry about energy usage in houses in your street, you should be worried about it in the fridges in your university, too. Ultimately, as the climate emergency intensifies, Farley argues, \u201cevery facet of society needs to change\u201d. Laboratories might not be a \u201cbehemoth\u201d, like the oil and gas industry, he says, but they have a significant and often ignored environmental impact. In a research-intensive university, Farley reckons the laboratories will account for about two-thirds of the energy bill. If a university is looking to reduce its energy use, research sciences are a good place to start. \u201cWe have people recycling at home, and doing nothing in their labs. I did a rough, back-of-the-envelope calculation,\u201d Farley says, and, depending on your research area, \u201cyour impact on the environment is 100 to 125 times more than at home.\u201d For those looking for a plastic-free future for science, a technological fix could well be found in history. In Bristol, Mortimer has been eyeing up the contents of the old glass cabinets. She says: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get back into glassware, trying to make it cool again within our department.\u201d Many people perceive plastic as indispensable to modern science. It can keep materials protected, even when we transport them. It keeps us out of them (for materials we don\u2019t want to contaminate) and it keep them out of us (for hazardous materials that might hurt us). It can also be easily moulded into a range of shapes. Some areas of science \u2013 not least DNA research \u2013 have grown up in an era of single-use plastic. Yet in some cases a return to glass might be the answer. \u201cUse glassware \u2013 it\u2019s there, it\u2019s available, it\u2019s sterilised,\u201d urges Mortimer. \u201cAll universities have a glass room just full to the ceilings of stuff that we can be using rather than plastics.\u201d Along with Chipper-Keating, she has been tasked with producing a whole-life costing exercise on glass versus plastics. In theory, it should be cheaper to reuse glass than to buy plastics again and again, especially as there are often costs associated with dumping these plastics. But reusing glass means it must be washed and sterilised, and that takes resources, too. This is a concern for Stuart in Leeds; the university doesn\u2019t want its plastic-free pledge to simply replace one environmental problem with another. In York, Kuntin is also concerned about the knock-on effects of switching back to glass. He says: \u201cEvery day, we use reagents like cell culture media \u2013 a nutrient broth that cells thrive in. These broths have been developed for decades, and since most cells are grown on plastic, that\u2019s what the reagents have been optimised for.\u201d On top of this, researchers such as Kuntin are interested in the finest details of cell behaviour \u2013 and what they\u2019re grown on could have an influence on how they behave. \u201cWe know that cells are very responsive to their environment, and can sense things like the roughness or stiffness of the surface they grow on,\u201d he explains. Unexpected changes in behaviour could be misinterpreted as a consequence of an experiment, when really it is just that the cells are behaving differently on glass. Another problem is how much time reusing glass could take. Time, along with water and heat, can cost a laboratory money. Ultimately, however, laboratories don\u2019t know until they do a full analysis. \u201cWe could do a whole-life costing exercise, and it may well be that plastics are so much cheaper,\u201d says Lewis in Bristol. \u201cIn which case, we would need subsidies.\u201d Lewis argues that any real change will require a change in how science is funded, with universities ideally needing to dem onstrate some level of sustainability before they could apply for certain grant schemes. There is only so far they can go working with the goodwill and interest of a few enthusiasts. Lewis sees scope to address this, if not in the next Research Excellence Framework for assessing the quality of research in the UK in 2021, then in the one after that. Whether the ecological crisis can hold on for another decade of science policy negotiations is another matter.

One of that select band is Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, chair of the intelligence and security committee and Conservative MP for Beaconsfield for more than two decades. He will fight the seat as an independent, but he is a Tory to the marrow of his bones and declares Boris Johnson unfit to be Britain\u2019s leader on several grounds, one being that he threatens to do \u201cthings to our country which will be uniquely damaging\u201d and another being \u201cthe use of Number 10 as a propaganda machine spewing out lies\u201d. That\u2019s strong stuff and the more pungent for our knowledge that Mr Grieve is saying out loud what a significant minority of his former colleagues are furtively thinking even as they urge a vote for the party.</p> <p>There are also a few Labour people who will say candidly that Mr Corbyn and his entourage of hard leftists should never be allowed over the threshold of Number 10. Ian Austin and John Woodcock, two men who have spent nearly all of their adult lives working for the Labour party, call Mr Corbyn \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/former-labour-mp-ian-austin-urges-voters-back-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">completely unfit to be prime minister</a>\u201d. Mr Austin says the party has become \u201cpoisoned by extremism and racism\u201d. Mr Woodcock says the Labour leader is so dangerous that he has to be prevented from \u201cgetting his hands on the levers of national security and defence\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Mr Johnson, we have a man whom his Tory predecessor as prime minister regards as \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to occupy Number 10</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their interventions would not have carried so much force if they could be simply dismissed as two angry ex-Labour MPs who speak only for themselves. Their condemnation comes with added heft because we know that many of their former colleagues agree with these starkly damning assessments of the Labour leader.</p> <p>Others tell us what they think of the candidates for the premiership by choosing to walk away. The announcement of the election was accompanied by a substantial exodus of more moderate Conservatives, including several former cabinet ministers and one serving one, Nicky Morgan. These refuseniks even include another Johnson. Jo was swollen with such filial pride and confidence that he spent less than six weeks attending his brother\u2019s cabinet before terminating his own promising career by resigning as a minister and declaring that he was standing down from parliament.</p> <p>A stream of Labour moderates have defected to other parties or are retreating from the fray to do something less spiritually desiccating with their lives than advocate a vote for a man they don\u2019t believe in. The most remarkable of the walkaways is Tom Watson. He chose the first evening of the campaign to announce that he was quitting both the deputy leadership and parliament. His resignation will go down as one of the most bizarre in history. Explaining his decision with some stuff about wanting to do other things, he said that he was training to be a Level 2 fitness instructor. That\u2019s a first. No one has previously quit a frontline political role on the grounds that he wanted to spend more time with his spinning class. Though he said nothing critical about the Labour leader in his odd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/tom-watson-to-quit-as-labour-deputy-leader-and-stand-down-as-mp\" title=\"\">resignation statement</a>, anyone who has spent any time with Mr Watson knows that he believes Mr Corbyn should not be prime minister. Perhaps he really does fancy an alternative career as a gym trimmer. Perhaps he could no longer bear the cognitive dislocation of having to campaign to put into Number 10 a man he doesn\u2019t think should ever sit there.</p> <p>His departure has distressed and angered many of the Labour moderates, especially those he persuaded to stay within the party only now to abandon them. There is at least a degree of integrity in refusing to carry on with a dishonest game with the electorate. Those who have quit the field, on both the Labour and Tory sides, will no longer have to lie to the voters when asked what they really think of their leaders. That will not be the case for those Johnson-distrusting Tories who plan to spend the next few weeks gritting their teeth until their molars ache as they recommend that he be returned to Number 10. Nor for the Corbyn-repulsed Labour candidates who will promote him for the premiership while fervently crossing their fingers that it will somehow not happen even if enough voters take their advice to grant Labour a majority.</p> <p>In Mr Johnson, we have a man whom his Tory predecessor as prime minister regards as \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to occupy Number 10. Anthony Seldon says this in his absorbing new book about Theresa May\u2019s premiership and I believe it to be true because I\u2019ve previously heard the same from my sources. Tory leaders have often had their differences with their successors, but as much as Ted Heath loathed Margaret Thatcher, I don\u2019t recall him ever suggesting that she was too depraved to hold the office of prime minister.</p> <p>Mrs May is running for parliament again in Maidenhead. So she will spend the time between now and election day advocating a Tory vote to sustain in Number 10 a man she thinks \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to occupy the address. She will not be the only Tory doing this. I suppose she and other Conservative candidates in a similar position are saying to themselves that they are compelled to do this because the alternative is even more ghastly.</p> <p>The levels of dissimulation are even more elevated on the Labour side where many, quite possibly a majority, of the party\u2019s candidates in winnable seats do not regard Mr Corbyn and his cabal as people who ought to be allowed near the machinery of power. Three years ago, Labour MPs held a confidence vote in which just 40 of them declared him fit to be their leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/28/jeremy-corbyn-loses-labour-mps-confidence-vote\" title=\"\">against 172 who argued for his removal</a>. None of the reasons that the 172 cited then have changed in the time since and some of the objections to the Labour leader have become more compelling. That confidence vote happened before it was fully apparent how toxically antisemitism in the party has spread on his watch. I have a huge collection of quotes from Labour MPs about why their leader would be a calamitous prime minister and a government led by him would have frightening consequences for security and the economy. The very same people are now pinning on their red rosettes and urging a vote to put Mr Corbyn into Number 10 even while believing he is utterly unsuitable for the office.</p> <p>I guess they will rationalise this behaviour by telling themselves that trying to stop Brexit trumps every other consideration or that the Tories are even more hateful or that Labour can\u2019t win anyway, so what\u2019s the harm? A lot of them deployed that latter excuse during the 2017 campaign. Confronted on the doorstep by the Corbyn-wary or the Corbyn-averse, many of Labour\u2019s candidates told these voters that it was safe to pick Labour because the party couldn\u2019t possibly win and once it had been defeated they\u2019d get rid of him. Labour didn\u2019t win, but they then didn\u2019t get rid of him. This time around, it won\u2019t be possible for Labour candidates to offer honest guarantees that a Labour vote won\u2019t put Mr Corbyn into Number 10, because it possibly might.</p> <p>For the voter, and there are many of them, who regards both men as terrible candidates for the premiership this election is a struggle of the unfittest. It poses the nation with a hideous choice. Our electoral system doesn\u2019t offer the opportunity to cross a box marked Labour (but not Corbyn) or Conservative (but not Johnson).</p> <p>The best hope for all who shudder at the thought of either man at Number 10 is another hung parliament. That will at least place some constraints on the havoc that either can inflict.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

The most remarkable of the walkaways is Tom Watson. He chose the first evening of the campaign to announce that he was quitting both the deputy leadership and parliament. His resignation will go down as one of the most bizarre in history. Explaining his decision with some stuff about wanting to do other things, he said that he was training to be a Level 2 fitness instructor. That\u2019s a first. No one has previously quit a frontline political role on the grounds that he wanted to spend more time with his spinning class. Though he said nothing critical about the Labour leader in his odd resignation statement, anyone who has spent any time with Mr Watson knows that he believes Mr Corbyn should not be prime minister. Perhaps he really does fancy an alternative career as a gym trimmer. Perhaps he could no longer bear the cognitive dislocation of having to campaign to put into Number 10 a man he doesn\u2019t think should ever sit there. His departure has distressed and angered many of the Labour moderates, especially those he persuaded to stay within the party only now to abandon them. There is at least a degree of integrity in refusing to carry on with a dishonest game with the electorate. Those who have quit the field, on both the Labour and Tory sides, will no longer have to lie to the voters when asked what they really think of their leaders. That will not be the case for those Johnson-distrusting Tories who plan to spend the next few weeks gritting their teeth until their molars ache as they recommend that he be returned to Number 10. Nor for the Corbyn-repulsed Labour candidates who will promote him for the premiership while fervently crossing their fingers that it will somehow not happen even if enough voters take their advice to grant Labour a majority. In Mr Johnson, we have a man whom his Tory predecessor as prime minister regards as \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to occupy Number 10. Anthony Seldon says this in his absorbing new book about Theresa May\u2019s premiership and I believe it to be true because I\u2019ve previously heard the same from my sources. Tory leaders have often had their differences with their successors, but as much as Ted Heath loathed Margaret Thatcher, I don\u2019t recall him ever suggesting that she was too depraved to hold the office of prime minister. Mrs May is running for parliament again in Maidenhead. So she will spend the time between now and election day advocating a Tory vote to sustain in Number 10 a man she thinks \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to occupy the address. She will not be the only Tory doing this. I suppose she and other Conservative candidates in a similar position are saying to themselves that they are compelled to do this because the alternative is even more ghastly. The levels of dissimulation are even more elevated on the Labour side where many, quite possibly a majority, of the party\u2019s candidates in winnable seats do not regard Mr Corbyn and his cabal as people who ought to be allowed near the machinery of power. Three years ago, Labour MPs held a confidence vote in which just 40 of them declared him fit to be their leader against 172 who argued for his removal. None of the reasons that the 172 cited then have changed in the time since and some of the objections to the Labour leader have become more compelling. That confidence vote happened before it was fully apparent how toxically antisemitism in the party has spread on his watch. I have a huge collection of quotes from Labour MPs about why their leader would be a calamitous prime minister and a government led by him would have frightening consequences for security and the economy. The very same people are now pinning on their red rosettes and urging a vote to put Mr Corbyn into Number 10 even while believing he is utterly unsuitable for the office. I guess they will rationalise this behaviour by telling themselves that trying to stop Brexit trumps every other consideration or that the Tories are even more hateful or that Labour can\u2019t win anyway, so what\u2019s the harm? A lot of them deployed that latter excuse during the 2017 campaign. Confronted on the doorstep by the Corbyn-wary or the Corbyn-averse, many of Labour\u2019s candidates told these voters that it was safe to pick Labour because the party couldn\u2019t possibly win and once it had been defeated they\u2019d get rid of him. Labour didn\u2019t win, but they then didn\u2019t get rid of him. This time around, it won\u2019t be possible for Labour candidates to offer honest guarantees that a Labour vote won\u2019t put Mr Corbyn into Number 10, because it possibly might. For the voter, and there are many of them, who regards both men as terrible candidates for the premiership this election is a struggle of the unfittest. It poses the nation with a hideous choice. Our electoral system doesn\u2019t offer the opportunity to cross a box marked Labour (but not Corbyn) or Conservative (but not Johnson). The best hope for all who shudder at the thought of either man at Number 10 is another hung parliament. That will at least place some constraints on the havoc that either can inflict. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "body": "<p>When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month \u2013 in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise \u2013 the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen.</p> <p>If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It\u2019s not only that he\u2019ll have to get the voice right (at his best \u2013 or worst, depending on your point of view \u2013 Bercow sounds like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtIO1z_1g\" title=\"\">Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh</a> in the 1935 movie <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em>). Actually, that\u2019s the easy part (\u201cOrder, orr-duu-rrr!\u201d). It\u2019s the personality that\u2019s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he\u2019s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he\u2019s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I\u2019ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears.</p> <p>When we meet in a Soho club, he has been a civilian \u2013 no longer the Speaker, and no longer the MP for Buckingham, the seat he has represented since 1997 \u2013 for three days. What is he feeling? Is it grief, or relief?</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel grief,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I say relief\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say that, because it was the greatest privilege of my life. It probably sounds trite, but it\u2019s too early to know how I\u2019m going to feel. I had a structure, and now that structure is gone, and it is discombobulating. In 10 years [as Speaker], I missed Prime Minister\u2019s Questions twice, on both occasions to speak at funerals. The question arises: whither now?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7625fba08fdf4c054310726d985b04378276ec3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7625fba08fdf4c054310726d985b04378276ec3f/0_218_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In House of Commons, gold mace in foreground out of focus, Bercow stands with three others sitting around.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow on his final day as Speaker on 31 October.

Convention dictates that the Speaker head to the upper house on retirement, but there is talk that pesky Bercow will be denied this privilege (talk that emanated first from the camp of an increasingly furious Theresa May earlier this year).</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s for other people to decide,\u201d he says, with utmost graciousness, \u201cbut yes, I would accept, if it was offered to me. I want to write, consult, have fun, and do good. I want to ensure that I\u2019m solvent, and I would like to speak to a wide variety of audiences around the world. That would appeal. What I loathe and fear is dancing.\u201d So, no <em>Strictly</em>, then? Certainly not.</p> <p>What about the election? How is he going to vote? \u201cYou can ask me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d Oh, please tell me. \u201cNo.\u201d As I\u2019m sure he knows \u2013 he wears the smile of an assassin \u2013 this is still an answer of a kind: given that he was a Conservative MP only five<strong> </strong>minutes ago, one would assume that if his intention was to vote Tory, he\u2019d simply say so. But it\u2019s also odd, this being one of only two matters on which he will hold back (the other is the allegations of bullying made against him in 2018, which he will not discuss beyond saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never bullied anyone in my life\u201d). He certainly isn\u2019t convinced the Tories will win.</p> <p>\u201cThe polls are volatile. The Conservatives are somewhat ahead. But they need to be 10 points ahead to be confident of a majority.\u201d Either way \u2013 a Tory majority, or not \u2013 he doesn\u2019t think the election will \u201csort\u201d the issue of Brexit. \u201cThis is just phase one. We\u2019ve yet to have the debate about the trade deal between the UK and the EU, and between the UK and the rest of the world. We\u2019re still going to be talking about this in five years, and possibly in 15 years.\u201d Does this depress him? \u201cI don\u2019t easily get depressed but my personal view is that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the postwar period.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t easily get depressed but I believe Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the postwar period</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the past three years, Bercow has presided over the efforts of first Theresa May\u2019s government, and then that of Boris Johnson, to pass a bill on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU through the House of Commons. It wasn\u2019t work that he ever anticipated having to do. On the night of the referendum in June 2016, watching the television in his children\u2019s playroom at Speaker\u2019s House, he was as surprised as anyone by the result. \u201cA lot of us in the political class are too London-centric, and that must apply to me, too, because I thought most Brits would, in a pragmatic way, vote to remain.\u201d Once a new prime minister had been installed in No 10, however, his amazement only grew.</p> <p>\u201cI had assumed that the architects of, and proselytisers for, Brexit would have a clear idea of what they wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was surprised there wasn\u2019t greater clarity. I would say that Brexiteers bear some share of the blame for the delay because they did not have an agreed approach to delivery. There are, for instance, prominent Brexiteers who very publicly stated that achieving a trade deal with the EU would be absolutely straightforward.\u201d Does he mean Liam Fox, the former secretary of state for international trade? Apparently, he does. \u201cQuite why he thought that, you\u2019d have to ask him. On average, a trade deal between two willing parties takes seven years to implement.\u201d</p> <p>The other problem was the attitude of Theresa May. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she bears me any ill will. I don\u2019t bear her any. She was doing her best. But there was one major problem. The government pursued its approach as though it had an absolute right to parliamentary delivery \u2013 even when it was a minority government [after the 2017 election]. There is a respectable argument for saying that it was incumbent upon it to try and achieve a wider consensus; to reach out to other parties. But no serious effort was made to do that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4c14559203ddfce9135eba54efeea4ea7e198417\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c14559203ddfce9135eba54efeea4ea7e198417/0_231_2928_3659/800.jpg\" alt=\"Bercow in morning suit walking holding hands with Sally, much taller than him, wearing fascinator.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow and his wife, Sally, at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout all this, Bercow was determined, as he had been ever since his election as Speaker in 2009, to protect the rights of the backbencher, ensuring that the executive could not force its will on the House. Some, however, saw his actions as unforgivably political, and slanted in favour of remain. In March, to the fury of many, he prevented May from bringing a third vote on her withdrawal agreement, quoting a convention that went back to 1604. In September, he allowed rebel MPs to take control of the Commons agenda to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Unsurprisingly, he defends his impartiality in this period: \u201cThe evidence overwhelmingly shows that I was completely fair. I reject the charge that I was the agent of remainers.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s impartial <em>now</em>. Far from it. He sounds to me like someone who has won a famous victory: a triumphant partisan by any other name.</p> <p>Take, for instance, the prorogation of parliament last August. When he heard that this was what Boris Johnson was planning, he was in Turkey with his family. \u201cWithin an hour, I\u2019d issued a statement to say I thought it was a constitutional outrage. That annoyed some: they said it wasn\u2019t for me to pronounce. But if the Speaker doesn\u2019t speak up for parliament, it\u2019s hard to know who does.\u201d A few days later, though, the supreme court ruled that the prorogation was, indeed, illegitimate. \u201cAn 11-nil verdict!\u201d he says, like the Arsenal fan that he is. He looks at me steadily. \u201cDo you understand if I say that when people know you were wrong, they find it easier to forgive you? But that when they know you were right, they don\u2019t like it?\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, did they come and apologise? No, they just attacked the court instead.\u201d</p> <p>Where does he think the impulse for this prorogation came from? \u201cI find it hard to penetrate the recesses of their fertile minds,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say they weren\u2019t seeking to stop debate, but it absolutely was not a normal prorogation.\u201d His voice begins to rise. \u201cIt was declared illegitimate. Ultra vires. Not <em>proper</em>. And, crucially, void. I repeat: void. Void. <em>Void</em>. Invalid. It didn\u2019t <em>happen</em>.\u201d By now, I\u2019m holding up a finger to indicate that, yes, I\u2019ve got the message. But it\u2019s no good. \u201cExpunged from the record. <em>Expunged</em>. Not deleted. <em>Expunged</em>. That conveys an impression of some force. You can imagine a team of people with clothes doing the sponging, wiping it away.\u201d You sound quite glad about this, I say. \u201cYes, I am glad about it,\u201d he replies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b24d5a3d70e10f3ab0aa80550fb36b20c8052f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b24d5a3d70e10f3ab0aa80550fb36b20c8052f7/907_0_1868_2334/800.jpg\" alt=\"A male aide puts on Bercow's gown in a corridor in the House of Commons\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On prorogation, John Bercow says: \u2018If the Speaker doesn\u2019t stand up for parliament, it\u2019s difficult to know who does.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a theory that Bercow, whose father was a cab driver, is motivated more than anything by social class. Having sometimes found himself the victim of snobbery, it is the fuel on which his engine runs, the spur for his greatest feuds and grudges. He tells me that he gets on well with Boris Johnson, whom he finds \u201cpersonable\u201d, but that he was rather less keen on David Cameron. \u201cHe was immensely capable on his feet, very dextrous, and on big occasions, he could be impressive\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Is there a \u2018but\u2019 coming? \u201cThere is, yes, and that is that David is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let\u2019s face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not. There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn\u2019t demanding one. He just thought it would work for him. He has the most enormous, probably public school-instilled, self-confidence. He thinks that people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.\u201d</p> <p>Did Cameron and George Osborne, the former chancellor, bait him? \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I didn\u2019t think George was mean. He is an icy calculator; when there is a strong difference of opinion, he\u2019s rather clinical.\u201d He makes his voice slightly posher, and a little bit Bond villain. <em>\u201c\u2018It\u2019s nothing personal, but I am going to have to take you out. The exigencies of the time require it. I don\u2019t dislike you, but the time for your political assassination has arrived. The slot has been booked, the weapon has been identified.\u2019</em> David Cameron is a more emotional character. Was he mean to me? He did strongly object to my becoming Speaker. He was not keen on me at all, but then, when he stood for the leadership, I said I didn\u2019t think Oxford-hunting-shooting-fishing-membership-of-White\u2019s was a combination to appeal to the masses. I thought he was too privileged.\u201d</p> <p>Becoming Speaker, Bercow says, was his way of dealing with his feelings about parliamentary life. He didn\u2019t care for the front benches [he was shadow chief secretary to the Treasury under Iain Duncan Smith, and shadow secretary of state for international development under Michael Howard], but on the back benches he felt \u201cunrecognised, powerless\u2026 eventually I said to my wife: \u2018Honey, this is a recipe for unhappiness.\u2019\u201d Some time after this, he had a drink with the former MP Jonathan Aitken, whose godfather, Selwyn Lloyd, was Speaker in the 70s. \u201c\u2018There are other routes to fulfilment,\u2019 Jonathan said. He almost winked at me.\u201d Was this a lightbulb moment? \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>And did he always know he would be a reforming Speaker (among his reforms are, famously, the establishment of a nursery in what was previously the House of Commons pistol range; an increase in the use of urgent questions, whereby any MP can demand a minister comes to the dispatch box; and the abandonment of the Speaker\u2019s traditional dress)? \u201cNo, but the reforms were obvious.\u201d He wanted the place to be more open, welcoming and, well, normal. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be hermetically sealed in fancy dress.\u201d</p> <p>Such changes were, of course, all of a piece with what Bercow calls his \u201cpolitical journey\u201d, an ideological odyssey that began in Edgware, north London, where he was born in 1963. His father had a car business at the time, and his mother was a secretary, though they divorced when he was 12. He was a precocious child. One story has him sitting on the wall in front of the family home, ostentatiously reading the <em>Times</em>, the newspaper so huge, it all but hid him from view. He appeared on<em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eAkveRVQSE\" title=\"\">Crackerjack</a></em>, the children\u2019s TV show and, as a teenager in the audience at <em>Question Time</em>, he lectured Barbara Castle, accusing her of having swapped the Commons for the European Parliament because she knew the Labour party had no future. He was also a tennis player: a Middlesex under-12s champion, no less. He shakes his head, forlornly. \u201cAs Jo Durie\u2019s coach once said to my mum: \u2018I don\u2019t think John is the most talented player on the circuit, but there are two things I admire about him: he will run for ever, and he cares massively about winning.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e097701bb5140f318e0c83d4a6e262409f155e88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e097701bb5140f318e0c83d4a6e262409f155e88/0_128_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Bercow in shorts and T-shirt jokes with David Cameron and aides in suits.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bercow jokes with David Cameron at a schools tennis event on a court set up outside the Houses of Parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/PA Archive/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But he disliked school. \u201cI was distracted by my parents\u2019 break-up. I was at sea for a period. I\u2019ve got some sad memories: terrible tensions between them, though much later they made up.\u201d He only got going at Essex University, where he received a first class degree in government.</p> <p>According to one commentator, by the time he was in his late teens, Bercow was \u201cmore rightwing than Marie-Antoinette\u201d: at university, he was a hang \u2019em, flog \u2019em type, a fierce opponent of the EU, and a member of the Monday Club, a notorious fringe group that was then aligned with the Tories. He was, in other words, the polar opposite, politically speaking, of the man who, in 2002, would resign from the shadow cabinet over his support for same-sex adoption. I wonder: is he embarrassed by his former self? I expect prevarication, some talk of youthful folly. But his response is straightforward.</p> <p>\u201cYes, very much so,\u201d he says. \u201cIn particular\u2026 \u201d (It\u2019s at this point that it happens for the first time: his eyes fill with tears and he chokes slightly on his words.) \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of having argued for the privatisation of the coal industry, or advocating tax of 15p in the pound. An intellectual case can be made [for those things]. No, the only thing I feel really ashamed about is that, when I joined the Monday Club, I joined its immigration, repatriation and race relations industry subcommittee. I\u2019m <em>deeply</em> ashamed of that.\u201d</p> <p>So why did he do it? \u201cYes, what on earth was this north London Jewish boy doing teaming up with a bunch of bigots, racists and crypto-fascists? I think I was rather influenced by my father, who in many respects was a good dad \u2013 honest, loyal, hard working, he\u2019s been dead for 33 years last week\u2026\u201d Again, the eyes brim and the voice cracks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rubbish my dad, but it is possible for Jewish people to be racist, just as it is possible for people of other faiths to be. Dad was a creature of his time. He had a particular view about Commonwealth immigration. One day, I went to see him, and he mentioned Enoch Powell, whom he thought much maligned. I went off and read his [Powell\u2019s] speeches, and I thought: wow, he\u2019s got views about markets and price controls and Northern Ireland, and I fell for that. When you are a young person, you can be attracted by an ideology.\u201d</p> <p>So what changed? How did his move leftwards begin? \u201cIn the Monday Club, I came across people who were hardcore, disgusting racists, and antisemitic, too, and I recoiled, and left. But that was in 1984. I remained strongly Conservative for a long period. I was a Thatcherite until 2001.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Monday Club I came across people who were hardcore, disgusting racists, and I recoiled</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was, he says, Tony Blair\u2019s second election victory that finally caused him to do some deep thinking. \u201cWe were smashed to smithereens.

But this doesn\u2019t seem to me quite right, not least because they met, in 1989, at a Conservative students\u2019 training conference.

      "bodyText": "When John Bercow bowed out as Speaker of the House of Commons last month \u2013 in the chamber, he listened uncomplainingly for just under three hours to MPs lavishly buttering him with praise \u2013 the attention of one newspaper diarist was drawn by rumours of the sight of a somewhat unlikely observer in the gallery. Who was this attentive fellow, and what was it that he was scribbling so assiduously in his notebook? Later, a name was supplied. Apparently, it was none other than the actor Tom Hollander, who may or may not be preparing to play the former Speaker on screen. If Bercow the biopic is shortly to become a reality, Hollander will have his work cut out. It\u2019s not only that he\u2019ll have to get the voice right (at his best \u2013 or worst, depending on your point of view \u2013 Bercow sounds like Charles Laughton as Captain Bligh in the 1935 movie Mutiny on the Bounty). Actually, that\u2019s the easy part (\u201cOrder, orr-duu-rrr!\u201d). It\u2019s the personality that\u2019s trickier to catch. Crikey, but he\u2019s a strange mix. Yes, as even he admits, he is pompous, irascible, long-winded, pig-headed and, at times, utterly irritating. But he\u2019s also quick, warm, quite funny and, most surprisingly of all for a politician, capable of great, almost dazzling, honesty. In summary, all of his emotions are perilously close to the surface and you must be prepared for spillages, even as you struggle to follow his endlessly unspooling paragraphs. In 25 years, I\u2019ve never interviewed someone more difficult to interrupt, or more prone to tears. When we meet in a Soho club, he has been a civilian \u2013 no longer the Speaker, and no longer the MP for Buckingham, the seat he has represented since 1997 \u2013 for three days. What is he feeling? Is it grief, or relief? \u201cI don\u2019t feel grief,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I say relief\u2026 I don\u2019t want to say that, because it was the greatest privilege of my life. It probably sounds trite, but it\u2019s too early to know how I\u2019m going to feel. I had a structure, and now that structure is gone, and it is discombobulating. In 10 years [as Speaker], I missed Prime Minister\u2019s Questions twice, on both occasions to speak at funerals. The question arises: whither now?\u201d Will he go to the Lords? Convention dictates that the Speaker head to the upper house on retirement, but there is talk that pesky Bercow will be denied this privilege (talk that emanated first from the camp of an increasingly furious Theresa May earlier this year). \u201cThat\u2019s for other people to decide,\u201d he says, with utmost graciousness, \u201cbut yes, I would accept, if it was offered to me. I want to write, consult, have fun, and do good. I want to ensure that I\u2019m solvent, and I would like to speak to a wide variety of audiences around the world. That would appeal. What I loathe and fear is dancing.\u201d So, no Strictly, then? Certainly not. What about the election? How is he going to vote? \u201cYou can ask me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to tell you.\u201d Oh, please tell me. \u201cNo.\u201d As I\u2019m sure he knows \u2013 he wears the smile of an assassin \u2013 this is still an answer of a kind: given that he was a Conservative MP only five minutes ago, one would assume that if his intention was to vote Tory, he\u2019d simply say so. But it\u2019s also odd, this being one of only two matters on which he will hold back (the other is the allegations of bullying made against him in 2018, which he will not discuss beyond saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never bullied anyone in my life\u201d). He certainly isn\u2019t convinced the Tories will win. \u201cThe polls are volatile. The Conservatives are somewhat ahead. But they need to be 10 points ahead to be confident of a majority.\u201d Either way \u2013 a Tory majority, or not \u2013 he doesn\u2019t think the election will \u201csort\u201d the issue of Brexit. \u201cThis is just phase one. We\u2019ve yet to have the debate about the trade deal between the UK and the EU, and between the UK and the rest of the world. We\u2019re still going to be talking about this in five years, and possibly in 15 years.\u201d Does this depress him? \u201cI don\u2019t easily get depressed but my personal view is that Brexit is the biggest foreign policy mistake in the postwar period.\u201d For the past three years, Bercow has presided over the efforts of first Theresa May\u2019s government, and then that of Boris Johnson, to pass a bill on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU through the House of Commons. It wasn\u2019t work that he ever anticipated having to do. On the night of the referendum in June 2016, watching the television in his children\u2019s playroom at Speaker\u2019s House, he was as surprised as anyone by the result. \u201cA lot of us in the political class are too London-centric, and that must apply to me, too, because I thought most Brits would, in a pragmatic way, vote to remain.\u201d Once a new prime minister had been installed in No 10, however, his amazement only grew. \u201cI had assumed that the architects of, and proselytisers for, Brexit would have a clear idea of what they wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was surprised there wasn\u2019t greater clarity. I would say that Brexiteers bear some share of the blame for the delay because they did not have an agreed approach to delivery. There are, for instance, prominent Brexiteers who very publicly stated that achieving a trade deal with the EU would be absolutely straightforward.\u201d Does he mean Liam Fox, the former secretary of state for international trade? Apparently, he does. \u201cQuite why he thought that, you\u2019d have to ask him. On average, a trade deal between two willing parties takes seven years to implement.\u201d The other problem was the attitude of Theresa May. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she bears me any ill will. I don\u2019t bear her any. She was doing her best. But there was one major problem. The government pursued its approach as though it had an absolute right to parliamentary delivery \u2013 even when it was a minority government [after the 2017 election]. There is a respectable argument for saying that it was incumbent upon it to try and achieve a wider consensus; to reach out to other parties. But no serious effort was made to do that.\u201d Throughout all this, Bercow was determined, as he had been ever since his election as Speaker in 2009, to protect the rights of the backbencher, ensuring that the executive could not force its will on the House. Some, however, saw his actions as unforgivably political, and slanted in favour of remain. In March, to the fury of many, he prevented May from bringing a third vote on her withdrawal agreement, quoting a convention that went back to 1604. In September, he allowed rebel MPs to take control of the Commons agenda to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Unsurprisingly, he defends his impartiality in this period: \u201cThe evidence overwhelmingly shows that I was completely fair. I reject the charge that I was the agent of remainers.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s impartial now. Far from it. He sounds to me like someone who has won a famous victory: a triumphant partisan by any other name. Take, for instance, the prorogation of parliament last August. When he heard that this was what Boris Johnson was planning, he was in Turkey with his family. \u201cWithin an hour, I\u2019d issued a statement to say I thought it was a constitutional outrage. That annoyed some: they said it wasn\u2019t for me to pronounce. But if the Speaker doesn\u2019t speak up for parliament, it\u2019s hard to know who does.\u201d A few days later, though, the supreme court ruled that the prorogation was, indeed, illegitimate. \u201cAn 11-nil verdict!\u201d he says, like the Arsenal fan that he is. He looks at me steadily. \u201cDo you understand if I say that when people know you were wrong, they find it easier to forgive you? But that when they know you were right, they don\u2019t like it?\u201d I nod. \u201cWell, did they come and apologise? No, they just attacked the court instead.\u201d Where does he think the impulse for this prorogation came from? \u201cI find it hard to penetrate the recesses of their fertile minds,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say they weren\u2019t seeking to stop debate, but it absolutely was not a normal prorogation.\u201d His voice begins to rise. \u201cIt was declared illegitimate. Ultra vires. Not proper. And, crucially, void. I repeat: void. Void. Void. Invalid. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d By now, I\u2019m holding up a finger to indicate that, yes, I\u2019ve got the message. But it\u2019s no good. \u201cExpunged from the record. Expunged. Not deleted. Expunged. That conveys an impression of some force. You can imagine a team of people with clothes doing the sponging, wiping it away.\u201d You sound quite glad about this, I say. \u201cYes, I am glad about it,\u201d he replies. There is a theory that Bercow, whose father was a cab driver, is motivated more than anything by social class. Having sometimes found himself the victim of snobbery, it is the fuel on which his engine runs, the spur for his greatest feuds and grudges. He tells me that he gets on well with Boris Johnson, whom he finds \u201cpersonable\u201d, but that he was rather less keen on David Cameron. \u201cHe was immensely capable on his feet, very dextrous, and on big occasions, he could be impressive\u2026\u201d Is there a \u2018but\u2019 coming? \u201cThere is, yes, and that is that David is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let\u2019s face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not. There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn\u2019t demanding one. He just thought it would work for him. He has the most enormous, probably public school-instilled, self-confidence. He thinks that people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.\u201d Did Cameron and George Osborne, the former chancellor, bait him? \u201cI\u2019m not complaining. I didn\u2019t think George was mean. He is an icy calculator; when there is a strong difference of opinion, he\u2019s rather clinical.\u201d He makes his voice slightly posher, and a little bit Bond villain. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s nothing personal, but I am going to have to take you out. The exigencies of the time require it. I don\u2019t dislike you, but the time for your political assassination has arrived. The slot has been booked, the weapon has been identified.\u2019 David Cameron is a more emotional character. Was he mean to me? He did strongly object to my becoming Speaker. He was not keen on me at all, but then, when he stood for the leadership, I said I didn\u2019t think Oxford-hunting-shooting-fishing-membership-of-White\u2019s was a combination to appeal to the masses. I thought he was too privileged.\u201d Becoming Speaker, Bercow says, was his way of dealing with his feelings about parliamentary life. He didn\u2019t care for the front benches [he was shadow chief secretary to the Treasury under Iain Duncan Smith, and shadow secretary of state for international development under Michael Howard], but on the back benches he felt \u201cunrecognised, powerless\u2026 eventually I said to my wife: \u2018Honey, this is a recipe for unhappiness.\u2019\u201d Some time after this, he had a drink with the former MP Jonathan Aitken, whose godfather, Selwyn Lloyd, was Speaker in the 70s. \u201c\u2018There are other routes to fulfilment,\u2019 Jonathan said. He almost winked at me.\u201d Was this a lightbulb moment? \u201cYes.\u201d And did he always know he would be a reforming Speaker (among his reforms are, famously, the establishment of a nursery in what was previously the House of Commons pistol range; an increase in the use of urgent questions, whereby any MP can demand a minister comes to the dispatch box; and the abandonment of the Speaker\u2019s traditional dress)? \u201cNo, but the reforms were obvious.\u201d He wanted the place to be more open, welcoming and, well, normal. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be hermetically sealed in fancy dress.\u201d Such changes were, of course, all of a piece with what Bercow calls his \u201cpolitical journey\u201d, an ideological odyssey that began in Edgware, north London, where he was born in 1963. His father had a car business at the time, and his mother was a secretary, though they divorced when he was 12. He was a precocious child. One story has him sitting on the wall in front of the family home, ostentatiously reading the Times, the newspaper so huge, it all but hid him from view. He appeared on Crackerjack, the children\u2019s TV show and, as a teenager in the audience at Question Time, he lectured Barbara Castle, accusing her of having swapped the Commons for the European Parliament because she knew the Labour party had no future. He was also a tennis player: a Middlesex under-12s champion, no less. He shakes his head, forlornly. \u201cAs Jo Durie\u2019s coach once said to my mum: \u2018I don\u2019t think John is the most talented player on the circuit, but there are two things I admire about him: he will run for ever, and he cares massively about winning.\u2019\u201d But he disliked school. \u201cI was distracted by my parents\u2019 break-up. I was at sea for a period. I\u2019ve got some sad memories: terrible tensions between them, though much later they made up.\u201d He only got going at Essex University, where he received a first class degree in government. According to one commentator, by the time he was in his late teens, Bercow was \u201cmore rightwing than Marie-Antoinette\u201d: at university, he was a hang \u2019em, flog \u2019em type, a fierce opponent of the EU, and a member of the Monday Club, a notorious fringe group that was then aligned with the Tories. He was, in other words, the polar opposite, politically speaking, of the man who, in 2002, would resign from the shadow cabinet over his support for same-sex adoption. I wonder: is he embarrassed by his former self? I expect prevarication, some talk of youthful folly. But his response is straightforward. \u201cYes, very much so,\u201d he says. \u201cIn particular\u2026 \u201d (It\u2019s at this point that it happens for the first time: his eyes fill with tears and he chokes slightly on his words.) \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of having argued for the privatisation of the coal industry, or advocating tax of 15p in the pound. An intellectual case can be made [for those things]. No, the only thing I feel really ashamed about is that, when I joined the Monday Club, I joined its immigration, repatriation and race relations industry subcommittee. I\u2019m deeply ashamed of that.\u201d So why did he do it? \u201cYes, what on earth was this north London Jewish boy doing teaming up with a bunch of bigots, racists and crypto-fascists? I think I was rather influenced by my father, who in many respects was a good dad \u2013 honest, loyal, hard working, he\u2019s been dead for 33 years last week\u2026\u201d Again, the eyes brim and the voice cracks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rubbish my dad, but it is possible for Jewish people to be racist, just as it is possible for people of other faiths to be. Dad was a creature of his time. He had a particular view about Commonwealth immigration. One day, I went to see him, and he mentioned Enoch Powell, whom he thought much maligned. I went off and read his [Powell\u2019s] speeches, and I thought: wow, he\u2019s got views about markets and price controls and Northern Ireland, and I fell for that. When you are a young person, you can be attracted by an ideology.\u201d So what changed? How did his move leftwards begin? \u201cIn the Monday Club, I came across people who were hardcore, disgusting racists, and antisemitic, too, and I recoiled, and left. But that was in 1984. I remained strongly Conservative for a long period. I was a Thatcherite until 2001.\u201d It was, he says, Tony Blair\u2019s second election victory that finally caused him to do some deep thinking. \u201cWe were smashed to smithereens. I thought: there\u2019s something wrong, here. The electorate cared about public services that we had under-resourced, and it cared about fairness. In our attitude to women and minorities, we came across as the nasty party, and I didn\u2019t think I was a nasty person.\u201d With this in mind, is he dismayed by the current mood? \u201cYes, there is a nastiness abroad. It is a pity.\u201d Again, he is on the verge of tears as he gasps out the words: \u201cIn the 1950s, there were notices in pubs that said: No blacks, no Irish, no dogs. The idea that there is a regression into an\u2026 atavistic camp is a tragedy.\u201d Has he received the kind of threats that many other MPs, particularly Jewish members, have recently described? \u201cOh, yes. But it\u2019s something I can shrug off. I don\u2019t want to be pious. I am capable of being upset from time to time. But have I lost a wink of sleep over this? No. I lose sleep about the health of a member of my family.\u201d At this point, beginning to sob, he asks me to switch off my tape recorder. When he has recovered, we talk about his wife and three children, with whom he has shared the \u201cbizarre, surreal\u201d experience of living in Speaker\u2019s House. Some have attributed the shift in his politics to the influence of his wife, Sally, a Labour supporter who famously has a \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d sticker on her car. But this doesn\u2019t seem to me quite right, not least because they met, in 1989, at a Conservative students\u2019 training conference. Was it love at first sight? \u201cI was very attracted to her, and I was completely amazed she had the remotest interest in me.\u201d Naturally, his determination kicked in. \u201cI worked at it. We had an on-off relationship, but I never gave up, and 13 years later, we got married.\u201d He says his wife has been a rock. But there have been \u2013 how to put this? \u2013 some challenges. She was photographed for a newspaper wearing only a sheet (power is an aphrodisiac, she said); appeared in reality TV shows; lost a libel case brought by Lord McAlpine; and had an affair with her husband\u2019s cousin. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had periods of turbulence,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s well known that Sally left me for a period.\u201d How did he cope? It was so public. \u201cIn the Commons, a dear friend, Charles Walker [a Tory MP], came up to me and said: \u2018I don\u2019t know how you keep going. You must feel so embarrassed.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not embarrassed. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u2019 How did I cope? I compartmentalised.\u201d Did he know he\u2019d get her back? \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a great certainty, but I thought it was worth trying. I do [love her a lot], and I\u2019m happier together than apart.\u201d For one last time, his eyes grow watery. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to think the grass is greener. I like to stick with things.\u201d He must go now. The man from the speaking agency he has joined, desperate to talk to him, is tapping on the door. But I sense a certain reluctance: the result, I think, of a feeling on his part that, at last, he has the chance to show people what he is. \u201cThe way I talk is not an affectation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt came from my father, who also spoke in paragraphs.

And now he really lets rip. \u201cThey have this stupid, bigoted, thick-as-pig-shit idea of me as someone who is just acting a part. It\u2019s just snobbery. Because public-school people are predestined: there\u2019s a map for them.\u201d Does he mean that they don\u2019t understand that the rest of us must be more pragmatic, perhaps shaking off versions of ourselves from time to time? He nods. \u201cI may be odd and pompous and an irritant. But I am completely authentic.\u201d He shows me the palms of his hands. \u201cThis is me,\u201d he says, sounding half dazed at the thought.",

Claudia Paoloni, the HCSA\u2019s president, said that without more radical pension reform \u201cthese well-meaning proposals are set to fail\u201d. HCSA members\u2019 scepticism that the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s plans will remove the risk of receiving a large tax bill comes after the British Medical Association and grassroots doctors signalled their opposition. \u201cUnderstaffing is at the root of the crisis and we know that for many hospital doctors pensions taxation has proven to be the last straw. They feel they have been flogging themselves to bridge the gaps in care created by vacancies and have been rewarded with tax bills running into tens of thousands,\u201d said Paoloni. \u201cThe truth is that even with tax changes not all of these will now be coaxed back into working overtime. They have reassesssed their work-life balance and chosen life.\u201d The HCSA also found more than a third (34%) of doctors have cut their hours, and 39% have turned down or given up medical leadership roles in the NHS, because of their pension concerns. Worryingly, around half of those who have taken either course of action said that no other doctor had stepped in to take over their work. The findings add to NHS pension difficulties facing the government, which hopes to introduce the flexibilities from next April. The BMA has already dismissed the plan as a mere \u201csticking plaster\u201d and warned that \u201cdoctors are trapped in a dilemma between wanting to care for patients and not wanting to end up worse off\u201d. The Association of Specialist Medical Accountants recently told ministers that flexibilities amounted to \u201cuninformed tinkering\u201d. NHS bosses are increasingly alarmed that the number of doctors scaling back their hours will leave hospitals struggling even more than usual when the traditional winter crisis hits. The issue is making it harder for hospitals to have enough A&amp;E specialists, anaesthetists and surgeons on duty. It is believed to be a key factor in the recent sharp escalation of delays facing patients awaiting treatment for breast cancer, for example. A Conservative spokesperson said: \u201cWe have already taken action to give staff more flexibility over how much they put into their pension pots and introduced new rules that will allow senior clinicians to take on additional NHS work and be fairly rewarded. It\u2019s imperative trusts implement these new rules.\u201d",

And since the security services and police can use it, many companies and property owners use it too.</p> <p>Amid signs of a growing backlash, the GDPR offers little help and even less consistency. In August, Sweden\u2019s data regulator <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49489154\" title=\"\">fined a high school </a>for using facial recognition to register student attendance, but did not rule it illegal.

A UK court upheld the use of facial recognition by South Wales police this autumn, but the main data regulator, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), warned last month that <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2019/10/live-facial-recognition-technology-police-forces-need-to-slow-down-and-justify-its-use/\" title=\"\">this should not be taken as a blanket permission </a>for the police to use the technology.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the House of Lords has introduced a bill calling for a moratorium on the automated use of facial recognition, something the science and technology committee in the House of Commons called for in July. Even the European commission admits that the GDPR is failing to protect us from a surveillance society, which is why it too is planning regulation on facial recognition technology as part of its new strategy for artificial intelligence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Advances in computing processing power and AI will allow those who have our data to do much more with it, and so with us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This change of course cannot come fast enough.

The next generation of wireless telecommunications infrastructure, known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/5g\" title=\"\">5G</a>, is beginning to transform the promise of the internet of things into a reality.

And even though non-US citizens are not protected by the Bill of Rights, Snowden believed that the US government was violating their human rights. This is what drove him to blow the whistle in 2013.</p> <p>Last week, Snowden said that the GDPR is \u201ca good first effort\u2026 but it\u2019s not a solution\u201d. He thinks that legislation should address the <em>collection</em> of our data, not its protection after it is collected. To do that, we will need to overhaul our approach. The GDPR protects data. To protect people, we need a bill of rights, one that protects our civil liberties in the age of AI.</p> <p>\u2022 Stephanie Hare is an independent researcher and broadcaster</p>",

Yet there are exceptions when it is in the public interest, such as fighting crime. This is how an exception becomes the rule. After all, who doesn\u2019t want to fight crime? And since the security services and police can use it, many companies and property owners use it too. Amid signs of a growing backlash, the GDPR offers little help and even less consistency. In August, Sweden\u2019s data regulator fined a high school for using facial recognition to register student attendance, but did not rule it illegal. France\u2019s regulator ruled last month that it is illegal to use facial recognition in secondary schools, but it has not challenged the government\u2019s plan to use facial recognition for a compulsory national digital identity programme. A UK court upheld the use of facial recognition by South Wales police this autumn, but the main data regulator, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), warned last month that this should not be taken as a blanket permission for the police to use the technology. Meanwhile, the House of Lords has introduced a bill calling for a moratorium on the automated use of facial recognition, something the science and technology committee in the House of Commons called for in July. Even the European commission admits that the GDPR is failing to protect us from a surveillance society, which is why it too is planning regulation on facial recognition technology as part of its new strategy for artificial intelligence. This change of course cannot come fast enough. But it must go much further. The next generation of wireless telecommunications infrastructure, known as 5G, is beginning to transform the promise of the internet of things into a reality. It will turn our wearable devices, homes, cars, workplaces, schools and cities into a never-ending stream of connected data. Advances in computing processing power and AI will allow those who have our data to do much more with it and so with us. Yet even as the question of who owns our data becomes more urgent, ownership may not be the best way to think about what is really a question of how to protect our civil liberties in the age of AI. In Permanent Record, Edward Snowden explains that it was his close study of the US constitution, specifically the Bill of Rights, which persuaded him that Americans\u2019 civil liberties were being violated by the US government\u2019s mass surveillance activities, which were carried out with and without the active participation of US technology companies. And even though non-US citizens are not protected by the Bill of Rights, Snowden believed that the US government was violating their human rights. This is what drove him to blow the whistle in 2013. Last week, Snowden said that the GDPR is \u201ca good first effort\u2026 but it\u2019s not a solution\u201d. He thinks that legislation should address the collection of our data, not its protection after it is collected. To do that, we will need to overhaul our approach. The GDPR protects data. To protect people, we need a bill of rights, one that protects our civil liberties in the age of AI. \u2022 Stephanie Hare is an independent researcher and broadcaster",

According to the analysis of members of the global art community, the city is not just having a moment, it is changing the art world order. Currently the world\u2019s third largest art market, after the US and the UK respectively, and with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/more-rich-people-in-china-than-america-wealth-gap-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">more ultra-rich citizens than the US for the first time</a>, China looks set to become the greatest art market of all, and Shanghai is fuelling this shift.</p> <p>Of course, there are caveats to the prognosis, not least the bothersome matter of how to reconcile art with the repressive Chinese state.

Buckley Wood is half-Chinese, grew up between London and Hong Kong and lived in Shanghai for five years. \u201cIf political tensions increase and the government continues capital controls on transferring money out of China, it\u2019s an issue.

It has evolved into a major art world fixture with all the frantic activity of the best international art fairs and biennales.

Billed as \u201cthe largest ever cultural exchange and cooperation project between two countries\u201d, the extensive, multidisciplinary programme will also include the training of Chinese museum professionals in curating and conservations as part of a skills exchange.

Taylor sold Frank Auerbach\u2019s <em>Reclining Head of Julia</em>, 2006, for \u201cover $700,000\u201d, two Armen Eloyan paintings \u201cfor $100,000 and the other a bit less\u201d, an Eddie Martinez sculpture for over $100,000, and another five pieces for up to $50,000 each. \u201cAnd this is over the first day and a half.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor has been coming to China for years. \u201cIt\u2019s all about building relationships. There is a word in Chinese \u2013 <em>guanxi</em> \u2013 which literally means \u2018relationships\u2019 and refers to the support networks and goodwill generated by cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>But During a party for an art exhibition at the Prada Foundation, in the former French Concession, a young Chinese journalist tells me she worries that the imposition of the western art canon on China smacks of \u201ccolonialism-lite\u201d. The next day, a couple of Brits are trying in vain to attract the attention of the sales team at the Tanks gift shop.

A Survation poll of more than 1,000 Asda shoppers carried out for the GMB found 37% \u2013 which would equate to 7 million consumers \u2013 said they would be less likely to shop at the supermarket after hearing the terms of the new contract. \u201cAsda customers overwhelmingly want to be served by people who are respected and treated well in their jobs \u2013 no one wants to feel bad about doing their shopping, especially at Christmas,\u201d said Gary Carter, GMB national officer for Asda. \u201cGMB don\u2019t take any joy from this, because our members\u2019 jobs depend on people shopping at Asda but people want to feel good about where they shop and clearly could vote with their feet.\u201d",

It was guilt. There\u2019s no other word for it. Every article felt like an intrusion into Ana\u2019s privacy and into her parents\u2019 unimaginable grief.</p> <p>I got the same feeling every time I saw the 14-year-old\u2019s photograph in the papers, whether it was the one of her smiling in science class or the one of her modelling in a fashion show to raise money for charity.</p> <p>I fancy myself as a hard-nosed hack, who reports the facts as he finds them and to hell with emotions. But this time I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that none of us should have been in that courtroom, sitting a few metres from Ana\u2019s mother and father as they listened to witnesses describe, in excruciating detail, what likely happened in their daughter\u2019s final, terror-filled moments at the hands of two 13-year-old boys. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I shouldn\u2019t be watching videos of one of the Ana\u2019s killers describe her as a \u201cweirdo\u201d who dressed in \u201cslutty clothes\u201d.</p> <p>I had an answer prepared for anyone who questioned me about the morality of <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/criminal-court/ana-kri%C3%A9gel-murder-trial-the-complete-story-1.3929570\" title=\"\">reporting the trial</a> in such detail. The press have a constitutional right, and a moral duty, to report what happens in the courts, I\u2019d respond from my high horse. And that counted double when dealing with such an extreme case. Society needs to learn why two seemingly normal boys would lure an affable girl from her family so she could be beaten to death in a derelict farmhouse.</p> <p>The case concluded last Tuesday, 18 months after Ana\u2019s body was found by garda\u00ed in the house. The teen known as Boy A, who beat her to death and violently sexually assaulted her, was sentenced to life, a term that would be reviewed in 12 years. Boy B, who lured Ana to the scene, was jailed for 15 years with a review after eight.</p> <p>That evening, I sat in the corner of a pub, an untouched pint in front of me. The last article had been filed and my newsdesk had finally stopped ringing me. For the first time in what seemed like an eternity, I finally had a chance to think and I thought that my justification for covering the trial now sounded very hollow. Because, despite a massive police investigation, an eight-week trial, a stack of psychological reports into the boys and acres of press coverage, we still had no idea <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/please-remember-ana-and-keep-her-in-your-hearts-1.4073654\" title=\"\">why two boys decided</a> to commit murder and why they chose Ana.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd63525698ac3fd1aa42f67f8ec75ecf2f8d5560\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd63525698ac3fd1aa42f67f8ec75ecf2f8d5560/0_117_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ana\u2019s parents, Patric and Geraldine Kri\u00e9gel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ana\u2019s parents, Patric and Geraldine Kri\u00e9gel, outside Dublin\u2019s central criminal court after the two boys were sentenced for her murder.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niall Carson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a brutal case, one which at times seemed to traumatise the entire country. Murders like this happen, but not in Ireland and certainly not in a quiet suburban community on the border of Dublin and Kildare, a place where, in the words of Ana\u2019s mother, Geraldine, \u201cthe only sounds in the morning are the doves cooing\u201d.</p> <p>The trial and subsequent assessments of Boys A and B did highlight several issues that might explain Ana\u2019s murder, some more plausible than others.</p> <p>Did bullying lead to Ana\u2019s death? We know she was savagely bullied, particularly online. Other children sent her abusive messages and comments under the YouTube videos Ana loved to make told her to \u201cgo die\u201d. But there is little evidence that the boys bullied Ana or even had much interaction with her. Of course, it\u2019s possible they saw how other children treated her and thought that her vulnerability made her the perfect victim.</p> <p>What about the content consumed by the boys? Both liked violent video games, but then so do most teenage boys. Boy A also liked horror movies but there is no evidence these were a motivating factor.</p> <p>Perhaps less easy to discount is the pornography consumed by Boy A, including material depicting violence against women. Garda\u00ed found thousands of images on his various devices, as well as internet searches for \u201cchild porn\u201d and \u201chorse porn\u201d. But the psychological assessments stated that he had a normal view of sexual matters, a fact scarcely believable given the nature of the attack. Ana was naked when found, her ripped clothes scattered around the room.</p> <p>In the absence of external factors, it\u2019s tempting to label one or both boys as budding psychopaths, devoid of empathy and preprogrammed to commit horrific crimes. But again the reports said neither showed signs of personality disorders or traits indicating psychopathy. Similarly, there was no evidence of mental illness in either teen.</p> <p>The analysis and think-pieces have started and will likely continue. There\u2019s nothing new here. As author Blake Morrison notes in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/09/scienceandnature1\" title=\"\"><em>What If</em></a>, his meditation on the reasons behind the murder of James Bulger in 1993 by two 10-year-old boys: \u201cThey scatter the blame at different targets \u2013 single mothers, absent fathers, schools, the Church, the Pill, the sixties, but most seem to agree that children these days are spoilt.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe our search for reason behind Ana\u2019s murder is selfish, a vain effort to convince ourselves there is a specific thing in society we can fix so this doesn\u2019t happen again. But perhaps terrible things like this just happen sometimes. Maybe we can better assess society not by the crime itself but by our response to it.</p> <p>In this, I find some hope. Ireland has embraced the Kri\u00e9gel family and taken the memory of Ana, a girl adopted from Russia who often felt like an outsider, into its heart.</p> <p>Garda\u00ed ran a flawless investigation and the rights of the two boys, the youngest in Irish history convicted of murder, were jealously guarded by investigators, lawyers and judges. (Unlike James Bulger\u2019s killers, neither will ever be identified publicly after the trial judge ruled it would be detrimental to their rehabilitation.)</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s the only lesson to be drawn here, that we can remain compassionate and hopeful in the face of such evil acts, even when we can\u2019t begin to understand them.</p> <p>\u2022 Conor Gallagher is the crime correspondent of the <em>Irish Times</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Whenever I filed copy on the Ana Kri\u00e9gel murder trial, I experienced a strange feeling, one I\u2019d never had during the hundreds of other criminal cases I\u2019d covered. It was guilt. There\u2019s no other word for it. Every article felt like an intrusion into Ana\u2019s privacy and into her parents\u2019 unimaginable grief. I got the same feeling every time I saw the 14-year-old\u2019s photograph in the papers, whether it was the one of her smiling in science class or the one of her modelling in a fashion show to raise money for charity. I fancy myself as a hard-nosed hack, who reports the facts as he finds them and to hell with emotions. But this time I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that none of us should have been in that courtroom, sitting a few metres from Ana\u2019s mother and father as they listened to witnesses describe, in excruciating detail, what likely happened in their daughter\u2019s final, terror-filled moments at the hands of two 13-year-old boys. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I shouldn\u2019t be watching videos of one of the Ana\u2019s killers describe her as a \u201cweirdo\u201d who dressed in \u201cslutty clothes\u201d. I had an answer prepared for anyone who questioned me about the morality of reporting the trial in such detail. The press have a constitutional right, and a moral duty, to report what happens in the courts, I\u2019d respond from my high horse. And that counted double when dealing with such an extreme case. Society needs to learn why two seemingly normal boys would lure an affable girl from her family so she could be beaten to death in a derelict farmhouse. The case concluded last Tuesday, 18 months after Ana\u2019s body was found by garda\u00ed in the house. The teen known as Boy A, who beat her to death and violently sexually assaulted her, was sentenced to life, a term that would be reviewed in 12 years. Boy B, who lured Ana to the scene, was jailed for 15 years with a review after eight. That evening, I sat in the corner of a pub, an untouched pint in front of me. The last article had been filed and my newsdesk had finally stopped ringing me. For the first time in what seemed like an eternity, I finally had a chance to think and I thought that my justification for covering the trial now sounded very hollow. Because, despite a massive police investigation, an eight-week trial, a stack of psychological reports into the boys and acres of press coverage, we still had no idea why two boys decided to commit murder and why they chose Ana. It was a brutal case, one which at times seemed to traumatise the entire country. Murders like this happen, but not in Ireland and certainly not in a quiet suburban community on the border of Dublin and Kildare, a place where, in the words of Ana\u2019s mother, Geraldine, \u201cthe only sounds in the morning are the doves cooing\u201d. The trial and subsequent assessments of Boys A and B did highlight several issues that might explain Ana\u2019s murder, some more plausible than others. Did bullying lead to Ana\u2019s death? We know she was savagely bullied, particularly online. Other children sent her abusive messages and comments under the YouTube videos Ana loved to make told her to \u201cgo die\u201d. But there is little evidence that the boys bullied Ana or even had much interaction with her. Of course, it\u2019s possible they saw how other children treated her and thought that her vulnerability made her the perfect victim. What about the content consumed by the boys? Both liked violent video games, but then so do most teenage boys. Boy A also liked horror movies but there is no evidence these were a motivating factor. Perhaps less easy to discount is the pornography consumed by Boy A, including material depicting violence against women. Garda\u00ed found thousands of images on his various devices, as well as internet searches for \u201cchild porn\u201d and \u201chorse porn\u201d. But the psychological assessments stated that he had a normal view of sexual matters, a fact scarcely believable given the nature of the attack. Ana was naked when found, her ripped clothes scattered around the room. In the absence of external factors, it\u2019s tempting to label one or both boys as budding psychopaths, devoid of empathy and preprogrammed to commit horrific crimes. But again the reports said neither showed signs of personality disorders or traits indicating psychopathy. Similarly, there was no evidence of mental illness in either teen. The analysis and think-pieces have started and will likely continue. There\u2019s nothing new here. As author Blake Morrison notes in What If, his meditation on the reasons behind the murder of James Bulger in 1993 by two 10-year-old boys: \u201cThey scatter the blame at different targets \u2013 single mothers, absent fathers, schools, the Church, the Pill, the sixties, but most seem to agree that children these days are spoilt.\u201d Maybe our search for reason behind Ana\u2019s murder is selfish, a vain effort to convince ourselves there is a specific thing in society we can fix so this doesn\u2019t happen again. But perhaps terrible things like this just happen sometimes. Maybe we can better assess society not by the crime itself but by our response to it. In this, I find some hope. Ireland has embraced the Kri\u00e9gel family and taken the memory of Ana, a girl adopted from Russia who often felt like an outsider, into its heart. Garda\u00ed ran a flawless investigation and the rights of the two boys, the youngest in Irish history convicted of murder, were jealously guarded by investigators, lawyers and judges. (Unlike James Bulger\u2019s killers, neither will ever be identified publicly after the trial judge ruled it would be detrimental to their rehabilitation.) Perhaps that\u2019s the only lesson to be drawn here, that we can remain compassionate and hopeful in the face of such evil acts, even when we can\u2019t begin to understand them. \u2022 Conor Gallagher is the crime correspondent of the Irish Times",

The man we\u2019re talking about, Timothy, a graphic designer, is the son of an inspirational Australian artist friend of hers. When his mother came to London to visit her son, they both called in on Lia.</p> <p>One of Lia\u2019s friends had told her it was pointless to wait for a man to come knocking at her door. \u201cBut Tim literally did knock on my door. He was really handsome and we had so much in common \u2013 it was amazing.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe even had a little bit of matching eczema on our foreheads.\u201d This, clearly, was a mark of God, I say. She shrieks with laughter (I can imagine her drawing the matching eczema \u2013 it would be the sort of zanily miniaturist detail she relishes). \u201cI now think God meant me to wait in order to appreciate what happened next.\u201d</p> <p>She was nearly 44 when their daughter, Anj\u00e8s, was born. Anj\u00e8s is a \u201creally friendly\u201d two-year-old, she says, adding: \u201cWhere does that come from? I\u2019m not like that, I\u2019m really withdrawn and a bit weird.\u201d Nonsense, I say. Not only is Lia herself \u201creally friendly\u201d but her focus, in her work, is on the mystery of friendship \u2013 human, animal, divine. Her latest children\u2019s book could even be, she suggests, about marriage. <em>The Secret Time Machine and the Gherkin Switcheroo</em> describes the challenge of living with an old bird who does the crossword puzzle and does not want to go out, and a worm who dreams of wriggling back underground. Having said that, the worm overturns Lia\u2019s definition of wormdom by mainly living above ground and by not being humble at all. He swings between feeling he is worthless and believing himself a genius. Like most of us, he is ordinary. \u201cI relate to the worm much more than the bird,\u201d she laughs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Drawing and painting was an escape.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhenever I was between projects,\u201d says Simone Lia \u2013 comic-strip cartoonist in the Observer and author of a new children\u2019s book, The Secret Time Machine and the Gherkin Switcheroo, about the unlikely friendship between a bird and a worm \u2013 \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop painting worms. I didn\u2019t know why.\u201d As I walk into her house in south London, I notice a huge painting in her hall with a caption in shaky capitals: \u201cWORM HARMONY\u201d. The worms look like demob-happy frankfurters. They have floaty bodies, dazed smiles. She knew enough, she goes on, to know she should pay attention to this obsession. And, with a laugh, she explains she realised how much she admired the character of the worm: \u201cThey\u2019re very humble, live in the ground, do good work, get on with it.\u201d These qualities, she says, \u201cI\u2019d like for myself.\u201d If this sounds like a Christian aspiration, it will not surprise Lia\u2019s many fans. In 2011, she beguiled readers with the book that made her name: Please God, Find Me a Husband! The belief in God was no joke. But the book was very funny. In one irresistible sequence, Lia, whose boyfriend had just ended their relationship by email, walks disconsolately across Leicester Square. She hears the lyrics of INXS\u2019s Need You Tonight playing from a bar and believes God is communicating with her. Before long, in her mind\u2019s eye, she is dancing friskily with God \u2013 a bearded, bespectacled bloke in a pale blue, calf-length dress. Her story leads her to a religious order in Wales (\u201cI\u2019m so not going to find a husband hanging out with nuns\u201d) and to Australia, where she meets a handsome horseman who, in the way of handsome horsemen, disappears over the horizon. It is eight years since that book was published (it has five worms on one of its opening pages). As we sit down in Lia\u2019s front room, I ask how long it took God to get his act together. \u201cTen years,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d trick God by doing a book. I felt sure God would give me a happy ending and I\u2019d definitely get a husband. But it doesn\u2019t really work like that. I finished the book and there was no one. I was 33. I didn\u2019t meet my husband until I was 41. We married two years later.\u201d I am looking at her as she speaks, her bright, smiling face always on the edge of wincing at herself. I am thinking how nice it would be to have a black-and-white drawing of her because her clothes would be such fun to colour in: scarlet T-bar shoes, a mustard-yellow cardy, a blue-and-white skirt. The man we\u2019re talking about, Timothy, a graphic designer, is the son of an inspirational Australian artist friend of hers. When his mother came to London to visit her son, they both called in on Lia.

She shrieks with laughter (I can imagine her drawing the matching eczema \u2013 it would be the sort of zanily miniaturist detail she relishes). \u201cI now think God meant me to wait in order to appreciate what happened next.\u201d She was nearly 44 when their daughter, Anj\u00e8s, was born. Anj\u00e8s is a \u201creally friendly\u201d two-year-old, she says, adding: \u201cWhere does that come from? I\u2019m not like that, I\u2019m really withdrawn and a bit weird.\u201d Nonsense, I say.

She did an art foundation year in Ipswich, studied illustration in Brighton and, while doing an MA at the Royal College of Art, met Tom Gauld, who \u201cgot me into comics\u201d, and with whom she collaborated (on Both). I am so diverted by her, I forget to ask where God fits in nowadays and pursue the subject by email. She replies in full.

Sergeant Jason Alderete of Houston Police Department\u2019s animal cruelty unit, later told a local TV station: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the effects of the drugs. There was an actual tiger!\u201d The animal was given a name, Loki, and sent to an animal sanctuary in the country, run by the <a href=\"https://www.humanesociety.org/\" title=\"\">Humane Society of the United States</a>. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Loki\u2019s experience was an isolated incident \u2013 it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>An oft-quoted statistic is that there are more tigers in American back yards than there are left in the wild. According to the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, there are between <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/international/pdf/factsheet-us-efforts-to-regulate-tiger-trade-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">3,200 and 3,500 tigers remaining in the wild</a> globally.

The truth is we have little idea how many there are in American ranches, unlicensed zoos, apartments, truck stops and private breeding facilities, due to a mishmash of state, federal and county laws governing their ownership.</p> <p>According to the World Wildlife Fund, only 6% of America\u2019s captive tiger population lives in zoos and facilities accredited by the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums; the rest are in private hands. Some are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture and others by state laws, but some are not regulated at all. \u201cIn some states, it is easier to buy a tiger than to adopt a dog from a local animal shelter,\u201d says the WWF.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44a230e5ff3280ac6d5f8e38c3c846c83ed92e12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a230e5ff3280ac6d5f8e38c3c846c83ed92e12/0_76_1439_863/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger in the tank: Loki, who was rescued from a cage in a garage in Houston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiger in the tank: Loki, who was rescued from a cage in a garage in Houston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Godofredo A Vasquez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Texas, which lets each of its 254 counties regulate the ownership of dangerous wild animals, it\u2019s hard to accurately gauge how many there are. In a state that prides itself on promoting individual freedoms, like openly carrying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles or bringing concealed handguns on to university campuses, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that owning a tiger is considered (by some) to be a God-given right.</p> <p>The deplorable conditions in which Loki was found illustrate the fact that these \u201crights\u201d can come at a cost. He was discovered in a 5ft x 3ft cage in the dark garage of the abandoned home. The cage\u2019s floor was made of plywood. It was three months before police arrested his owner, a 24-year-old woman named Brittany Garza, who was taken into custody and charged with animal cruelty. She responded that she was in the process of relocating and had not abandoned the animal, as it had food and water.</p> <p>Katie Jarl, the Humane Society\u2019s southwest regional director, says there have been numerous similar incidents. In 2016, police in Conroe, a town north of Houston, received reports of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKLRHPkSYIQ\" title=\"\">a tiger roaming a residential neighbourhood</a> after it escaped from someone\u2019s back yard. \u201cNo one knew about them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were completely off the map.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These animals are extremely complex and powerful and can kill a human being with a swipe of their paw</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2009, a 330lb tiger escaped from its enclosure in Ingram, Texas, and was found in a 79-year-old woman\u2019s back yard. In 2007, a one-year-old tiger \u201cwearing a makeshift lead\u201d was found shot dead in a wooded area off the motorway in Dallas. In 2003, in another Dallas suburb, a motorist spotted a four-month-old tiger roaming the side of the road. In 2001, a three-year-old boy was killed by one of his relative\u2019s three pet tigers in Lee County, Texas. And in 2000, animal control officers near Houston spent three hours searching for a tiger that had escaped from a garden cage while its owners were out of town. That same year, in Channelview, Texas, a three-year-old boy had his arm ripped off by his uncle\u2019s 400lb pet.</p> <p>As for Loki, Jarl says a law-enforcement source of hers outside the city had got in touch to say the authorities had known about Loki\u2019s owner for a long time. \u201cShe had been raising cubs in her home for years,\u201d Jarl says, \u201cin a county where there were no restrictions.\u201d</p> <p>This year, two state legislators filed bills aimed at prohibiting the private ownership of \u201cdangerous wild animals\u201d. But this is Texas, where the private ownership of pretty much everything is sacrosanct, and neither bill became law. There was \u201cpassionate testimony\u201d on both sides of the debate, says the assistant to one of the legislators involved.</p> <p>According to one conservation charity, four states (Alabama, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin) do not regulate the private ownership of exotic pets at all. Brittany Peet, director of Captive Animal Law Enforcement for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), says there are a \u201cpatchwork of laws\u201d regulating the possession of big cats. \u201cAnd you can usually get around those laws by applying for a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) exhibitor\u2019s licence,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as filling out an application and writing a cheque for $100. The regulations are very minimal \u2013 as long as you have a cage where the animal can fully stand up and turn around you shouldn\u2019t have a problem getting a licence.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone should be terrified and shocked by this,\u201d Peet adds. \u201cThese animals are extremely complex and powerful and can kill a human being with a swipe of their paw. People keeping tigers in back yards are not experts.

He believes he provided the seven tigers that once lived on his private, 50-acre ranch 80 miles east of Dallas, with more than enough enrichment and stimulation.

      "bodyText": "It was the sort of headline impossible to scroll past: \u201cPot Smokers Find Caged Tiger in Abandoned Houston House, Weren\u2019t Hallucinating: Police.\u201d Last February, a group of people had snuck into a deserted house in Texas\u2019s largest city to smoke marijuana when they stumbled upon a full-grown tiger in a cage \u2013 a cage secured by just a nylon strap and a screwdriver. Sergeant Jason Alderete of Houston Police Department\u2019s animal cruelty unit, later told a local TV station: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the effects of the drugs. There was an actual tiger!\u201d The animal was given a name, Loki, and sent to an animal sanctuary in the country, run by the Humane Society of the United States. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking Loki\u2019s experience was an isolated incident \u2013 it isn\u2019t. An oft-quoted statistic is that there are more tigers in American back yards than there are left in the wild. According to the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, there are between 3,200 and 3,500 tigers remaining in the wild globally. By some estimates there are 5,000 in captivity in the US, though there might be more. The truth is we have little idea how many there are in American ranches, unlicensed zoos, apartments, truck stops and private breeding facilities, due to a mishmash of state, federal and county laws governing their ownership. According to the World Wildlife Fund, only 6% of America\u2019s captive tiger population lives in zoos and facilities accredited by the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums; the rest are in private hands. Some are regulated by the US Department of Agriculture and others by state laws, but some are not regulated at all. \u201cIn some states, it is easier to buy a tiger than to adopt a dog from a local animal shelter,\u201d says the WWF. In Texas, which lets each of its 254 counties regulate the ownership of dangerous wild animals, it\u2019s hard to accurately gauge how many there are. In a state that prides itself on promoting individual freedoms, like openly carrying AR-15 semi-automatic rifles or bringing concealed handguns on to university campuses, it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that owning a tiger is considered (by some) to be a God-given right. The deplorable conditions in which Loki was found illustrate the fact that these \u201crights\u201d can come at a cost. He was discovered in a 5ft x 3ft cage in the dark garage of the abandoned home. The cage\u2019s floor was made of plywood. It was three months before police arrested his owner, a 24-year-old woman named Brittany Garza, who was taken into custody and charged with animal cruelty. She responded that she was in the process of relocating and had not abandoned the animal, as it had food and water. Katie Jarl, the Humane Society\u2019s southwest regional director, says there have been numerous similar incidents. In 2016, police in Conroe, a town north of Houston, received reports of a tiger roaming a residential neighbourhood after it escaped from someone\u2019s back yard. \u201cNo one knew about them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were completely off the map.\u201d In 2009, a 330lb tiger escaped from its enclosure in Ingram, Texas, and was found in a 79-year-old woman\u2019s back yard. In 2007, a one-year-old tiger \u201cwearing a makeshift lead\u201d was found shot dead in a wooded area off the motorway in Dallas. In 2003, in another Dallas suburb, a motorist spotted a four-month-old tiger roaming the side of the road. In 2001, a three-year-old boy was killed by one of his relative\u2019s three pet tigers in Lee County, Texas. And in 2000, animal control officers near Houston spent three hours searching for a tiger that had escaped from a garden cage while its owners were out of town. That same year, in Channelview, Texas, a three-year-old boy had his arm ripped off by his uncle\u2019s 400lb pet. As for Loki, Jarl says a law-enforcement source of hers outside the city had got in touch to say the authorities had known about Loki\u2019s owner for a long time. \u201cShe had been raising cubs in her home for years,\u201d Jarl says, \u201cin a county where there were no restrictions.\u201d This year, two state legislators filed bills aimed at prohibiting the private ownership of \u201cdangerous wild animals\u201d. But this is Texas, where the private ownership of pretty much everything is sacrosanct, and neither bill became law. There was \u201cpassionate testimony\u201d on both sides of the debate, says the assistant to one of the legislators involved. According to one conservation charity, four states (Alabama, Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin) do not regulate the private ownership of exotic pets at all. Brittany Peet, director of Captive Animal Law Enforcement for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), says there are a \u201cpatchwork of laws\u201d regulating the possession of big cats. \u201cAnd you can usually get around those laws by applying for a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) exhibitor\u2019s licence,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as filling out an application and writing a cheque for $100. The regulations are very minimal \u2013 as long as you have a cage where the animal can fully stand up and turn around you shouldn\u2019t have a problem getting a licence. \u201cEveryone should be terrified and shocked by this,\u201d Peet adds. \u201cThese animals are extremely complex and powerful and can kill a human being with a swipe of their paw. People keeping tigers in back yards are not experts. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, and they\u2019re not providing these animals with enrichment and stimulation that they need in order to live relatively normal lives in captivity.\u201d Bill Rathburn disagrees.

      "body": "<p>When comments first arrived at the bottom of the internet, in their blood-spatter and bile, I wondered what it would mean for young women writing online. I had recently been one, you see, barely a day before. Until comments, angry readers had been obliged to find a bit of paper and a green pen before writing their response to my pieces about the benefits of a tiny handbag, or at least find my email address and then a quiet library in order to set out their ideas about my latent Judaism and love of cash. And then the internet opened and, while some of its corners welcomed passionate discourse, leading to friendships borne of such fetishes as identity politics on <em>The Wire</em> and the propagation of succulents, the spaces under women\u2019s writing wriggled with fury and disgust.</p> <p>What I thought would happen would be that young women would weigh up the benefits of such a career or hobby, one that invited commentary from a collection of boys that read their thoughts about a new computer game and react by critiquing their breasts, and decide, nah. I thought the advent of comments would signal a loss of female voices online and, undoubtedly, many women went quiet. But many, instead, accepted the abuse as a price of admission, their skin thickening until a daily scream from a stranger in Spain reminding them of their infinite stupidity became as routine as tea.</p> <p>I wonder, as a growing number of female MPs announce they won\u2019t be standing in the general election citing the abuse they faced in office, whether something is about to change. Whether it has to. Any person online has seen the relentless tide of faceless tweeters and proud fathers of three pouring pain on women they disagree with as if laundry water from a window. Any person who\u2019s talked to a woman in a position of power has heard of the threats they receive, whether on the way they walk home at night, or their absence from TV debates, or the security doors they install at their homes. Last week, 72 women MPs sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/29/cross-party-female-mps-condemn-uk-media-treatment-meghan-duchess-sussex-royal\" title=\"\">a letter</a> to Meghan Markle describing how, \u201cWe share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation, which is now so often used as a means of disparaging women in public office from getting on with our very important work.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is, it\u2019s effective. Why would any normal person rationally choose to stick in a job that requires her to piss on a thousand fires simply to reach her desk? Why would any young woman seeing not just the rape threats and violence a politician must navigate, but their daily weather conditions, the tornado of ignorance, of comments on their weight, decide to choose that life over something simpler, perhaps in telesales?</p> <p>A century after women won the right to vote, 50 years after fighting for a place at the table, they are being bullied out of public office and public life by people with numbers for names. By people whose online faces are Union Jacks, whose waking moments are spent sharing memes about Trump, torture and cheeky little frogs.

      "bodyText": "When comments first arrived at the bottom of the internet, in their blood-spatter and bile, I wondered what it would mean for young women writing online. I had recently been one, you see, barely a day before. Until comments, angry readers had been obliged to find a bit of paper and a green pen before writing their response to my pieces about the benefits of a tiny handbag, or at least find my email address and then a quiet library in order to set out their ideas about my latent Judaism and love of cash. And then the internet opened and, while some of its corners welcomed passionate discourse, leading to friendships borne of such fetishes as identity politics on The Wire and the propagation of succulents, the spaces under women\u2019s writing wriggled with fury and disgust. What I thought would happen would be that young women would weigh up the benefits of such a career or hobby, one that invited commentary from a collection of boys that read their thoughts about a new computer game and react by critiquing their breasts, and decide, nah. I thought the advent of comments would signal a loss of female voices online and, undoubtedly, many women went quiet. But many, instead, accepted the abuse as a price of admission, their skin thickening until a daily scream from a stranger in Spain reminding them of their infinite stupidity became as routine as tea. I wonder, as a growing number of female MPs announce they won\u2019t be standing in the general election citing the abuse they faced in office, whether something is about to change. Whether it has to. Any person online has seen the relentless tide of faceless tweeters and proud fathers of three pouring pain on women they disagree with as if laundry water from a window. Any person who\u2019s talked to a woman in a position of power has heard of the threats they receive, whether on the way they walk home at night, or their absence from TV debates, or the security doors they install at their homes. Last week, 72 women MPs sent a letter to Meghan Markle describing how, \u201cWe share an understanding of the abuse and intimidation, which is now so often used as a means of disparaging women in public office from getting on with our very important work.\u201d The problem is, it\u2019s effective. Why would any normal person rationally choose to stick in a job that requires her to piss on a thousand fires simply to reach her desk? Why would any young woman seeing not just the rape threats and violence a politician must navigate, but their daily weather conditions, the tornado of ignorance, of comments on their weight, decide to choose that life over something simpler, perhaps in telesales? A century after women won the right to vote, 50 years after fighting for a place at the table, they are being bullied out of public office and public life by people with numbers for names. By people whose online faces are Union Jacks, whose waking moments are spent sharing memes about Trump, torture and cheeky little frogs.

Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the evidence on rising temperatures? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/\">Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO</a>&nbsp;say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The<a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf\">&nbsp;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>&nbsp;says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bnhcrc.com.au/news/blogpost/richard-thornton/2019/grim-fire-season-looms-many-australians-remain-unprepared\">Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre</a>&nbsp;says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What other effects do carbon emissions have?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>So is climate change making everything dryer? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What do recent weather patterns show?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an \u201carson emergency\u201d, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that \u201cgreenies\u201d are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists.</p>\n    <p>NSW\u2019s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have the words right now.

      "bodyText": "The greater Sydney region will face catastrophic fire danger on Tuesday for the first time since the rating was introduced and fire authorities say conditions in other parts of New South Wales could also be set to worsen. The warning was issued as more than 80 fires continued to burn in the north of the state late on Sunday. Three people have died in the fires and at least 150 properties have been destroyed. The number of properties lost in the emergency is expected to grow as fire grounds become accessible to crews assessing the damage. On Sunday afternoon, two emergency warnings were issued for fires burning on the north-east and mid-north coast of NSW. A fire at Bills Crossing, north of Taree, had already burned through almost 12,000 hectares, with the Rural Fire Service warning people in the Johns River area to seek shelter as the blaze approached. The other warning was issued for an out-of-control fire in the Mt Nardi national park, where people were advised that leaving early was their safest option. While some weather conditions were expected to ease late on Sunday and into Monday, both the Rural Fire Service and the Bureau of Meteorology warned that dangerous conditions were forecast for Tuesday. The Rural Fire Service issued a catastrophic fire danger warning for the greater Sydney and greater Hunter regions \u2013 including the Blue Mountains and the central coast \u2013 on Tuesday due to high temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions. Extreme fire danger is forecast in the Illawarra/Shoalhaven region, the north coast, the central ranges, the northern slopes and the north-western regions. The far north coast, New England, the far south coast, the southern ranges, and the lower central west plains are expecting severe fire danger. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, visited devastated bushfire communities on Sunday. The federal government announced that disaster recovery payments of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child would be made available immediately through Centrelink for people affected by fires in NSW and Queensland. Leo Generaux from Tinonee, about 12km south-west of Taree, said on Sunday he didn\u2019t know if he had a house to return to. He and his wife had been evacuated twice in three days and had been told his neighbour\u2019s home had been destroyed. On Sunday, Generaux, aged in his 70s, was at the Club Taree evacuation centre watching for the arrival of Morrison and Berejiklian. \u201cWe were allowed to go in on Saturday to see our home and our neighbours, waiting at our door, told us their house had been burnt to the ground. We were in a state of shock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said, \u2018You can stay with us,\u2019 but they said, \u2018That\u2019s no good the fire hasn\u2019t finished yet,\u2019 and then in the afternoon we were evacuated again. There was a fire on the other side, the east side. \u201cThe smoke was billowing towards us and we got the phone call, \u2018Leave now\u2019. I have no idea if my house is still there. We left in a hurry, only one road was open. That\u2019s now closed. There is no way of telling what is going on at our property.\u201d In Terania Creek, near the Nightcap national park, Terri Nicholson spent Sunday watching fires move into private property on the western side of the valley and start heading south. Many residents in the immediate vicinity of multiple fires had been evacuated to The Channon, the nearest town. Nicholson\u2019s parents are Nan and Hugh Nicholson. Forty years ago they hosted the blockade that ultimately stopped logging of the rainforest near their property and saved rainforest in other parts of NSW. \u201cNan and Hugh Nicholson hosted the site of the Terania protest to defend this great rainforest from logging and now we\u2019re here defending it due to the effects of climate change,\u201d Nicholson said from her parents\u2019 property. \u201cI don\u2019t even have the words right now. It\u2019s just gobsmacking and distressing to witness.\u201d Nicholson said residents were preparing for conditions to worsen over the next few days. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing rainforest burn. There\u2019s fire threatening our houses right now,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThere\u2019s fire trucks, volunteers. The local fire service is incredible, they\u2019re protecting our home. This is the home I grew up in. My childhood home. My parents\u2019 land. \u201cIt\u2019s quite intense to see ancient, iconic rainforest burn \u2013 this delicate ecosystem \u2013 and see firefighters here risking their lives and just to see global heating in action.\u201d In Queensland, more than 50 fires were burning on Sunday and emergency warnings were still in place at Cooroibah and Ringtail Creek, north of Noosa on the Sunshine Coast. Fires had destroyed houses, sheds and cars and forced thousands of people to flee their homes. A firefighter suffered a broken leg but no lives have been lost or other injuries reported. The winds and hot and dry conditions that have stoked blazes are set to continue on Sunday, ease on Monday, and worsen on Tuesday, challenging crews and people battling to save their homes. The emergency warnings for Cobraball and nearby Bungundarra have eased but people are warned to be on the alert because conditions could get worse. They face an anxious wait to see if their homes are still standing because they can\u2019t return until it is safe to do so. Red Cross Queensland\u2019s emergency services manager, Colin Sivalingum, said it was a traumatic time for people in evacuation centres. \u201cMost people just want to go back home to see what\u2019s actually happening. That\u2019s making them very anxious. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us,\u201d he told the ABC. \u2022 Additional reporting by Australian Associated Press",

Confirmation bias has always run deep in politics, but social media has multiplied the possibilities exponentially. When a candidate has no fixed position, we tend to fill in the blanks to our own satisfaction. It\u2019s why staying quiet or being confusing about one\u2019s true principles can be a winner for politicians. </p> <p>A candidate who flip-flops over one issue may not lose trust, depending on the reasons for the flip-flopping or how much a voter cares about that particular issue. A candidate who flip-flops on issue after issue, like a teenager trying on outfits, raises questions of reliability. On election day, a key question we should ask ourselves is: am I voting for an inconsistent candidate who merely mouths something I want to hear?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019d like to be able to point to a golden age of trust in political integrity but there hasn\u2019t been one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next, competence. Political polls tend to ask voters: who do you trust the most? It\u2019s a terrible way of framing the trust question. The better question is: how much can we trust someone to do x, y or z? That is, to do a <em>specific</em> task. Redesign the NHS. Tackle climate change. Handle national security. Manage a budget of \u00a3800bn. Negotiate with the EU. That kind of contextual thinking gets us closer to assessing competence. I may trust Trump to tweet something stupid at 3am, but I don\u2019t trust his negotiation skills with Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un. I may trust Jeremy Corbyn to renationalise the rail service, but I don\u2019t trust him to write a \u201cletter of last resort\u201d to Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine chief commander, giving instructions of the actions to be taken if the country is obliterated by a nuclear strike . As a voter, I have to decide which of those trust andcompetence issues matter most to me.</p> <p>Third, empathy. During the Great Depression, the newly inaugurated President Franklin Roosevelt made few promises of quick fixes and did not try to sugar-coat the crisis. Through his broadcast fireside chats, however, he showed empathy to his frightened listeners. He asked the country to unite in vanquishing fear. He pulled diverse groups of people together through his sincerity and openness, apparently genuine. As Roosevelt said: \u201cNobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.\u201d </p> <p>Which brings us to integrity. I\u2019d like to be able to point to a golden age of trust in political integrity but there hasn\u2019t been one. Even when Winston Churchill was leading Britain to victory at the end of the last world war, a Gallup survey found people were almost evenly divided between those who believed political leaders were out to do their best for the country and those who believed they were only self-interested.</p> <p>Integrity comes down to intentions and motives. What do political leaders gain by lying? What are their interests and principles and are they aligned with mine? Do I believe they\u2019ll do the right thing for the right reasons? In the immortal words of Dr Seuss, which candidate \u201csays what they mean and means what they say\u201d? It matters. When we are standing in the privacy of the election booth, stubby pencil in hand, we\u2019re not just voting. We\u2019re part of a crucial exercise in trust.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Rachel Botsman is the author of </em>Who Can You Trust?<em> and a fellow at Oxford Business School</em></p>",

Confirmation bias has always run deep in politics, but social media has multiplied the possibilities exponentially. When a candidate has no fixed position, we tend to fill in the blanks to our own satisfaction. It\u2019s why staying quiet or being confusing about one\u2019s true principles can be a winner for politicians. A candidate who flip-flops over one issue may not lose trust, depending on the reasons for the flip-flopping or how much a voter cares about that particular issue. A candidate who flip-flops on issue after issue, like a teenager trying on outfits, raises questions of reliability. On election day, a key question we should ask ourselves is: am I voting for an inconsistent candidate who merely mouths something I want to hear? Next, competence. Political polls tend to ask voters: who do you trust the most? It\u2019s a terrible way of framing the trust question. The better question is: how much can we trust someone to do x, y or z? That is, to do a specific task. Redesign the NHS. Tackle climate change. Handle national security. Manage a budget of \u00a3800bn. Negotiate with the EU. That kind of contextual thinking gets us closer to assessing competence. I may trust Trump to tweet something stupid at 3am, but I don\u2019t trust his negotiation skills with Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong-un. I may trust Jeremy Corbyn to renationalise the rail service, but I don\u2019t trust him to write a \u201cletter of last resort\u201d to Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine chief commander, giving instructions of the actions to be taken if the country is obliterated by a nuclear strike . As a voter, I have to decide which of those trust andcompetence issues matter most to me. Third, empathy. During the Great Depression, the newly inaugurated President Franklin Roosevelt made few promises of quick fixes and did not try to sugar-coat the crisis. Through his broadcast fireside chats, however, he showed empathy to his frightened listeners. He asked the country to unite in vanquishing fear. He pulled diverse groups of people together through his sincerity and openness, apparently genuine. As Roosevelt said: \u201cNobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.\u201d Which brings us to integrity. I\u2019d like to be able to point to a golden age of trust in political integrity but there hasn\u2019t been one. Even when Winston Churchill was leading Britain to victory at the end of the last world war, a Gallup survey found people were almost evenly divided between those who believed political leaders were out to do their best for the country and those who believed they were only self-interested. Integrity comes down to intentions and motives. What do political leaders gain by lying? What are their interests and principles and are they aligned with mine? Do I believe they\u2019ll do the right thing for the right reasons? In the immortal words of Dr Seuss, which candidate \u201csays what they mean and means what they say\u201d? It matters. When we are standing in the privacy of the election booth, stubby pencil in hand, we\u2019re not just voting. We\u2019re part of a crucial exercise in trust. \u2022 Rachel Botsman is the author of Who Can You Trust? and a fellow at Oxford Business School",

For Daniel Osei, a student in Virginia, in the US, wearing matching makeup is a more recent venture. \u201cIt was her idea,\u201d he says of his girlfriend, JaLynn Evans, also a student. \u201cShe\u2019d always told me that I would look good with makeup on.\u201d The pair wore a matching look created by Evans for recent photos, also posted on Instagram. \u201cAll of our friends online loved it because they support the art form of makeup and are very open to new ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cIn real life, I got mixed responses initially but after a while people started to admit they really liked the shoot.\u201d The rise in couples coordinating their makeup is a win for \u201cgender-expansive identities\u201d, says Laura Kraber, chief executive and co-founder of the inclusive makeup brand Fluide. She says they are \u201cinspiring all of us to be more connected to our loved ones and more playful in both our relationships and our style\u201d.",

Fire conditions potentially worse than those seen on Friday have been forecast for Tuesday.<br></p> <p>On Tuesday, hot, dry and gusty conditions will affect much of NSW. Large parts of the state, including fire-affected areas of the north-east, as well as the Illawarra, the Blue Mountains, the central coast and the Hunter, and parts of the state\u2019s central west are being warned of severe to extreme fire danger.<br></p> <p>\u201cThere is potential for conditions on Tuesday to be worse than they were on Friday last week,\u201d Shabren said.<br></p> <p>\u201cVery high fire danger will persist in the affected areas up to Tuesday and even after it peaks on Tuesday, so there\u2019s very little respite.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any significant rainfall in the foreseeable future. The outlook is for drier and hotter conditions for the remainder of the year.\u201d<br></p> <p>Shabren said Tuesday\u2019s strong winds could also bring raised dust to parts of the state\u2019s west such as Dubbo, Condobolin and Parkes.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T03:55:05.887Z\">at 3.55am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5dc774098f08be4a102e63fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-10T02:30:22.359Z\">2.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Yesterday it was revealed that the federal government was prepared to deploy the Australian Defence Force in order to combat the fires.

police and emergency services, <strong>Lisa Neville</strong>, are with Black Saturday survivors today launching a new advertising campaign aimed at getting Victorians to prepare for the coming bushfire season.</p> <p>Victoria is currently experiencing cooler temperatures and some rain, but it is expected to be a hotter and drier summer. </p> <p>\u201cThis campaign is all about reminding people that fire is very real, very real indeed, and whether it be radiant heat that can take your life from 300m away or ember attack that can come from 40km away, the need for a plan and the need to be aware of the circumstances, the need to take action is absolutely paramount,\u201d Andrews said.</p> <p>\u201cBe prepared, take note of these ads, and really think about the plan,\u201d Neville said.</p> <p>Neville said the campaign was about making people think \u201chow well do you know fire?\u201d</p> <p>Information about the campaign can be found <a

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re preparing a full wrap of the bushfire crisis in NSW and Queensland as we speak. In the meantime, here\u2019s what we know: New South Wales Three people have died: Julie Fletcher, 63, in Johns River and the Wytaliba residents Vivian Chaplain, 69, and George Nole. Up to 30 people have been injured. At least 150 homes are destroyed and the figure is expected to rise. There are 72 fires burning across the state, with 36 not under control and 13 listed as watch and act. The Rural Fire Service has issued a warning that conditions will worsen on Tuesday, saying it will be a \u201cdangerous day\u201d and \u201chomes and lives will be at risk\u201d. There is a statewide total fire ban on Monday and Tuesday. Queensland There are 51 fires burning. Emergency warnings are continuing at Cooroibah and Ringtail Creek, north of Noosa on the Sunshine Coast. One home has been lost at Cooroibah and three sheds. One firefighter suffered a broken leg in the Cooroibah blaze. There is an emergency warning at Adelaide Park, part of the Cobraball and Bungundarra fire in the Yeppoon hinterland. Sixteen structures \u2013 including multiple homes \u2013 have been damaged or destroyed by this fire. More than 6,000 hectares of grazing, agricultural and bushland has been burnt. A state of fire emergency has been declared across 42 local government areas. On Tuesday the New South Wales lower house of parliament is due to debate legislation that would try to stop planning authorities from blocking mine developments based on emissions from coal once it is burned. With the bushfire crisis in NSW unfolding, environment advocates are calling on the government to postpone that debate. Protests are expected in Sydney on that day. Authorities have put in place a catastrophic fire danger forecast for the same day. \u201cThe NSW government did this kneejerk reaction in response to pressure from the mining industry to take climate change out of the consideration for new coalmines and gasfields,\u201d George Woods, a coordinator at Lock the Gate, said. \u201cWith the catastrophe unfolding around us in north-east NSW, this is the time to be listening to the people and responding effectively to climate change. \u201cWe would like them to withdraw the bill.\u201d NSW Labor has called for parliament to be suspended this week. The Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service has closed parts of the Byfield conservation, state and national parks due to bushfires. Warning signs are in place and campgrounds have been evacuated. The following campgrounds are now closed until advised it is safe to return: Upper Stony, Red Rock, Waterpark Creek, Five Rocks, Nine Mile Beach \u2013 Casuarina, Melaleuca, Myrtella and Pandanus \u2013 and Water Park Point Headland. All permits are suspended for the duration of the closure. For the first time ever, there has been a catastrophic fire danger forecast for Sydney on Tuesday. That is the highest level of bushfire danger, and homes are not designed to withstand fires in this level. The NSW Rural Fire Service says high temperatures, strong winds and low humidity is forecast for the Greater Sydney and Greater Hunter areas. Illawarra and the north coast regions are on extreme level, while the far north coast, New England, far south coast, southern ranges, and lower central west plains are on severe. It\u2019s for this reason a number of schools have been closed. Residents are advised to avoid bushfire-prone areas, and people have been told to go to safer areas such as large cities or towns away from bushland. Some schools will temporarily close tomorrow, the secretary of the Department of Education in NSW, Mark Scott, has announced. An emergency warning has been issued for residents in John River due to the Bills Crossing Crowdy fire. A total fire ban has been issued for the entire state of New South Wales for Monday and Tuesday due to the dangerous conditions expected over the next two days. Terri Nicholson is a resident of Terania Creek near the world heritage-listed Nightcap national park. Forty years ago her parents, Nan and Hugh Nicholson, hosted the blockade that ultimately stopped logging of the rainforest near their property and saved rainforest in other parts of NSW. She says now they are watching it burn. \u201cNan and Hugh Nicholson hosted the site of the Terania protest to defend this great rainforest from logging and now we\u2019re here defending it due to the effects of climate change,\u201d Nicholson said from her parents\u2019 property. \u201cI don\u2019t even have the words right now. It\u2019s just gobsmacking and distressing to witness.\u201d Out of control fires have spread from the Nightcap national park into private property on the western side of the valley and on Sunday were heading south. Many residents in the immediate vicinity have been evacuated to The Channon, the nearest town. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing rainforest burn. There\u2019s fire threatening our houses right now,\u201d Nicholson said. \u201cThere\u2019s fire trucks, volunteers. The local fire service is incredible, they\u2019re protecting our home. This is the home I grew up in. My childhood home. My parents\u2019 land. \u201cIt\u2019s quite intense to see ancient, iconic rainforest burn \u2013 this delicate ecosystem \u2013 and see firefighters here risking their lives and just to see global heating in action.\u201d Nicholson said residents were preparing for conditions to worsen over the next few days. She said right now people were responding to the immediate crisis. But Terania Creek was an environmentally engaged community with a history of caring for the forest, opposing gas fields and now being active on the climate crisis. \u201cThere is anger at politicians for continuing to be blind and continuing to support and promote activities that make the situation worse,\u201d she said. \u201cAnger at the wilful ignorance of politicians who are ignoring increasing risk to our people, our natural system and the economy. \u201cWe saw volunteers risking their lives yesterday and again today. The drought and the fires have now become very personal for our family. It\u2019s incredibly personal having it on your doorstep.\u201d New South Wales Labor is calling for state parliament to be suspended for the week. Via AAP: NSW Labor is calling for the upcoming week of state parliament be suspended so politicians can be with the communities they represent while they battle devastating bushfires. Manager of opposition business Ryan Park on Sunday wrote to Speaker Jonathan O\u2019Dea to ask that the reserve week instead be used to finalise any legislation. \u201cThe communities impacted by this horrific situation need all the support they can get and we are of the firm view that elected Members can help their constituents better by being in their electorate,\u201d Mr Park said in a statement. \u201cMembers need to be there for the community the next week when the full extent of the damage caused will become more evident.\u201d Mr Park said the situation was unprecedented and Labor believed parliament shouldn\u2019t sit next week as a result. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, had this to say about this tweet from Greens MP Adam Bandt: \u201cThis is despicable. The fact is, at this time, as David Littleproud has just said, we want to put this above politics. People who are at risk of losing their homes or people have already lost their homes or pets, indeed lost family members, don\u2019t need to hear politicians coming out and starting to play the same game,\u201d he said. McCormack said Adam Bandt should think before making \u201csuch stupid and callous comments\u201d like that. \u201cThe fact is, the government does take climate change very seriously. The fact is we are meeting our international obligations and will continue to do so.\u201d (The UN might dispute that though, we aren\u2019t for 2030.) \u201cAustralians get through these because we are a resilient bunch,\u201d McCormack said. \u201cWe stick together, we band together, we make sure that we help those in need and comments coming from a little Melbourne apartment from a little individual with a little mind should not be accepted or tolerated at this time.\u201d The Bureau of Meteorology says the fire conditions in NSW are expected to remain persistent for most of Sunday. That is, dry conditions, driven by a high pressure system, and south-westerly wind gusts of up to 35km/h in some areas, such as Armidale. Those winds are expected to be constant for most of the afternoon, however, a change of direction to south-easterly winds is forecast for the later part of the afternoon. Abrar Shabren, a forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, said that could change the direction of the fire and \u201ccan be a significant problem for firefighters on the ground\u201d. He said the winds will ease into Monday, but there will be little respite. Fire conditions potentially worse than those seen on Friday have been forecast for Tuesday. On Tuesday, hot, dry and gusty conditions will affect much of NSW. Large parts of the state, including fire-affected areas of the north-east, as well as the Illawarra, the Blue Mountains, the central coast and the Hunter, and parts of the state\u2019s central west are being warned of severe to extreme fire danger. \u201cThere is potential for conditions on Tuesday to be worse than they were on Friday last week,\u201d Shabren said. \u201cVery high fire danger will persist in the affected areas up to Tuesday and even after it peaks on Tuesday, so there\u2019s very little respite. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any significant rainfall in the foreseeable future. The outlook is for drier and hotter conditions for the remainder of the year.\u201d Shabren said Tuesday\u2019s strong winds could also bring raised dust to parts of the state\u2019s west such as Dubbo, Condobolin and Parkes. Yesterday it was revealed that the federal government was prepared to deploy the Australian Defence Force in order to combat the fires. When asked about this, Morrison said that the response from the NSW government had been \u201coutstanding\u201d and if the state needed more support, the state government would ask for it. When he was asked about climate change, someone heckled back to the journalist \u201coh please!\u201d Morrison said his focus was on what was happening on the ground. \u201cOne of the stories I heard today and the commissioner has referred to it because it is not uncommon, you have firefighters out there saving someone else\u2019s house while their own house is burning down,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when we are in that sort of a situation, that is where attention must be.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, are holding a press conference in Taree after being briefed by the Rural Fire Service. Berejiklian said neighbours in the region have to rally around each other. \u201cWhat has really hit me today is even though some people know that their homes are OK, they are still extremely traumatised by what they have experienced, by what they have seen, what their neighbours are going through. So just because someone\u2019s property is safe doesn\u2019t mean they are OK and we are appealing to everybody to please watch out for your neighbours, please know that there is help available.\u201d Berejiklian said it had been humbling as premier to come to Taree and hear everyone\u2019s stories. Morrison agreed. \u201cI have to tell you as a prime minister I am never more proud of Australians than in moments like these,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just show incredible spirit, incredible heart, incredible generosity.\u201d Morrison also thanked the employers of the volunteer firefighters who wouldn\u2019t be at work. \u201cThey cannot come to work tomorrow or the day after or the day after that, then I would ask you to continue to support them in that and I thank you for the way you have supported them. They will have to be there running their businesses and they will be doing it a bit shorthanded.\u201d They both warned, as we have heard today, that conditions in NSW are expected to be dire on Tuesday. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and the minister for police and emergency services, Lisa Neville, are with Black Saturday survivors today launching a new advertising campaign aimed at getting Victorians to prepare for the coming bushfire season. Victoria is currently experiencing cooler temperatures and some rain, but it is expected to be a hotter and drier summer. \u201cThis campaign is all about reminding people that fire is very real, very real indeed, and whether it be radiant heat that can take your life from 300m away or ember attack that can come from 40km away, the need for a plan and the need to be aware of the circumstances, the need to take action is absolutely paramount,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cBe prepared, take note of these ads, and really think about the plan,\u201d Neville said. Neville said the campaign was about making people think \u201chow well do you know fire?\u201d Information about the campaign can be found here. Some images from photographers out in the field over the past day. The Bureau of Meteorology has warned the winds, in combination with the hot and dry conditions, mean the fire danger is very high across the entire east coast of Queensland, and much of the north of the state. My colleague, Paul Karp, picked up this heckler while the prime minister was being briefed in Wauchope. Freelance reporter Christine Tondorf is speaking to bushfire evacuees in Taree, where the prime minister, Scott Morrison, is due to pay a visit. Leo Generaux from Tinonee, 20km south-west of Taree, doesn\u2019t know if he has a house to return to. He has been evacuated twice in three days and has been told his neighbour\u2019s house no longer stands, but has not been able to find out if his house is also burnt. Generaux, aged in his 70s, and his dog, April, are sitting at the entrance of Club Taree watching the pool of journalists gathered for the arrival of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, due at 11.45am. Generaux says he and his wife are now questioning whether they should be living on their rural acreage in the community of 300 people. \u201cWe were allowed to go in on Saturday and our neighbours, waiting at our door, told us their house had been burnt to the ground. We were in a state of shock,\u201d Generaux says. \u201cWe said you can stay with us, but they said \u2018that\u2019s no good the fire hasn\u2019t finished yet\u2019, and then in the afternoon we were evacuated again. Now there was a fire on the other side, the east side. \u201cThe smoke was billowing towards us and we got the phone call, \u2018leave now\u2019. I have no idea if my house is still there. We left in a hurry, only one road was open. That\u2019s now closed. There is no way of telling what is going on at our property.\u201d Generaux says he and his wife run a small mango hobby farm, but describes the fires as a \u201cmind changer\u201d. \u201cThe whole idea of living in the country now is becoming a bigger risk than it\u2019s ever been. Personally if we lose the house we will just sell up and move into a regional town so we don\u2019t have to ever do this again.\u201d Generaux, who is originally from the US, has lived in his Tinonee home for 10 years and is optimistic he may get home today, but no one can tell him when the main Tinonee road will be open. \u201cClimate change is not political. Climate change is a scientific fact,\u201d the Glen Innes Severn mayor, Carol Sparks, said on ABC News. Her home was severely damaged in the fires. The identity of the third victim of the bushfires in New South Wales has been released \u2013 Julie Fletcher\u2019s body was found in a burnt-out home in North Taree. Vivian Chaplain reportedly died defending her home in Wytaliba, while George Nole\u2019s body was found in a burnt-out car in Glen Innes. The five people who were missing at the start of Sunday have since been located. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is holding a press conference. She says there are still 51 active fires across the state, and 382 vehicles and 1,200 firefighters out in the field. There will still be poor conditions over the next week, she says, with Queensland expected to have its worst day on Wednesday. All schools in Queensland will be open tomorrow. She urged residents to listen to authorities. \u201cPlease, if you get an emergency warning, if you are told to leave, please do not hesitate. Do not hesitate at all,\u201d she said. The Queensland government will also be monitoring smoke haze throughout the south east of the state, as well as in Rockhampton and Yeppoon, she said. \u201cI have been speaking to the chief health officer as well. If you do suffer from asthma, please stay indoors. Please make sure that you are monitoring your health.\u201d There are no missing people in Queensland, and the only person injured is a young boy burnt yesterday. It is worth repeating that the NSW Rural Fire Service is warning Tuesday will be a very dangerous day. \u201cWe are looking down the barrel of a busy few days and potentially a dangerous day come Tuesday,\u201d the RFS inspector Ben Shepherd told Seven News on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get as many of these fires under control before the onset of that weather on Tuesday, but look we won\u2019t have these fires under control by that stage, we\u2019ll have to concentrate where it is burning close to residential areas.\u201d Conditions have eased in NSW today but around half of the 72 fires across the state are still out of control. Hot and windy conditions from the west will travel east across Monday into Tuesday, and that is when it will be the hottest, with low humidity, making it extremely dangerous. Shepherd said areas not currently affected by fires, including in the Sydney region as well as the Illawarra, could be in danger on Tuesday. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, are in Wauchope this morning being briefed by the Rural Fire Service. The situation in Queensland, via AAP: Massive bushfires that have destroyed houses, sheds and cars and forced thousands to flee their homes continue to burn in Queensland. Fifty-five fires were burning in the state on Sunday morning, including the huge fire at Cooroibah, north of Noosa, where an emergency zone remains. One house has been lost at Cooroibah on the Sunshine Coast along with three sheds, cars and wildlife. Multiple homes were also reportedly lost over night north of Rockhampton when a fire tore through Cobraball and nearby Bungundarra. Fire and emergency services can\u2019t confirm that until assessment teams enter the area. Thousands have people have been evacuated from the paths of the fires burning in Queensland. Some estimates say up to 9,000 were evacuated from suburbs at the northern end of Noosa due to the Cooroibah fire. Brian Williams, 61, says his shed and several cars on his block on Lake Cooroibah Road were destroyed on Friday. He was out but his 18-year-old son, Beau, was studying at home and called his father. \u201cHe said \u2018hey dad, the fire is right on us\u2019,\u201d Mr Williams told the ABC. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t get the fire pump going, it was all panic. \u201cHe said, \u2018listen, I have to go\u2019, and as he is going, trees were exploding around him and embers were flying over and kangaroos were running alongside him.\u201d A firefighter suffered a broken leg but no lives have been lost or other injuries reported. The winds and hot and dry conditions that have stoked blazes are set to continue on Sunday, ease on Monday, and worsen on Tuesday, challenging crews and people battling to save their homes. The emergency warnings for Cobraball and nearby Bungundarra have eased but people are warned to be on the alert because conditions could get worse. They face an anxious wait to see if their homes are still standing because they can\u2019t return until it is safe to do so. Red Cross Queensland emergency services manager Colin Sivalingum said it was a traumatic time for people in evacuation centres. \u201cMost people just want to go back home to see what\u2019s actually happening. That\u2019s making them very anxious. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us,\u201d he told the ABC. A state of fire emergency was declared on Saturday in 42 local government areas, prohibiting all outdoor fires and activities such as welding that can spark fires. People were also told to evacuate ahead of bushfires at Tarome in the Scenic Rim west of the Gold Coast and Thornton in the Lockyer Valley on Saturday but those warnings have been downgraded. People have been warned not to return to their homes until it is safe to do so. Authorities say swathes of bushland parched by drought have increased the risk of fires breaking out. Almost 100,000 hectares and 19 homes have been destroyed in Queensland since the start of September, with 2,000 bushfires burning since then. The NSW Rural Fire Service reports all those who were reported missing have been found. The NSW Rural Fire Service is warning people not to get complacent despite the easing conditions today, given the worsening conditions in the next few days. Smoke haze is also a major issue in fire-affected areas. You can get a sense of the amount of smoke from this graphic from the Bureau of Meteorology. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has told Insiders he offered to go to fire-affected areas when he spoke with the prime minister yesterday and would visit those areas if it was appropriate to do so. Meanwhile in Western Australia, it appears a bushfire in Gnangara has eased overnight, after homes were damaged and two people from a nearby retirement village were taken to hospital. Information on the latest conditions in WA can be found here. David Littleproud, the minister for natural disaster and emergency management, is on the ABC announcing that disaster recovery payments of $1,000 for adults and $400 for children will be made available through Centrelink for people affected by the fires in Queensland and New South Wales from midday today. \u201cWe say to those people \u2013 please do not self-assess, make the call to Centrelink and they will be able to support you even if you lost everything. If you don\u2019t have any identification, you don\u2019t have any of your bankcards or anything, we\u2019ll get you one,\u201d he said. He said Centrelink would attempt to get buses up to the Gold Coast hinterland and Port Macquarie to support people in those areas. When asked whether the fires were a wake-up call for the federal government to develop proper plans for resourcing to fight fires, Littleproud said the government had been prepared. \u201cWe have been ready for these fires \u2013 we predicted they would be earlier this year because of the research work that the state and federal governments have done together, putting aside politics,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work that way, to make sure our investments give us the best science, the best technology we need and then also equip our firefighters with the best tools. We\u2019ve got the best firefighters in the world and our job as federal and state governments is to support them with the science and the tools to be able to fight fires and keep us all safe.\u201d The NSW rural fire service deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers, told the ABC on Sunday morning that the focus for Sunday is on fires on the north coast of the state. He said the fires are likely to flare up again on Tuesday when conditions are worse, and will threaten properties again. He said areas on the north coast where there are already fires will be the biggest concern with strong westerly winds and low humidity on Tuesday. There aren\u2019t any fires in the Sydney, Illawarra and central west areas at the moment, but Rogers said on Tuesday those areas would be a major concern. He said the RFS was looking at how best to deploy resources, as well as keep people in those areas informed to ensure they\u2019re ready on Tuesday. He said there should be an update on the reported five missing people later this morning. Despite all the fires raging throughout the state, there is no total fire ban in New South Wales. The Rural Fire Service says it is using the slightly improved conditions today to strengthen containment lines before it gets worse in the next few days. And in Queensland, there has been a state of emergency declared across half the state, with 42 local government areas affected by fires as of Sunday, from the Gold Coast up to Townsville. Around 5,000 homes have been evacuated and one home reportedly destroyed. You can see the affected areas and the declaration here. Good morning, we will continue to follow the ongoing fire crises in New South Wales and Queensland today. For those in fire-affected areas, please listen to your local emergency broadcaster, and follow instructions from fire crews and authorities. There are multiple warnings still current and the situation remains volatile. See online updates for New South Wales and Queensland. There are 72 fires burning across New South Wales as of Sunday morning, 36 of which are out of control. Eleven fires remain at watch and act. Conditions are expected to worsen over the next few days, including a \u201cpotentially dangerous day\u201d on Tuesday, according to NSW rural fire service inspector Ben Shepherd. Three people have been killed, with seven reported missing. Wytaliba resident Vivian Chaplain, 69, has been confirmed as one of the victims, while an elderly man in Wytaliba is believed to be the second victim, and a body was found in a home in North Taree 150 homes have been destroyed, with that tally expected to go up significantly as assessment teams go through the affected areas. Some fire stations have also been destroyed South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania are sending fire crews to NSW. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian and prime minister Scott Morrison will visit affected communities on Sunday. About 2,000 people have evacuated to 15 evacuation centres set up.",

The county won\u2019t make much difference to the overall outcome of the presidential election as Kansas is a solidly Republican state.

      "bodyText": "Steve Isley sees no reason not to believe what Donald Trump has to say about Congress\u2019s impeachment investigation. \u201cThe Democrats have been trying to impeach him ever since he got elected, so I\u2019m not too wild about it,\u201d said the retired construction worker. \u201cSo far I\u2019m doubtful they have any evidence.\u201d But even Isley, who is planning to vote for the president again next year and scorns all Democrats as \u201csocialists\u201d, is prepared to keep open the possibility that, as the first public hearings begin in Congress next week, the investigation might reveal wrongdoing by Trump that would make impeachment legitimate. \u201cIt\u2019d have to be something along the lines of Nixon,\u201d he said of the president who resigned over Watergate. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad enough at this point.\u201d Isley, who grew up on a Kansas farm, lives in Johnson county, a Kansas City suburb that flipped from supporting Trump in 2016 to unseat a Republican and elect Sharice Davids, a gay Native American, to Congress as a Democrat two years later. The swing in votes reflected a shift away from Trump in suburbs across America that would appear to complicate his re-election in 2020 if he\u2019s unable to bolster support elsewhere, particularly in rural areas of swing states. The impeachment hearings unfolding in Washington, which will enter their public phase on Wednesday, look unlikely to help. The Republican leadership\u2019s efforts to whip up outrage against the process as illegitimate, including a stunt where members of Congress stormed a room where witness depositions were being taken to claim Democrats were trying the president in secret, has again riled a hard core of Trump supporters to rally angrily in his defense. But there is also a part of the electorate that voted for him \u2013 less ideological Republican supporters and independents \u2013 who are prepared to see where the evidence leads. They have a more open mind than Trump campaign strategists would like. A Fox News poll showed nearly half of Americans favor impeaching the president and one-third of those opposed could change their minds if presented with new evidence. \u201cI vote Republican or I don\u2019t vote,\u201d said Bill Harris, a business manager who supports Trump. \u201cThis is all political. Nancy Pelosi is out to get Trump. Anyone can see that. That\u2019s Washington. But I do think he has questions to answer. We need to hear the evidence, hear the people who were there. I\u2019m not against that.\u201d Harris said he knows of others who voted for Trump whose doubts about the president have been stacking up and that if there is evidence of wrongdoing it would turn them away from him. \u201cThere are those who defend him no matter what and then there are those people who think he\u2019s too unpredictable, too unstable. He\u2019s done some good things on trade but I think there are a lot of Republicans like myself who have doubts and concerns. I wish he would keep his mouth shut,\u201d he said. Then he added an afterthought. \u201cIt would be a mistake for the Democrats to remove him. They should let the election do that. If the Democrats have the evidence, the voters will make the decision,\u201d he said. That is precisely what some Johnson county Democrats are counting on. The county won\u2019t make much difference to the overall outcome of the presidential election as Kansas is a solidly Republican state. But it will be crucial in Davids\u2019 fight for re-election and maintaining Democratic control of Congress, and it is reflective of the shift in other big city suburbs across the midwest, which will have an important say in who wins in 2020. Nancy Leiker, the chair of the Johnson county Democratic party, said impeachment is not the most important issue for most voters. That remains healthcare. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help but think that as the investigation goes on and becomes more public, those numbers will change,\u201d she said. Leiker said opposition to Trump has drawn more people into campaigning and Democrats think the impeachment hearings can only help. Cassie Woolworth, a contract IT analyst and single mother of three boys, was among those who largely ignored politics until Trump was elected. \u201cMy generation of women took their eye off the ball. We thought the battles were won,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he got elected, I was so angry. I felt so defeated.\u201d So Woolworth joined a local women\u2019s branch of the Democratic Party and banged on doors to get Davids elected in 2018. She was also out campaigning in local elections last week. \u201cYou\u2019re already seeing the independents here stepping back from the Republican party. I think it\u2019s because Trump keeps speaking,\u201d she said. Woolworth thinks the impeachment process will evolve into a political test for Republican members of Congress from midwestern states. \u201cOnce people have heard the evidence, they will be judged by voters over how they voted on impeachment,\u201d she said. Some people will not take very much convincing. Kent Tyler, an artist who voted for George W Bush and then Barack Obama, regards Trump with disdain but is waiting to see what the impeachment hearings reveal. \u201cBefore I make up my mind, I want to see what will come to light. I think it\u2019s very important,\u201d he said. \u201cI call myself a conservative Democrat. I used to be in the middle. Undeclared. Once Trump got into office, and he started doing his stuff, I switched to Democrat. Things need to be brought to light. I think the evidence is going to be very damaging.\u201d Still Tyler worries about what the impact of the hearings on an already divided country. \u201cSo much hate has been made in America, I think it\u2019s going to get very nasty,\u201d he said.",

Seldon is told by one official: \u201cShe was the least collegiate prime minister I ever worked with, worse even than Gordon Brown because she was not as bright and lacked his intelligence and vision.\u201d</p> <p>She and Philip Hammond, another vinegary character, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/12/bad-blood-flows-neighbours-downing-street-philip-hammond-theresa-may-budget\" title=\"\">loathed each other</a>. \u201cTheresa, that\u2019s not how it works,\u201d the chancellor would say patronisingly. It turned sour almost instantly and became the most toxic relationship between prime minister and chancellor in many decades, worse even than that between Blair and Brown, and without any of the compensating successes of that duo. There\u2019s a great anecdote about May and Hammond attending the Davos forum in the Swiss Alps. May is helicoptered off the mountains to the airport for the journey home and finds that her jet has gone missing. \u201cWhere\u2019s my plane?\u201d she demands and is told by the RAF officer in charge that the chancellor has taken it. \u201cShe went absolutely crazy,\u201d reports one witness. \u201cHer whole body contorted in anger and indignation.\u201d</p> <p>Under pressure, she had a tendency to retreat from everyone except her husband, Philip, into a \u201cbunker of two\u201d. The election campaign started to unravel when her social care policy, quickly tagged a \u201cdementia tax\u201d, came under ferocious attack. She could have mounted a confident defence or conducted an elegant retreat. She did neither, instead disappearing to her home in Maidenhead and going incommunicado as the storm raged around flailing and divided aides. Having signed off on a campaign entirely designed around her, when it started to fall apart she became \u201csurly and miserable\u201d and petulantly complained: \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be about me.\u201d</p> <p>She knew little about Europe when she came to office, but lacked the intellectual self-confidence to seek out advice beyond her tiny troupe of trusties, a fatal handicap when it came to formulating a workable strategy for Brexit. She was increasingly ridiculed for the robotic nature of her public performances. Behind closed doors, fists were banged on desks, rows became expletive-laden and there were tears, quite a lot of tears. Then again, there was quite a lot to cry about.</p> <p>Seldon, a fair-minded man who always strives to find some virtues in every prime minister that he studies, argues that May did advance parts of her domestic agenda, dealt with Donald Trump as well as anyone could, and \u201cmight well have become a reasonably good, if unspectacular, prime minister\u201d had it not been for Brexit. He acquits her of some of the worst charges that have been levelled against her. The maladroit response to the Grenfell inferno, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/13/pm-on-grenfell-i-do-not-know-why-official-help-took-so-long-to-come\" title=\"\">when she initially failed to meet any of its victims</a>, was not an example of cold indifference to the suffering of others. Her security told her she couldn\u2019t visit the site of the disaster because it would trigger a riot. She later spent considerable time with Grenfell survivors and kept drawings by the Grenfell children in her office to the end of her days at No 10.</p> <p>Had she been able to display more empathy and emotional intelligence in public, she might have been a more successful prime minister. Then again, probably not. She had a tireless work ethic, a keen eye for detail and was driven by duty as well as ambition, but she was woefully short of many of the other skills required to prosper at the very top.</p> <p>Authoritative and insightful, this work adds to the already formidable canon of the prolific Seldon, author of more than 40 books. He and his battalion of researchers had just six months to produce this account of a complex premiership and yet the clear prose never reads as if written in a slapdash hurry. Though there doesn\u2019t seem to have been much, if any, cooperation from May herself, the book draws on interviews with many of the key players. It also exploits to excellent effect Seldon\u2019s contacts within the civil service and his capacity to get senior officials to talk frankly. If you want to know who did what when and why, this book will tell you. Seldon excels at piecing together how critical decisions came to be made before coming to well-reasoned judgments about their wisdom and impact.</p> <p>A very different character, a man that May thought \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to be prime minister, is now hoping to succeed where she failed. I look forward to Johnson at 10, though it is impossible at this moment to know whether that will be another big book or a very short one.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p> <p><em>\u2022 May at 10</em> by Anthony Seldon is published by Biteback (\u00a325).

May is helicoptered off the mountains to the airport for the journey home and finds that her jet has gone missing. \u201cWhere\u2019s my plane?\u201d she demands and is told by the RAF officer in charge that the chancellor has taken it. \u201cShe went absolutely crazy,\u201d reports one witness. \u201cHer whole body contorted in anger and indignation.\u201d Under pressure, she had a tendency to retreat from everyone except her husband, Philip, into a \u201cbunker of two\u201d. The election campaign started to unravel when her social care policy, quickly tagged a \u201cdementia tax\u201d, came under ferocious attack. She could have mounted a confident defence or conducted an elegant retreat. She did neither, instead disappearing to her home in Maidenhead and going incommunicado as the storm raged around flailing and divided aides. Having signed off on a campaign entirely designed around her, when it started to fall apart she became \u201csurly and miserable\u201d and petulantly complained: \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be about me.\u201d She knew little about Europe when she came to office, but lacked the intellectual self-confidence to seek out advice beyond her tiny troupe of trusties, a fatal handicap when it came to formulating a workable strategy for Brexit. She was increasingly ridiculed for the robotic nature of her public performances. Behind closed doors, fists were banged on desks, rows became expletive-laden and there were tears, quite a lot of tears. Then again, there was quite a lot to cry about. Seldon, a fair-minded man who always strives to find some virtues in every prime minister that he studies, argues that May did advance parts of her domestic agenda, dealt with Donald Trump as well as anyone could, and \u201cmight well have become a reasonably good, if unspectacular, prime minister\u201d had it not been for Brexit. He acquits her of some of the worst charges that have been levelled against her. The maladroit response to the Grenfell inferno, when she initially failed to meet any of its victims, was not an example of cold indifference to the suffering of others. Her security told her she couldn\u2019t visit the site of the disaster because it would trigger a riot. She later spent considerable time with Grenfell survivors and kept drawings by the Grenfell children in her office to the end of her days at No 10. Had she been able to display more empathy and emotional intelligence in public, she might have been a more successful prime minister. Then again, probably not. She had a tireless work ethic, a keen eye for detail and was driven by duty as well as ambition, but she was woefully short of many of the other skills required to prosper at the very top. Authoritative and insightful, this work adds to the already formidable canon of the prolific Seldon, author of more than 40 books. He and his battalion of researchers had just six months to produce this account of a complex premiership and yet the clear prose never reads as if written in a slapdash hurry. Though there doesn\u2019t seem to have been much, if any, cooperation from May herself, the book draws on interviews with many of the key players. It also exploits to excellent effect Seldon\u2019s contacts within the civil service and his capacity to get senior officials to talk frankly. If you want to know who did what when and why, this book will tell you. Seldon excels at piecing together how critical decisions came to be made before coming to well-reasoned judgments about their wisdom and impact. A very different character, a man that May thought \u201cmorally unfit\u201d to be prime minister, is now hoping to succeed where she failed. I look forward to Johnson at 10, though it is impossible at this moment to know whether that will be another big book or a very short one. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer \u2022 May at 10 by Anthony Seldon is published by Biteback (\u00a325).

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, on his morning run up the Hollywood Deep Dell, Matthew Frost began taking pictures of tourists capturing their own moments in front of the famous sign. The Los Angeles film-maker built up a collection: monks in orange robes goofing around; a mother in a onesie; an Irish travel blogger; a bemused park ranger; a barefoot woman with a sweatshirt tied round her neck; four Valley girls on their way to brunch; a Dynamo Moscow fan taking a picture of the team\u2019s mascot; a Chinese family in Levi\u2019s T-shirts; \u201csome German guys in blue\u201d. The photographs are now collected in a book, I Saw The Sign, which tells us something about celebrity, something about tourism and something about capturing moments in time. For Frost, not knowing what he\u2019s going to find up at the sign gives his routine a precious sense of the unknown. \u201cPeople line up to stand on these two rocks that sit in the path,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s symbolic, because it doesn\u2019t really change your perspective. It\u2019s funny, because we\u2019re used to people posing for selfies in front of [the Leaning Tower of] Pisa or the Louvre.

The agrochemical companies are not having as much luck keeping foreign leaders in line, however, amid growing global awareness of the risks many pesticides spell for human health. Thailand joins dozens of countries that have already banned or are planning bans on paraquat, chlorpyrifos and/or glyphosate. Thailand\u2019s national hazardous substances committee voted last month to ban all three due to the dangers established by scientific evidence. Thailand\u2019s leaders were motivated in part by research showing that use of these chemicals in agriculture not only puts farm workers at risk, but also endangers consumers because the bug and weed killers\u2019 residues persist in fruits, vegetables, grains and other foods.

They were a national TV blockbuster, beamed into millions of homes in the days before media fragmentation, internet echo chambers and alternative facts. This week, House Democrats will hope to recreate that sense of occasion when they begin public impeachment hearings regarding Donald Trump and his attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Televised hearings will \u201cbe an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves\u201d, Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, has said. But it will also be a battle with Republicans in the court of public opinion. At stake is the framing of a narrative crucial to the impact of the hearings for an impeachment vote, the 2020 presidential election and the history books. Schiff will hope to avoid a replay of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony in July, about which the broadcaster Chuck Todd commented: \u201cOn optics, this was a disaster.\u201d Todd was widely criticised but it did become clear that Mueller\u2019s stumbling performance failed to shift public opinion as Democrats had hoped. The Watergate hearings, prompted by a break-in at Democratic party headquarters and a cover-up, gripped the nation as the evidence against Richard Nixon built hour after hour, day after day, over seven months.

No such thing exists. Yes, I know no one wants to hear that, but it\u2019s the truth. You can love a foundation that suddenly decides it no longer loves you.

There are 23 shades, so the range is not extensive (to be fair that is relatively speaking), but it is evenly spread across all skin tones and the clever formulation takes undertones into consideration.

Cows require a lot of water, a lot of food and a lot of land but we don\u2019t have enough of any of these. We can recycle, drive electric cars, we can shower less, but these changes can\u2019t compete with reducing consumption by one hamburger per week.\u201d</p> <p>Reducing beef production would result in a huge reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and far less clearance of wild countryside for grazing land. Other meats, such as pork and fish, will soon be added to the menu, reducing the need for pig-rearing or fishing.</p> <p>The health benefits are substantial too, said Ben-Shitrit. \u201cIf you eat meat, there are nutritional advantages and disadvantages. But definitely people consume too much. Plant-based products don\u2019t contain cholesterol or the pathogens that exist in meat.\u201d</p> <p>They would therefore be attractive to many vegetarians who could gain the nutritional value without a moral dilemma. Poorer nations, where traditional meat is too expensive for most of the population, will also benefit in time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc68bf8b4de0c7a8fa581e1500a68e4af618e405\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc68bf8b4de0c7a8fa581e1500a68e4af618e405/0_0_2310_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giuseppe Scionti, CEO of Novameat, with a prototype of his printer in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giuseppe Scionti, CEO of Novameat, with a prototype of his printer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Scionti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Redefine Meat will pilot its plant-based meat in restaurants throughout Europe early in 2020, so British diners could have next year\u2019s Christmas lunches printed for them. It has already served hundreds of people in Israel and conducted tastings in Europe. The products will initially be more expensive than traditional meat \u2013 the firm is aiming for a price point around \u00a328 per kg, twice the cost of British supermarket sirloin steak \u2013 but this will come down over time and should, eventually, be cheaper than traditional meat.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good, tasty meat that we produce here,\u201d said Ben-Shitrit.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is how to scale up so you can put it in a butcher\u2019s shop in London day in, day out. So our business model is to sell the machines and the ingredients, not the finished meat.\u201d</p> <p>Worldwide, meat production is booming. According to UN figures, in the early 1960s, around 70 million tonnes of meat was produced. By 2017, that had multiplied to more than 330 million tonnes. Britons eat about 80kg of meat each per year.</p> <p>The technology for 3D-printed meat is improving rapidly. Last month, another Israeli firm, <a href=\"https://www.aleph-farms.com/\" title=\"\">Aleph Farms</a>, printed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/07/wheres-the-beef-248-miles-up-as-first-meat-is-grown-in-a-space-lab\" title=\"\">meat produced from cow muscle cells on the International Space Station</a>. The company says its meat will be on general sale a few years from now.</p> <p>Before then, Spanish-based <a href=\"https://www.novameat.com/\" title=\"\">Novameat</a> expects to have its plant-based printers in Spanish and Italian restaurants by the end of 2020, and in British restaurants soon after. Its CEO, Giuseppe Scionti, plans to have the machines in supermarkets in 2021 and in homes a year or two later.</p> <p>Pea and rice proteins are fed into Novameat\u2019s printers in capsules like those for an espresso machine. They contain a red paste that is turned into realistic steak or chicken. Salmon, lamb and pork capsules will be coming soon. Scionti believes the quality of what comes out \u2013 steaks and chicken fillets that mimic the taste and fibrous texture of meat \u2013 will be the key to its success.</p> <p>The British market is a major target. \u201cIn Britain, the \u2018flexitarian\u2019 [largely vegetarian, but sometimes eating meat] movement is very big \u2013 around one third of the population,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis way you can support biodiversity and avoid food waste because so much shop food is discarded.\u201d</p> <p>The technology is being closely watched by the food industry. Emma Lake, news editor of the<em> Caterer</em>, said: \u201cThe potential market for 3D-printed meat could be substantial; we\u2019ve already seen dramatic growth in vegan meat imitations in response to more consumers cutting down on their consumption of animal products for environmental and health reasons. The launch of the Greggs vegan sausage roll in January demonstrated the interest in such products.\u201d</p>",

Other meats, such as pork and fish, will soon be added to the menu, reducing the need for pig-rearing or fishing. The health benefits are substantial too, said Ben-Shitrit. \u201cIf you eat meat, there are nutritional advantages and disadvantages. But definitely people consume too much. Plant-based products don\u2019t contain cholesterol or the pathogens that exist in meat.\u201d They would therefore be attractive to many vegetarians who could gain the nutritional value without a moral dilemma. Poorer nations, where traditional meat is too expensive for most of the population, will also benefit in time. Redefine Meat will pilot its plant-based meat in restaurants throughout Europe early in 2020, so British diners could have next year\u2019s Christmas lunches printed for them. It has already served hundreds of people in Israel and conducted tastings in Europe. The products will initially be more expensive than traditional meat \u2013 the firm is aiming for a price point around \u00a328 per kg, twice the cost of British supermarket sirloin steak \u2013 but this will come down over time and should, eventually, be cheaper than traditional meat. \u201cIt\u2019s really good, tasty meat that we produce here,\u201d said Ben-Shitrit. \u201cThe question is how to scale up so you can put it in a butcher\u2019s shop in London day in, day out. So our business model is to sell the machines and the ingredients, not the finished meat.\u201d Worldwide, meat production is booming. According to UN figures, in the early 1960s, around 70 million tonnes of meat was produced. By 2017, that had multiplied to more than 330 million tonnes. Britons eat about 80kg of meat each per year. The technology for 3D-printed meat is improving rapidly. Last month, another Israeli firm, Aleph Farms, printed meat produced from cow muscle cells on the International Space Station. The company says its meat will be on general sale a few years from now. Before then, Spanish-based Novameat expects to have its plant-based printers in Spanish and Italian restaurants by the end of 2020, and in British restaurants soon after. Its CEO, Giuseppe Scionti, plans to have the machines in supermarkets in 2021 and in homes a year or two later. Pea and rice proteins are fed into Novameat\u2019s printers in capsules like those for an espresso machine. They contain a red paste that is turned into realistic steak or chicken. Salmon, lamb and pork capsules will be coming soon. Scionti believes the quality of what comes out \u2013 steaks and chicken fillets that mimic the taste and fibrous texture of meat \u2013 will be the key to its success. The British market is a major target. \u201cIn Britain, the \u2018flexitarian\u2019 [largely vegetarian, but sometimes eating meat] movement is very big \u2013 around one third of the population,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis way you can support biodiversity and avoid food waste because so much shop food is discarded.\u201d The technology is being closely watched by the food industry. Emma Lake, news editor of the Caterer, said: \u201cThe potential market for 3D-printed meat could be substantial; we\u2019ve already seen dramatic growth in vegan meat imitations in response to more consumers cutting down on their consumption of animal products for environmental and health reasons. The launch of the Greggs vegan sausage roll in January demonstrated the interest in such products.\u201d",

I think it took no more than half an hour to accomplish.\u201d The rows of headshots of McCartney, Ringo Starr, George Harrison and John Lennon that appear like film frames on the front of A Hard Day\u2019s Night were taken in Freeman\u2019s London studio. He asked them to make new facial expressions for each photo. This weekend, McCartney also described how Freeman came up with the distorted Rubber Soul cover portrait, which appears below the title logo designed by Charles Front. \u201cBob\u2019s normal practice was to use a slide projector and project the photos he\u2019d taken on to a piece of white cardboard, which was exactly album sized, thus giving us an accurate idea of how the finished product would look,\u201d wrote McCartney. \u201cDuring his viewing session the card, which had been propped up on a small table, fell backwards giving the photograph a \u2018stretched\u2019 look. Instead of simply putting the card upright again we became excited at the idea of this new version of his photograph. \u201cHe assured us that it was possible to print it this way and because the album was titled Rubber Soul we felt that the image fitted perfectly.\u201d Freeman, born in London and educated at Cambridge, began his photographic career at the Sunday Times and first made an impact with black and white studies of jazz musicians, including the saxophonist John Coltrane. The Beatles\u2019 manager, Brian Epstein, first commissioned Freeman to take a group portrait of the band in 1963. Freeman later worked as a director on the cult Swinging London film The Touchables and was also the photographer for the first Pirelli calendar. He suffered a severe stroke in 2014 and his family paid for his care and the preservation of his archive by selling a copy of one of his John Lennon portraits. Bidding farewell, McCartney wrote: \u201cI will miss this wonderful man, but will always cherish the fond memories I have of him. Thanks Bob. Love Paul.\u201d",

You went for the glide of the smoked salmon trolley, and the steak and ale suet pudding in a lake of shiny gravy; for the perfect chicken Kiev that came with its own overtly kinky black leather vest to be worn against Bellagio fountains of garlic butter. Mostly you went for the feeling that in here, everything will be looked after. I am regularly asked to recommend somewhere for a special meal in London. The Game Bird is one of those I most regularly suggest.

Happily, this lot haven\u2019t screwed up. Norma is the kind of effortless crowd-pleaser that takes serious work. It occupies a narrow townhouse on Charlotte Street, just north of Oxford Street, so that each floor\u2019s dining room has about it the classy glow of a vintage train\u2019s dining car. At the front is a raw bar, the ice stacked with smooth-shelled cherrystone clams and red prawns, curled up against each other. There are booths upholstered in amber plush, and deco-style glass panels. The floor and walls are tiled in a Moorish pattern of interlocking points. All about is a downlit glow. It has a sense of intimacy, without requiring you to be so close to your neighbour you can detect their deodorant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01a50169e8bd6145d37eb576be6a0a54e5be6476\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01a50169e8bd6145d37eb576be6a0a54e5be6476/324_439_4850_2910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Caramelised edges\u2019: violet artichokes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Caramelised edges\u2019: violet artichokes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The menu is built around snacks and small plates, with a handful of pastas and chunkier mains.

      "bodyText": "Norma, 8 Charlotte Street, London W1T 2LS (020 3995 6224). Snacks \u00a33.50-\u00a38, small plates \u00a38-\u00a315, large plates \u00a319-\u00a330, desserts \u00a33.50-\u00a39, wines from \u00a327 Movie critics get excited about the latest Scorsese picture. Theatre critics get excited when they hear Tom Stoppard has written a new play. I\u2019m a restaurant critic, so I got excited when I heard about Norma, a new restaurant from the team behind the Stafford hotel. The Stafford is hidden away down one of the lanes off London\u2019s St James\u2019s Street. It\u2019s a neighbourhood occupied by shops selling only things you might want rather than anything you might ever need: a handmade pair of shoes, say, or a \u00a315m superyacht. In 2017, the Stafford became home to the Game Bird, a restaurant nobody thought they needed, but which it turned out I really wanted. The Game Bird was that rare thing, an instant classic, which transformed what had been a moribund dining room where your evening went to die, into a place of joy, albeit spendy joy. You went for the glide of the smoked salmon trolley, and the steak and ale suet pudding in a lake of shiny gravy; for the perfect chicken Kiev that came with its own overtly kinky black leather vest to be worn against Bellagio fountains of garlic butter. Mostly you went for the feeling that in here, everything will be looked after. I am regularly asked to recommend somewhere for a special meal in London. The Game Bird is one of those I most regularly suggest. (The others, because you\u2019re asking, are Margot and Rules.) Earlier this year it was announced that Ben Tish, formerly of the Salt Yard group\u2019s collection of Mediterranean restaurants, was joining the Stafford as chef director. He would also open Norma, which would major on the food of Sicily and its Moorish influences, Tish having recently completed a handsome cookbook called, aptly, Moorish. This was the coming together of people who know exactly what they are doing. If any new restaurant deserved to be taken seriously in this world of gloom and threat, it was this one. It promised to be a place that could keep the gloom at bay. Then again, even the greatest team can screw up. Just ask the people who put together Turn off the Dark, the Spiderman musical. Happily, this lot haven\u2019t screwed up. Norma is the kind of effortless crowd-pleaser that takes serious work. It occupies a narrow townhouse on Charlotte Street, just north of Oxford Street, so that each floor\u2019s dining room has about it the classy glow of a vintage train\u2019s dining car.

There are booths upholstered in amber plush, and deco-style glass panels. The floor and walls are tiled in a Moorish pattern of interlocking points. All about is a downlit glow. It has a sense of intimacy, without requiring you to be so close to your neighbour you can detect their deodorant. The menu is built around snacks and small plates, with a handful of pastas and chunkier mains. There is an essay to be written, a rather dull, earnest one, about the way classy metropolitan restaurants re-engineer the food of what might look like leftovers into desirable objects for urban taste-chasers. Arancini are just a way to stop you throwing out the uneaten risotto. Likewise, the spaghettini fritters served here, for \u00a36, were once just a way to use up uneaten pasta. The lesson is this: we should all cook more pasta than we need, so it too can be formed into such blissful discs and fried until crisp and golden. Enough parmesan is grated over the top to make them disappear from view. Alongside is a pot of a warm parmesan and olive oil sauce. It\u2019s a fondue that\u2019s taken on a personal trainer and butched up. The whole dish is the domestic, made glamorous. Golden triangles of a kind of bread formed from chickpea pur\u00e9e also come with their own sauce, a strident and aromatic salsa verde. We have halved violet artichokes, trimmed back to the important bits and seared until their edges are caramelised, with a walnut whip-shaped dollop of a pine nut pur\u00e9e. From the raw bar come slices of sea bream with a pinkish glow, dressed with peppery olive oil and both pomegranate seeds and the salty orange promise of bottarga.

A robotic cheetah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE3fmFTtP9g\">sprints</a> across a parking lot. A robotic dog takes on a human in a tug of war. Sometimes the robots are cute, like the Sand Flea, which flicks itself effortlessly over 30ft walls. Sometimes they\u2019re scary: like the android who does parkour.</p> <p>But the general tone of the videos is ominous \u2013 like the one of this militaristic looking robot called BigDog being <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNZPRsrwumQ\">kicked</a> and then recovering.<strong> </strong>Watching the machine regain composure is chilling. You almost expect it to turn around and retaliate, hinting at a future when this might, in fact, happen.</p> <p>For this reason, on the release of almost every new Boston Dynamics video, the internet lights up with commentary about how we\u2019re all doomed, how the robot apocalypse is nigh. The parody videos made by the LA production leveraged this reaction and indulged the fantasy: the series ends with the CGI robot replicas holding humans at gun point.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LikxFZZO2sk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LikxFZZO2sk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That we respond with a sense of fear to sophisticated-seeming robots makes sense. Robots have been associated with a narrative of insurrection and replacement since they made their debut in Karel Capek\u2019s 1920 play, Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots, which was about worker robots violently overthrowing their human overlords. This narrative has been repeated ever since in movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator, and more recently, the HBO series Westworld.</p> <p>The purpose of these narratives has been to use the robot as humanity\u2019s mirroring other, similar enough to force us to reflect, with some productive distance, on issues of exploitation, labor, slavery, bigotry, revolution. In other words, the robot apocalypse narrative speaks to our deepest fears about ourselves.</p> <p>But with their videos of robot cheetahs and back-flipping androids, Boston Dynamics have exploited this narrative as a marketing tool. This is a cunning trick. By appropriating the sci-fi narrative in their videos, Boston Dynamics is, for one, overselling their robots. (They are nowhere near strong, smart, or robust enough to challenge human supremacy, whatever that means.)</p> <p>This has created hype and a brand identity around the company. In September this year, they started selling their SpotMini, a camera equipped dog-like, door-opening robot, and already they\u2019ve had a \u201c<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/boston-dynamics-puts-its-robotic-quadruped-spot-up-for-sale/\">deluge</a>\u201d of interest.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tf7IEVTDjng?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The deeper problem, though, is that conflating real robots with make-believe robots distracts and obfuscates questions of agency and responsibility.</p> <p>There is something deeply unsettling about a private company making agile, powerful, autonomous machines. But what\u2019s scary isn\u2019t the robot. Rather, it is who is building them and to what end.</p> <p>The fact that Boston Dynamics has been repeatedly funded by Darpa, an agency of the United States Department of Defense? That\u2019s something to think about. The fact that Boston Dynamics are advertising SpotMini for <a href=\"https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot\">surveillance</a> tasks? That\u2019s something to think about. The robot apocalypse, not so much.</p> <p>Bootstrapping the narrative of robot apocalypse into discourse about real technology pervades the discourse of hi-tech. Elon Musk talks endlessly of the singularity; even the more measured Sundar Pichai anthropomorphizes AI. Ultimately, this distracts us from thinking about digital infrastructures built out of unaccountable practices. It makes it harder for us to think through complex cases, like when Uber\u2019s self-driving car hit a pedestrian. As <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ubers-self-driving-car-didnt-know-pedestrians-could-jaywalk/\">recent documents show</a>, this had nothing to do with the robot car and everything to do with shoddy engineering and a bad safety culture.</p> <p>Boston Dynamic\u2019s videos are, to be sure, entertaining. But by raising the alarm of robot takeover they achieve the self-serving purpose of reasserting unrealistic fantasies about technology\u2019s power, while redirecting away from more critical examination of human decisions and design practices.</p>",

For this reason, on the release of almost every new Boston Dynamics video, the internet lights up with commentary about how we\u2019re all doomed, how the robot apocalypse is nigh. The parody videos made by the LA production leveraged this reaction and indulged the fantasy: the series ends with the CGI robot replicas holding humans at gun point. That we respond with a sense of fear to sophisticated-seeming robots makes sense. Robots have been associated with a narrative of insurrection and replacement since they made their debut in Karel Capek\u2019s 1920 play, Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots, which was about worker robots violently overthrowing their human overlords. This narrative has been repeated ever since in movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Terminator, and more recently, the HBO series Westworld. The purpose of these narratives has been to use the robot as humanity\u2019s mirroring other, similar enough to force us to reflect, with some productive distance, on issues of exploitation, labor, slavery, bigotry, revolution. In other words, the robot apocalypse narrative speaks to our deepest fears about ourselves. But with their videos of robot cheetahs and back-flipping androids, Boston Dynamics have exploited this narrative as a marketing tool. This is a cunning trick. By appropriating the sci-fi narrative in their videos, Boston Dynamics is, for one, overselling their robots. (They are nowhere near strong, smart, or robust enough to challenge human supremacy, whatever that means.) This has created hype and a brand identity around the company. In September this year, they started selling their SpotMini, a camera equipped dog-like, door-opening robot, and already they\u2019ve had a \u201cdeluge\u201d of interest. The deeper problem, though, is that conflating real robots with make-believe robots distracts and obfuscates questions of agency and responsibility. There is something deeply unsettling about a private company making agile, powerful, autonomous machines. But what\u2019s scary isn\u2019t the robot. Rather, it is who is building them and to what end. The fact that Boston Dynamics has been repeatedly funded by Darpa, an agency of the United States Department of Defense? That\u2019s something to think about. The fact that Boston Dynamics are advertising SpotMini for surveillance tasks? That\u2019s something to think about. The robot apocalypse, not so much. Bootstrapping the narrative of robot apocalypse into discourse about real technology pervades the discourse of hi-tech. Elon Musk talks endlessly of the singularity; even the more measured Sundar Pichai anthropomorphizes AI. Ultimately, this distracts us from thinking about digital infrastructures built out of unaccountable practices. It makes it harder for us to think through complex cases, like when Uber\u2019s self-driving car hit a pedestrian. As recent documents show, this had nothing to do with the robot car and everything to do with shoddy engineering and a bad safety culture. Boston Dynamic\u2019s videos are, to be sure, entertaining. But by raising the alarm of robot takeover they achieve the self-serving purpose of reasserting unrealistic fantasies about technology\u2019s power, while redirecting away from more critical examination of human decisions and design practices.",

The existence of executive-dominated unitary boards will resist cultural and institutional change that is designed to transform the way corporations and board directors operate. This is a fundamental obstacle to progress.</p> <p>My research over the years has examined stakeholder governance frameworks that have flourished in northern European jurisdictions for well over a century. Corporations in those jurisdictions are required by law to appoint and operate with independent supervisory boards. These boards reflect the interests of all stakeholders, including employees and shareholders. They oversee the activities of the executive board of management. This has fostered a very different style of corporate stewardship and corporate responsibility.</p> <p>Sad to say, these important differences are not widely understood or appreciated in English-speaking countries.</p> <p>The inner-directed nature in which corporate jurisprudence has evolved in both the US and Britain has created a powerful smokescreen.

      "bodyText": "I was saddened to read that many of the African soldiers and carriers who served with the British Army in east Africa during the First World War were buried in unmarked graves (\u201cNo graves, no dignity. How Britain dishonoured its African war dead\u201d, Focus). The acknowledgment by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission of its past unequal treatment is at least a start in redressing the balance. However, while it may be true that memorials in east Africa do not give the names of individuals who fell, the situation is not the same in at least one southern African former colony: Nyasaland, now the independent state of Malawi. In the old colonial capital, Zomba, lies a memorial to men of the King\u2019s African Rifles who fell in the war. The roll of honour starts with the names of the British commissioned and non-commissioned officers killed, but is followed by a long list of local men, headed \u201cAfrican Rank and File\u201d, with each soldier given his name, rank and number, as on countless memorials throughout France and Belgium. If the individual graves were not marked, at least the sacrifice of these local men was duly commemorated. Melvin Hurst Ventnor, Isle of Wight In our often-divided times it is important to pause and reflect on the things that we share. This Remembrance Sunday, 75 years on from three pivotal battles of the Second World War \u2013 Monte Cassino, D-Day, and Kohima and Imphal \u2013 we should consider how soldiers from Britain and its allies from across the Commonwealth nations, the US and the free armies of Europe fought side by side to overcome adversity. We welcome this autumn the Remember Together initiative from British Future and the Royal British Legion, which brings communities together to mark our shared heritage. This history of service and sacrifice encompasses the stories of the Polish and Caribbean airmen who helped defend our skies, being marked in Boston, Lincolnshire; and the commemoration in Leicester of the 2.5 million-strong army from undivided India that fought for Britain in its hour of need. It is a message that we should share far and wide across the UK \u2013 that remembrance belongs to us all. Rt Rev James Newcome, bishop of Carlisle; Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, senior rabbi to Reform Judaism; Imam Qari Asim, chair, Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board; David Lammy MMP; Neil O\u2019Brien MP; Jamie Stone MP; Rt Rev Martyn Snow, bishop of Leicester; Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, former chief of the defence staff; Mohammad Nafees Zakaria, High Commissioner for Pakistan to the UK; Seth George Ramocan, High Commissioner for Jamaica to the UK; Catherine Davies, head of remembrance, Royal British Legion; Sunder Katwala, director, British Future; Amandeep Madra, chair, UK Punjab Heritage Association; Jasvir Singh, chair, City Sikhs; Cllr Dhruv Patelfounder and director, City Hindus Network; Hanka Januszewska, director, Polish Heritage Society (UK) A better way to run business Elizabeth Warren is right in championing stakeholder capitalism (\u201cElizabeth Warren\u2019s project is to remake capitalism. What can our politicians learn from her?\u201d, Comment). But reform in the US, as in Britain, faces many challenges. The self-serving doctrine of \u201cshareholder primacy\u201d has to be exposed for what it is. The existence of executive-dominated unitary boards will resist cultural and institutional change that is designed to transform the way corporations and board directors operate. This is a fundamental obstacle to progress. My research over the years has examined stakeholder governance frameworks that have flourished in northern European jurisdictions for well over a century. Corporations in those jurisdictions are required by law to appoint and operate with independent supervisory boards. These boards reflect the interests of all stakeholders, including employees and shareholders. They oversee the activities of the executive board of management. This has fostered a very different style of corporate stewardship and corporate responsibility. Sad to say, these important differences are not widely understood or appreciated in English-speaking countries. The inner-directed nature in which corporate jurisprudence has evolved in both the US and Britain has created a powerful smokescreen. This has distorted our view of what wider purposes corporations have the potential to serve if they are governed appropriately.

This \u00a355bn a year boost outdoes Sajid Javid\u2019s \u00a320bn a year extra on capital projects. Some of the credit for this turnaround must go to the leftwing thinktanks that have chipped away at the arguments for austerity ever since former chancellor George Osborne declared in 2010 that it was the only way to bring the deficit under control. Then, Osborne had important support from the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, the Paris-based thinktank for the richest 36 nations. In recent years, these organisations have conceded that a financial crisis should never be allowed to go to waste and, rather than panic, it would be better for a consistent policy of public investment to remain in place.

John Major\u2019s response to the early 1990s recession was to save money by cutting public investment. He backed his chancellor, Ken Clarke, in putting a red line through hospital refurbishments and new school buildings rather than increase borrowing or impose tax increases. When Tony Blair and Gordon Brown switched the spending taps back on in 1999, the need to wake up and retool the construction industry and marshal a public sector more used to imposing austerity pushed the cost of investment up by many billions of pounds more than it should have been. Osborne\u2019s clampdown has left the construction industry and the public sector in much the same position today, as the parties consider how and what to improve. It is a criticism made last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the tax and spending watchdog, which said Tory and Labour plans could be undermined by the lack of shovel-ready projects.

      "bodyText": "Right, time for bed. Thanks for staying the course - roll on the Test series! Well how about that! The second best Super Over of 2019 - but what a way to finish both a game that had looked damp tissue-paper two hours ago, and a series between two sides that are so tricky to divide. A tasty hors d\u2019oeuvre to cheer up a moribund UK November. Man of the match: Jonny Bairstow New Zealand 8-1 : (Guptill 1, de Grandhomme 0 ) Seifert only manages two off Jordan\u2019s yorker, then a wide, then Seifert throws the bat and just beats two desperate chasing fielder by a finger-tip - four, then a dot ball, a wicket. And the game dribbles away off the last two balls. Great bowling by Jordan. A fabulous catch by Eoin Morgan, running 20 yards, and pulling the catch back over his shoulder. Two balls left, two sixes win it, a six and four and we get another super over. Looks like it is going to be Chris Jordan bowling for England. England 17-0: (Bairstow 8, Morgan 9) Is that enough? Two sixes over the short boundary over Southee\u2019s head - one to each batmen. But not full madness. Benjamin Macintyre is back: \u201cI told you so!\u201d You did! \u201cWhere\u2019s my twitter battle?\u201d This time, there is no boundary count if scores are equal after one over each. It\u2019s not quite a packed Lord\u2019s, but a third-full Eden Park is eager for a sandwich called revenge. It\u2019s going to be Southee to bowl to Bairstow and Morgan. 10.6 overs: Jordan smacks a great fat four and knock me down that\u2019s the Super Over! 10.5 overs: Two runs by Jordan. Six to win, four for a super over!!! 10.4 overs: Jordan swipes Neesham for six over Boult\u2019s head. With only three off the first two balls, Curran has to go for it, but bottom-ends the ball to third man. 13 needed off 3 balls. 10th over: England 131-6 (T Curran 12, Billings 8) Billings turns Southee\u2019s first ball for four, then a wide, a handful of singles before Billings escapes from a one-handed mis-hit high into the air. Super over. Sixteen to win off 6 balls, Neesham to bowl it. 9th over: England 121-6 (T Curran 10, Billings 2) Boult has a moment and asks for possibly the worst lbw review this side of black and white movies . Tom Curran swipes across the line for six, and fluffs a couple of rampy-flicky things. Then a cartoon-time run-out as Billings slips, drops his bat and Boult drops the ball. 26 to win off 12 balls. 8th over: England 111-6 (T Curran 2, Billings 2) An eventful over, two wickets and ten runs including a blowsy six by Gregory. England are ahead by one run at the same stage. Three overs left. A two ball wonder from Gregory. Hope he gets another chance after this tour. A flick to cover. A huge wide that Curran charges at, then somehow snakes his body back in one move but is a sneeze short of getting his bat down in time. 7th over: England 97-3 (S Curran 23, Bairstow 45) Neesham arrowed for six over midwicket, then guided at full-stretch, down on his knees by Bairstow, who somehow comes back for the second. NZ v relieved to see the end of him. Bairstow tries to guide the ball behind but top-edges to Seifert. Good news for NZ as Bairstow had that glint in his eye. 6th over: England 90-3 (S Curran 23, Bairstow 38) Jonny Bairstow eyes up Sodhi, seasons generously, and brushes with oil. Three plump sixes, two straight back over his head, one wilder. A wide for quick breather then he attempts to remove Sodhi\u2019s hand with a fierce drive that Sodhi has the misfortune to intercept. 5th over: England 68-3 (S Curran 22, Bairstow 18) Sam Curran gets stuck into Kuggeleijn, polishing 20 off four balls with a couple of fours, a couple of sixes, with the eezy-breezy polish he brings to all his cricket. Six overs left. 4th over: England 49-3 (S Curran 2, Bairstow 18) Bairstow swats a bloated six off Santner, nine from the over. 3rd over: England 39-3 (Bairstow 11) Morgan, bat high in the air as he watched the bowler\u2019s approach, was in the same belligerent mood as on Friday. A towering six that kisses the dipping sun, then a four and another six before he too falls. All on Bairstow now? Morgan charges into an attempted yorker from Boult but just lofts it to Kuggeleijn at mid-off just in front of the rope. 2nd over: England 22-2 (Morgan 1, Bairstow 11) Super bowling from Southee, and a lovely couple of shots from Bairstow who is playing artist this over, muscular finesse. Just a gentle catch to mid-off from the first ball of Southee\u2019s over. 1st over: England 9-1 (Vince 1, Bairstow 1) It\u2019s Boult, bowling full in his tightly-fitting black trews. Dot, one, one then Banton picks him up off his toes and whallops him back over his head for six. Then the wait, and the wicket - the ball seemed to hit both pads. Is it? Isn\u2019t it? Banton given out straight away by the on-field umpire but England review and it takes forever. In the end it is umpire\u2019s call so Banton trudges off. The floodlights are on, but we look good to go for the second innings. It\u2019s all big and busty and beautiful, if a little like eating a full box of Milk Tray in one sitting. Just refuelling on a coffee as England come out. 11th over: New Zealand 146-5 (Neesham 1) Nine off the last over, two wickets, bish, bash, boof- it\u2019s a cracking total but I reckon England can get it. Taylor run-out going for the second to the last ball of the innings Yorker-tastic from Tom Curran, a spit of in-swing and stumps a go-go. 10th over: New Zealand 136-3 (Neesham 0, Selfert 16) Oh, that\u2019s a beauty: a ramp shot down on one knee, Seifert deposits the ball into the stand behind him. Next ball he unveils the ugliest swipe you ever did see over long-on for six, and then a cover- drive dart for four more. The first three balls of Sam Curran\u2019s over were dot balls, but that\u2019s ancient history in T11. Inevitably a big hit, a pull safely into the hands of James Vince at deep midwicket. 9th over: New Zealand 119-2 (Munro 38, Selfert 16) Jordan, right arm covered in . a blue sleeve, charges in. Only one boundary off the over, albeit a huge six. Just two overs left, as a strong breeze ruffles the players\u2019 trousers. 8th over: New Zealand 110-2 (Munro 38, Selfert 15) Seifert pulls a six high and into the hands of a man in the crowd. Six again, down on one knee baby, into the crowd once more where an unlucky dad floors one, with his son next to him. That\u2019s Rashid bowled out. 7th over: New Zealand 95-2 (Munro 35, de Grandhomme 2) Great bowling by Mahmood - he and Rashid have put the breaks on after the opening gush. Jonny Bairstow is on the mike for the second match in a row - what\u2019s he done to deserve that? A catch for James Vince, down by his toes, after his shocker in the field a couple of matches ago. A quick ball, too quick for de Grandhomme, is miscued high. 6th over: New Zealand 88-1 (Munro 35, de Grandhomme 2) Just five singles and a wicket from Adil Rashid in the best over of the innings by far. Just five overs left. Another huge swipe falls into Banton\u2019s hands just in front of the boundary at deep midwicket. 5th over: New Zealand 83-0 (Munro 32, Guptill 50) The pigeon-chested Mahmood takes his turn in the stocks. Munro top-edges a four over Sam Billings\u2019 head, then Guptill moves to his fifty off 19 balls with a single. A relatively parsimonious over is spoilt when Munro swings the last delivery for yet another six. 4th over: New Zealand 70-0 (Munro 21, Guptill 48) So now we get Rashid, who appeals for a stumping first ball - not out. Then Guptill slaps his red-soled shoe down the pitch and slams a six over long off , then he toe-ends the next for another six, this time straight. They scamper a few more. 3rd over: New Zealand 55-0 (Munro 19, Guptill 36) Eoin Morgan digs into his bag and pulls out experience. He waves for Chris Jordan, whose first ball is whacked over mid-off for six by Munro. A fuller one is turned square by Guptill with a rounding of the wrists for four, then a huge slapping pull for six. He finds his line with the last two balls. At this rate, NZ will get 150 from their 11 2nd over: New Zealand 37-0 (Munro 12, Guptill 25) This is how you do it Sam... ah. Guptill slogs, with no attempt at artistry, two sixes and a four. A consolation dot ball for Tom Curran at the end. Twenty from the over. 1st over: New Zealand 17-0 (Munro 12, Guptill 5) There are three overs in the re-shaped power play, and Sam Curran is bowling the first of them. Guptill has a wasted swing first ball, but has a good swipe to the second over midwicket to the boundary. Munro leans back and tips a fat, slower ball square for four, then a six over the short straight boundary. Easy pickings. \u201cGood morning from India,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWhen I woke up at around eight in the morning, I was disappointed because I realised a lot of the match might have already taken place; after checking the OBO, I was disappointed to see the prospect that none of it might take place. Now, the game does seem to be on track for a resumption. It will have just enough overs in it to make the encounter, ahem, still cricket. This series has turned out to be one of the best in the history of the format and deserves nothing less than an epic send-off today. Best of luck to all the players involved; hoping for a classic finish!\u201d Thanks Abhijato. The players are just standing for a moment\u2019s silence to remember all those who died in the World Wars and other conflicts. Play will start in five minutes, four bowlers will bowl two overs each, one will bowl three, there\u2019s rain floating about... if there\u2019s anyone still out there, this could be fun! Weather permitting, a 4pm (3am GMT) start, 11 overs a side. While we wait, a great read by Ali Martin on Ian Smith and his magic commentary spell at the World Cup Final. \u201cI think about that day at Lord\u2019s quite a lot. It doesn\u2019t dominate my life but it will never leave me. You could commentate on sport your whole life and never get a moment like that. My voice will be there for ever, I guess. It\u2019s an honour \u2026 I just hope I got it right.\u201d Not sure when these southern hemisphere games start anymore. Aus v Pakistan - day and/or night games. NZ v England day and/or night games....and one I believe was a \u2018twilight\u2019 game starting at 6 PM local time....which was either 7 AM GMT the day after or 5 PM yesterday, the ICC schedulers need to to sort it out ! writes Simon R. This ground has good drainage so we\u2019ll start soon. Pass the coffee..or whisky. I agree, it is a bit of a brain-blanker. Philip, the poor guy in charge of the Guardian\u2019s OBO rota, grinds his teeth to stumps trying to work out times for the Southern hemisphere games. I\u2019m going to put the kettle on now, TMS has moved temporarily to the World Service where they\u2019re talking about the air pollution in Delhi which affected the Bangladesh v India match last week and saw Bangladesh players being sick on the pitch. \u201cThere were some murmurs about moving it out, but by then it was far too late. The ground was full, it was like the warning you get on cigarette packs, you read them but you ignore them,\u201d says the Indian correspondent (apologies I didn\u2019t catch his name.) Just a quick reminder that although the game is shrinking all the time, they won\u2019t call it off till the tick has tocked past the latest start time 4:47pm (3.47GMT). Seventh Horcrux writes: Hello Tanya. Is it worth staying up waiting for the cricket to start? There\u2019s a certain footy game scheduled for later today, and this delay is testing my already frail nerves?\u201d Well...they\u2019ve resorted to replays on Sky. On TMS, a gloomy Aggers has been looking at the satellite pictures so ....I guess it depends if you think you might need tiredness to dull the pain tomorrow afternoon. Red or blue? It\u2019s still raining by the way and grey and miserable. David Gaskell writes: \u201cJohn Starbuck is always a welcome correspondent, almost part of the OBO team. What I need to know, of the hundred novels, has he read \u201c Moby Dick\u201d ? Now, I\u2019m hoping that wasn\u2019t some kind of rude dig that I didn\u2019t get... I think you two went to school together, no? Ah, here\u2019s John. \u201cI I feel at a slight advantage because I did read a lot of them for A levels and degree, which just goes to show that the canon can change pretty quickly: no Ulysses or Moby-Dick, let alone War and Peace? I do feel that, like the first BBC2 programme, it\u2019s slanted more towards \u2018women\u2019s novels\u2019 but we are probably overdue a correction.\u201d Yes, I think you\u2019re right, a definite feminine slant but, yes too, about time! I\u2019m surprised Our Mutual Friend makes the cut, though studying it for A level is often enough to ruin a book. John, John! Are you still there? if this was the list, it isn\u2019t quite 100 best novels but \u201c100 English language titles that have shaped their (the judges) world\u201d. I\u2019ve read a respectable-ish 34 of the 100 - but very much boosted by the August section . Loving the fact Ballet Shoes and Forever were on the list - essential reading for any school girl in the 1980s. No cricket there that I can see unless The Far Pavilions by M.M. Kaye is flanneled foolery? Benjamin Macintyre has an idea \u201cSo, the first series between these two sides since a certain ODI last summer with the series tied at 2-2. According to my highly scientific calculations this can only mean one outcome. Scores tied with the only way to separate the two sides a Jimmy Neesham v Jofra Archer twitter battle. May the best man win.\u201d Genuis! Perhaps KSI v Logan Paul* should have thought of that before they settled on a boxing match. *admission, I had never heard of these people until a few hours ago. Oh dear, the brollies are up and there is a further delay, though it is frou-frou, not torrents. While we wait, here are the teams: England 1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 Tom Banton, 3 James Vince, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Sam Billings (wk), 6 Lewis Gregory, 7 Sam Curran, 8 Tom Curran, 9 Chris Jordan, 10 Adil Rashid, 11 Saqib Mahmood. New Zealand 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Colin Munro, 3 Tim Seifert (wk), 4 Colin de Grandhomme, 5 Ross Taylor, 6 Jimmy Neesham, 7 Mitchell Santner, 8 Tim Southee (capt), 9 Ish Sodhi, 10 Trent Boult, 11 Scott Kuggeleijn. Alex Webster is very much over the tie-thing \u201cI play cricket in Southland and I get \u201cit was a tie\u201d pretty much every Saturday (and most Thursdays). As we were driving back from a victorious trip to Tapanui (two and a half hour local derby) I heard a few shouts about them winning a Super Over to take the series. I suggested they might want to make sure they score enough boundaries this time. This is now my stock response - seems to go down well.\u201d \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get on top of the weather and know what we\u2019ll be chasing,\u201d says Morgan. England bring back Vince, Rashid and Mahmood; Malan, Pat Brown and Parkinson are out. Harsh. Right that\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to quickly attack the chocolate digestives. Oh John Starbuck, what would we do without you? \u201cGood morning, as I suppose one should say, though it feels like the middle of the night. Still, what with MOTD finishing late, and having watched the BBC2 100 best novels programme (I worked out I\u2019d read 27 of the 100, but I expect plenty of OBO readers have read more) I felt up to tacking the final match of this series, especially as it\u2019s now tied, though how long I last will depend on how much of the remaining Glenmorangie I can imbibe. Still, today is Sunday so I\u2019m due another lie-in and let the world go hang. Up to now it\u2019s been the Radio 3 weird krautrock-style soundtracks ( very 1970s) and I\u2019m now going over to TMS for a bit of weather-related chat to support the OBO profundities. Over to you ....\u201d Oooh, 100 best novels - that\u2019s a challenge. Is it this list? The clock starts ticking at 2:40pm (1.40GMT) when we begin losing overs, with the latest start time 4:47pm (3.47GMT) - though, dear god, let\u2019s hope not. Some BlackCap data to chew over: So the latest is that there will be a toss at 2.10 NZ time ( 1.10am GMT) with play due to start, weather permitting, at 2.30pm ( 1.30am GMT). My brother Sam has delivered a Whatsapp from Auckland on the family cricket chat. He\u2019s sitting in the damp stands and has sent me a photo of the tie he was given outside the ground... Ok, so Ian Ward has a jacket on but the rain seems to have stayed away. He, David Lloyd and Nasser chew the fat on Tom Banton, Matt Parkinson \u201che\u2019s got the wood on New Zealand\u201d and Dawid Malan. We see the ground - hmmm, nobody there yet. Ah, it\u2019s been raining all morning apparently and the forecast is set squiffy. But do stick with me. Send me emails, go on. Good morning everyone, the sleepy-eyed and the bushy-tailed. We travel today to Auckland for the final IT20 of the series where, conveniently enough, a series-decider is waiting for us, the scoreline currently: England 2. New Zealand 2. Only a week ago they were playing a rugby-league triple-header at Eden Park and England will be hoping for a better result than Great Britain managed - they do however have the buffer of a record-highest score in their victory at Napier to keep them jolly. There are more short boundaries today at Eden Park, though this time in the diagonal over fine-leg. Dawid Malan, centurion in the last game, will be licking his lips - assuming he plays. Anyway, over to Eden Park to see if the weather gods are being kind.",

In her book <em>This Changes Everything</em>, she laid the blame on powerful global corporations and acquiescent governments, which both simultaneously underplay the scale of the climate emergency and exploit our collective sense of helplessness in the face of it. Since then, a new urgency has driven climate activism, most successfully in the disruptive protests of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a>.

It is one of a series of photographs he made using long, slow exposures on a mounted camera to track him as he ran along a meandering line on the mountain holding a flaming torch. (You can see him collapse with altitude exhaustion in a <a href=\"https://simonnorfolk.com/when-i-am-laid-in-earth\" title=\"\">short film</a> documenting the making of the work shot by the <em>Observer</em> photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/antonioolmos\" title=\"\">Antonio Olmos</a>.) </p> <p>\u201cI use old maps to trace the exact line where the front edge of the glacier existed in previous years,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy starting point was 1963, the year I was born, and I have made similar images for selected years ever since.

      "bodyText": "\u2018What is it about those melting glaciers and desperate polar bears that makes us want to look away?\u201d the activist and author Naomi Klein asked in 2015. In her book This Changes Everything, she laid the blame on powerful global corporations and acquiescent governments, which both simultaneously underplay the scale of the climate emergency and exploit our collective sense of helplessness in the face of it. Since then, a new urgency has driven climate activism, most successfully in the disruptive protests of Extinction Rebellion. Can art, though, have a meaningful role in raising awareness of that urgency? A forthcoming exhibition, Meltdown: Visualising Climate Change, at the Horniman Museum in London sets out to answer that question in the affirmative. It focuses on the fate of the world\u2019s glaciers through the prism of art, photography and film. \u201cWe are using art as a kind of seduction to draw people in, then shock them,\u201d says photographer Simon Norfolk, one of the artists involved. Why glaciers, though? Norfolk points out that, while severe floods and forest fires are in some ways more dramatically visual, \u201cthey can leave you open to the charge of not being scientific\u201d. Glaciers, on the other hand, are one of the key and irrefutable indicators of climate change. \u201cThrough photography and film, you can record over time the ways in which they are receding, and by how much,\u201d he says. \u201cPlus, they are just so visual.\u201d The Lewis Glacier, Mt Kenya, 1963 (A), 2014. The image traces a line where the glacier\u2019s front was in 1963 while showing where it is now. Using scientific maps and GPS, Norfolk marked out the older line using hidden flashlights. \u2018I walked along the line dragging my burning stick, joining up the dots of the flashlights. It took about 20 minutes, which was hard work at altitude. The exposure for the mountain and the stars continues for the rest of the hour. I wanted it to be all in camera because climate change is surrounded by loons who will claim I faked it all.\u2019 By way of illustration, his arresting image The Lewis Glacier, Mt Kenya, 1963 shows a line of fire snaking along the rocky slope of a once completely snow-covered mountain skirting close to some scattered wooden buildings. It is one of a series of photographs he made using long, slow exposures on a mounted camera to track him as he ran along a meandering line on the mountain holding a flaming torch. (You can see him collapse with altitude exhaustion in a short film documenting the making of the work shot by the Observer photographer Antonio Olmos.) \u201cI use old maps to trace the exact line where the front edge of the glacier existed in previous years,\u201d he explains. \u201cMy starting point was 1963, the year I was born, and I have made similar images for selected years ever since. It is a way of photographing the absence of something, in this instance a few kilometres of ice that have disappeared in the intervening years.\u201d The series won Norfolk a Sony World Photography award in 2015. Ice Cave, Vatnaj\u00f6kull, 2014. Richard Mosse used a large-format plate-film camera and infrared film to photograph the ice cave under the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland. Glacier caves usually form when air enters where water flows underneath the ice, the warm air slowly creates melting and forms a cave from beneath. The dynamic process is becoming more unpredictable as the weather changes and cave access may become impossible in the future. Meltdown is curated by Project Pressure, an activist charity that, since 2008, has commissioned artists to work with climate scientists on often ambitious projects that highlight the earth\u2019s increasingly unstable environment. Their partners and sponsors include Nasa, WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), Hasselblad and the UN Climate Action Summit. \u201cWhen we began in 2008, climate change was not high on the activist agenda in the way that it is now, but we understood the urgency,\u201d says the founder of the project, Danish photographer Klaus Thymann. \u201cFor centuries, landscape has been one of the classic themes of great art, so it makes sense to use art as another means to make people aware of the climate emergency and hopefully help instigate institutional and behavioural changes.\u201d From a purely artistic perspective, what is most interesting about the Meltdown exhibition is that, though it includes the work of a few documentary photographers, it is a reflection of the broad range of conceptual strategies being adopted by contemporary activist artists: from Richard Mosse, winner of last year\u2019s prestigious Prix Pictet, to No\u00e9mie Goudal, a French artist whose photographic installations, a hybrid of the real and the created, are made in often elemental landscapes. Glacier 1, 2016, by Noemie Goudal. French conceptual artist Goudal is interested in the meeting of the organic and the manmade. This work was made on the Rh\u00f4ne glacier, where Goudal constructed a large-scale photographic installation printed on biodegradable paper that disintegrates in water. \u2018All my work is about the fragility of the landscape,\u2019 she says. For Meltdown, Mosse used a large-format plate camera to photograph an eerily beautiful ice cave underneath the Vatnaj\u00f6kull glacier in Iceland. It was formed by air entering beneath the ice cap, and, in Mosse\u2019s blue-tinged prints, resembles a sci-fi landscape, all smooth curves and jagged icicles, made all the more unreal by his use of infrared film. Goudal specalises in elaborate interventions with the landscape. For this commission, she photographed the Rh\u00f4ne glacier in the Swiss Alps, before printing the results on large sheets of biodegradable paper. She then mounted the prints, which are 3.5 metres tall, on to plastic canvas using \u201ca children\u2019s glue that disintegrates on contact with water\u201d. The prints were then suspended in front of the landscape she had photographed and, throughout a single day, she shot around a hundred frames of the disintegrating image. \u201cI am primarily interested in the choreography of the landscape and how it moves and changes continually,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to alter our perception of it through images that show the organic and the artificial blending and clashing. In this instance, I kept on shooting until the scene reverted to the original landscape.\u201d Mt Baker, 2014, by Peter Funch. Danish artist Funch uses old tourist postcards and historic photos as source material for his series Imperfect Atlas. In this case the images are re-creations of vintage postcards of Mount Baker [in Washington state, US] found on eBay \u2018I located the positions from which the original postcard images had been made,\u2019 he says, \u2018and re-shot the glaciers from those positions to create comparative juxtapositions of then and now.\u2019 I had assumed that Goudal\u2019s disintegrating prints were a visual metaphor for the effects of global warming on the glacier, but she insists that her art \u201cdoes not really fit into a discourse about environmental issues\u201d and is more about the ways in which artists and scientists \u201cobserve and interpret\u201d the environment. \u201cGeology and astronomy are important elements in my work,\u201d she says, \u201cbut, apart from this commission, there is really no big eco-subtext in the rest of my work.\u201d Other artists have turned to the past to make sense of our present ecological dilemmas. Peter Funch uses vintage tourist postcards and historic images of Mount Rainier and Mount Baker in the North Cascades in Washington as raw material for his series Imperfect Atlas. Using maps and satellite images, he pinpointed the exact spot from which the original pictures were taken so that he could photograph today\u2019s mountain glaciers from the same position. Funch also employed an old-fashioned technical process called RGB tricolour separation, in which red, green, and blue filters are used to create three separate monochrome images, which are then combined to make a single full-colour image. The process was invented in 1850, a decade after the first recorded evidence that the mountain glaciers were receding. As his work makes clear, even the earliest 19th-century photographs of glaciers were visual documents of their slow decline. Bone from 4000 BC, Switzerland, 2017: Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin make photographic still lifes of the often perfectly preserved objects revealed by shrinking glaciers, such as this human bone which remained intact in the ice for thousands of years. \u201cIn the exhibition, we use glaciers as a symbol,\u201d says Thymann. \u201cBut some of the work is about what makes a surprising story. The artists Broomberg and Chanarin photographed objects that were found inside the ice of melting glaciers.

It can, indeed, be seen at one level as the story of plucky Lyra Belacqua, in a just-alternative world, where a sort-of-Oxford exists, but with airships and truth-telling compasses, and one\u2019s soul striding or prowling or flying beside you in the form of an animal known as a daemon.</p> <p>On another level, it\u2019s nothing less than an intellectual treatise on atheism and the grim levels any church will go to in order to guard its secrets, to deny pure truth and the freedom of reason. It had perforce to please both mild, what\u2019s-on-telly browsers and diehard fans of that beloved trilogy. (Wiki has an entire entry on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_(His_Dark_Materials)\" title=\"\">Dust</a>, a manifestation of consciousness, including a section on the provenance of its naming, which itself includes the passage \u201cthe Mulefa, who are able to see Dust directly, use the word \u2018sraf\u2019, accompanied by a leftward flick of the trunk [or arm for humans] to describe it\u201d.

Stylish and steampunk enough, but it seemed to be pitched somewhere between Harry Potter and <em>Game of Thrones</em> (the music certainly was <em>GoT</em>-vainglorious). Still, it\u2019s a hard task to pitch just-so, and it takes a singular vision to manage. Thankfully we had first Pullman, and now Thorne.</p> <p>Mercifully, crucially, it\u2019s almost wholly unlike the 2007 film of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNiiJ0JtBOQ\" title=\"\">The Golden Compass</a></em>, which studios attempted to make in God-ridden America with, remarkably, no reference to heresy or atheism. Thus rather missing the point: think <em>Hamlet</em> without the indecision.</p> <p>Meanwhile, expect before Christmas a clamour for the golden age of airships and a rush to name at least animals, if not actual children, after the intriguing daemons/familiars.

      "bodyText": "Indie bands have done R&amp;B before \u2013 you will have heard of the xx. Now, with genre boundaries more porous than ever, swapping lo-fi pop for R&amp;B shouldn\u2019t feel like an audacious act. This album does. One record ago, Girl Ray were a fresh-faced, lo-fi pop three-piece whose videos featured games of rounders. Now, their second outing suggests a burgeoning north London version of Haim or, perhaps, Broadcast playing the songs of Everything But the Girl. Show Me More, released last summer, may have found Poppy Hankin, Iris McConnell and Sophie Moss still riding bicycles in the video, but their disco tune offered vastly increased quotients of slinkiness and soul. The hazy title track, meanwhile, nods to Tom Tom Club, with a swirling keyboard motif underlining how much has changed in this trio\u2019s outlook. House piano, a rapper \u2013 PSwuave \u2013 and, on Beautiful, a reggae lilt, all have their place on Girl. These moves are still tentative, and talk of artistic progression is often the kiss of death, but Girl Ray have moved out of a place of limitations into more kaleidoscopic musicality.",

This is quite a shock, not because of the words, but because of the anger. Mpanga has been careful to keep any rage reined in during his first series, but in this episode, which addresses who his listeners might be and why they might be listening, there are moments when he seems properly furious. He\u2019s a man who is in touch with his feelings, and is able to express them in many different forms, whether subtle or in-your-face. Actually, he plays with them, and, so, us. He beguiles with his intelligence; he confuses with his flights of fancy; he questions our assumptions, draws us into his subconscious and sends us spinning out across continents, before taking the mickey out of himself and us for listening at all.</p> <p>But let\u2019s rewind. <em>George\u2019s Podcast</em> is, as you may have guessed, an experimental one. Flipping between forms, using poetry, fiction, news, history and music, he is telling us a larger story than the one contained in each individual show. And he\u2019s more explicit about what his true aim in this series is: he wants to enlighten and empower the next generation of BAME kids. He used to want to be a politician. Now he knows that he is more likely to achieve his goal through entertainment. He covers all this in the first episode of the new series, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000b18m\" title=\"\">Sabrina\u2019s Boy</a>, which uses the biography of a real-life rap star (I\u2019m not revealing who it is) to explore a larger discussion of blaxploitation films, Reaganomics and why drug dealing and murder can seem the only options for black youth, whether in the 1970s and 80s US or contemporary UK. Over the next three episodes, things get weirder: we essentially take a ride around Mpanga\u2019s head, partly while he\u2019s sleeping. Some of this works well, some less so (the journey through his snoozy brain gets a bit <em><a href=\"https://www.beano.com/posts/the-numskulls-1995\" title=\"\">The Numskulls</a></em>), but at all times, the dynamics and tone keep you listening. Plus, there\u2019s his self-awareness: that episode ends with two of his friends dragging him about whether anyone will understand what he\u2019s trying to say. And then the fifth episode uses Mpanga\u2019s own history of growing up on St Raphael\u2019s estate in Neasden, London, to explain his current and constant state of mind. There\u2019s so much packed into this podcast, and yet, you feel, Mpanga still has reams more to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cb740473bfa49ffd186c264f72024d85ee2ba61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cb740473bfa49ffd186c264f72024d85ee2ba61/0_948_3057_3056/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Esther Perel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Her candid truth is like a douse of cold water\u2019: Esther Perel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean Goldsmith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another favourite podcaster returned last week. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/28/esther-perel-the-relationship-guru-who-thinks-infidelity-isnt-all-bad\" title=\"\">Esther Perel</a>, the couples\u2019 psychotherapist who persuades her clients to let us listen in to sessions, has a new series on Spotify: <strong><a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/hows-work\" title=\"\">How\u2019s Work?</a></strong> This opens with emotional clips from her interviewees and is, interestingly, very like her couples\u2019 therapy series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/30/esther-perel-fix-the-sex-and-your-relationship-will-transform-esther-perel\" title=\"\">Where </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/30/esther-perel-fix-the-sex-and-your-relationship-will-transform-esther-perel\" title=\"\">Should We Begin?</a></em>, but for work.

      "body": "<p>\u2022 One of the year\u2019s most enjoyable discs is a new album by the tenor <a href=\"http://edlyon.info/\" title=\"\">Ed Lyon</a>. His <strong><a href=\"https://delphianrecords.co.uk/product-group/17th-century-playlist/\" title=\"\">17th Century Playlist</a></strong> (Delphian) includes songs of contrasting mood by Cavalli, Landi and other less familiar baroque composers. All, except one by Dowland, were new to me. Part of the charm, Lyon\u2019s versatile singing aside, is the rich accompaniment \u2013 plucked and bowed \u2013 provided by lutenist <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Kenny</a> and the ensemble <a href=\"https://elizabethkenny.co.uk/theatre-of-the-ayre/\" title=\"\">Theatre of the Ayre</a>, playing variously guitar, theorbo, triple and Irish harp, viola da gamba and violins.</p> <p>Taking the notion that much of this music was written for small courts, shaped in response to the tastes of a benefactor or dedicatee, Lyon has conceived the programme as a highly personal mixtape-cum-playlist. Switching with agility between French, Italian and English, he gives each track distinct character and spirit. One for any baroque fan\u2019s Christmas list.</p> <p>\u2022 You might want to pair it with Fretwork\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/8683008--in-nomine-ii\" title=\"\">In Nomine II </a></strong>(Signum Classics), a rewarding potpourri of instrumental consort music from the 16th and 17th centuries by Robert Parsons, John Bull, Christopher Tye, Henry Purcell and others, together with contemporary pieces by Nico Muhly and Gavin Bryars.</p> <p>Mostly written for four or five instruments, usually viols, this English genre takes its name from words in the Benedictus of the mass, and is characterised by the alto part carrying the slow-note theme (cantus firmus), with other parts playing in counterpart around that line: easier to hear than explain in a short space. <a href=\"http://www.fretwork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fretwork</a>, who started out with an album called <em><a href=\"https://www.fretwork.co.uk/portfolio/in-nomine/\" title=\"\">In Nomine</a></em> more than 30 years ago, are matchless performers of this contemplative, introverted repertoire. The Bryars, a Fretwork commission from 1995, stands out as a dark, melancholy modern classic.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009zq0\" title=\"\">The Future of the Past: Early Music Today</a></strong> is a six-part series on Radio 3 in which my fellow reviewer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholas-kenyon\" title=\"\">Nicholas Kenyon</a> tells the story of the early music revival and the pioneer musicians who brought about this revolution.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2022 One of the year\u2019s most enjoyable discs is a new album by the tenor Ed Lyon. His 17th Century Playlist (Delphian) includes songs of contrasting mood by Cavalli, Landi and other less familiar baroque composers. All, except one by Dowland, were new to me. Part of the charm, Lyon\u2019s versatile singing aside, is the rich accompaniment \u2013 plucked and bowed \u2013 provided by lutenist Elizabeth Kenny and the ensemble Theatre of the Ayre, playing variously guitar, theorbo, triple and Irish harp, viola da gamba and violins. Taking the notion that much of this music was written for small courts, shaped in response to the tastes of a benefactor or dedicatee, Lyon has conceived the programme as a highly personal mixtape-cum-playlist. Switching with agility between French, Italian and English, he gives each track distinct character and spirit. One for any baroque fan\u2019s Christmas list. \u2022 You might want to pair it with Fretwork\u2019s In Nomine II (Signum Classics), a rewarding potpourri of instrumental consort music from the 16th and 17th centuries by Robert Parsons, John Bull, Christopher Tye, Henry Purcell and others, together with contemporary pieces by Nico Muhly and Gavin Bryars. Mostly written for four or five instruments, usually viols, this English genre takes its name from words in the Benedictus of the mass, and is characterised by the alto part carrying the slow-note theme (cantus firmus), with other parts playing in counterpart around that line: easier to hear than explain in a short space. Fretwork, who started out with an album called In Nomine more than 30 years ago, are matchless performers of this contemplative, introverted repertoire. The Bryars, a Fretwork commission from 1995, stands out as a dark, melancholy modern classic. \u2022 The Future of the Past: Early Music Today is a six-part series on Radio 3 in which my fellow reviewer Nicholas Kenyon tells the story of the early music revival and the pioneer musicians who brought about this revolution.",

She does not have a grave, her ashes having been taken by the funeral director, according to records. A memorial hydrangea with a plaque in the crematorium\u2019s remembrance gardens disappeared decades ago after funding for its upkeep stopped. Until now, Schmolka has been similarly unheralded in Prague. There is no memorial or visible reference to her in the five-storey former primary school building in the historic Jewish quarter of Josefov, from which she ran the refugee relief operation and where she was arrested. Her former home in the city\u2019s tourist district stands derelict and in disrepair, although councillors recently stopped it from being sold to developers to form part of a hotel currently under construction, and have intensified efforts to make the local council buy the property, which it already part owns. V\u00edt Masare, co-chair of the Prague Greens, who organised the move to award Schmolka honorary citizenship, has called for the creation of a permanent exhibition marking her life below the first-floor house. \u201cThere\u2019s a big justification for dedicating more space than just a plaque,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked with my Green party colleagues to help the refugees after the 2015 crisis and we got so much criticism. I can imagine the hostile conditions she had to work in, with so much antisemitism.\u201d",
