Doctors\u2019 coping mechanisms included distraction from a situation and blaming themselves rather than working out how to solve a problem, which the authors said showed they were not adapting well to pressure. A BMA study last year found that eight in 10 doctors were at significant risk of burnout and 27% had previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition. Many NHS trusts have responded to stress and burnout among staff by taking steps such as offering yoga, pilates and physiotherapy sessions and encouraging staff to take regular breaks. Meanwhile, a separate study has found that almost one in five doctors who deliver babies have post-traumatic stress disorder from witnessing distressing events in their work. In a survey of 1,095 UK obstetricians and gynaecologists, two-thirds said they had encountered traumatic situations during labour and birth.

Prof Pauline Slade and colleagues found that PTSD was leading to staffing problems on maternity units because doctors affected go on sick leave, and it is a key factor in the fact that three in 10 doctors training to specialise in obstetrics give up before they qualify. The condition could also desensitise obstetricians in how they care for mothers and encourage them to intervene earlier during childbirth if problems arise with the baby, the study said.

Share Bougna With the Locals Traditional Kanak bougna \u2013 New Caledonia\u2019s most iconic meal - may not grace the menus of Michelin star restaurants, but it\u2019s a dish laden with love, tradition, and coconut milk. Bougna is essentially a combination of yam, taro, sweet potato, banana, and either chicken, fish, or assorted shellfish. Simple in makeup, the recipe is a true labour of love. Once prepared, the mixture is wrapped tightly in banana leaves and left to cook long and slow in an earth oven. The result?

The player always insisted the encounter was consensual but acknowledged that \u201cshe did not and does not view this incident the same way I did\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Washington Post has suspended a journalist after she tweeted about Kobe Bryant\u2019s historical sexual assault case shortly after the basketball player and his daughter died in a helicopter crash. Felicia Sonmez was put on leave after posting a link to an article about the 2003 rape allegation against the former LA Lakers player, with the newspaper saying her \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in sharing the story had undermined the work of her colleagues. The incident raises questions about how to deal with the media legacies of much-lauded individuals and which aspects of their lives to highlight in the immediate aftermath of their deaths. Sonmez did not write the piece, which was published by the Daily Beast in 2016 and is entitled \u201cKobe Bryant\u2019s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser\u2019s Story, and the Half-Confession\u201d. Nor does she cover sport \u2013 she writes for the Washington Post\u2019s politics team. However, her decision to share the article about the accusation that dogged Bryant early in his career \u2013 and ultimately resulted in him reaching a financial settlement with his accuser \u2013 drew a furious and widespread backlash, including death threats, from fans of the player. Many felt the tweet came too soon after the death on Sunday of Bryant alongside his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others. The backlash resulted in Sonmez\u2019s post getting \u201cratio\u2019d\u201d \u2013 the term for when a tweet attracts substantially more replies than the number of retweets or likes, suggesting it has been divisive or badly received. Those encouraging criticism of Sonmez included Donald Trump Jr, the son of the US president, who said: \u201cYou Washington Post reporters really can\u2019t help yourselves, can you?\u201d The original accusation against Bryant was made by a 19-year-old receptionist at a Colorado hotel, who told local police she had been raped in the player\u2019s hotel room but later declined to testify in a criminal case. The player always insisted the encounter was consensual but acknowledged that \u201cshe did not and does not view this incident the same way I did\u201d. At the time he apologised for \u201cmy behaviour that night and for the consequences she has suffered\u201d. Sonmez justified her decision to share the article about the case on Sunday, saying: \u201cTo the 10,000 people (literally) who have commented and emailed me with abuse and death threats, please take a moment and read the story \u2013 which was written 3+ years ago, and not by me. Any public figure is worth remembering in their totality even if that public figure is beloved and that totality unsettling. That folks are responding with rage and threats toward me (someone who didn\u2019t even write the piece but found it well-reported) speaks volumes about the pressure people come under to stay silent in these cases.\u201d Her bosses disagreed and suspended her. Tracy Grant, the managing editor of the Washington Post, said: \u201cNational political reporter Felicia Sonmez was placed on administrative leave while the Post reviews whether tweets about the death of Kobe Bryant violated the Post newsroom\u2019s social media policy.

The Washington Post Guild, which represents the newspaper\u2019s employees, said that Somnez was being \u201ccensured for making a statement of fact\u201d and criticized the Post for failing to support her in the face of threats of violence. \u201cInstead of protecting and supporting a reporter in the face of abuse, the Post placed her on administrative leave while newsroom leaders review whether she violated the social media policy.

City of London police said that no injuries to police or prison staff had been reported. A police spokesperson confirmed that a number of people were ejected from court following the incident. The jury heard that the five defendants and two other men, whose identities are unknown, set off in the early evening of Friday 22 February to track down members of a rival gang, armed with at least five knives, a handgun and a shotgun. After spotting a group including Gabbidon-Lynck, a shot was fired before the defendants gave chase \u201clike a pack of animals\u201d, DCI Simon Stancombe said. \u201cSo desperate were the defendants to continue their petty postcode rivalry, the gang launched their gun and knife attack outside a busy cinema and several restaurants packed with people and children enjoying their Friday night.\u201d Jason Fraser, a 20-year-old associate of Gabbidon-Lynck, was surrounded, stabbed and shot. He survived the attack, but was left with life-changing injuries. Gabbidon-Lynck escaped the assailants and returned to his car, before attempting to drive into the rival group to halt the attack. As the defendants turned to attack the car, Gabbidon-Lynck tried to reverse before being blocked by a row of parked cars. After running into a nearby hairdresser\u2019s, he was caught and stabbed five times, severing an artery, in scenes that prosecutor Oliver Glasgow described as \u201creminiscent of a Hollywood film\u201d. The group, thought to be members of Tottenham\u2019s NPK gang, fled the scene, changing their clothes and abandoning their car at Broadwater Farm Estate. Stancombe described the attack as one of \u201cpetty postcode rivalry\u201d, carried out \u201cwith a ferocity I have rarely seen\u201d. In a statement, he said: \u201cIn truth, there are no winners, no bragging rights or anything to be proud of. One man is dead, another has life-changing injuries, a family is utterly bereft and five young men will spend the best days of their lives behind bars.\u201d He praised the family of Gabbidon-Lynck, and said they had \u201cmaintained their dignity in very difficult circumstances\u201d throughout the trial. The defendants, who will serve a minimum of between 21 and 28 years in jail, denied the charges.",

      "bodyText": "I sat down at my desk on the first day of the new decade to reflect, and worked out that I had taken 13 international flights (return, that is) and three domestic flights, and spent eight months abroad in 2019. There was a five-day period in October when I crossed three continents and took four international flights, with each leg being 10 hours or more. Packing for my long-haul flights has become so second nature to me that I find separating my lights from my darks on laundry day a harder task. Here are my 10 in-flight essentials. 1. Noise-cancelling headphones Some people enjoy the white noise of the plane engine but I\u2019m certainly not one of them. Having noise-cancelling headphones guards you against any snoring neighbours, screaming kids and noise from the cabin. If you have ones that you\u2019ve worn in and fit your head and ears perfectly, make sure to pack them with an adaptor so they can be used with the in-flight entertainment system. Upgrade your experience: Noise-cancelling headphones are a must and you can relax knowing Cathay Pacific provides them to all Premium Economy and Business Class passengers, but for the ultimate sound comfort, upgrade to the latest in aircraft technology and fly on a Cathay Pacific A350. Designed to minimise sound and jet lag, the A350s are 50% quieter in perceived levels of external noise. 2. Sleeping mask and thick socks I\u2019m someone who struggles to sleep on planes when there are lights on around me; I need complete darkness. Sometimes you may find yourself with a neighbour who just doesn\u2019t want to sleep and insists on reading a tearjerker Nicholas Sparks novel for the duration of your flight, so having a sleeping mask is crucial to make sure you get those zeds. If you want to make your trip feel really luxe, invest in a silk sleeping mask. Upgrade your experience: Cathay provides sleeping masks and socks to all guests travelling in Premium Economy and Business Class. And if you\u2019re flying in the comfort of the latest A350 aircraft you will be lulled to sleep by inbuilt, intelligent mood lighting. 3. Cleansing wipes and sheet masks My biggest issue when I\u2019m doing a lot of flying is taking care of my skin. Dehydration is almost always a given when you fly, and you need to keep your skin as well as your body hydrated. I usually pack cleansing wipes and disposable sheet masks. Upgrade your experience: Cathay Pacific provides hot towels in Premium Economy and Business Class as part of in-flight service and pre-landing. Business Class customers also get a Bamford hydrating face mist. 4. Beauty kit An essential beauty kit for me would usually include a lip balm and moisturiser to complement the above. If you happen to be meeting someone as you get off the plane - cough, such as a handsome man you\u2019ve been seeing, cough - you may want to bring some CC cream with you to do a pre-landing touch-up. I\u2019m not sure about you guys but I certainly do not sashay off the plane looking like Giselle B\u00fcndchen and definitely need all the cover-up I can get so that I don\u2019t look like I\u2019ve just run off the cast of The Walking Dead. Oh, and before I forget, bring your usual toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash. Who wants to smell your stank breath? Upgrade your experience: Cathay\u2019s new Business Class amenity kit, in collaboration with UK luxury brand Bamford, includes a Bamford hand and body lotion, hydrating face mist and lip balm (as well as toothbrush, toothpaste mouthwash, eye mask and earplugs). 5. Portable battery pack Let\u2019s face it\u2026 is there anything more terrifying than seeing that battery icon flash bright red on your phone? Save yourself the unnecessary anxiety and bring a portable charger with you when you travel. And with that, a charging cable. Upgrade your experience: Cathay Pacific aircraft have a USB port for phone charging at each seat. 6. Hair maintenance We should never forget the hair; after hours of being in an enclosed space, taking care of the bird\u2019s nest is almost as essential as eliminating your stank breath. I suggest bringing a scrunchie to keep your hair under control during the flight, and dry shampoo (ensure it\u2019s less than 100ml) post flight. Some dry shampoos smell amazing and almost double as a deodorant to mask any indecent smells, so make sure you find a good one. 7. A good book There are only so many movies you can watch during a flight before those eyes start to tire, so I find it useful to bring a good read. I also find that if you\u2019re struggling to sleep, reading almost always facilitates heavy eyelids. Upgrade your experience: Prefer to binge-watch? Cathay offers multiseason box sets of award-winning drama series, so you can watch from the pilot to the latest season finale. 8. Reusable and collapsible water bottle It\u2019s the 21st century and saving the environment should be front of mind for all of us.

Upgrade your experience: In Cathay Pacific Business Class, comfortable slippers are provided for use in-flight. 10. Rollerball perfume As I mentioned earlier, I smell pretty average after a flight - as I\u2019m sure everyone does. When a shower is still hours away, save the noses of those around you by having a decent rollerball perfume in your handbag. At most airports, Sephora and Mecca Cosmetica will have a range available for you. Upgrade your experience and book your next long haul with Cathay Pacific.",

Quite good stuff, this:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yeah, tough opening period of the game for us, and that\u2019s where we lost the match. Arsenal started brightly, we didn\u2019t. We weren\u2019t our best, that was very clear. We found it difficult to get pressure on the ball, we found it difficult to get on the ball, they went two goals up and it was a tough evening for us. We responded really well. With 15 minutes to go in the first half we found our gears, and from there we were fine. There were elements of our game that we need to look at and address, problems we had on the pitch that we didn\u2019t deal with well enough, but I think it was more a feeling that wasn\u2019t quite there today. A feeling that we had against Brighton, that we had to dig in and fight and scrap. We were losing too many duels, missing too many tackles. </p> <p>It\u2019s hugely frustrating. I know the players aren\u2019t going out there intentionally to deliver that, but it\u2019s where we are at the moment. We\u2019re a little bit Jekyll and Hyde, in that we can perform, we can compete, we can do everything we need to do to win games, and then sometimes that\u2019s missing. That\u2019s the frustrating part. From my side, I don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going to turn up. The one quality we do need to show between now and the end of the season is the nasty stuff, the horrible stuff, the off-the-ball bits that we need to do. We have to deliver that.

That\u2019s what we\u2019re about to witness. For this, ladies and gentlemen, is the very first FA Cup tie between Bournemouth and Arsenal. The Cherries are looking to reach round five for the fifth time in their history (they\u2019ve have reached the sixth round once, in 1957, and never got any further), Arsenal for the first time in three years (though they got at least that far in all but three of the preceding 17 years, in which time they reached seven finals and won six). There is, as you will have noticed, a massive disparity in Cup-flavoured achievement between these clubs, and for all their problems this season Arsenal remain eight places above their relegation-haunted opponents, but Bournemouth have home advantage and Ye Old Magic of the Cup to call upon, so anything is possible. </p> <p>For Arsenal, Exciting Youngster Gabriel Martinelli is likely to start - \u201cWe have to bring him down,\u201d said Mikel Arteta, which as it happens is precisely the thought that ran through David Luiz\u2019s head when Tammy Abraham looked like scoring for Chelsea last week, which is why he\u2019s suspended for this one. Bournemouth fielded a more than decent team in their third-round match against Luton, and we can thus expect similar this time even if Eddie Howe suggested he would rest the \u201cplayers playing with injuries that ideally if we had a full squad to pick from wouldn\u2019t be playing\u201d, without suggesting who these players were.</p> <p>Anyway, and to conclude, I\u2019m hoping for a rollicking Cup tie. Welcome all! <br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m gone. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! And Eddie Howe has a good chinwag. Quite good stuff, this: Yeah, tough opening period of the game for us, and that\u2019s where we lost the match. Arsenal started brightly, we didn\u2019t. We weren\u2019t our best, that was very clear. We found it difficult to get pressure on the ball, we found it difficult to get on the ball, they went two goals up and it was a tough evening for us. We responded really well. With 15 minutes to go in the first half we found our gears, and from there we were fine. There were elements of our game that we need to look at and address, problems we had on the pitch that we didn\u2019t deal with well enough, but I think it was more a feeling that wasn\u2019t quite there today. A feeling that we had against Brighton, that we had to dig in and fight and scrap. We were losing too many duels, missing too many tackles. It\u2019s hugely frustrating. I know the players aren\u2019t going out there intentionally to deliver that, but it\u2019s where we are at the moment. We\u2019re a little bit Jekyll and Hyde, in that we can perform, we can compete, we can do everything we need to do to win games, and then sometimes that\u2019s missing. That\u2019s the frustrating part. From my side, I don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going to turn up. The one quality we do need to show between now and the end of the season is the nasty stuff, the horrible stuff, the off-the-ball bits that we need to do. We have to deliver that. We can\u2019t afford not to. Mikel Arteta has a chat. What, he\u2019s asked, did he like about Arsenal\u2019s display? I think the way we started the game, and the way they followed what we wanted to do, to generate overloads and space in the areas we wanted. In the second half we became a little bit sloppy in our passing, the rhythm was down and I didn\u2019t like that very much. And in the second half we knew they were going to push, and we suffered a little bit and conceded a goal in the end, which made it difficult and nervous. He\u2019s asked about Martinelli and Sako, and their combinations on the left which were a feature of the first half: We need to find different ways to generate good situations for us, and they start to understand what I\u2019m looking for from them. I would like us to be a little bit more flexible with some things we can do, but in general with the young lads I\u2019m really happy today. And finally, on the prospect of them plundering the transfer market this month: We are in the market and the club is trying to facilitate us one or two boys, but I don\u2019t know. When we have something to say we will confirm it with you. This cannot be coincidence. Alright, it could be, but a really extraordinary one. Here\u2019s Ed Aarons\u2019 match report from the Vitality Stadium: If this is what Mikel Arteta\u2019s vision for Arsenal\u2019s future looks like then the club should be in very safe hands. First-half goals from youth team products Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah secured a first away victory for their manager since he succeeded Unai Emery that sets up another trip to the south coast to play Portsmouth in the fifth round. Along with the impressive Joe Willock and Gabriel Martinelli, Arteta\u2019s decision to field a starting lineup that featured four players aged 20 and under paid dividends here with an all-action display that left Eddie Howe\u2019s side chasing shadows at times during the first half. Much more here: Bournemouth weren\u2019t great in the second half, but they were at least competitive. They threw themselves around a bit, they closed down, they denied Arsenal the space and time that helped them dominate the opening period. Arsenal looked good in the first half, but most teams would have looked good against that Bournemouth side. They also sustained a potentially serious defensive injury, with Mustafi being stretchered off, which is good or bad, depending on your perspective. 90+11 mins: While the goal kick is in the air, the final whistle blows! 90+10 mins: The chance! Fraser crosses, Martinez roars off his line to punch to Lewis Cook on the edge of the area, who chests down and half-volleys high! 90+10 mins: They\u2019re still going. Bournemouth have the ball, but too far from goal. 90+8 mins: Surridge is booked for fouling Guendouzi. Guendouzi himself has negotiated the game without a caution, remarkably. 90+7 mins: Ceballos is closed down by Lewis Cook as he clears the ball. He goes down for a while, which is good game management or bad cheating, depending on your viewpoint. 90+5 mins: The goal stands. Bournemouth have three minutes (and some more stoppage time) to lay siege to the Arsenal penalty area. 90+5 mins: VAR wants to see some more replays of the goal. I can\u2019t see any other reason for him stopping proceedings here. Francis\u2019s cross goes through a cluster of bodies to Surridge, who takes a touch to control before tapping into the net, with Martinez grounded and irrelevant. 90+3 mins: Guendouzi hits a 25-yard shot that keeps rising, clearing the bar by a foot or so. 90+2 mins: Xhaka is booked for timewasting, as he dallies over a free-kick. 90+2 mins: Arsenal make their final change, bringing Ainsley Maitland-Niles on for Willock. 90+1 mins: There will be about eight minutes of stoppage time. Eight! 89 mins: Bournemouth\u2019s final substitution sees Sam Surridge replace Dominic Solanke. 89 mins: Bournemouth remain one goal away from making this interesting. Francis\u2019s cross is thumped clear by Guendouzi. 86 mins: The frustrating thing about Ceballos is that his surname very nearly means onions, but doesn\u2019t (that would be cebollas). He thus fails to make it into a vegetable-name XI, alongside Fabrizio Ravanelli (radishes) and, um, some others I don\u2019t know. 85 mins: Arsenal win a corner now. Ceballos sends it in, it\u2019s flicked on and then headed clear, all without anyone hurting anyone else. 83 mins: Both players have recovered. There might be quite a lot of injury time here. 81 mins: More injuries. This time Cook and Sokratis clash heads in the area. 81 mins: Both players recover, and a couple of minutes later Gosling, from the edge of the D, has a shot that deflects off Xhaka for a corner. 79 mins: More injuries. Saka goes down after a collision with Gosling, who gets up, runs on and collides with Guendouzi. 77 mins: A spell of Bournemouth possession in their own half ends with Cook, under pressure from Nketiah, passing out of play for a corner. Matt Stephens writes: \u201cA comfortable away victory, a clean sheet and a Mustafi injury. Surely I am dreaming!\u201d 76 mins: That\u2019s Simpson\u2019s last contribution to the game. He and Harry Wilson come off, and Callum Wilson and Simon Francis are on. 75 mins: Simpson and Bellerin both go for a lofted pass on the Bournemouth left. Bellerin wins it in the air, and Simpson jumps into him. The Arsenal player is receiving treatment. 73 mins: This game is still being played at a decent tempo, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that one team knows it no longer has to score, and the other no longer knows how to score. 70 mins: It is absolutely tipping down in Bournemouth now. Arsenal take off Pepe, and bring on Dani Ceballos. 68 mins: Bellerin surges forwards. Just back from a lengthy injury lay-off, the Spaniard scored a late goal in his comeback game at Chelsea and is sprinting 70 yards at this stage of this one, which seems admirable. 66 mins: Oooooh! Martinez comes out and flaps at the corner, and Simpson heads just wide of the empty net! 66 mins: Another corner. The home fans are starting to believe. 65 mins: Holding\u2019s first task is to concede a corner. Sokratis heads it clear. 62 mins: Mustafi departs on the stretcher and is taken straight down the tunnel. Holding is on. 61 mins: Mustafi will play no more. A stretcher has been brought on, and Rob Holding is being readied. 60 mins: It did look like Mustafi landed very awkwardly on his left foot, and that his ankle might very well be genuinely sore. Though of course he could just be timewasting. 58 mins: The ball bounces towards Arsenal\u2019s penalty area, with Solanke bustling around threateningly. Martinez comes out and goes to head it, Mustafi beats him to it, and the defender ends up on the ground, clutching his left shin. Bournemouth don\u2019t profit from all of this panic. 57 mins: The home fans are now booing Martinelli, because of his play-acting, and Guendouzi, because he and Gosling aren\u2019t playing nice. 57 mins: Guendouzi brings down Lewis Cook. There was hardly any contact, which is presumably why the referee didn\u2019t get out his book for a player who has been booking-bound since the very early stages. 54 mins: Bournemouth send a fine ball into the area, but Martinelli - who not only didn\u2019t have a head injury a few minutes back, but no injury at all - heads clear. 53 mins: Guendouzi goes to pick up a dead ball, at which Gosling tries to stamp on it, and the two players square up. It was Bournemouth\u2019s ball, so Guendouzi should probably have kept his hands off it, but Gosling\u2019s attempt to take it seemed a little over-aggressive. 51 mins: Play continues for an age with Martinelli on the turf, apparently hurt. Arsenal attack for a while, then Bournemouth win the ball and have a go. Eventually the referee stops play though it\u2019s hard to see why, there not being a head injury to worry about. 47 mins: Obviously Bournemouth will be needing a goal soonish, and not to concede again, if they are to have a chance here. Arsenal though have the first attack of the half, and the first corner, which is competently defended. 46 mins: And they\u2019re off! The players are back out and ready for more. A goal and an assist for Bukayo Saka already, and he\u2019s outassisting his teammates this season by a convincing margin. Half-time viewing: \u201cHi Simon,\u201d writes Ben. Hi!. \u201cThe confusingly titled Live is Life, which you mention [a while ago now, but still - ed] was blasting out at the Vitality Stadium, will always be associated with this quite amazing video of Maradona warming up in 1989.\u201d 45+3 mins: Bournemouth demonstrated in the closing stages of the half that this could have been an exciting and closely-contested Cup tie, had they not conceded twice and played like a gang of absolute pranksters for the best part of 40 minutes beforehand. 45+1 mins: There\u2019ll be a couple of minutes of stoppage time. They start with Harry Wilson becoming the night\u2019s first cautionee, after bringing Nketiah down from behind. 45 mins: Bournemouth have had an encouraging five minutes. It\u2019s a shame that the scoreline is so discouraging already, but still. They win a corner, but waste it miserably. 44 mins: Xhaka gives the ball away to Fraser, who exchanges passes with Solanke, jinks his way to the edge of the area and then slices a shot hopelessly wide. 41 mins: Bournemouth have woken up! Fraser passes to the overlapping Simpson, whose pull-back is booted clear by Xhaka. 39 mins: Another Bournemouth shot! This time Wilson (H) crosses from the right and Gosling meets it, though unfortunately he meets it with his shoulder and the ball loops over the bar. 38 mins: Shot! By Bournemouth! Fraser\u2019s cross from the left flicks off a head to Harry Wilson, beyond the far post, whose volley towards the near post is saved by Emiliano Martinez. 37 mins: Gosling steals the ball from Sokratis, who presumably had forgotten that there were any Bournemouth players, so rarely have they bothered him, but Bournemouth fail to capitalise. 35 mins: Simpson does well to stop Nketiah reaching Guendouzi\u2019s through-ball. \u201cArsenal\u2019s search to replace Mustafi is over,\u201d trills Charles Antaki. \u201cThere\u2019s a chap on the field, also called Mustafi, who seems to be a reincarnation of Franco Baresi and Franz Beckenbauer. Sign him up, Mikel!\u201d 33 mins: Pepe distracts every defender in the neighbourhood and then passes to Bellerin, now alone on the right, who has time to measure his cross but Cook wins the battle to put a head on it. 31 mins: Martinelli speeds past Cook on the Arsenal left, gets to the byline and squares for Nketiah, but Ake flings out a foot to deny the visitors a potential third. 29 mins: Shot! Pepe saunters past a few defenders on the right, cuts in, and shoots wide of the near post. 28 mins: This is the worst of VAR, taking an age to make a decision they didn\u2019t even have to make, before deciding that they needn\u2019t have bothered. 27 mins: There is a VAR check in progress, on a possible offside. Though they seem to be checking Martinelli, who didn\u2019t even nearly touch the ball. And Arsenal take a two-goal lead! The last few miutes have been humiliating for Bournemouth. Again Saka is crucial, collecting Willock\u2019s pass and sending in a low cross that goes behind Martinelli but is turned in by Nketiah! 26 mins: Some of Bournemouth\u2019s interplay, their closing down and their defensive shape could have come straight from a how-not-to-play-football instructional video. 24 mins: Arsenal pass the ball around the defence for a while, lulling Bournemouth into a stupor, and then Mustafi smacks a 60-yard pass to Sako, who has gone completely unnoticed on the left, and the Gunners suddenly have a promising attacking situation. Sako\u2019s cross hits a defender, though, and the visitors end with nothing more than a throw-in. 22 mins: Martinelli hopelessly miscues a 30-yarder, which flies high and wide. Arsenal are completely dominant. 20 mins: Save! Bellerin passes infield to Willock, who turns Gosling, nudges the ball past Ake and has a shot from an acute angle that Travers blocks. The ball rebounds back off Willock and into the middle of the six-yard box, but to a defender rather than a forward. 19 mins: Nice work down the left by Arsenal involving Martinelli, Saka and Xhaka, but it ends with a poor, looping cross from Saka, and that\u2019s the end of the attack. 15 mins: Guendouzi fouls Fraser, giving Bournemouth another free-kick. Those are two not very dangerous but extremely sloppy fouls from the Frenchman. Perhaps he\u2019s still a bit dazed after that face-hitting business. 14 mins: Bournemouth win a throw-in on the left, even though Pepe very clearly stopped the whole ball crossing the whole line. I do feel that linesmen are very often overkeen on awarding throw-ins like this. Ho hum. 12 mins: Guendouzi, back on his feet if still a little puce of face, brings Gozling down on the edge of the centre circle, but the free-kick doesn\u2019t threaten the Arsenal defence. 10 mins: The ball hits Guendouzi inside Arsenal\u2019s penalty area and he goes down clutching his face. This is a near-certain sign that it not only hit his arm but also that he knew all about it, however replays show the ball did indeed hit him in the nose. 9 mins: A fine goal, this. You might expect the goalkeeper to save a shot from this angle, but it was an exceptionally vicious one, so we\u2019ll give him a pass. 8 mins: Arsenal win a corner, which is headed away by Ake. The first decent attack ends in a goal! Joe Willock is the inspiration, turning nicely away from Gosling on the halfway line. He runs to the edge of the area before passing to Martinelli on his left, who passes to Saka on his left, who lashes a rising shot past Mark Travers from an acute angle! 2 mins: A couple of early balls forward, one from each team, neither of them successful. 1 min: Peeeeeeep! The whistle blows and Arsenal, in their Bruised Banana away kit, get the game started. And they\u2019re out! And a tweet arrives! \u201cI am equal parts astonished and refreshed that Martinelli isn\u2019t on Twitter,\u201d writes Pete Mumola. Sorry to disappoint, but this appears to be him (or someone else with access to him) The teams are in the tunnel. Kick-off is about four minutes away. Eddie Howe has a chat. Callum Wilson has had an injection in his knee, and Howe wanted to protect the players that aren\u2019t 100% fit today\u201d, hence him being on the bench rather than on the pitch: It\u2019s an important competition for us. It\u2019s our next game. We won our last game, we want to try to build on that momentum and we\u2019d love to be in the next round. I think it\u2019s going to be really good game. We\u2019ve done well here under lights in recent games, so let\u2019s hope that continues. Currently on the PA system at the Vitality Stadium: Live if Life by Opus. Classic! The weather in Bournemouth currently is pure filth. Apparently the rain might stop by half-time. The draw has been concluded, and the winners from this tie will be away to Portsmouth in the fifth round. The fifth-round draw is about to happen. Follow it live with me here: This just in from Bournemouth\u2019s changing room. Brooklyn Genesini is on the bench, and in line to make his first senior appearance today. He\u2019s an 18-year-old full-back. Here are the teams again in totally plain text form: Bournemouth: Travers, Smith, S Cook, Ake, Simpson, L Cook, Surman, Gosling, H Wilson, Fraser, Solanke. Subs: Ramsdale, Francis, C Wilson, Billing, Surridge, Dobre, Genesini. Arsenal: Martinez, Bellerin, Mustafi, Sokratis, Saka, Guendouzi, Xhaka, Pepe, Willock, Martinelli, Nketiah. Subs: Leno, Ceballos, Lacazette, Ozil, Torreira, Maitland-Niles, Holding. Referee: Martin Atkinson. Team news is very much in, and here it is in Twitterish form: Hello world! History in the making. That\u2019s what we\u2019re about to witness. For this, ladies and gentlemen, is the very first FA Cup tie between Bournemouth and Arsenal. The Cherries are looking to reach round five for the fifth time in their history (they\u2019ve have reached the sixth round once, in 1957, and never got any further), Arsenal for the first time in three years (though they got at least that far in all but three of the preceding 17 years, in which time they reached seven finals and won six). There is, as you will have noticed, a massive disparity in Cup-flavoured achievement between these clubs, and for all their problems this season Arsenal remain eight places above their relegation-haunted opponents, but Bournemouth have home advantage and Ye Old Magic of the Cup to call upon, so anything is possible. For Arsenal, Exciting Youngster Gabriel Martinelli is likely to start - \u201cWe have to bring him down,\u201d said Mikel Arteta, which as it happens is precisely the thought that ran through David Luiz\u2019s head when Tammy Abraham looked like scoring for Chelsea last week, which is why he\u2019s suspended for this one. Bournemouth fielded a more than decent team in their third-round match against Luton, and we can thus expect similar this time even if Eddie Howe suggested he would rest the \u201cplayers playing with injuries that ideally if we had a full squad to pick from wouldn\u2019t be playing\u201d, without suggesting who these players were. Anyway, and to conclude, I\u2019m hoping for a rollicking Cup tie. Welcome all!",

      "bodyText": "A youthful French side have been warned to brace themselves for a crash course in Test-match reality on Sunday when England head to Paris for the opening round of the 2020 Six Nations Championship. Eddie Jones is clearly tiring of reading about the hosts\u2019 fresh-faced potential and says England will ruthlessly target anyone who is not up to it. Despite the untimely injury withdrawal of the highly rated hooker Camille Chat, France are still hoping to make a lively start to the tournament with a number of newcomers set to feature at the Stade de France. Jones, however, insists there are no shortcuts at international level and has promised France\u2019s new caps a baptism of fire. \u201cIt is going to test those young players because they will have never played against a brutal physicality and intensity that we are going to play with on Sunday,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is not domestic rugby. That is why you call it Test rugby. \u201cAt stages they are going to be looking at each other wanting to know where the answers are going to come from.

      "body": "<p>Gimmicky policies, horrible inefficiency and factional promotions are among the catalogue of errors behind Labour\u2019s dismal performance at the general election, according to party members.</p> \n<p>The damning comments on Labour\u2019s campaign form part of an early release of views gathered by a team headed by the former party leader Ed Miliband consisting of MPs, union leaders and party members. They have tasked themselves with analysing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign and suggesting ways the party might find a path back to power.</p> \n<p>More than 8,000 people have replied to the nationwide call for members\u2019 experiences and reasons that led to Labour suffering its worst defeat since 1935. A full analysis of the findings will be conducted by the Labour Together Review commission after it closes on 21 February.</p> \n<p>Comments received so far include that party\u2019s free broadband commitment felt \u201cgimmicky and distracting\u201d for voters. Another member who responded said they thought promotions to positions of authority were \u201cbased on nothing more than factional loyalty\u201d.</p> \n<p>One supporter said the strategy of targeting elites was seen as \u201cTrumpian\u201d by voters. \u201cFeel that our rhetoric around \u2018elites\u2019 and who we didn\u2019t like or support made us look negative and aggressive,\u201d they said. </p> \n<p>A phone system was also \u201cdown at the start\u201d of the campaign and an online uploading platform described as \u201cclunky\u201d. One team member said: \u201cIt crashed several times and this whole area was the most stressful aspect of running the campaign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking at a campaign event in Oxford, Rebecca Long-Bailey said she didn\u2019t think voters had rejected socialism at the general election, and that she would never apologise for the Labour manifesto. \u201cI spent the last four years writing the policies that were contained within that manifesto \u2026 I thought it was the most hopeful manifesto I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> \n<p>She asserted her commitment to bringing academies back into local authority control, repealing the 2010 Health and Social Care Act and ensuring the rights of EU workers after Brexit.</p> \n<p>Reports over the weekend suggested some Labour MPs were threatening to quit the party if Long-Bailey is chosen as leader, and she emphasised the need for unity between all sides of the party. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been a unified party, and whoever the leader becomes we have to have a united party going forward because divided parties don\u2019t win general elections. Whether you\u2019re a Labour member or a Labour MP I would expect you to support our chosen leader.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shabana Mahmood MP, one of the review commissioners and a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee, said: \u201c[It is] still very early days, and we\u2019re encouraging as many Labour party members as possible to take the survey and share their views, alongside our plans to listen to voters in seats we lost and need to win to form a government, many responses so far reflect the big issues of this election: leadership, Brexit, antisemitism and the role of media.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs the review progresses we want to get a much deeper understanding of some of the lessons this provides for the future. Further detailed in depth analysis and listening to MPs that won, and defeated MPs and candidates, as well as the wider membership and the public will enable us to do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Also on the review team are Miliband, Lucy Powell MP, James Meadway, a former adviser to shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the general secretary of the TSSA union, Manuel Cortes, and Jo Platt, the former MP for Leigh.</p> \n<p>The review team met for the first time earlier this month. As well as the survey, they are holding listening events in heartland seats, examining the ground campaign, analysing the role of Facebook and social media, and looking at the part trade unions played.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d63977e-7c74-49ae-9fe0-e262bc9c6b17\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kC3vgUBCl00?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Each defeated Labour MP has been written to for their opinions on the election, and Labour candidates in the 124 seats the party must win to form a majority, according to analysis by the Fabian Society. The final document will also suggest ways the party can win again in the future, after suffering four election losses in 10 years.</p> \n<p>There were some positive views among the responses, with praise for the event pages for members and the Organise app, which had allowed people to communicate well. Activists\u2019 individual efforts were also recognised, with appraisals such as \u201ceveryone did their best\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb903f00-7374-421b-b47f-ef6529a1d17a\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>\u2022 The \u201cred wall\u201d was a huge block of Labour-voting constituencies stretching from north Wales into Merseyside, through Greater Manchester along the Midlands and up to the north-east.

      "bodyText": "Gimmicky policies, horrible inefficiency and factional promotions are among the catalogue of errors behind Labour\u2019s dismal performance at the general election, according to party members. The damning comments on Labour\u2019s campaign form part of an early release of views gathered by a team headed by the former party leader Ed Miliband consisting of MPs, union leaders and party members. They have tasked themselves with analysing Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s campaign and suggesting ways the party might find a path back to power. More than 8,000 people have replied to the nationwide call for members\u2019 experiences and reasons that led to Labour suffering its worst defeat since 1935. A full analysis of the findings will be conducted by the Labour Together Review commission after it closes on 21 February. Comments received so far include that party\u2019s free broadband commitment felt \u201cgimmicky and distracting\u201d for voters. Another member who responded said they thought promotions to positions of authority were \u201cbased on nothing more than factional loyalty\u201d. One supporter said the strategy of targeting elites was seen as \u201cTrumpian\u201d by voters. \u201cFeel that our rhetoric around \u2018elites\u2019 and who we didn\u2019t like or support made us look negative and aggressive,\u201d they said. A phone system was also \u201cdown at the start\u201d of the campaign and an online uploading platform described as \u201cclunky\u201d. One team member said: \u201cIt crashed several times and this whole area was the most stressful aspect of running the campaign.\u201d Speaking at a campaign event in Oxford, Rebecca Long-Bailey said she didn\u2019t think voters had rejected socialism at the general election, and that she would never apologise for the Labour manifesto. \u201cI spent the last four years writing the policies that were contained within that manifesto \u2026 I thought it was the most hopeful manifesto I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d She asserted her commitment to bringing academies back into local authority control, repealing the 2010 Health and Social Care Act and ensuring the rights of EU workers after Brexit. Reports over the weekend suggested some Labour MPs were threatening to quit the party if Long-Bailey is chosen as leader, and she emphasised the need for unity between all sides of the party. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been a unified party, and whoever the leader becomes we have to have a united party going forward because divided parties don\u2019t win general elections. Whether you\u2019re a Labour member or a Labour MP I would expect you to support our chosen leader.\u201d Shabana Mahmood MP, one of the review commissioners and a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee, said: \u201c[It is] still very early days, and we\u2019re encouraging as many Labour party members as possible to take the survey and share their views, alongside our plans to listen to voters in seats we lost and need to win to form a government, many responses so far reflect the big issues of this election: leadership, Brexit, antisemitism and the role of media. \u201cAs the review progresses we want to get a much deeper understanding of some of the lessons this provides for the future. Further detailed in depth analysis and listening to MPs that won, and defeated MPs and candidates, as well as the wider membership and the public will enable us to do this.\u201d Also on the review team are Miliband, Lucy Powell MP, James Meadway, a former adviser to shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the general secretary of the TSSA union, Manuel Cortes, and Jo Platt, the former MP for Leigh. The review team met for the first time earlier this month. As well as the survey, they are holding listening events in heartland seats, examining the ground campaign, analysing the role of Facebook and social media, and looking at the part trade unions played. Each defeated Labour MP has been written to for their opinions on the election, and Labour candidates in the 124 seats the party must win to form a majority, according to analysis by the Fabian Society. The final document will also suggest ways the party can win again in the future, after suffering four election losses in 10 years. There were some positive views among the responses, with praise for the event pages for members and the Organise app, which had allowed people to communicate well. Activists\u2019 individual efforts were also recognised, with appraisals such as \u201ceveryone did their best\u201d. The review was heavily criticised when it launched in late December for the involvement of Miliband and Powell, who lost the 2015 general election. Powell, who represents Manchester Central, was Miliband\u2019s campaign manager. She has previously defended their roles, suggesting Miliband retained his Labour seat in the \u201cred wall\u201d as others fell to the Tories; has been campaigning in the traditional heartland of Doncaster regularly for the past four years; and has as much to offer \u201cas the next person\u201d. They are not due to recommend a leadership candidate to succeed Corbyn. Their report comes as Labour leadership candidates were presented with a second analysis of the election defeat from Europe for the Many, an organisation that brings together academics and campaigners. They suggest the party will not win the next election without regaining socially conservative voters but warned achieving that presents Labour with a serious challenge. Their report, The Devastating Defeat, found that in the 2019 election, voters focused on values and identity over economic policies, which advantaged the Tories, particularly in ex-heartland seats. But any rush to recapture socially conservative voters should not lead to Labour imitating Tory policies on immigration and law, they warn. This could create difficulties in managing Labour\u2019s membership, and previous attempts to become more authoritarian \u2013 citing Gordon Brown\u2019s \u201cBritish jobs for British workers\u201d \u2013 had lacked credibility. Abandoning all discussion of rejoining the EU was also essential for the future electoral success of Labour, the report said. Bridget Phillipson, Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, said: \u201cTo win over voters who are less socially liberal than Labour is today, but more economically leftwing than the Tories, we should not impersonate them.\u201d Luke Cooper, an associate researcher at the LSE, said: \u201cBrexit has created a really tough situation for Labour. By making values and identity the central questions of the day, it has broken the party\u2019s traditional electoral coalition.\u201d",

While strolling the trails in the island\u2019s two parks, Parque Nacional Chilo\u00e9 and Parque Tantauco, you might see the world\u2019s smallest deer, the pudu, as well as Darwin\u2019s fox, named after Charles Darwin\u2019s visit here in 1834. You can visit a protected penguin colony, Monumento Natural Islotes de Pu\u00f1ihuil, that\u2019s the only place in the world where you can see both Humboldt and Magellanic penguins at once - time your trip between September and March to catch the breeding season, when the beaches are alive with the waddling, tuxedo-clad little birds. Keen birders will be delighted to know that shearwaters, albatrosses, terns and petrels are all found here. You can also spot blue whales, dolphins and sea lions cruising past the island. Getting - and staying - there From Chile\u2019s capital of Santiago (just a 13-hour flight from Australia), it\u2019s a short flight to Puerto Montt, then a brief journey with one of Chile\u2019s excellent bus companies, which will take you directly to the island\u2019s main city. Once there, you\u2019re spoilt for choice with where to stay. Gazing out over the smaller islands that scatter the Sea of Chilo\u00e9 is Tierra Chilo\u00e9, a stylish five-star hotel with excellent dining options and a luxurious spa. The wood-shingled OCIO Territorial Hotel is another environmentally friendly option on the Rilan Peninsula, where you can enjoy a hot tub under the star, while the water-front eco-lodges at Refugio Pullao - designed to maximise your connection with nature - offers incredible birdwatching, with tours on offer. It\u2019s easy to fall for Chilo\u00e9\u2019s distinctive charms - but it\u2019s hard to leave the enchanted isle. For more information, visit chile.travel/en.",

The need to accommodate nuclear power pushes up bills because windfarm owners are being paid to turn off turbines and avoid making unwanted free electricity. The problem of intermittency has not been completely cracked because the grid and technology needs updating to cope with the occasional shortfalls of renewables but batteries, pump storage, biogas turbines and other engineering tricks are rapidly solving the problem. Out of earshot of the politicians, the question of what to do with all the surplus power when demand is low is being tackled by increasing storage capacity but also by making green hydrogen. Some nuclear buffs are even suggesting hydrogen production might be the only viable hope for using up their spare power.",

Both teams, then, will be at full tilt.</p> \n<p>Leicester travel with the knowledge they have already demolished Villa at the same venue this season \u2013 winning 4-1 in the Premier League in December \u2013 but while that may bolster their confidence, there must also be a nagging fear that Villa have grown stronger since then and, indeed, since they battled for that draw in the first leg. Smith hopes this game will bring proof that his team are getting better at both ends of the pitch.</p> \n<p>Their defensive solidity has improved since the manager\u2019s switch to a back-three formation, as was apparent in a first leg in which Villa fended off heavy pressure from Rodgers\u2019 side, who dominated possession. Pepe Reina has joined the club since then and the arrival of an experienced goalkeeper has fortified Villa\u2019s backline even further.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1347ced-6bc5-4c6f-81f5-71c59b0e47b2\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Up top, meanwhile, Villa hope Samatta will provide the sharpness that they have lacked too often this season.

      "bodyText": "Leicester City\u2019s ambition for this season is to qualify for the Champions League while Aston Villa\u2019s main aim is to stave off relegation from the Premier League, but on Tuesday both clubs will have only one thing on their minds: reaching the Carabao Cup final. With their semi-final perfectly balanced after the 1-1 draw in the first leg, the importance of the second leg at Villa Park can be gauged by the fact Brendan Rodgers says Jamie Vardy could play despite not being fully fit and Dean Smith is likely to give a debut to Villa\u2019s new \u00a38.5m striker Mbwana \u201cAlly\u201d Samatta. Both teams, then, will be at full tilt. Leicester travel with the knowledge they have already demolished Villa at the same venue this season \u2013 winning 4-1 in the Premier League in December \u2013 but while that may bolster their confidence, there must also be a nagging fear that Villa have grown stronger since then and, indeed, since they battled for that draw in the first leg. Smith hopes this game will bring proof that his team are getting better at both ends of the pitch. Their defensive solidity has improved since the manager\u2019s switch to a back-three formation, as was apparent in a first leg in which Villa fended off heavy pressure from Rodgers\u2019 side, who dominated possession. Pepe Reina has joined the club since then and the arrival of an experienced goalkeeper has fortified Villa\u2019s backline even further. Up top, meanwhile, Villa hope Samatta will provide the sharpness that they have lacked too often this season. The winger Anwar El Ghazi did a reasonable job filling in for Wesley after the Brazilian striker suffered cruciate ligament damage in the win at Burnley on New Year\u2019s Day, but Villa\u2019s need for a specialist goalscorer has been achingly obvious.

      "bodyText": "A federal court has ruled Arizona Republicans\u2019 ban on mail-in ballots is illegal and unconstitutional, calling it intentionally discriminatory toward people of color, who already face increased barriers to voting. The ruling is a major victory for the Democratic party, which filed the suit, and will likely make it easier for minorities to get their ballots counted in the largely red state. Four years ago, Arizona Republicans made it a felony, punishable by prison time, for third-party groups to collect mail-in ballots during elections \u2013 a process often called \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d Marginalized communities in the state may rely more on ballot harvesting, the court noted. Native Americans, for example, benefit significantly from third-party ballot collection efforts because just 18% of registered voters have mail service at home, and reservations can be far from polling stations. Some minority communities also have widespread distrust in the mailing system: in San Luis, a city that is 98% Hispanic, a major highway separates 13,000 residents from the nearest post office. \u201cThe adverse impact on minority communities is substantial. Without \u2018access to reliable and secure mail services,\u2019 and without reliable transportation, many minority voters \u2018prefer instead to give their ballots to a volunteer\u2019,\u201d the court said. And Hispanics and Native Americans make up nearly 37% of the state\u2019s population \u2013 promising to be a key demographic in this year\u2019s presidential election.

Republicans have claimed that several of those changes, including the Arizona ballot harvesting ban, were created to avoid voter fraud.

Broadsword to Danny Boy.</p> <p>All of which was predictably wasted on Warman, who merely wittered on about the government doing nothing to compromise national security while making sure Boris could honour his election pledges for everyone to download movies on their phones a bit quicker. Besides, if Huawei was to be allowed to run riot on the UK\u2019s 5G networks, then it would only be given access to \u201cedge\u201d rather than \u201ccore\u201d activities.</p> <p>This was \u201cDoor\u201d Matt at his most dim. Because the whole point of 5G is there is no difference between edge and core activities. Everything will be connected to everything. Once a half-decent hacker is into your fridge, it\u2019s only a matter of time before he\u2019s into Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s phone. And from there it\u2019s a superhighway to MI6 and GCHQ.

It\u2019s so sweet that, after all this time, there are still some MPs who are surprised that Johnson doesn\u2019t keep his promises. Julian Lewis simply wondered why the intelligence security committee had not been consulted. Duh! Because it would have told the government not to go anywhere near Huawei, that\u2019s why.</p> <p>The only MP to speak up for Huawei was the Tory Crispin Blunt. The Americans were just jealous of the fact that we might get a digital head start on them. And, so what if the Chinese found out a few things we would have rather kept to ourselves? Data security was so 2019. What the hell was wrong with sharing stuff with a country with a dodgy record on human rights and democracy that would have the potential to shut down the UK\u2019s entire national grid, if it made online shopping in rural areas a bit easier?</p> <p>Warman survived more or less unscathed as MPs didn\u2019t want to give him too hard a time. There was no point in shooting the messenger \u2013 especially one who didn\u2019t even understand the message. The real battle would come on Tuesday, when the decision would be announced. Then there would be a significant number of Tories wondering why on earth a Tory government was selling itself out to the Chinese. It just remained to be seen if Boris would have the guts to tell the Commons in person. Because sadly Lady Nicky would yet again be unavoidably detained.</p>",

What the hell was wrong with sharing stuff with a country with a dodgy record on human rights and democracy that would have the potential to shut down the UK\u2019s entire national grid, if it made online shopping in rural areas a bit easier? Warman survived more or less unscathed as MPs didn\u2019t want to give him too hard a time. There was no point in shooting the messenger \u2013 especially one who didn\u2019t even understand the message. The real battle would come on Tuesday, when the decision would be announced. Then there would be a significant number of Tories wondering why on earth a Tory government was selling itself out to the Chinese. It just remained to be seen if Boris would have the guts to tell the Commons in person. Because sadly Lady Nicky would yet again be unavoidably detained.",

      "body": "<p>From wildfires to rising tides, the climate crisis is already bringing many threats. Now scientists say it may also bring a shortage of many popular wines.</p> <p>Researchers looked at the land suitable for 11 popular varieties of wine grape and found that 2C (3.6F) of warming above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a rise the world is on track to exceed \u2013 would result in a 56% loss of suitable land within current wine-growing regions compared with the 1970s, before the most serious impacts of global heating.</p> <p>The white grape variety ugni blanc (also known as trebbiano toscano) is expected to lose 76% of its suitable growing area, and riesling 66%. The red grape grenache is predicted to lose 31% of the area currently deemed suitable for growing the variety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/23/countries-must-triple-climate-emissions-targets-to-limit-global-heating-to-2c\">Countries must triple climate emission cut targets to limit global heating to 2C</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the team said the glass was not necessarily half empty. Ignacio Morales-Castilla, the co-author of the study from the University of Alcal\u00e1, Spain, said: \u201cThe positive message is that we can still adapt viticulture to climate change \u2013 and diversity is a very interesting tool to do that. But the warning \u2026 is we should limit warming [as much as] possible, because the more warming we have, the fewer options for adaptation.\u201d</p> <p>Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Morales-Castilla and colleagues report how they built a computer model that takes into account the timing of processes such as budding and fruit ripening for the 11 different varieties, as well as the climate in areas where these varieties are currently grown. From this, they identified areas within current wine-growing regions suitable for each of the 11 varieties.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/wine-climate-change-zip/giv-3902OD760Xz5D3Qw/\" data-alt=\"Guardian graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/wine-climate-change-zip/giv-3902OD760Xz5D3Qw/\">Guardian graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The model suggests global heating may hit the wine cellar hard: if no action is taken, a 2C rise would result in a 56% loss in land for the 11 varieties . A 4C rise would mean 85% of these areas would be lost.</p> <p>While Morales-Castilla said that was partly down to factors such as changes in rainfall, the main driver was heat. He noted this might damage plants, or speed up ripening and make the grapes too high in sugar.</p> <p>But the model also shows that if these areas could be replanted with a more suitable wine grape, or newly suitable areas planted, only 24% of growing area within current regions would be lost under a 2C temperature rise \u2013 a reduction in loss of more than a half.

      "bodyText": "From wildfires to rising tides, the climate crisis is already bringing many threats. Now scientists say it may also bring a shortage of many popular wines. Researchers looked at the land suitable for 11 popular varieties of wine grape and found that 2C (3.6F) of warming above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a rise the world is on track to exceed \u2013 would result in a 56% loss of suitable land within current wine-growing regions compared with the 1970s, before the most serious impacts of global heating. The white grape variety ugni blanc (also known as trebbiano toscano) is expected to lose 76% of its suitable growing area, and riesling 66%. The red grape grenache is predicted to lose 31% of the area currently deemed suitable for growing the variety. But the team said the glass was not necessarily half empty. Ignacio Morales-Castilla, the co-author of the study from the University of Alcal\u00e1, Spain, said: \u201cThe positive message is that we can still adapt viticulture to climate change \u2013 and diversity is a very interesting tool to do that. But the warning \u2026 is we should limit warming [as much as] possible, because the more warming we have, the fewer options for adaptation.\u201d Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Morales-Castilla and colleagues report how they built a computer model that takes into account the timing of processes such as budding and fruit ripening for the 11 different varieties, as well as the climate in areas where these varieties are currently grown. From this, they identified areas within current wine-growing regions suitable for each of the 11 varieties. The model suggests global heating may hit the wine cellar hard: if no action is taken, a 2C rise would result in a 56% loss in land for the 11 varieties . A 4C rise would mean 85% of these areas would be lost. While Morales-Castilla said that was partly down to factors such as changes in rainfall, the main driver was heat. He noted this might damage plants, or speed up ripening and make the grapes too high in sugar. But the model also shows that if these areas could be replanted with a more suitable wine grape, or newly suitable areas planted, only 24% of growing area within current regions would be lost under a 2C temperature rise \u2013 a reduction in loss of more than a half. Under a 4C rise, 58% of such an area would be lost if varieties were switched or newly suitable areas planted \u2013 about a third lower than if no such action was taken. For example, many areas of wine land suitable for pinot noir, including in South Africa and Burgundy, will need to be switched to grapes such as syrah, monastrell and grenache, which produce fruit later in the year and are better able to tolerate a warmer climate. The team said some countries might be more affected than others, with countries already warmer and less able to compensate for future losses: land loss for the varieties could hit 90% for Italy and Spain under 4C of heating. And there\u2019s more: the team found that new areas around the world \u2013 including parts of the UK \u2013 would become suitable for wine grapes as the planet continues to heat, with early-ripening varieties such as pinot noir moving north. The study has limitations, including the fact that it only looks at a handful of the more than 1,100 varieties of wine grape. Morales-Castilla suggested other varieties might offer greater potential for adaptation as the climate continued to heat up. The team said mitigation efforts were not without their problems: replanting or regrafting vineyards is expensive. There are also complex rules about how wines are labelled: for example, the name \u201cchampagne\u201d can legally be used only if the sparkling wine comes from the Champagne region of France. Prof Steven Penfield, of the crop genetics department at the John Innes Centre, who was not involved in the research, welcomed the study. He said: \u201c[It shows] that if growers are willing to adapt by changing the varieties they grow, there are ways to maintain yields in the face of rising temperatures, at least in the less extreme emissions scenarios. \u201cThe challenge for the industry will be that local varieties often add distinctive characters to wines, and there will be a reluctance to let go of traditional varieties, especially in areas with strong cultural heritage.

Recommended reads On paper, Josh Thomas\u2019s Please Like Me didn\u2019t exactly scream \u201cLOL\u201d. A half-hour comedy about mental illness (anxiety, depression, bipolar), the first episode of which opened with the main character coming out as gay and the suicide attempt of his mum? Not quite your classic Australian TV comedy, writes Benjamin Law. Although it was thoroughly Australian, Please Like Me became part of a wave of spiritually aligned international TV comedies in which you got the palpable sense writers had scripted episodes with as much emotional rigour as any prestige drama. We\u2019re working, but not as much as we want to \u2013 and that keeps wages low, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cWe began 2019 with the unemployment rate at 5.0% and we left it with the rate at 5.1%. This in itself suggests not much happened, but if we look at the chart of the unemployment rates for men and women, we see that last year was one where these two genders had very different outcomes. Both men and women also had 5.0% unemployment in December 2018, but while women\u2019s unemployment rate remains at that level (and with a rate of 4.96% close to being rounded down to 4.9%), the rate for men has risen to 5.3%.\u201d Listen On the latest episode of Today in Focus: Life after Auschwitz. Ivor Perl and Susan Pollack were 12 and 13 when they were transported to Auschwitz. On the 75th anniversary of the concentration camp\u2019s liberation, they tell their stories. Sport Nick Kyrgios departed the Australian Open with a fourth-round defeat at the hands of world No1 Rafael Nadal, who took the match 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) at the Rod Laver Arena, writes Russell Jackson. \u201cContaining some of the most thrilling tennis of the tournament, the three-and-a-half-hour tussle reached fever pitch in an electric third set, which Nadal won in a tiebreak, then chiselled his way to victory. Resilient in defeat, Kyrgios lost no fans.\u201d John McEnroe has meanwhile has slammed Margaret Court as the \u201ccrazy aunt\u201d of tennis. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing longer than the list of Margaret Court\u2019s tennis achievements: it\u2019s her list of offensive and homophobic statements,\u201d he said on Eurosport. In cricket, England have thrashed South Africa to claim 3-1 series win. England won by 191 runs as their hosts collapsed at the Wanderers. Media roundup The Australian reveals that Bridget McKenzie \u201csigned off on about $1m in grants for shooting clubs before her department received the results of a $160,000 report into the economic and social benefits of shooting\u201d. The Sydney Morning Herald leads with the news that coronavirus could cost the Australian economy $2.3bn because of Chinese tourists and students staying home. A fortnight before Christmas \u201cthe Morrison government sought advice from one of Australia\u2019s foremost marketing experts on how to better sell its policies, including those on climate change\u201d, the Australian Financial Review reports. Coming up Women\u2019s world No 1 Ash Barty plays Petra Kvitova for a place in the semi-finals of the Australian Open. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will visit Orange in NSW for the first meeting of the drought and flood advisory board. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 It is a debate that has torn Britain in two, ripped friends and family apart, and entrenched deep and uncrossable lines throughout the land. Should the Royal Mint have used an Oxford comma on its Brexit 50p piece? His Dark Materials novelist Philip Pullman thinks so.

      "bodyText": "The US military has confirmed that one of its aircraft crashed in eastern Afghanistan but said there was \u201cno indication the crash was caused by enemy fire\u201d. A Taliban spokesman had claimed that the group shot the plane down over territory they control near Ghazni city. The US Bombardier E-11A went down early on Monday afternoon and was initially mistaken by Afghan authorities for a passenger jet. But footage, purportedly from the wreckage site, soon emerged, showing the US air force insignia on a charred fuselage. \u201cWhile the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire,\u201d a spokesman for the US military in Afghanistan tweeted. \u201cTaliban claims that additional aircraft have crashed are false.\u201d A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said in a statement posted online: \u201cAn American invader aircraft has been shot down. Lots of officers have been killed.\u201d He said high-ranking CIA officers had been onboard the plane, but the claim could not be independently verified. In separate comments, Mujahid told the Guardian the purported shooting down of the plane had \u201cno impact\u201d on the negotiations over the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. \u201cNo agreement has been reached yet and Americans are continuing their attacks too.\u201d Tariq Ghazniwal, a local journalist, said he saw two bodies, but others had counted a total of five. The E-11A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node has been described by the US air force as \u201cwifi in the sky\u201d, a roving communications satellite to support missions in remote areas without existing infrastructure. The Taliban have occasionally been reported to have access to anti-aircraft weapons, including cases where they fired Stinger missiles of the kind supplied to the rebels by the CIA during the 1980s Russian occupation. In 2007, Taliban fighters are thought to have used a shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missile to shoot down a Chinook helicopter, killing all on board.",

The health secretary told the House of Commons that the government was \u201crapidly advancing\u201d plans to help citizens leave, and he urged any Britons in Hubei province to contact the Foreign Office. He said those who chose to return to the UK would be asked to self-isolate even if they had no symptoms of the viral pneumonia caused by coronavirus. More than 1,500 people have arrived in the UK on flights from Wuhan since 10 January, and it has emerged that the government has been able to trace only a small minority. It has email addresses for 10% and hopes the rest will hear of the new advice to self-isolate through the media. The Department of Health said those who had arrived from Wuhan in the last 14 days should stay home and keep away from close contact with other people. The government does not propose a strict quarantine. The government has been criticised for not having acted sooner to help UK citizens leave Wuhan, where streets are deserted and supermarket shelves are emptying. Other countries including France and Japan have already moved to get their citizens out. French citizens are to be offered a place on a flight this week. On arrival in France, they will be placed in quarantine for 14 days. It has been suggested the virus may be transmissible before symptoms show, though some experts say this is unlikely and that if it does happen, people will probably contract a mild form of the bug.

Health secretary Matt Hancock has said that \u201canyone in the UK who has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days\u201d should self-isolate. About 73 people have been tested negative for the virus in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Health experts say they would be surprised if the virus does not spread to the UK. Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, has admitted the authorities were too slow in how they released information about the virus. Appearing on state TV he said: \u201cWe were not sufficiently in time, and we did not make good use of many helpful information.\u201d China\u2019s Daily newspaper released images allegedly showing the first wing of a specialist hospital for coronavirus patients built in just 16 hours in Wuhan. However, Twitter users were quick to point out that the shared image of a modular building can be seen elsewhere on the internet, for example here. Turkey urged its citizens not to travel to China unless necessary to avoid infection with the coronavirus, and Ukraine warned against all but essential travel to the Hubei province. The UK government is under pressure to evacuate Britons stranded in the city of Wuhan and the province of Hubei. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking to make available an option\u201d for British nationals to leave Hubei. Britons stranded in the Wuhan say the UK response has been \u201cpathetic\u201d. France, Japan, the US and Spain are all attempting to evacuate citizens stranded in China. The lunar new year holiday in China has been extended until 2 February across China and to 9 February in Shanghai. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 has banned inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30 million residents. Hong Kong has banned Hubei residents from entering. New coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia, South Korea and Canada. Cambodia and Sri Lanka reported their first case. World Heath Organization chiefs have held meetings in Beijing on Monday. The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week urged China to ensure lockdown measures are kept \u201cshort in duration\u201d. That\u2019s all for now, we will update the blog later if there are new developments. Ukraine has advised its citizens against all non-essential travel to the Hubei Province in China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. Ukrainian authorities also advised citizens traveling to China to take precautions, including avoiding contact with people displaying signs of respiratory diseases. The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) said on Monday that \u201cthe immediate health risk from [coronavirus] in the U.S. is currently considered low.\u201d According to new figures published on its website on Monday, there are 73 people in the US still under investigation, 32 confirmed negative and 5 positive. \u201cThere is an ongoing investigation to determine more about this outbreak. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available,\u201d a statement said. The CDC added that reported illnesses in infected people had ranged from little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying. Turkey has urged its citizens not to travel to China unless necessary to avoid infection with the coronavirus. \u201cIt is highly recommended that our citizens do not travel to China unless it is necessary and if they travel there, they should stay away from the regions where the cases are seen, especially in Hubei province,\u201d the Turkish ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Monday. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has announced that it is working on a coronavirus vaccine, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and several other partners. CEPI said it will \u201cbegin three programmes\u201d aimed at creating an effective vaccine against the virus that has so far killed 82 reported cases. Health secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that \u201call possible means\u201d were being used to get in contact with the 1,460 people who have travelled to the UK from Wuhan before the city went on lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019re collaborating with [...] Border Force, with the airlines and with others including universities, schools and cultural organisations to try to make contact,\u201d Hancock said. China has announced that 60.33bn yuan (6.6bn GBP) will be allocated for the sole purpose of fighting the coronavirus outbreak. China\u2019s Ministry of Finance and National Health Commission said funds would be used to prop up public health services and epidemic prevention. France expects to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area, though evacuees will have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France. Japanese citizens who wish to return home from Wuhan are expected to be flown out via charter flights as early as Tuesday, Reuters reports. Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said about 430 Japanese nationals had been confirmed to be in Hubei province. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has questioned whether there are enough specialist beds available in the NHS to deal with any potential coronavirus outbreak in the UK. Ashworth said specialist extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) beds might be needed for the treatment of the virus, and they were already in high demand in the UK, PA reported. He asked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to \u201cupdate the House on how many ECMO beds are currently open and what preparations the NHS is making on that front?\u201d Hancock responded: \u201cThere are four centres that are stood up and ready should there be a need. The centres are in Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospital (London), Liverpool, Newcastle and the Royal Free (London) and there is a further escalation if more beds are So we are ready, but of course we keep all these things under review.\u201d The total number of confirmed people infected with the coronavirus now stands at 2,887, with 2,827 of these in China. Australia had 4 confirmed cases, Cambodia 1, France 3, Hong Kong 5, Japan 3, Macao 2, Malaysia 3, Nepal 1, Singapore 4, Taiwan 3, Thailand 5, Vietnam 2, South Korea 2, Sri Lanka 1 and the US 5. This post was amended on 29 January 2020 to change \u201cTaipei\u201d to Taiwan. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has told MPs that the risk to the UK population is low and the country is \u201cwell prepared and well equipped\u201d to respond if required. However, he added that the Foreign Office was \u201crapidly advancing measures to bring UK nationals back from Hubei province\u201d. \u201cCoronaviruses do not usually spread if people don\u2019t have symptoms \u2013 but we cannot be 100% certain. \u201cFrom today, we are therefore asking anyone in the UK who has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days to self-isolate. Stay indoors and avoid contact with other people \u2013 and to contact NHS 111. \u201cIf you are in Northern Ireland, you should phone your GP. \u201cIf you develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to the area, and are now in the UK, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city. \u201cDo not leave your home until you have been given advice by a clinician.\u201d Hancock added that efforts were continuing to trace people who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan: \u201cHaving eliminated those who we know have since left the country, there are 1,460 people we are seeking to locate. \u201cThe Foreign Office is rapidly advancing measures to bring UK nationals back from Hubei province. \u201cI have asked my officials to ensure there are appropriate measures in place upon arrival to look after them and protect the public.\u201d The health secretary asked Britons in Hubei province to get in contact with the Foreign Office. People\u2019s Daily, China\u2019s largest newspaper, has claimed on Twitter that an \u201cantiviral spray\u201d that can be applied to the throat and shield from infection with the coronavirus has been developed in a clinical centre in Shanghai. The tweet seemed to imply that the spray is already being used by hospital staff in China on the frontline of the virus outbreak, as it emphasised that \u201cmass-production for public use is not available for now\u201d. The US president, Donald Trump, has commented on the coronavirus on Twitter, stating that his administration has offered help to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping: Dubai\u2019s Emirates airline has advised its flight crews to stay in their hotels when on a layover in China to avoid infection risk with the coronavirus. According to Reuters, the airline also recommends that crew avoid areas with a potential for large gatherings of people. The expert added that it was probably difficult for someone infected with coronavirus to transmit it to others without coughing or sneezing, but that more research was needed. Van Kerkhove said that so far there was no evidence that the virus was mutating. Van Kerkhove said a lot of people were asking whether receiving mail from Wuhan posed an infection risk, and said that this was not a concern, as the virus would not survive for that long a journey. She added that not many children had been infected so far, and that about three to six feet (1-2 metres) of distance should be kept from those carrying the virus in order to avoid infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) has invited people to participate in a live Q&amp;A with the epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove on Twitter. Van Kerkhove, who specialises in respiratory diseases, said that while it was confirmed that this was a \u201cnew\u201d coronavirus, it was still being investigated whether it was transmitted from an animal. She added that currently there were 37 confirmed cases in 12 countries other than China. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a short while ago that three new cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in the US \u2013 one in Arizona and two in California \u2013 apparently all travellers returning from Wuhan. One wing of the specialist hospital in Wuhan has been constructed in just 16 hours, according to China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily. It will be handed over to the military next week. Update: A number of Twitter users have pointed out that the above image of a modular building can be seen elsewhere on the internet, for example here. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: The number of deaths from coronavirus has risen to 81, with the number of confirmed infections climbing above 2,700 in China alone. The southern province of Hainan has reported its first fatality. About 95% of deaths and more than 50% of infections are in Hubei province. China\u2019s second most powerful man, Premier Li Keqiang, has become the most senior figure to visit Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. He met medical staff, visited a supermarket, and the construction site of a new hospital. Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, has admitted the authorities were too slow in how they released information about the virus. Appearing on state TV he said: \u201cWe were not sufficiently in time, and we did not make good use of many helpful information.\u201d About 73 people have been tested negative for the virus in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Health experts say they would be surprised if the virus does not spread to the UK. The UK government is under pressure to evacuate Britons stranded in the city of Wuhan and the province of Hubei. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking to make available an option\u201d for British nationals to leave Hubei. Britons stranded in the Wuhan say the UK response has been \u201cpathetic\u201d. The lunar new year holiday in China has been extended until 2 February across China and to 9 February in Shanghai. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 has banned inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30 million residents. Hong Kong has banned Hubei residents from entering. New coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia, South Korea and Canada. Cambodia has reported its first case. World Heath Organization chiefs have held meetings in Beijing on Monday. The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week urged China to ensure lockdown measures are kept \u201cshort in duration\u201d. The mayor of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, has acknowledged criticism over his handling of the crisis, admitting that information was not released quickly enough. Zhou Xianwang wore a mask for protection as he told Chinese state broadcaster CCTV: \u201cWe haven\u2019t disclosed information in a timely manner and also did not use effective information to improve our work.\u201d He said he would resign if it helped with public opinion but pointed out the local government was obliged to seek permission before fully disclosing information about the virus, and that its response had since become \u201ctougher than others\u201d. The number of people tested for the virus in the UK has now reached 73, with all coming back been negative. The latest figures come in a 2pm update from the Department of Health and Social Care. Saudi Arabia\u2019s health ministry has put out some very rigorous hand-washing guidance, that includes using a paper towel to turn the tap off. Here\u2019s video of Wuhan\u2019s mayor admitting the city had been slow to provide information about the virus. A second case of the virus has been confirmed in Canada. Officials in Ontario said it had been diagnosed in the wife of a man who was already being treated in Toronto, CBS reports. The couple travelled back from Wuhan last week. Cambodia has confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the country, its health minister, Mam Bunheng, said on Monday, Reuters reports. The patient is a Chinese national in the coastal city of Sihanoukville, he said. More than a dozen countries have reported cases, although most are in China. AP has more on the Cambodia case. Mam told a press conference that the 60-year-old Chinese man had flown directly from Wuhan to Sihanoukville on 23 January. He displayed symptoms of the illness on Saturday. The Pasteur Institute in the capital, Phnom Penh, confirmed the infection from a blood sample. The man is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Sihanoukville. Sihanoukville is a popular destination for Chinese visitors. The man\u2019s three travelling companions from Wuhan were found not to have the virus. British citizens trapped in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, say the UK government\u2019s response has been slow and unclear, and its travel advice pathetic. Up to 300 British citizens are thought to be stuck in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located and where most of the 81 deaths associated with the disease have occurred. It is not clear whether the British government will conduct an evacuation, though the US and Japan are preparing airlifts. The French carmaker PSA Group has also said it will evacuate its employees. Kharn Lambert, 31, from Lancaster, who works as a PE teacher in Wuhan, described the city as a ghost town. All planes and trains have been cancelled and most private vehicles banned from the roads, as officials try to stop the spread of the virus. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: The number of deaths from coronavirus has risen to 81, with the number of confirmed infections climbing above 2,700 in China alone.

The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week urged China to ensure lockdown measures are kept \u201cshort in duration\u201d. On his visit to Wuhan, China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, visited the site of a special new hospital being constructed to treat coronavirus patients. The hospital is due to be completed as soon as next week. Li delivered an upbeat message. He said: \u201cTo get the epidemic under control in Wuhan and the good health of people in Wuhan will be good news for the whole country. We wish the people of Wuhan a safe, healthy and long life. Let\u2019s go, Wuhan!\u201d The front page of the Evening Standard, edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, underlines the growing pressure facing the UK government to evacuate Britons stranded in Wuhan and Hubei. Footage has emerged of people clamouring for face masks at the gates of a factory in Jiujiang, in Jiangxi province, 230km (142 miles) south-east of Wuhan. Germany is also considering evacuating its citizens from Wuhan, AP reports. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, told reporters that the German government\u2019s crisis response committee would meet shortly with medical experts to evaluate the situation. The foreign ministry currently advises Germans to refrain from or postpone \u201cnon-essential travel\u201d to China. Maas said the German embassy is in touch with its citizens in Wuhan, which a spokeswoman said number about 90 people. Mass said: \u201cWe are examining and preparing for all options.\u201d A consular team is expected to arrive in Wuhan later on Monday to provide Germans there with assistance. Here\u2019s our latest coronavirus explainer. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $10m (\u00a37.6m) to tackling the virus. The money will be split between China and countries in Africa. One supermarket shopper was unfazed by the visit to Wuhan of China\u2019s prime minister Li Keqiang, Keith Zhai from Reuters reports. The death toll from the virus has risen to 81, after the southern island province of Hainan in the South China Sea reported its first fatality, an 80-year-old woman whose family arrived from Wuhan on 17 January, AP reports. Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, has accounted for 76 of the deaths reported so far. There have been one each in Shanghai and the provinces of Hebei in the north, Heilongjiang in the north-east and Henan in central China. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 2,744. Officials in Shanghai, a city with a population of more 25 million people, have extended the lunar new year holiday to 9 February. It has ordered sports stadiums and religious events closed. Shanghai has gone further than the rest of China where the holiday was pushed back from Sunday to Thursday to reduce mass gatherings in an effort to block spread of the virus. Britain\u2019s embassy in Beijing has said it is \u201cworking to make available an option\u201d for British nationals to leave the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus as the UK\u2019s response was contrasted with that of other countries with active evacuation plans. The announcement on Monday came as the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt backed the idea of airlifts for British citizens in China and Public Health England said the first case of the virus was likely to come from somebody already in the UK. \u201cOur view is that, although airports are important, the most likely place that we might find a case is somebody in the country already, and it\u2019s absolutely critical that the public health service and the NHS are ready to diagnose that and are able to designate the person to the right facilities,\u201d said Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director and director of health protection for PHE. Here\u2019s a map showing how the virus has spread across the world in terms of confirmed cases. In that appearance on Chinese TV, Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, admitted the authorities were too slow in how they released information about the virus, AFP\u2019s Xinqi Su reports. Chinese officials at the centre of the crisis are coming under fire for incompetence and being ridiculed for not properly wearing protective masks, AFP reports. Many Chinese social media users were incensed by what they perceived as a series of errors at a televised press conference Sunday by three local officials at the heart of the new virus outbreak. Governor of central Hubei province, Wang Xiaodong, held the press conference without wearing a mask - in violation of the provincial capital Wuhan\u2019s own rules mandating masks in public spaces. Meanwhile the mayor of Wuhan was wearing his mask incorrectly by having it on inside out, pointed out Chinese users on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like social media platform. \u201cIf the mayor doesn\u2019t even know how to wear a mask, how will everyday people know?\u201d criticised one user. \u201cIncompetent and irresponsible politicians,\u201d wrote another in a scathing comment about the press briefing. The comments are a rare instance of public anger outpacing the army of online censors in China, where criticism of government figures is usually scrubbed. By Monday afternoon, a hashtag on the press briefing had more than 680 million views on Weibo. Online users also focused in on Wang\u2019s repeated fumble of Hubei\u2019s annual mask production \u2013 giving three revisions to his answer from 10.8 billion to 1.8 billion, to 1.08 million. \u201cAs the governor of Hubei province, how can you not know how many masks Hubei province produces?\u201d asked one incredulous user. Britons stranded in Wuhan and other Chinese cities are frustrated by the UK government\u2019s response. They have been speaking to Michael Standaert, a Guardian stringer in Beijing. Matthew Heard, a 31-year-old education consultant from London, has been living in Wuhan on and off for more than five years. Confusion would be the word to describe what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a lot of information flying around. There\u2019s posts flying around group chats and no one really knows what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s the main frustration. I\u2019ve been holed up for the last maybe three days. On the first day I started out to the supermarket and got a good few things to keep me tied over for the foreseeable eight or nine days, but I\u2019m going to consider perhaps going out again. I know a few others who are venturing out most days just to go to the shops or to the supermarket to see if they can restock on supplies and things. Asked he was in touch with the UK embassy, Heard said: They don\u2019t really seem to be doing too much, you send an email and whether you get a response or not is entirely a guess. The Foreign Office is what people are relying on for information. It is staying relatively quiet, with very tentative statements, thinking about potential action, things like that and it\u2019s not really helping anyone. I think what people want to hear is whether there is a plan, and what the situation for us is, and what we should be doing, because so far their advice has just been to get out of the city which is impossible, because the cities are locked down. Asked what he\u2019s doing to pass the time, Heard said: This year I pledged to myself at the beginning of 2020 I was gonna read 50 books this year, and I\u2019m making a good bit of progress on that. Kharn Lambert, 31, from Lancaster, Lancashire, is working in Wuhan as a PE teacher for an international school. We are still being advised to stay in the house as it\u2019s the safest place and only go out when absolutely necessary. My biggest worry is my grandmother who suffers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This city is pretty much a ghost town apart from the odd person walking the streets to get necessities, some cars are out and about. We have enough supplies for now probably enough food for the next two weeks, I\u2019ve got enough masks for the amount of time I think I\u2019ll be outside, I\u2019m trying to go out as little as possible, with my grandmother\u2019s condition I don\u2019t want to jeopardise her health. The response from the UK government has been an absolute joke. They were helpful at the beginning, they put us in touch with a doctor for more medication for my grandmother, but since then they have been quiet, we have not even had a hello from any of the British consulate staff in Wuhan. I presume they have been evacuated in secret because they seem to have left Wuhan, the advice from the embassy is to keep checking the travel advisory website for updates. The update is absolutely pathetic \u2013 \u201cget out if you can\u201d \u2013 how can we? We are on lockdown. The FCO have been absolutely shocking in their response. The school are desperately trying to help with the situation as they fear for my grandmother\u2019s health if she was to contract this virus. The head of the World Health Organization will hold a special meeting with officials in Beijing on Monday to discuss how to contain the coronavirus that has killed 80 people and left more than 400 in a critical condition. In an effort to reduce chances of infection during what is China\u2019s busiest travel season, officials announced the end of this week\u2019s lunar new year holiday would be postponed until at least 2 February. Authorities have also widened sweeping restrictions on travel across the country. On Monday, Chongqing municipality, which has a population of 30 million, said it had banned long-distance bus services. The municipality borders Hubei province, where the vast majority of deaths have been recorded. It follows similar announcements over the weekend by Beijing, Shanghai and the eastern province of Shandong. The suspension of long-distance bus services, the cheapest way to travel, is likely to slow down the return of millions of migrant workers who have visited their families over the lunar new year. By postponing the end of the holiday to Sunday from Friday, officials hoped to \u201ceffectively reduce mass gatherings\u201d and \u201cblock the spread of the epidemic\u201d, a cabinet statement said. Many of China\u2019s big retail chains have also said they will temporarily close their stores, while some online businesses and banks have advised employees returning from Hubei province to work from home. Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonzalez, has said Spanish officials are trying to repatriate 20 Spaniards stranded in Wuhan and Hubei. A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan say they have not left their apartment for five days, that all transport has been stopped and \u201cthere is no place to go\u201d and \u201cso we are pretty much stuck\u201d, PA Media reports. Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast there has been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have \u201cstruggled\u201d to contact, possibly because of the time difference and them being closed over the weekend. They have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a \u201cghost town\u201d. Neal said: \u201cEven if the news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change - I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting. We have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.\u201d He said there is a support group for people who may need help and to get masks and some volunteers are going out to make deliveries. Hunt said emailing and trying to ring the authorities has brought a \u201cuseless automated response back from the embassy saying not to go\u201d to the area. She feels the Chinese authorities have made the right decision by shutting down the city, adding: \u201cAll we keep hearing is that the death toll is accelerating every day. All we can do really is sit tight and wait for more news. \u201cAlthough it is hard us being stuck here, we know that it is the safest possible option for us at the moment.\u201d Meanwhile, health officials are continuing to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the area of China worst affected by the outbreak. The DoH confirmed it is trying to find \u201cas many passengers as we can\u201d who arrived from the region in the past two weeks to check on their wellbeing. It is understood Border Force officers have been recruited to help speed up the search for passengers as testing for the virus continues in the UK. One British man, who had travelled to Wuhan to visit his girlfriend, is stuck in the city after his return flight on 3 February was cancelled, and he described trying to get out of the area as \u201cimpossible\u201d. The 29-year-old, who did not want to be named, told the PA news agency: \u201cThere is no news on when the airport will reopen therefore the airline (China Southern) have just cancelled the flight. \u201cI\u2019ve also had no help from the UK Embassy in Beijing who are conveniently closed for the weekend.\u201d The Foreign Office has confirmed it is working on making an \u201coption available\u201d for British nationals to leave Wuhan in Hubei province in China. British citizens in the region have been told to call the FCO on +86 (0) 10 8529 6600 or (+44) (0)207 008 1500 should they need assistance. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWe continue to monitor developments closely and are in close touch with the Chinese authorities. The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern.\u201d The Australian government does not know how many of its citizens are caught in the vast quarantine lockdown imposed across China, as it and governments around the world scramble to try to evacuate their nationals. But it appears increasingly unlikely foreign countries will be allowed to simply extricate their citizens in the face of militarily enforced lockdowns. Indonesia has said it \u201cseems to be impossible\u201d, while Australia has said it \u201cneeds to abide by the travel restrictions \u2026 placed there for precisely the purpose of containing the coronavirus\u201d. A hotline for family members of Australian citizens has received 385 calls, but the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has said it was \u201cunwise to speculate\u201d on how many citizens this represented or how quickly they could be brought out. The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has joined calls for the UK to organise airlifts for UK citizens in China and warned of the pressure the coronavirus could put on the NHS. Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan and elsewhere, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think I would be very sympathetic and I\u2019m sure the Foreign Office would be too.\u201d He said the NHS is well-equipped to deal with patients returning with the virus but warned that it could strain the service. \u201cThis is a very difficult time of year for the NHS \u2013 it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies. \u201cI think the thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services. \u201cI think it would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.\u201d On the global markets, oil prices and shares are selling off as the death toll from the coronavirus rises and more cases are confirmed around the world. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost more than 110 points in early trading, falling 1.5% to 7472.877. Stock markets in Germany and France were also down 1.5% while France\u2019s CAC index slid 1.7%. Chinese and other Asian markets were closed for the lunar new year holiday but Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 2%, its biggest one-day fall in five months. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, tumbled $1.3 to $59.39, a 2.2% fall. China is the world\u2019s biggest oil importer and if its economic slowdown deepens as the virus spreads, it will need less oil. The virus outbreak has sparked a flight to safe-haven investments: investors are buying the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc , gold and US Treasury bonds. More than 50 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care, although all tests have returned negative, PA reports. As of Sunday afternoon, some 52 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been tested for the deadly flu-like virus. The current risk to the public remains low, the department said, adding that the government is continuing to monitor the situation closely. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a \u201cfair chance\u201d cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about 2,744 including 80 deaths, which have all occurred in China. Britons trapped in the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak have been urged to leave the area if they are able to do so. The Foreign Office updated its guidance to \u201cadvise against all travel to Hubei province\u201d, which has been on lockdown for several days as China seeks to contain the illness. But the guidance also added: \u201cIf you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.\u201d Prof Whitty said following a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall on Friday that the virus looked \u201ca lot less dangerous\u201d than contracting Ebola, the recent coronavirus, Mers and \u201cprobably less dangerous\u201d than Sars virus. But he added: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is how far it\u2019s going to spread, that really is something we need to plan for all eventualities. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage.\u201d \u201cWe think there\u2019s a fair chance we may get some cases over time. Of course this depends on whether this continues for a long time, or whether this turns out to be something which is brought under control relatively quickly.\u201d The UK government is coming under pressure to evacuate UK citizens from Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei. Both the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, have said ministers are considering an evacuation plan, but both stopped short of committing to one. The response of other countries has added weight to calls for the UK to order a full evacuation plan. AP has a roundup of what countries are doing for their citizens. Japan Its chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said 560 Japanese citizens are confirmed in Hubei and chartered evacuation flights are being prepared to leave as soon as possible. The Japanese embassy in Beijing said the initial evacuation is limited to those in Wuhan. Evacuees are expected to include employees of Honda, Electron, Aeon other Japanese companies operating in Wuhan. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said his cabinet will designate the new coronavirus as an infectious disease subject to forced hospitalisation and isolation. Such preventative measures appear to be preparation for the evacuation. United States The US consulate in Wuhan plans a charter flight on Tuesday to evacuate its personnel and some other Americans. The US embassy in Beijing said the limited capacity on the flight to San Francisco meant priority will be given to to individuals at greater risk from coronavirus. France The health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, said French citizens who want to leave Wuhan will be taken on a direct flight to France in the middle of the week, and then held in quarantine for 14 days. French carmakers PSA, which produces Peugeot and Citroen cars, said it was evacuating its expatriate employees and their families from Wuhan and quarantining them in another city. The number of deaths from coronavirus has risen to 80, with infections climbing above 2,700. Hainan province confirmed its first death. 95% of deaths and more than 50% of infections are in Hubei province. China\u2019s second most powerful man, Premier Li Keqiang, has met medical staff and visited a supermarket in Wuhan. The lunar new year holiday in China has been extended until 2 February. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 has banned inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30 million residents. New coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia and South Korea. World Heath Organization chief will hold meetings in Beijing on Monday. Hong Kong has banned Hubei residents from entering. The Associated Press has just published a useful list of the latest figures on coronavirus infections. It says these are up-to-date as of midday on Monday in Beijing: China: 2,744, with 769 of those newly confirmed in the 24 hours through midnight Sunday. Five are in Hong Kong and two in Macao. Nearly all of the 80 deaths have been in Hubei province, with four elsewhere in China. United States: 5, 2 in southern California and 1 each in Washington state, Chicago, and Arizona. Thailand: 8 Australia: 5 South Korea: 4 Japan: 4 Singapore: 4 Malaysia: 4 France: 3 Taiwan: 3 Vietnam: 2 Canada: 1 Nepal: 1 As I mentioned earlier, China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, has been visiting Wuhan. There\u2019s been plenty of video clips on social media of him meeting medical staff. He also visited a store where he had his temperature scanned upon entry. Singapore said on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak will hurt its economy this year. So far it has reported four cases of the virus. \u201cWe certainly expect there to be an impact on our economy, business and consumer confidence this year especially as the situation is expected to persist for some time,\u201d its trade minister, Chan Chun Sing, said. Singapore is currently forecasting growth in a wide range of 0.5-2.5% this year. The country has announced a raft of new measures on Monday to halt the spread of the virus, including urging all school students and staff with a recent travel history to China to stay at home for a fortnight. The head of the World Health Organization will hold a special meeting with officials in Beijing on Monday to discuss how to contain the coronavirus. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Twitter: \u201cMy WHO colleagues and I would like to understand the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak.\u201d You can find our latest update on the virus outbreak below. As I reported earlier, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, has travelled to Wuhan, the centre of the virus outbreak. Li is China\u2019s second most powerful man. According to the government outlet, the Global Times, he told medical staff at Wuhan hospital: \u201cI am here to cheer you up.\u201d The Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has said that Hainan province confirmed on Monday that an 80-year-old woman has died after being infected with the coronavirus, marking the province\u2019s first fatality in the rapidly spreading outbreak. China\u2019s state media is reporting that of the more than 2,700 people infected with coronavirus, 461 are in a critical condition. Eighty people are known to have died in China from the virus. China\u2019s CGTN state TV channel has launched a live feed of the construction of the 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan. You can see it here. The BBC\u2019s China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, is reporting that China\u2019s massive film studio, Hengdian studios, has suspended filming because of the virus. The studio\u2019s website says it is the biggest film and TV shooting base in the world. More on the Australian cases of the virus, and the University of New South Wales, which is in Sydney, has confirmed that one of its students has tested positive for the virus. I am assuming that this is the 21-year-old woman referred to by the health authorities at a press conference in the past hour. The university says the student arrived back in Sydney on 22 January and was not infectious on the flight. \u201cThe student did not attend any classes at the University and stayed on her own in campus accommodation with no close contact before she was admitted to hospital,\u201d the university said. So after that flurry of news conferences, I\u2019ll just double back on one of the key points from Australian authorities. That is, they don\u2019t believe there have been any human-to-human transmission of the virus in the country. This is significant for a number of reasons, but particularly as the country\u2019s schools are due to return this week from the long summer break. Medical advice is if children have been in close contact with a CONFIRMED case of the virus, they should not attend school for 14 days. The New South Wales department of education describes close contact as \u201cliving in the same household, 15 minutes face-to-face contact with a person with confirmed coronavirus in any setting, or sharing a closed space with a person with confirmed coronavirus for more than 2 hours\u201d. Payne has also asked anyone who is still in affected Chinese provinces to get in touch with her department. She says the contact line has already had 385 calls. She has given out the two numbers again: ph 1300 555 135 from inside Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 from outside the country. Payne has advised Australians in China not to attend public gatherings: \u201cPeople will be safer if they continue to follow the advice that has been given by health authorities, both in Australia and in China. That does mean avoiding major gatherings, staying away from crowded areas, as much as possible, and following strict hygiene precautions,\u201d Payne says. Now we are hearing from Australia\u2019 s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. She says where possible, her government is looking to assist Australians who want to leave Hubei province. A number of countries have been looking at how to get their citizens out of affected Chinese provinces which are affected by coronavirus, particularly Hubei. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, says the majority of people who have been tested in Australia have tested negative for coronavirus. He says there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Australia. Every flight from China is now being met by border security officers, who are giving out information about the virus and are also working to identify potentially infected passengers. Four adults in Western Australia are also being tested to see if they have contracted the deadly coronavirus. The WA Department of Health would not confirm any further details about the patients on Monday but said they each met specific travel criteria. There have been no confirmed cases in WA with three people returning negative test results. In New South Wales, a 21-year-old woman has been confirmed to have the coronavirus. She is bring treated at Sydney\u2019s Westmead hospital. It brings the number of cases in Australia to five. There has been concern in Australia over schools returning this week after the summer break. Kerry Chant, the chief health officer for the state of New South Wales, has just given a news conference in which she advised that if children have had contact with people confirmed to have the coronavirus, they should not attend school: The national approach to this issue is that our advice is that people that have come back from \u2013 children that have come back from the Hubei province \u2013 we have broadened it slightly from Wuhan with the emerging evidence of transmission from adjacent areas of Wuhan, the city, to the Hubei province more broadly. We are recommending that, if you have symptoms, that you should get immediately checked if you\u2019ve come back from that area. And also, if you\u2019ve been in contact with any confirmed case, that you should not attend school \u2013 close contact with a confirmed case of novel coronavirus \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t attend school for the 14 days. Otherwise, we\u2019re just suggesting that people monitor their symptoms. That\u2019s the advice we\u2019ve seen with schools. We\u2019ve just had a national hook-up and there\u2019s been agreement that that is the approach nationally. Several Sydney private schools have gone further, banning students who have recently visited China from returning to school without medical certificates, as concerns grow about the spread of coronavirus. Pymble Ladies College in Sydney\u2019s north has told parents that if their child has recently visited an affected area in China or has been in contact with someone who has visited an affected area, they should not attend school for at least 14 days after their return to Australia or 14 days after the contact with someone who has visited an affected area. Students in that situation would require a medical certificate before returning to school. Other private schools in Sydney, including Scots College, Ravenswood School for Girls, Kambala School and Newington College, have told parents that students who have visited affected regions in China must provide medical clearance from a doctor, the ABC reported. A spokesperson for the NSW Education department said the department will be providing updated health advice to schools today but it was not advising that students should be kept at home, and would provide updated health advice later on Monday. Most public school students in New South Wales are due to return to classes from Wednesday. Death toll in China rises to 80, with infections climbing above 2,700. 95% of deaths and more than 50% of infections are in Hubei province. China\u2019s second most powerful man, Premier Li Keqiang, arrives in Wuhan. China extends lunar new year holiday until 2 February. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 bans inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30m residents. Chongqing borders Hubei province. World Heath Organization chief flies to Beijing. Hong Kong bans Hubei residents from entering. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, has arrived in Wuhan. Pictures show him carrying out inspections of what look like medical facilities in the city. Li is the head of the government\u2019s coronavirus taskforce and the second most powerful man in China, after President Xi Jinping. Chongqing municipality, which borders the province of Hubei, where the coronavirus outbreak began, has banned bus travel between provinces from midday on Monday. The municipality has a population of around 30m people, making it one of the biggest in China. Chongqing city has a population of about 9 million. In the UK 50 people have been tested for the virus and all have returned negative. The current risk to the public is described as low, but England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a \u201cfair chance\u201d cases would emerge in Britain. The UK\u2019s home secretary, Priti Patel, has said the government is \u201clooking at all options\u201d to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports that officials have been asked to examine the logistics for an airlift from the city. You can read our full coverage here: An Irish teacher living in Wuhan, Ben Kavanagh, has made a video for Britain\u2019s Channel 4 news, about his daily life in the locked-down city. You can see it below via YouTube, including all the precautions taken to leave the house. There are reports that a fourth person has been diagnosed with coronavirus in South Korea. Just on those figures, the government tabloid, the Global Times has recently tweeted figures of cases in provinces across China. The next most infections outside of Hubei (1,423 cases) is in Guangdong, which has 146 cases. Henan and Zhejiang provinces each have 128 cases. Given the spread of the virus across China and to at least 10 other countries, I thought it\u2019s worth mentioning that all but four deaths so far have been recorded in Hubei province, where the outbreak started. Of the 80 fatalities reported by the National Health Commission, 76 are were in Hubei (that\u2019s 95% of fatalities). The total number of cases reported in Hubei is 1,423, according to government figures. This makes up 51.5% of the 2,761 cases reported so far by the commission across China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Several of the UK\u2019s newspaper front pages carry stories of the coronavirus spread, including pleas from Britons stranded in Wuhan. In Australia, where five cases of the virus have been confirmed, there\u2019s also wide coverage on Monday morning\u2019s newspapers. Melbourne\u2019s Age newspaper says more cases are expected. The Australian newspaper reports on Australian children being trapped in Wuhan. Social media is reporting discontent about the handling of the response to the virus in Hubei province, including the governor of the province apparently stumbling over the number of face masks produced there. Keeping track of the numbers in this coronavirus story is challenging, with things changing all the time. But one figure that caught my attention from the National Health Commission this morning, was the number of people currently under medical observation for the virus. It stands at 30,453. It\u2019s not clear from the statement where or how these people are being observed, but we do know that there\u2019s a huge construction effort going on in Wuhan to build a 1,000-bed hospital for the virus patients. You can read our full story on this 10-day build here, but it\u2019s fair to say the pictures of the construction are pretty incredible. The Chinese city of Wuhan is suspending customs services for four days until Thursday, according to the government-run Global Times. I assume that this is linked to the transport shutdown in the city. I\u2019ll bring you more information on this when it comes to hand. Japan is to send a chartered plane to Wuhan, possibly on Tuesday, to bring back Japanese citizens who wish to return home, Kyodo news agency said, citing a foreign ministry source. The government has so far been able to contact about 430 Japanese citizens living or staying in Hubei province, almost all of them in Wuhan, the foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said on Sunday. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said: \u201cAs soon as adjustments with the Chinese government are done, I will pursue all means, including a charter plane, to realise the return of all applicants\u201d from Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province. Japan\u2019s health ministry on Sunday confirmed the country\u2019s fourth case of coronavirus. The patient is a man in his 40s who arrived in Japan on Wednesday as a tourist from Wuhan, the ministry said, adding he was in a stable condition. He reportedly showed no symptoms on arrival in Japan but later developed a fever and sought medical help in Aichi prefecture, central Japan. Honda, meanwhile, said it was arranging for 30 employees, including Japanese nationals and their families, to be flown out of Wuhan on a government-chartered flight, according to the Nikkei business newspaper. The carmaker said a small number of staff would stay on in the Chinese city, where it has three factories. Hong Kong has stepped up efforts to stop the virus\u2019s entry. As of Monday, residents of Hubei will be banned from entering. Anyone who has visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, will also be banned from entry. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents. Hong Kong has six confirmed cases of the virus. With millions of people now subject to travel restrictions in China, as the country shut down transport networks in a bid to stop the spread of the virus, some countries are preparing to help their citizens leave affected areas. Japan\u2019s foreign minister has confirmed that there are 430 Japanese citizens in Hubei province, mostly in Wuhan. Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters that he had spoken to his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, and that Wang understood Tokyo\u2019s desire to repatriate its nationals as soon as possible. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had said earlier that his government was working with Chinese authorities to make arrangements for all Japanese nationals wishing to return from Wuhan, including with charter flights, but no schedule has been set. The Australian government is also working to repatriate its citizens trapped in Wuhan, including about 100 schoolchildren who are stranded there. \u201cWe are working to make sure that there is support for those Australians and we are also working on, as are other countries, trying to secure their ability to return to Australia. At this point in time, the foreign minister is working around the clock on that,\u201d said Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. There have been five confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia as of Monday 27 January. Australians who believe they have family in the affected areas can contact this emergency telephone number + 61 2 6261 3305, for assistance. You can read Guardian Australia\u2019s latest piece on the country\u2019s response to coronavirus here: If you or your family are concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, this has been one of the Guardian\u2019s best read pieces on the illness, including the virus\u2019s symptoms, information about transmission, where it\u2019s been identified globally and what experts are saying about the virus. Some more information now on the update from China\u2019s National Health Commission with regards to the number of deaths and infections from coronavirus. On Sunday 26 January 769 new cases were reported across 30 different areas of China. As of midnight on Sunday into Monday, of the more than 2,700 cases reported (including in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao), the commission said 30 were severe. There are nearly 6,000 suspected cases and 51 cured cases China\u2019s state media, CGTN (formerly CCTV), is reporting that the lunar new year holiday has been extended by three days until 2 February. All universities, schools and kindergartens will postpone the start of their spring term until further notice, it says. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the outbreak of the coronavirus. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and I will be keeping you up to date on developments as they unfold. The first order of business to report is that the death toll in China has risen to 80, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). This is up from 56 yesterday. The NHC also says there are more than 2,700 infections reported (note that the commission has included Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in this number). The news comes as the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, flies to Beijing to discuss the outbreak with authorities. \u201cI am on my way to Beijing, to meet with the government and health experts supporting the \u001dcoronavirus response,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cMy WHO colleagues and I would like to understand the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak.\u201d You can get up to speed on the story with our latest piece from the Guardian, including fears that up to 100,000 people may be infected.",

Speaking outside Epstein\u2019s Manhattan mansion, Geoffrey Berman, US attorney for the southern district of New York, said the agencies had contacted Andrew regarding an interview, but that he had not yet agreed to provide one. It is understood that there will be no attempt to force Andrew to testify, leaving open the possibility that he will never answer prosecutors\u2019 questions about his relationship with Epstein. Prince Andrew, 59, stepped back from royal duties in November, following a widely-criticized interview with the BBC about his friendship with Epstein. At the time, Andrew, said he was \u201cwilling to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations if required\u201d over the ongoing US probe into Epstein \u2013 who was charged with sex-trafficking. But at a press conference in New York City\u2019s Upper East Side, Berman told reporters that requests had so far gone unanswered. Federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York, along with the FBI, were seeking to interview Andrew as they probe into Epstein\u2019s potential co-conspirators. Buckingham Palace said it would not be commenting. The matter is being dealt with by Prince Andrew\u2019s legal team. Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged with sex trafficking girls as young as 14. He was found dead in a jail cell in August 2019, the medical examiner ruled his death to be suicide. The wealthy financier once had a wealthy and influential circle of friends that included Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew. That network largely deserted Epstein after he pleaded guilty to procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Andrew, however, stayed at Epstein\u2019s home in December 2010, months after he had been released from prison. One of Epstein\u2019s accusers in his July arrest, Virginia Giuffre, said she was instructed to have sex with Andrew in 2001, when she was 17 years old. Prince Andrew told the BBC he had \u201cno recollection\u201d of meeting Giuffre, and said on the night the alleged sex occurred he was at a Pizza Express in Woking. After Epstein\u2019s death William Barr, the US attorney general, vowed that the federal sex-trafficking case into Epstein would continue. \u201cAny co-conspirators should not rest easy,\u201d Barr said at the time. Andrew, the eighth in line to the throne, was effectively suspended from royal duties by Queen Elizabeth in the aftermath of his BBC interview. In a statement released in Andrew\u2019s name, he said: \u201cIt has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family\u2019s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. \u201cTherefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.\u201d Before being asked about the Duke, Berman confirmed the investigation was looking at possible \u201cconspirators\u201d who worked with Epstein. He added: \u201cJeffrey Epstein couldn\u2019t have done what he did without the assistance of others, and I can assure you that the investigation is moving forward.\u201d Berman was speaking at an event to promote a new law that makes it easier for victims to sue over childhood abuse. The Home Office declined to comment on whether there had been any formal US request to interview or even extradite Prince Andrew to the USA. Any request for extradition would normally go to the Home Office initially. Scotland Yard has previously defended its decision to drop an investigation into claims of sex trafficking made against Epstein by Giuffre, who says she was forced to sleep with the Duke of York. Prince Andrew has dropped out of public sight for most of the past few months but did appear alongside the Queen, his mother, at a church service in Norfolk earlier this month. There have been unconfirmed reports of a downgrading of Andrew\u2019s security since he no longer performs royal engagements. Unlike Prince Harry, he continues to use his HRH title. A final decision is said to rest with the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, after review by the Metropolitan police. Andrew stood down from public duties within days of the BBC interview with the Newsnight anchor Emily Maitlis. He was accused of lacking empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and of failing to show regret over his friendship with the disgraced US financier. During the interview he said he was prepared to give testimony under oath \u201cif push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so\u201d. Andrew has said he did not see, witness or suspect any suspicious behaviour during his visits to Epstein\u2019s homes in Florida, New York and the Caribbean. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 January 2020. An earlier version stated that Prince Harry had not retained his HRH status. This has now been corrected.",

There, animal behaviour specialists work with designers to create the kind of technology that helps animals communicate and work alongside humans more naturally \u2013 to raise the alarm if an owner falls ill, put a wash on, or switch out the lights for an owner who has a disability.</p> <p>\u201cIf you give animals more of a voice, they can make themselves better understood. It\u2019s as though they can talk back to us \u2013 and this can be very valuable,\u201d says Clara Mancini, a communication and design expert who founded the lab back in 2011. \u201cWe are researching with them, allowing animals to participate in the design process.\u201d</p> <p>This is a niche area of an already niche field \u2013 but dozens of master\u2019s at UK universities relate to animal behaviour in some form; some research-led, some practical.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2019/mar/05/a-shoe-in-how-apprenticeships-put-farriery-back-on-track\">A shoe-in: how apprenticeships put farriery back on track</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Working closely with charities, the OU\u2019s lab has collaborated with the likes of Dogs for Good and Medical Detection Dogs. Traditionally, medical detection dogs trained to sniff out cancerous cells have learned to sit down in front of positive samples. But for a dog, this is an unnatural response to an exciting smell, says Mancini, and limits what they can reveal. Her team have created a sort of sniffing platform with pressure pads that measures a dog\u2019s spontaneous response to an odour. Mancini hopes this will allow scientists to detect more nuances in a dog\u2019s reaction, revealing more about the stage or concentration of the cancer, for example. Other projects include designing an alarm \u2013 in the shape of a sausage, no less \u2013 that an assistance dog could pull if a diabetic owner suffers a hypoglycaemic attack.

There, animal behaviour specialists work with designers to create the kind of technology that helps animals communicate and work alongside humans more naturally \u2013 to raise the alarm if an owner falls ill, put a wash on, or switch out the lights for an owner who has a disability. \u201cIf you give animals more of a voice, they can make themselves better understood. It\u2019s as though they can talk back to us \u2013 and this can be very valuable,\u201d says Clara Mancini, a communication and design expert who founded the lab back in 2011. \u201cWe are researching with them, allowing animals to participate in the design process.\u201d This is a niche area of an already niche field \u2013 but dozens of master\u2019s at UK universities relate to animal behaviour in some form; some research-led, some practical. Working closely with charities, the OU\u2019s lab has collaborated with the likes of Dogs for Good and Medical Detection Dogs. Traditionally, medical detection dogs trained to sniff out cancerous cells have learned to sit down in front of positive samples. But for a dog, this is an unnatural response to an exciting smell, says Mancini, and limits what they can reveal. Her team have created a sort of sniffing platform with pressure pads that measures a dog\u2019s spontaneous response to an odour. Mancini hopes this will allow scientists to detect more nuances in a dog\u2019s reaction, revealing more about the stage or concentration of the cancer, for example. Other projects include designing an alarm \u2013 in the shape of a sausage, no less \u2013 that an assistance dog could pull if a diabetic owner suffers a hypoglycaemic attack. Researchers have also designed large snout-friendly buttons for assistance dogs in the home. While the OU\u2019s lab is unique in the UK, the University of Stirling is also offering a master\u2019s in human animal interaction.

Understanding animals better has wider moral implications, Mancini believes. \u201cWe tend only to listen to our own voice and that\u2019s dangerous. We have forgotten we are part of something bigger \u2013 and if we don\u2019t adjust our perspective, we are eventually going to destroy the planet.\u201d Experience: \u2018I measure the bond between animals and humans\u2019 Lauren Samet, 33, is about to complete her PhD in animal welfare and nutrition.

Some universities have focused master\u2019s \u2013 Goldsmiths now offers master\u2019s in black British history and black British writing, Birmingham City is preparing for its first intake on a new black studies MA, and Bristol University has appointed a black history professor to explore the city\u2019s historic links with slavery. As for the BAME philosophers and historians, there are plenty, says Siriwardena - from professors Naomi Zack to Kwame Anthony Appiah to medieval philosopher Avicenna \u2013 they just need to make their way on to the reading lists. This article was amended on 28 January 2020 to correct a quote from Dr Shahmima Akhtar, which previously said that history was the least diverse subject in the UK.",

      "body": "<p>Along with strong criticism of the London fire brigade, and heartrending testimony about the 72 people who died, the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-grenfell-tower-report-bringing-justice-closer\" title=\"\">dramatic finding</a> of the Grenfell Tower inquiry\u2019s first phase was that cladding panels fitted around the west London block of flats not only contributed to but \u201cactively promoted\u201d the fire\u2019s rapid spread. On Monday the inquiry\u2019s second phase opened with the revelation that Arconic, the cladding system\u2019s manufacturer, knew five years before Grenfell\u2019s refurbishment that its panels were \u201cnot suitable for use on building facades\u201d in Europe because they did not meet safety standards.</p> <p>When much of the argument about the disaster\u2019s causes is unavoidably technical, involving as it does details of construction contracts and building regulation, such straightforward language has an immediate impact. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/27/grenfell-tower-inquiry-companies-passing-the-buck-on-responsibility\" title=\"\">series of emails</a> from an Arconic official, cited in a statement from the main building contractor, Rydon, referred to the \u201cbad behaviour\u201d of the Reynobond PE 55 panels when fitted in cassette form \u2013 as they were at Grenfell \u2013 and added that it expected them to be put \u201cout of market\u201d. The inquiry also heard that Celotex, the company which made the insulation used on Grenfell, was concerned in 2013 about how the material would behave in a fire when used behind cladding.</p> <p>Arconic gives its opening statement on Tuesday. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, has spoken of \u201ca merry-go-round of buck-passing\u201d. So far, he said, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Celotex were the only core participants to have accepted any responsibility for the disastrous events of 14 June 2017, with the council admitting that it failed in its duty as a building regulator.</p> <p>Navigating between rival versions of events, and making recommendations to government, is the challenge now facing the inquiry. It was never likely that the participants were going to make this task any easier unless they were forced to. Arconic and Celotex are subject to civil court proceedings brought by bereaved relatives in the US, which could lead to huge payouts.

      "bodyText": "Along with strong criticism of the London fire brigade, and heartrending testimony about the 72 people who died, the most dramatic finding of the Grenfell Tower inquiry\u2019s first phase was that cladding panels fitted around the west London block of flats not only contributed to but \u201cactively promoted\u201d the fire\u2019s rapid spread. On Monday the inquiry\u2019s second phase opened with the revelation that Arconic, the cladding system\u2019s manufacturer, knew five years before Grenfell\u2019s refurbishment that its panels were \u201cnot suitable for use on building facades\u201d in Europe because they did not meet safety standards. When much of the argument about the disaster\u2019s causes is unavoidably technical, involving as it does details of construction contracts and building regulation, such straightforward language has an immediate impact. A series of emails from an Arconic official, cited in a statement from the main building contractor, Rydon, referred to the \u201cbad behaviour\u201d of the Reynobond PE 55 panels when fitted in cassette form \u2013 as they were at Grenfell \u2013 and added that it expected them to be put \u201cout of market\u201d. The inquiry also heard that Celotex, the company which made the insulation used on Grenfell, was concerned in 2013 about how the material would behave in a fire when used behind cladding. Arconic gives its opening statement on Tuesday. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, has spoken of \u201ca merry-go-round of buck-passing\u201d. So far, he said, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and Celotex were the only core participants to have accepted any responsibility for the disastrous events of 14 June 2017, with the council admitting that it failed in its duty as a building regulator. Navigating between rival versions of events, and making recommendations to government, is the challenge now facing the inquiry. It was never likely that the participants were going to make this task any easier unless they were forced to. Arconic and Celotex are subject to civil court proceedings brought by bereaved relatives in the US, which could lead to huge payouts. In the UK, the Metropolitan police are waiting for the inquiry\u2019s conclusions before deciding whether to pursue manslaughter and corporate manslaughter charges, and civil litigation is possible. But the strength of the evidence presented on day one of the inquiry\u2019s second phase may have the effect of focusing minds. Confidence among victims\u2019 groups has taken a battering in recent weeks, after they discovered what they believed to be a conflict of interest. Benita Mehra, an engineer appointed to the panel created to advise the inquiry\u2019s chair, Sir Martin Moore-Bick \u2013 a panel that victims fought for \u2013 stepped down at the weekend, 10 days after it was revealed that an organisation she led received a \u00a371,000 grant from Arconic\u2019s philanthropic foundation. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died at Grenfell, said relations between the inquiry and the bereaved have moved \u201c10 steps backwards\u201d as a result, and ministers should apologise for a crass oversight as well as find a replacement in short order. Victims are entitled to be furious. But the reality is that, right now, the inquiry is their best chance of getting at the truth about what happened, ensuring that nothing similar happens again, and providing the police with evidence for any prosecutions. Sir Martin\u2019s criticism of the London fire brigade commissioner, Dany Cotton, was rightly followed by her resignation.

Sinn F\u00e9in, the political wing of the IRA during the Troubles, has meanwhile refashioned itself in the republic as a leftwing champion of the working-class and pensioners and an alternative to the Fianna F\u00e1il/Fine Gael conservative duopoly that has taken turns ruling Ireland for almost a century.

The retirement of former leader Gerry Adams \u2013 he is stepping down as a TD (MP) for Louth \u2013 will further distance the party from the Troubles.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

      "body": "<p>Just before Billie Eilish won album of the year at the Grammys on Sunday night, she was caught on camera. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be me, please,\u201d she appeared to be saying, as if appalled by her own success.</p> <p>It had been an extraordinary evening. The 18-year-old whispery pop innovator swept all of the \u201cbig four\u201d categories \u2013 album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and best new artist \u2013 with her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?. She became only the second person in history to do so \u2013 and the first woman and youngest person (the first person to win all four of these awards in one go was Christopher Cross, in 1981). She also broke a record previously held by Taylor Swift. A decade ago, Swift became the youngest person to win album of the year, aged 20. Eilish unseated her, with an offering that would never have seemed likely to seduce the mainstream. As her brother and collaborator Finneas explained in their acceptance speech: \u201cWe wrote an album about depression and suicidal thoughts and climate change \u2026 We stand up here confused and grateful.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DyDfgMOUjCI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Back when Swift was the one sweeping awards ceremonies with country-tinged love songs, no one would have predicted that her successor would look and sound like Eilish: a deadpan goth who was once described by rapper Tyler, the Creator as a \u201c17-year-old girl who dresses like a quarterback\u201d. But for anyone who has been paying attention, Eilish\u2019s Grammys dominance shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. After all, she is the quintessential Generation Z pop star (and the first true global star to be born in this millennium), with a teenage fanbase clamouring around her just as intensely as one did around Swift a decade ago.</p> <p>The singer has been making music since the age of 13, when she and Finneas (then 17) created Ocean Eyes, a gentle swarm of an electronic pop song, in his bedroom. They uploaded it to SoundCloud and the song went viral thanks to Eilish\u2019s fragile falsetto vocal and the pair\u2019s talent for a sweeping, evocative hook. But as they kept writing together \u2013 helped by their actor/artist parents, who homeschooled them in music theory and slept in the living room of their Los Angeles home to give them the room to create \u2013 Eilish\u2019s appeal deepened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"38c1dd32ed5b2b78c5d7fe50dfdcb8a7dfe2dad6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38c1dd32ed5b2b78c5d7fe50dfdcb8a7dfe2dad6/0_188_4560_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eilish with her five Grammy trophy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eilish with her five Grammy trophies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Weaving in snippets of field recordings, including a dental drill, and samples from the US version of The Office, the pair developed a strange, experimental kind of pop music that borrows from the world of ASMR YouTube videos (in which closeup recordings of whispers and hair-brushing are used to trigger a tingling response). The dark, depressive themes of Eilish\u2019s lyrics (\u201cI wanna end me\u201d, goes one of her catchiest refrains), her low-key vocal style and her androgynous fashion sense may have held her back from mainstream pop fame in the past. But to Gen Z, those are all the things that make her beloved: she\u2019s a nonchalant, nihilistic figure who rejects everything that pop girls have historically been told they have to be in order to be successful. Where people\u2019s idea of a pop star has traditionally been upbeat, bombastic and focused on performance, Eilish is moody and quiet, made for streaming in the background or playing on your headphones. In some ways, you might say Taylor Swift has been succeeded by the anti-Taylor Swift.</p> <p>Her style is the first thing many notice about her \u2013 and the biggest signal that she refuses to be boxed into gendered expectations of pop stars. At the Grammys on Sunday, she wore a black and green customised Gucci suit that covered her body entirely covered, the loosely cut trousers trailing over her sneaker-clad feet. In a Calvin Klein campaign last year, she explained that the reason she dresses in baggy clothes is that \u201cnobody can have an opinion because they haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s underneath. Nobody can be like: \u2018She\u2019s slim-thick,\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s not slim-thick,\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s got a flat ass,\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s got a fat ass.\u2019 No one can say any of that because they don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>She knows all too well the scrutiny that the bodies of female stars are subject to \u2013 and, in true Gen Z fashion, she has chosen to opt out of all that noise. Her stylist, Samantha Burkhart, once told Vogue Australia that Eilish \u201clives in this place of genderlessness and ambivalence towards clothing, which I think is very freeing in a lot of ways. She is not buying into the hypersexualised idea of what femininity is.\u201d</p> <p>If pop music under the reign of Swift, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga in the 00s was about choruses you could scream, Eilish\u2019s is pop music to weep into your pillow. Her latest single, Everything I Wanted, is an aching, gentle meditation on how her sudden rise to fame made her suicidal; an older cut, the creepy Idon\u2019twannabeyouanymore, is a bitter expression of low self-esteem and negative self-talk. For kids who feel as if they are battling these same issues, Eilish\u2019s self-loathing can sound like catharsis.</p> <p>And there are a lot of them. In the UK, there has been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/18/children-alone-uk-mental-health-problems-listening-stigma\" title=\"\">48% rise in anxiety and depression among teenagers in the past 15 years</a>. This is a generation who have been contending with austerity, fear of the climate crisis, ever-growing exam pressures and social media scrutiny as they have grown up \u2013 and a generation who are constantly failed by a lack of access to mental health services. Yet it is also a generation who are more acutely aware of their<strong> </strong>mental illness than others \u2013 one American survey found that Gen Zers were 27% more likely to report their mental health as \u201cpoor\u201d than adults.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"064d80c61eb1cd12ca421cd70a2e4685b90c0fe6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/064d80c61eb1cd12ca421cd70a2e4685b90c0fe6/0_24_4849_2909/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eilish on stage in Inglewood, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eilish on stage in Inglewood, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This isn\u2019t to say Eilish\u2019s introspective style is unprecedented \u2013 rather, it harks back to the emos who ruled the early 00s \u2013 a genre that is currently experiencing a revival of its own. My Chemical Romance, who captured a generation of misfits with their breakout single I\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise) in 2004, recently sold out their two UK comeback shows in minutes. Eilish, along with eyelinered contemporaries including Lauv and Yungblud, is their spiritual successor \u2013 without the thrashing guitars. If you removed the hushed ballad audio from the video of her hit When the Party\u2019s Over, in which she wears thick chains and bleeds black liquid from her eyes, it could easily pass for a 00s emo classic.</p> <p>One thing, of course, that sets her apart is her gender. The emo mould of the 00s was undoubtedly male. Hannah Ewens, a music journalist and the author of Fangirls: Scenes from Modern Music Culture, notes that: \u201cShe\u2019s not singing like, say, Britney did about being a girl and teen heartbreaks, she\u2019s leaning into the darkness in her whole vibe as an artist, in a way that iconic male artists like Slipknot and Marilyn Manson did. She\u2019s doing what iconic rock artists did before her \u2013 exploring themes like darkness, mental health and being aggressively yourself whatever the consequence, with a very strong visual element and aesthetic, but it\u2019s authentically updated for a Gen Z audience.\u201d</p> <p>This blurring of genre and gender is what Ewens believes has won Eilish a fanbase across demographics \u2013 and, unusually, the approval of critics and the Grammys committee, too. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rare for someone with a teen-girl-heavy fanbase to be accepted in this way critically,\u201d Ewens says. \u201cPossibly it has something to do with the fact that she\u2019s encapsulating something that\u2019s zeitgeist-y, new and ultimately fairly genderless.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/27/2020-grammys-billie-eilish-recording-academy\">Grammys 2020: Billie Eilish's triumph overshadowed but well-deserved</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A pop star shouldn\u2019t have to deny or cloak her femininity in order to be taken seriously \u2013 and that is a battle that Swift has recently taken on, with songs such as The Man that address stark differences in the way male and female musicians are talked about. Eilish herself says she owes a debt to Swift \u2013 who seemed to foresee Eilish\u2019s success In a speech she gave at the Billboard Women in Music event in 2014. While accepting her woman of the year gong, Swift said: \u201cRight now, your future woman of the year is somewhere in a piano lesson, in a choir, and we need to take care of her.\u201d In 2019, Eilish won the same award and remembered that when Swift won: \u201cI was 11 at the time, and I was in a choir and learning to play piano, and you took care of me.\u201d</p> <p>But even so, the new pop-girl archetype that Eilish is creating is a radical departure from what we have expected of pop heroines in the past. It is impossible to say what the next star to break Eilish\u2019s record for Grammy wins will look or sound like \u2013 she appears to be one of those rare artists whose unlikely breakthrough signals a turning point for the whole industry. Her totally untested route to fame indicates that, for this generation, the unspoken rules that 00s female pop stars had to follow may finally be starting to fall away. </p>",

The 18-year-old whispery pop innovator swept all of the \u201cbig four\u201d categories \u2013 album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and best new artist \u2013 with her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?. She became only the second person in history to do so \u2013 and the first woman and youngest person (the first person to win all four of these awards in one go was Christopher Cross, in 1981). She also broke a record previously held by Taylor Swift. A decade ago, Swift became the youngest person to win album of the year, aged 20. Eilish unseated her, with an offering that would never have seemed likely to seduce the mainstream. As her brother and collaborator Finneas explained in their acceptance speech: \u201cWe wrote an album about depression and suicidal thoughts and climate change \u2026 We stand up here confused and grateful.\u201d Back when Swift was the one sweeping awards ceremonies with country-tinged love songs, no one would have predicted that her successor would look and sound like Eilish: a deadpan goth who was once described by rapper Tyler, the Creator as a \u201c17-year-old girl who dresses like a quarterback\u201d. But for anyone who has been paying attention, Eilish\u2019s Grammys dominance shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. After all, she is the quintessential Generation Z pop star (and the first true global star to be born in this millennium), with a teenage fanbase clamouring around her just as intensely as one did around Swift a decade ago. The singer has been making music since the age of 13, when she and Finneas (then 17) created Ocean Eyes, a gentle swarm of an electronic pop song, in his bedroom. They uploaded it to SoundCloud and the song went viral thanks to Eilish\u2019s fragile falsetto vocal and the pair\u2019s talent for a sweeping, evocative hook. But as they kept writing together \u2013 helped by their actor/artist parents, who homeschooled them in music theory and slept in the living room of their Los Angeles home to give them the room to create \u2013 Eilish\u2019s appeal deepened. Weaving in snippets of field recordings, including a dental drill, and samples from the US version of The Office, the pair developed a strange, experimental kind of pop music that borrows from the world of ASMR YouTube videos (in which closeup recordings of whispers and hair-brushing are used to trigger a tingling response). The dark, depressive themes of Eilish\u2019s lyrics (\u201cI wanna end me\u201d, goes one of her catchiest refrains), her low-key vocal style and her androgynous fashion sense may have held her back from mainstream pop fame in the past. But to Gen Z, those are all the things that make her beloved: she\u2019s a nonchalant, nihilistic figure who rejects everything that pop girls have historically been told they have to be in order to be successful. Where people\u2019s idea of a pop star has traditionally been upbeat, bombastic and focused on performance, Eilish is moody and quiet, made for streaming in the background or playing on your headphones. In some ways, you might say Taylor Swift has been succeeded by the anti-Taylor Swift. Her style is the first thing many notice about her \u2013 and the biggest signal that she refuses to be boxed into gendered expectations of pop stars. At the Grammys on Sunday, she wore a black and green customised Gucci suit that covered her body entirely covered, the loosely cut trousers trailing over her sneaker-clad feet. In a Calvin Klein campaign last year, she explained that the reason she dresses in baggy clothes is that \u201cnobody can have an opinion because they haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s underneath. Nobody can be like: \u2018She\u2019s slim-thick,\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s not slim-thick,\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s got a flat ass,\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s got a fat ass.\u2019 No one can say any of that because they don\u2019t know.\u201d She knows all too well the scrutiny that the bodies of female stars are subject to \u2013 and, in true Gen Z fashion, she has chosen to opt out of all that noise. Her stylist, Samantha Burkhart, once told Vogue Australia that Eilish \u201clives in this place of genderlessness and ambivalence towards clothing, which I think is very freeing in a lot of ways. She is not buying into the hypersexualised idea of what femininity is.\u201d If pop music under the reign of Swift, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga in the 00s was about choruses you could scream, Eilish\u2019s is pop music to weep into your pillow. Her latest single, Everything I Wanted, is an aching, gentle meditation on how her sudden rise to fame made her suicidal; an older cut, the creepy Idon\u2019twannabeyouanymore, is a bitter expression of low self-esteem and negative self-talk. For kids who feel as if they are battling these same issues, Eilish\u2019s self-loathing can sound like catharsis. And there are a lot of them. In the UK, there has been a 48% rise in anxiety and depression among teenagers in the past 15 years. This is a generation who have been contending with austerity, fear of the climate crisis, ever-growing exam pressures and social media scrutiny as they have grown up \u2013 and a generation who are constantly failed by a lack of access to mental health services. Yet it is also a generation who are more acutely aware of their mental illness than others \u2013 one American survey found that Gen Zers were 27% more likely to report their mental health as \u201cpoor\u201d than adults. This isn\u2019t to say Eilish\u2019s introspective style is unprecedented \u2013 rather, it harks back to the emos who ruled the early 00s \u2013 a genre that is currently experiencing a revival of its own. My Chemical Romance, who captured a generation of misfits with their breakout single I\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise) in 2004, recently sold out their two UK comeback shows in minutes. Eilish, along with eyelinered contemporaries including Lauv and Yungblud, is their spiritual successor \u2013 without the thrashing guitars. If you removed the hushed ballad audio from the video of her hit When the Party\u2019s Over, in which she wears thick chains and bleeds black liquid from her eyes, it could easily pass for a 00s emo classic. One thing, of course, that sets her apart is her gender. The emo mould of the 00s was undoubtedly male. Hannah Ewens, a music journalist and the author of Fangirls: Scenes from Modern Music Culture, notes that: \u201cShe\u2019s not singing like, say, Britney did about being a girl and teen heartbreaks, she\u2019s leaning into the darkness in her whole vibe as an artist, in a way that iconic male artists like Slipknot and Marilyn Manson did. She\u2019s doing what iconic rock artists did before her \u2013 exploring themes like darkness, mental health and being aggressively yourself whatever the consequence, with a very strong visual element and aesthetic, but it\u2019s authentically updated for a Gen Z audience.\u201d This blurring of genre and gender is what Ewens believes has won Eilish a fanbase across demographics \u2013 and, unusually, the approval of critics and the Grammys committee, too. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rare for someone with a teen-girl-heavy fanbase to be accepted in this way critically,\u201d Ewens says. \u201cPossibly it has something to do with the fact that she\u2019s encapsulating something that\u2019s zeitgeist-y, new and ultimately fairly genderless.\u201d A pop star shouldn\u2019t have to deny or cloak her femininity in order to be taken seriously \u2013 and that is a battle that Swift has recently taken on, with songs such as The Man that address stark differences in the way male and female musicians are talked about. Eilish herself says she owes a debt to Swift \u2013 who seemed to foresee Eilish\u2019s success In a speech she gave at the Billboard Women in Music event in 2014. While accepting her woman of the year gong, Swift said: \u201cRight now, your future woman of the year is somewhere in a piano lesson, in a choir, and we need to take care of her.\u201d In 2019, Eilish won the same award and remembered that when Swift won: \u201cI was 11 at the time, and I was in a choir and learning to play piano, and you took care of me.\u201d But even so, the new pop-girl archetype that Eilish is creating is a radical departure from what we have expected of pop heroines in the past. It is impossible to say what the next star to break Eilish\u2019s record for Grammy wins will look or sound like \u2013 she appears to be one of those rare artists whose unlikely breakthrough signals a turning point for the whole industry. Her totally untested route to fame indicates that, for this generation, the unspoken rules that 00s female pop stars had to follow may finally be starting to fall away.",

      "bodyText": "Back from packing parcels at my local Trussell Trust warehouse, I saw Zoe Williams\u2019 piece (The poor deserve more than rations, G2, 23 January). Here in Norwich we pack boxes with three-day \u201crations\u201d for a single person, a couple or a family, and volunteer drivers take them to distribution centres around the city, where our clientele collect them. Yes, our basic package has to be fairly bland and non-perishable, but thanks to donors\u2019 great generosity we usually have lots of extras and treats, which we pack into every spare space. The prescribed list represents best food value, but there\u2019s always room for \u201cempty calories\u201d. I\u2019m sure we aren\u2019t the only branch that does this. As well as biscuits, we can usually include chocolate, jam or honey, and even cake. We can\u2019t put in fresh fruit and vegetables or eggs, but these items regularly come to the warehouse and go out to the centres with our drivers. We also get day-old bread and pastries from a supermarket. When packing a box we have to think about our most likely recipients. We get some esoteric donations, and some that have obviously been hanging around a pantry for too long. But thanks to our donors we are able to provide parcels that are not just basic. Gale Carruthers Norwich \u2022 Zoe Williams misses the point. Trussell Trust food banks provide emergency food to people in crisis, people who cannot afford to feed themselves. There may be more such people now and their crises may be ongoing rather than short-lived, but common sense suggests that although they may enjoy a jar of olives, a bag of pasta is more useful. A standard list of non-perishable items ensures equity and that basic dietary needs are met. In Exeter we update our priority list weekly, encouraging supporters to donate items that are in short supply. Thanks to our sister charity, Exeter Food Action, we offer fruit and vegetables, bread, and sometimes cakes. Perhaps it would have been better to remind readers that people in crisis need not only food but also shower gel, deodorants, toothbrushes and washing powder, plus practical and emotional support. And they probably need these things more than they need sun-dried tomatoes. Jeff Skinner Exeter \u2022 At the food bank in Sidmouth where I volunteer we have always provided fresh milk, which we buy in, and bread that is kindly donated by a local baker. We are fortunate to get regular cash donations that are used to buy fresh fruit and vegetables from a local greengrocer. We also provide cheese and eggs.

In every case, it seemed to be someone else\u2019s fault, he said.</p> \n<p>The counsel for Harley Facades, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, pointed the finger at Arconic. He said that far from prohibiting its use on high-rise buildings, Arconic\u2019s brochure \u201cgave no indication Reynobond was not suitable for high-rise residential blocks\u201d and boasted of \u201ccomplete versatility in external applications\u201d.</p> \n<p>Harley Facades, which erected the cladding, was also in contact with Arconic\u2019s UK sales manager about the Grenfell project and \u201cat no point was it suggested by the manufacturer that the product should not be used at Grenfell\u201d, Laidlaw said.</p> \n<p>Given this, he said Arconic\u2019s claim that \u201cit should have been obvious to anybody involved in construction that its product was not of limited combustibility\u201d was \u201castonishing\u201d.</p> \n<p>Studio E, the architect, said it believed the building regulations were not fit for purpose and blamed materials manufacturers for providing safety testing data that \u201cmisled designers\u201d. It said the building services engineers Max Fordham proposed the use of combustible insulation and that Rydon had the power to change the materials. It claimed its position was \u201cnot an attempt to pass the buck\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cStudio E will listen carefully,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe company wants to understand and learn, however painful that may be.\u201d </p> \n<p>Kensington and Chelsea council has admitted failing as a building regulator. Its building control officers inspected the cladding works seven times and found them to be complete to \u201ca high standard\u201d. Harley Facades has also admitted that its works breached building regulations because it failed to install cavity barriers around window openings, which allowed the fire to spread.</p> \n<p>Arconic and Celotex are due to make opening statements on Tuesday. </p>",

At the start of 18 months of evidence about decisions taken before the fire, its immediate aftermath and the role of government, the main contractor, Rydon, revealed that Claude Wehrle, an Arconic official, had explained in internal emails in 2011 that the fire rating of the panels had dropped to class E from class B and so were \u201cunsuitable for use on building facades\u201d in Europe. But, he said, \u201cwe can still work with regulators who are not as restrictive\u201d. In another email in 2015, Wehrle admitted that Reynobond PE was \u201cdangerous on facades and everything should be transferred to (FR) fire-resistant as a matter of urgency\u201d. He added: \u201cThis opinion is technical and anti-commercial, it seems.\u201d The Arconic emails were introduced by Marcus Taverner QC, the counsel for Rydon, the main contractor, who said: \u201cArconic continued to use the [class B] certificate to promote sales of Reynobond and did so specifically in the case of Grenfell Tower.\u201d The panels were fitted on Grenfell during its refurbishment between 2014 and 2016, and the first phase of the inquiry last year concluded that they were the primary cause of the spread of the 14 June 2017 fire. Listening to the evidence at the inquiry venue in Paddington, west London, were bereaved and survivors including Nabil Choucair, who lost six members of his family, Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle, and Marcio Gomes, who led his pregnant wife and their two daughters to safety from their 21st-floor home. The area reserved for victims was packed. Some walked with sticks and others carried babies. Taverner also read out an internal email from Celotex, which made the combustible insulation, from 2013. It showed that officials knew using its insulation alongside aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, as happened at Grenfell, could be dangerous. \u201cWe cannot seem to find or design a suitable barrier in which we have enough confidence that it can be used behind a standard ACM panel which we know will melt and allow fire into the cavity \u2026 Or do we take the view that our product realistically shouldn\u2019t be used behind most cladding panels because in the event of a fire it would burn?\u201d In the same year, the company decided to enter the \u201clucrative\u201d high-rise market, Taverner said, and it was sold for use on Grenfell nevertheless. An expert report commissioned by the inquiry on the architecture of the refurbishment has also concluded: \u201cIt is probable that Celotex was marketing a product for use on the exterior walls of buildings 18 metres in height that they knew to be non-compliant.\u201d Responding after the hearings, Mussilhy said: \u201cThey knew it was dangerous and shouldn\u2019t have been used on buildings above 11 metres and they knew Grenfell was above 11 metres. It shows they don\u2019t care and wanted to maximise the amount of money they could make. Ultimately, people have died because of their actions.\u201d The inquiry restarted with only one of its two expert panellists after the engineer Benita Mehra was forced to resign on Saturday because of her links to Arconic. The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Mehra ran a charity that received a \u00a371,000 grant from the Arconic Foundation, the company\u2019s philanthropic arm. The inquiry\u2019s chairman, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, gave no indication of when she would be replaced. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, said almost all of the organisations responsible for the refurbishment were engaged in \u201ca merry-go-round of buck-passing\u201d, taking positions that contain \u201cno trace of any acceptance of any responsibility\u201d. In every case, it seemed to be someone else\u2019s fault, he said. The counsel for Harley Facades, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, pointed the finger at Arconic. He said that far from prohibiting its use on high-rise buildings, Arconic\u2019s brochure \u201cgave no indication Reynobond was not suitable for high-rise residential blocks\u201d and boasted of \u201ccomplete versatility in external applications\u201d. Harley Facades, which erected the cladding, was also in contact with Arconic\u2019s UK sales manager about the Grenfell project and \u201cat no point was it suggested by the manufacturer that the product should not be used at Grenfell\u201d, Laidlaw said. Given this, he said Arconic\u2019s claim that \u201cit should have been obvious to anybody involved in construction that its product was not of limited combustibility\u201d was \u201castonishing\u201d. Studio E, the architect, said it believed the building regulations were not fit for purpose and blamed materials manufacturers for providing safety testing data that \u201cmisled designers\u201d. It said the building services engineers Max Fordham proposed the use of combustible insulation and that Rydon had the power to change the materials. It claimed its position was \u201cnot an attempt to pass the buck\u201d. \u201cStudio E will listen carefully,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe company wants to understand and learn, however painful that may be.\u201d Kensington and Chelsea council has admitted failing as a building regulator. Its building control officers inspected the cladding works seven times and found them to be complete to \u201ca high standard\u201d. Harley Facades has also admitted that its works breached building regulations because it failed to install cavity barriers around window openings, which allowed the fire to spread. Arconic and Celotex are due to make opening statements on Tuesday.",

We couldn\u2019t stop Brexit, we can\u2019t stop climate change and we couldn\u2019t play white-ball cricket with a red ball. Now please, let\u2019s try to put some runs on the board before we all die in a giant fireball. Where does Buttler fit into these straitened times? Perhaps he doesn\u2019t. This, in a way, is the Buttler Paradox: the less important he is, the better he performs; the better he performs, the more important he becomes. This is why the comparisons with AB de Villiers or MS Dhoni or even Kevin Pietersen have never quite worked. At his best Buttler is a glorious freewheeling irrelevance, a joyriding frivolity, a player who derives his essential function from having none at all. Still, no player operates in a vacuum. Over time the constant background noise of English cricket acts as a sort of tightening noose, a vortex of stern faces and statistical damnation from which there is no real escape. Remember when people used to gripe that Ian Bell made centuries only when somebody else did? Or that Jonathan Trott scored too slowly? English cricket loves nothing more than complaining, even if the cumulative effect is a kind of nonsensical cant. Play with freedom, Jos. Express yourself. But not with too much freedom or expression. Execute your full repertoire of shots without taking undue risks. Play your own game \u2013 and the situation. Buttler, for his part, has been playing pretty much solidly for a year: a period that has taken in a gruelling home World Cup, an immediate Ashes series and the birth of his first child (from whom this is his first winter away). Should his underperformance really surprise us? And if not, then why is the debate about discarding him for good rather than trying to get the best out of him? There are broader, more fundamental questions, too. Can a team accommodate a Sibley and a Buttler at once? If not, why not? What does it say about Test cricket if it cannot find a place for one of the most thrilling talents in the sport? And how do you reckon Australia feel about Buttler never playing in another Ashes? Ultimately, you feel the loss of Buttler would say as much about English cricket as it would about Buttler himself.",

      "body": "<p>I\u00f1aki Williams had just begun the long walk to the bench when he heard something. There were 20 minutes left and Athletic Bilbao were drawing 1-1 at Espanyol, but that didn\u2019t matter much any more. He was heading towards where Iker Muniain was about to take corner, yet his mind was elsewhere now. Barely a metre from Muniain as he ran up and bent the ball into the box, the pair crossing paths, his attention was drawn to the stands instead. Williams slowed slightly, head turned, hearing it more clearly now. He couldn\u2019t tell how many, but it was too many. There was a hint of a challenge, but he kept going. Then, as turned up the touchline he did stop. \u201cSons of bitches, all of you,\u201d he muttered. As he sat on the bench, someone leant across: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he was asked. \u201cUh! Uh! Uh!\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI leave here a bit sad, because of the draw, but above all because I suffered racist abuse,\u201d Williams said afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s something that no black player, or any player of any race wants to hear. It\u2019s totally unacceptable: people should come to the ground to enjoy it, to support their team, to enjoy football, which is a team sport, a sport of friendship. It\u2019s a sad day.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/27/ashley-young-inter-impact-serie-a-title-race-heats-up\">Ashley Young makes rapid Inter impact as Serie A title race heats up</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As for the referees\u2019 report, that didn\u2019t say anything. Nor was the game stopped, or any announcement made: the only game to have been stopped in Spain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/15/spanish-football-nazi-chants-roman-zozulya-rayo-vallecano-albacete-valencia-real-madrid\">remains the recent Rayo-Albacete match</a>, postponed after Rayo fans\u2019 songs accusing Roman Zozulya of being a Nazi, an irony not lost this weekend.</p> \n<p>There is a reason nothing was done on Saturday: the referee had not been aware of the alleged abuse. While it had been picked up by a camera following Williams around the pitch, it had not been heard by others or on the general broadcast. Muniain told the referee, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez, after the match but because neither he, nor the delegates from the league or the federation directly witnessed it, it could not be included in his report, as per existing protocols. The RFEF statement explaining that took more than a day to be released, and was focused more on why there hadn\u2019t been action than on how they would act. Having been picked up by television, though, those protocols may now change and many are calling for players\u2019 complaints about abuse to be presumed to be true as a starting point.</p> \n<p>This is the second time that Williams has been subjected to alleged racist abuse. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/18/sporting-gijon-racial-abuse-alleged-stand-closure\">In 2016</a>, he faced monkey chants from members of Sporting Gij\u00f3n\u2019s neo-Nazi group, the Ultra Boys. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise at the time,\u201d he recalled in a documentary on racism in football aired last week. \u201cIt was the referee who noticed. He came to me and said: \u2018I\u00f1aki, they\u2019re insulting you, there is racist abuse. I\u2019m going to stop the game so an announcement is made over the PA so it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u2019 It struck me, because it was the first time it has happened to me.\u201d Sporting had part of that stand closed in punishment and there are similar suggestions this time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gonzalo1502/status/1221181862141480960\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Espanyol 1-1 Athletic.

With sad inevitability, some have also seen it through club allegiances. The Federation seemed keener to explain why it hadn\u2019t acted than it was to do so. The league president, Javier Tebas, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/la-liga-javier-tebas-vox-andalucia-partido-a8732291.html\">a supporter of the far-right VOX</a> and a man who previously said he wished there was a \u201cSpanish Le Pen\u201d, described this as \u201cstep backwards\u201d. He also said: \u201cThe measures adopted over the last years have to improve, given that, while it is true that there has been a decrease in insults, violent attitudes and behaviour, they are insufficient.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a1347ced-6bc5-4c6f-81f5-71c59b0e47b2\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is a certain false equivalency in how all insults are pursued, and still a lingering sense that racism specifically has not been taken seriously enough. Yet there are some hopes that this might start something. Across Spain, there were messages of condemnation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/27/europeanfootball.sport1\">a sign of a shift</a> \u2013 even if only on the surface and even if certain messages were harder to swallow, given where and who they came from. Marca gave over its front cover to lead on \u201cWe are all I\u00f1aki Williams\u201d, alongside the slogan: \u201cStop racism.\u201d The president of the government tweeted his support for Williams. As one columnist put it: \u201cIt shames us to watch that documentary and see how lax we were in eradicating it, accepting it; let\u2019s not feel the same way if there is another documentary in 20 years\u2019 time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulreidy67/status/1221206843671896066\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Front cover of Marca tomorrow.....<br>Good to see the subject of racism in the game here (finally) being given the exposure it warrants<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TodosSomosWilliams?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TodosSomosWilliams</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/s4BP9LQzfl\">pic.twitter.com/s4BP9LQzfl</a></p>\u2014 Paul Reidy (@paulreidy67) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulreidy67/status/1221206843671896066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Williams is only the second black player to play for Athletic, <a href=\"https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/11/23/jonas\">after Jonas Ramalho</a>. He tells the story of how his mother broke down in tears during a family holiday in the desert, <a href=\"https://cadenaser.com/ser/2020/01/21/deportes/1579631718_050888.html\">recalling her journey</a> from Accra to northern Africa, where she climbed the fence into the Spanish enclave of Melilla. She was pregnant with Williams at the time and he was born in Basurto, Bilbao. \u201cI am proud to be black and I am proud to be Basque,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to open doors.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Talking points</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are used to being the second-best team in the city, but not the third. Held by Legan\u00e9s on Sunday in the noon kick-off, by six o\u2019clock they were no longer even in a Champions League place, having been overtaken by Getafe. And yet it was not just that they could not get beyond a 0-0 draw with Legan\u00e9s, bottom-of-the-table Legan\u00e9s. It was not just that they have been knocked out of the Cup and that this is their worst start under Diego Simeone. It was not even that all of these words are in El Pa\u00eds\u2019s match report: \u201ccomatose\u201d, \u201clost\u201d, \u201csunk\u201d, \u201chorrendous\u201d, \u201ccalamity\u201d, \u201cDantesque,\u201d and \u201cdepression\u201d.</p> \n<p>No. It was the anxiety, the vulnerability. Worse, it was the fact that it didn\u2019t really stand out; it was the weird, disconcerting feeling of normality and acceptance, resignation from the team that rebelled like no one else. The sense that something is not right, something deep; that this just isn\u2019t <em>them</em>, and certainly isn\u2019t Simeone. All of it summed up in a phrase that jarred. \u201cBefore, we would have lost this,\u201d he said, which quite apart from being a strange thing to feel happy about simply isn\u2019t true. Before, Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 his Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 would have won this, or believed they would; 0-0 with 20 minutes to go used to be their kind of place. Not any more.</p> \n<p>Maybe it\u2019s not his either. His name was chanted at the start, a very pointed show of support, but something is slipping there too. For a moment, the man Unai Emery once described as \u201cwar personified\u201d looked like he wasn\u2019t fighting any more, as if the man in black had become an ordinary bloke and the football team he was watching wasn\u2019t really his. The technical area at the Wanda Metropolitano is huge anyway, and only one person is allowed in there, but it might never have looked so big, so empty, maybe even lonely, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1221407313090707458?s=20\">as it did on Sunday</a>. Usually, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s manager fills the space, shouting and straining, dashing about and kicking every ball, conducting the crowd as well as his players, but not this time: for much of a cold, still morning, he walked around it, going nowhere in particular with his hands in his pockets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13ea623091e696224bddd6465e080ae9b3715fd7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13ea623091e696224bddd6465e080ae9b3715fd7/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simeone during the stalemate with Legan\u00e9s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simeone during the stalemate with Legan\u00e9s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 Quique Seti\u00e9n\u2019s Barcelona had the ball. And then, suddenly, they didn\u2019t. And, in a flash and a single pass, Valencia had a penalty. It was only 10 minutes in, but already it was all falling apart for Barcelona. Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen saved that penalty, diving left to deny Maxi. He also saved a shot that flew back off the bar via his hands. But he couldn\u2019t stop everything and Barcelona could not stop Valencia. \u201cI got my revenge,\u201d Maxi said after he had scored both in a 2-0 win, their first against Barcelona at Mestalla in over a decade. It might have been more: Valencia had a third goal from Gabriel ruled out. Messi had 11 shots, of the team\u2019s 14, but only rarely looked like he might score. He looks like he might end up getting bored. \u201cVery, <em>very</em> worrying,\u201d said the front of Sport \u2013 and it was no exaggeration for once. \u201cLost,\u201d El Mundo Deportivo called them.</p> \n<p>\u2022 None of Real Madrid\u2019s forwards have scored since Valencia, but no matter. Varane, Casemiro and Nacho have been enough of late. A 1-0 win in Valladolid took them back to the top for the first time since week eight, and while it wasn\u2019t pretty or even particularly impressive, they look increasingly likely to stay there. There\u2019s a solidity and a competitiveness about them that speaks of Zidane\u2019s determination to win the league, plus a sense that somehow they always will find a way. Usually from a cross or a dead ball \u2013 and that\u2019s fine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1221548637899104257\"> \n

      "bodyText": "I\u00f1aki Williams had just begun the long walk to the bench when he heard something. There were 20 minutes left and Athletic Bilbao were drawing 1-1 at Espanyol, but that didn\u2019t matter much any more. He was heading towards where Iker Muniain was about to take corner, yet his mind was elsewhere now. Barely a metre from Muniain as he ran up and bent the ball into the box, the pair crossing paths, his attention was drawn to the stands instead. Williams slowed slightly, head turned, hearing it more clearly now. He couldn\u2019t tell how many, but it was too many. There was a hint of a challenge, but he kept going. Then, as turned up the touchline he did stop. \u201cSons of bitches, all of you,\u201d he muttered. As he sat on the bench, someone leant across: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he was asked. \u201cUh! Uh! Uh!\u201d he said. \u201cI leave here a bit sad, because of the draw, but above all because I suffered racist abuse,\u201d Williams said afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s something that no black player, or any player of any race wants to hear. It\u2019s totally unacceptable: people should come to the ground to enjoy it, to support their team, to enjoy football, which is a team sport, a sport of friendship. It\u2019s a sad day.\u201d As for the referees\u2019 report, that didn\u2019t say anything. Nor was the game stopped, or any announcement made: the only game to have been stopped in Spain remains the recent Rayo-Albacete match, postponed after Rayo fans\u2019 songs accusing Roman Zozulya of being a Nazi, an irony not lost this weekend. There is a reason nothing was done on Saturday: the referee had not been aware of the alleged abuse. While it had been picked up by a camera following Williams around the pitch, it had not been heard by others or on the general broadcast. Muniain told the referee, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez, after the match but because neither he, nor the delegates from the league or the federation directly witnessed it, it could not be included in his report, as per existing protocols. The RFEF statement explaining that took more than a day to be released, and was focused more on why there hadn\u2019t been action than on how they would act. Having been picked up by television, though, those protocols may now change and many are calling for players\u2019 complaints about abuse to be presumed to be true as a starting point. This is the second time that Williams has been subjected to alleged racist abuse. In 2016, he faced monkey chants from members of Sporting Gij\u00f3n\u2019s neo-Nazi group, the Ultra Boys. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise at the time,\u201d he recalled in a documentary on racism in football aired last week. \u201cIt was the referee who noticed. He came to me and said: \u2018I\u00f1aki, they\u2019re insulting you, there is racist abuse. I\u2019m going to stop the game so an announcement is made over the PA so it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u2019 It struck me, because it was the first time it has happened to me.\u201d Sporting had part of that stand closed in punishment and there are similar suggestions this time. Espanyol said they were trying to identify those responsible, although there was a certain defensiveness when it came to the club\u2019s culpability, an insistence that chants had not come from the official singing sections and was only a few people. With sad inevitability, some have also seen it through club allegiances. The Federation seemed keener to explain why it hadn\u2019t acted than it was to do so. The league president, Javier Tebas, a supporter of the far-right VOX and a man who previously said he wished there was a \u201cSpanish Le Pen\u201d, described this as \u201cstep backwards\u201d. He also said: \u201cThe measures adopted over the last years have to improve, given that, while it is true that there has been a decrease in insults, violent attitudes and behaviour, they are insufficient.\u201d There is a certain false equivalency in how all insults are pursued, and still a lingering sense that racism specifically has not been taken seriously enough. Yet there are some hopes that this might start something. Across Spain, there were messages of condemnation, a sign of a shift \u2013 even if only on the surface and even if certain messages were harder to swallow, given where and who they came from. Marca gave over its front cover to lead on \u201cWe are all I\u00f1aki Williams\u201d, alongside the slogan: \u201cStop racism.\u201d The president of the government tweeted his support for Williams. As one columnist put it: \u201cIt shames us to watch that documentary and see how lax we were in eradicating it, accepting it; let\u2019s not feel the same way if there is another documentary in 20 years\u2019 time.\u201d Williams is only the second black player to play for Athletic, after Jonas Ramalho. He tells the story of how his mother broke down in tears during a family holiday in the desert, recalling her journey from Accra to northern Africa, where she climbed the fence into the Spanish enclave of Melilla. She was pregnant with Williams at the time and he was born in Basurto, Bilbao. \u201cI am proud to be black and I am proud to be Basque,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to open doors.\u201d Talking points \u2022 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid are used to being the second-best team in the city, but not the third. Held by Legan\u00e9s on Sunday in the noon kick-off, by six o\u2019clock they were no longer even in a Champions League place, having been overtaken by Getafe. And yet it was not just that they could not get beyond a 0-0 draw with Legan\u00e9s, bottom-of-the-table Legan\u00e9s. It was not just that they have been knocked out of the Cup and that this is their worst start under Diego Simeone. It was not even that all of these words are in El Pa\u00eds\u2019s match report: \u201ccomatose\u201d, \u201clost\u201d, \u201csunk\u201d, \u201chorrendous\u201d, \u201ccalamity\u201d, \u201cDantesque,\u201d and \u201cdepression\u201d. No. It was the anxiety, the vulnerability. Worse, it was the fact that it didn\u2019t really stand out; it was the weird, disconcerting feeling of normality and acceptance, resignation from the team that rebelled like no one else. The sense that something is not right, something deep; that this just isn\u2019t them, and certainly isn\u2019t Simeone. All of it summed up in a phrase that jarred. \u201cBefore, we would have lost this,\u201d he said, which quite apart from being a strange thing to feel happy about simply isn\u2019t true. Before, Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 his Atl\u00e9tico \u2013 would have won this, or believed they would; 0-0 with 20 minutes to go used to be their kind of place. Not any more. Maybe it\u2019s not his either. His name was chanted at the start, a very pointed show of support, but something is slipping there too. For a moment, the man Unai Emery once described as \u201cwar personified\u201d looked like he wasn\u2019t fighting any more, as if the man in black had become an ordinary bloke and the football team he was watching wasn\u2019t really his. The technical area at the Wanda Metropolitano is huge anyway, and only one person is allowed in there, but it might never have looked so big, so empty, maybe even lonely, as it did on Sunday. Usually, Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s manager fills the space, shouting and straining, dashing about and kicking every ball, conducting the crowd as well as his players, but not this time: for much of a cold, still morning, he walked around it, going nowhere in particular with his hands in his pockets. \u2022 Quique Seti\u00e9n\u2019s Barcelona had the ball. And then, suddenly, they didn\u2019t. And, in a flash and a single pass, Valencia had a penalty. It was only 10 minutes in, but already it was all falling apart for Barcelona. Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen saved that penalty, diving left to deny Maxi. He also saved a shot that flew back off the bar via his hands. But he couldn\u2019t stop everything and Barcelona could not stop Valencia. \u201cI got my revenge,\u201d Maxi said after he had scored both in a 2-0 win, their first against Barcelona at Mestalla in over a decade. It might have been more: Valencia had a third goal from Gabriel ruled out. Messi had 11 shots, of the team\u2019s 14, but only rarely looked like he might score. He looks like he might end up getting bored. \u201cVery, very worrying,\u201d said the front of Sport \u2013 and it was no exaggeration for once. \u201cLost,\u201d El Mundo Deportivo called them. \u2022 None of Real Madrid\u2019s forwards have scored since Valencia, but no matter. Varane, Casemiro and Nacho have been enough of late. A 1-0 win in Valladolid took them back to the top for the first time since week eight, and while it wasn\u2019t pretty or even particularly impressive, they look increasingly likely to stay there. There\u2019s a solidity and a competitiveness about them that speaks of Zidane\u2019s determination to win the league, plus a sense that somehow they always will find a way. Usually from a cross or a dead ball \u2013 and that\u2019s fine. \u2022 \u201cPoo,\u201d Mendilibar called it, so it\u2019s fair to say he wasn\u2019t impressed with Eibar\u2019s performance.",

      "body": "<p>Trauma, like its sibling stress, is a much-overused word these days. People are \u201cstressed\u201d by a full inbox or \u201ctraumatised\u201d because they left their phone in an Uber. Maybe we underplay the reality of trauma because we cannot look it in the face. Our streets are full of bundles of rags in sleeping bags, with people inside. We could ask them about the trauma of abuse or addiction, but we scuttle past. This is not a blame game \u2013 we all cope by shutting down.</p> <p>But what if you can\u2019t shut down? What if you can\u2019t forget? What if the horrors you have seen can\u2019t be put in a box marked \u201cthe past\u201d, but are ever-present? Then you are in trouble. It was tremendously brave, even for a brave man such as the BBC reporter Fergal Keane, to talk about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Keane had been dealing with this after decades of reporting from conflict zones all over the world. His colleague Jeremy Bowen has spoken of long period of depression and PTSD after his many years in the Middle East.</p> <p>I have worked with reporters who could never manage a normal life and were always itching to get back to what most of us would call hell. War zones felt alive; family routine felt dead.</p> <p>The first step in treating trauma is recognising it. I have met therapists brought in to do bereavement counselling for Grenfell survivors who said they couldn\u2019t begin that work because these people were still in trauma. They could smell the smoke and see the flames. I once spoke to soldiers with the charity Combat Stress, and their agitation was so visible it was alarming. One man told me that, just behind me, he could see his friend on fire. Another would be having tea in a cafe with his family, a curtain would flicker and he would dive under the table. These men had served in the Falklands, Ireland and Iraq. What we once called shellshock we now see as PTSD.</p> <p>There is minimal help for these people.</p> <p>There is medication and there are various types of therapy, from cognitive processing (where you may begin to understand that what has happened is not your fault) to a kind of exposure treatment (which means learning not to avoid what triggers memories) to eye-movement desensitisation, which appears to be getting results, although no one knows why.</p> <p>What all these treatments (except drugs) have in common is that patients need the presence of another person, to remember in a place of safety. This is as true for survivors of sexual abuse as it is for young lads returning from Afghanistan.</p> <p>We need witnesses. As the great Judith Herman wrote: \u201cThe conflict between the will to deny horrible events and the will to proclaim them aloud is the central dialectic of psychological trauma.\u201d No wonder, then, that journalists may suffer \u2013 they see suffering most of us never want to see.</p> <p>Writing this on Holocaust Memorial Day, I am minded to think of what happens when there are no more witnesses. There are so few Holocaust survivors left that it\u2019s the job of the rest of us now. \u201cJob\u201d is the wrong word \u2013 it is our moral imperative.</p> <p>We are beginning to understand how trauma crosses generations. Some find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2014/apr/25/epigenetics-beginners-guide-to-everything\" title=\"\">epigenetic</a> reasons; others suggest that the children of survivors may have been asked to hold information that is too much to take on. Recovery from trauma requires a feeling of security, mourning and a connection back to normal life. The horrifying rise of antisemitism should make everyone think about why Jewish people may again feel afraid.</p> <p>Everywhere now I see a belittling of therapy (a self-indulgent chat about feelings) and journalism (fake news), and I connect these two things. Why? Because the best people of these professions \u2013 and Keane is definitely one \u2013 are witnesses. Herman talks of the \u201cpotential power of any relationship of witnessing\u201d. This is both the hardest and the most powerful thing we can do. But it is more necessary now than ever. We bear witness. We remember, we mourn, we reconnect.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p>",

They could smell the smoke and see the flames. I once spoke to soldiers with the charity Combat Stress, and their agitation was so visible it was alarming. One man told me that, just behind me, he could see his friend on fire. Another would be having tea in a cafe with his family, a curtain would flicker and he would dive under the table. These men had served in the Falklands, Ireland and Iraq. What we once called shellshock we now see as PTSD. There is minimal help for these people. There is medication and there are various types of therapy, from cognitive processing (where you may begin to understand that what has happened is not your fault) to a kind of exposure treatment (which means learning not to avoid what triggers memories) to eye-movement desensitisation, which appears to be getting results, although no one knows why. What all these treatments (except drugs) have in common is that patients need the presence of another person, to remember in a place of safety. This is as true for survivors of sexual abuse as it is for young lads returning from Afghanistan. We need witnesses. As the great Judith Herman wrote: \u201cThe conflict between the will to deny horrible events and the will to proclaim them aloud is the central dialectic of psychological trauma.\u201d No wonder, then, that journalists may suffer \u2013 they see suffering most of us never want to see. Writing this on Holocaust Memorial Day, I am minded to think of what happens when there are no more witnesses. There are so few Holocaust survivors left that it\u2019s the job of the rest of us now. \u201cJob\u201d is the wrong word \u2013 it is our moral imperative. We are beginning to understand how trauma crosses generations. Some find epigenetic reasons; others suggest that the children of survivors may have been asked to hold information that is too much to take on. Recovery from trauma requires a feeling of security, mourning and a connection back to normal life. The horrifying rise of antisemitism should make everyone think about why Jewish people may again feel afraid. Everywhere now I see a belittling of therapy (a self-indulgent chat about feelings) and journalism (fake news), and I connect these two things. Why? Because the best people of these professions \u2013 and Keane is definitely one \u2013 are witnesses. Herman talks of the \u201cpotential power of any relationship of witnessing\u201d. This is both the hardest and the most powerful thing we can do. But it is more necessary now than ever. We bear witness. We remember, we mourn, we reconnect. \u2022 Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist",

The Conservative backlash over his proposed decision to allow Huawei a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network does not mean that Johnson faces any sort of immediate risk in the Commons. The Huawei decision is not one that will have to be put to a vote and, even if it were, he has a majority of 80-plus (the exact figure depends how you count it). </p> \n  <p>But until now he has encountered virtually no opposition from his own MPs in parliament on anything. This afternoon that all changed, as one Tory MP after another stood up to question the wisdom of giving Huawei even a limited role in the 5G network.</p> \n  <p>And it was not just the usual foreign policy hawks who were sounding off on this. There were mainstream loyalists expressing concern too, like Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, Damian Collins, the former culture committee chair, and Tim Loughton, the former first minister. </p> \n  <p>In one sense this just marks the return of normal politics. But it is unusual to hear a minister receive so little support from the government backbenches during an urgent question like this.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In 5G there is no fringe. There is only core.

And that\u2019s one thing that we actually find hard to understand because if you grow up in Ireland, you know, we speak English as our first language, most of us do anyway. We watch the BBC, we watch Graham Norton, we watch your television, your news. We really understand a lot about Britain.</p> \n   <p>But I think a lot of British people don\u2019t understand a lot about Ireland, including your politicians. And that\u2019s what was very badly exposed I think during the whole Brexit process \u2026</p> \n   <p>I think that a lot of people in Britain underestimated the fact that European partners will stay by us. You know, Britain has a very powerful history, a very colonial history. And I think there were people in Britain who thought that France, Germany and Britain would get together at a big summit and tell the small countries what\u2019s what. That\u2019s not the way the 21st century works. That\u2019s certainly not the way the European Union works.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is plenty of evidence to support what Varadkar is saying, and the Atlantic\u2019s <strong>Tom McTague</strong> came up with a new anecdote last week which supports the claim that the cabinet underestimated Ireland. In <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/britain-brexit-canada-model-europe/605224/\">an article about how the UK could emulate Canada after Brexit</a>, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In Britain\u2019s negotiations with Ireland over Brexit, some senior politicians in London were dismissive of the effectiveness of Irish diplomacy. One cabinet minister, who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, told me that Ireland was a small country, which meant that the quality of its ministers could not match that of those in the UK. And yet this attitude proved part of London\u2019s undoing in the negotiations, which saw Ireland win more of its objectives than Britain did.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Varadkar said he did not know if Brexit would increase the chances of Ireland reuniting.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he thought it would be \u201cpossible\u201d but \u201cdifficult\u201d to conclude a UK-EU trade deal before the end of this year.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Johnson had personally assured him that he did not want the UK to undercut EU standards after </strong><strong>Brexit</strong>. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>He said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the area where it\u2019s going to become tricky is this whole idea of a level playing field. Because there\u2019s a genuine concern across the European Union that part of the motivation behind Brexit was for the UK to undercut us in terms of environmental standards, labour standards, product standards, food standards, all of those things. Now when I meet Prime Minister Johnson he says: \u2018No, absolutely not. That\u2019s not the kind of United Kingdom that I want or need as prime minister.\u2019 But we want that written down in law. We want that in a treaty so that we know that the UK will not be undercutting the EU with lower standards.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Varadakar insisted that there would be a need for some checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit. </strong>Johnson has repeatedly played down the need for these checks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/13/labour-leadership-nomination-deadline-means-thornberry-and-lewis-risk-elimination-from-contest-at-230pm-live-news?page=with:block-5e1c6c068f087e8308e6d673#block-5e1c6c068f087e8308e6d673\">telling a news conference in Belfast recently</a> that these checks would only apply in the absence of a zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal. But Varadkar said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Goods coming into Northern Ireland, which may come across the border into the European Union, Ireland, the single market \u2013 then there will be checks required at ports and airports in Northern Ireland.

He is expected to say it should be allowed to play a role, subject to certain conditions.</p> \n  <p>On the Today programme this morning <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the former foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s main rival in the Tory leadership contest last summer, said that when he was in government he was sceptical about allowing Huawei to take on this role. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I must admit I always wondered whether it was wise to allow ourselves to become technologically dependent on another country, whichever country, for something as critical as 5G technology.</p> \n   <p>That is my view, but I would say if the decision goes the other way this week, as some of the signs seem to indicate it might, I hope there will also be some reflection in the US because we have never needed the western alliance to be stronger than now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt also said that, even if the intelligences services thought they could contain any risk, he was worried about how the situation might develop in the future. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I do accept the word of our intelligence community that they are pretty good at protecting our core national infrastructure. </p> \n   <p>But I think the issue is what happens if we get to the situation where no western companies that are really able to compete with Huawei going forward and, like it or not, in a decade\u2019s time people will look back and say: \u2018Was this really wise to take this decision in 2020 that has led to this dependency?\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>According to the Financial Times, Johnson is expected to say that Huawei can play a role in building the 5G network, subject to a market cap. In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bef8972-405a-11ea-bdb5-169ba7be433d\">their story (paywall)</a> <strong>George Parker </strong>and<strong> Nic Fildes</strong> say:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The NSC [national security council] will be asked to consider two options: the total ban on Huawei demanded by Mr Trump; or a ban on the company providing \u201ccore\u201d services, coupled with a limit on market share. </p> \n   <p>Non-core equipment refers to the antennas and base stations that sit on masts and rooftops, which are considered less vulnerable than the core servers and systems where customer information is processed. </p> \n   <p>Telecoms companies have been bracing for months for the introduction of a limit to how much Huawei equipment can be used in a city or region. Mobile phone companies typically source equipment from more than one vendor but build the network in clusters. </p> \n   <p>That means a single city, such as Manchester, may be dominated by Huawei radio equipment if all the mobile networks \u2013 Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three \u2013 use Huawei in that region. </p> \n   <p>The push to impose a market share threshold \u2013 considered by Theresa May\u2019s government last year \u2013 would require networks to swap out equipment in exchange for Ericsson, Nokia or Samsung kit. That would add cost for the industry rolling out 5G but would be less of a setback than a total ban on using Huawei.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As the Guardian reports, yesterday <strong>Mike Pompeo,</strong> the US secretary of state, claimed that choosing Huawei would amount to a threat to UK sovereignty.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/27/uk-sovereignty-in-jeopardy-if-huawei-used-for-5g-us-warns\">UK sovereignty in jeopardy if Huawei used for 5G, US warns</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc306cdfc2f2ece8d0ed3b3501a0d23073589b1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc306cdfc2f2ece8d0ed3b3501a0d23073589b1a/0_38_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T11:54:22.469Z\">at 11.54am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2e9dc78f08a6950eb499f0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T09:02:19.399Z\">9.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK must keep fishing waters open to EU boats if it wants trade deal for banking, Irish PM implies</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. At the end of this week the UK will leave the European Union. But if Boris Johnson thinks that this will amount to getting Brexit done, he\u2019s wrong, according to his Irish opposite number, <strong>Leo Varadkar</strong>. \u201cWe\u2019re only at halftime on Brexit. It\u2019s not done yet,\u201d he told the BBC, in an interview with its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg.</p> \n  <p>In the interview Varadkar more or less explicitly said that if the UK wanted British banks to be able to continue to have access to the EU financial services market after Brexit, it was going to have to let EU boats continue to fish in British waters. Asked if the proposed UK-EU trade deal would end up being limited or piecemeal, Varadkar, who is of course <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/irish-prime-minister-leo-varadkar-to-call-national-election-on-8-february\">in the middle of a general election campaign</a>, replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we\u2019ll have to be comprehensive. You could have a bare bones interim agreement, but whatever final future economic partnership we come up with, I think it will have to be quite detailed. </p> \n   <p>Because what happens in these things is trade-offs. For example, the United Kingdom has a very strong position on fisheries. The UK has a lot of waters, and a lot of fish is taken out of your waters by boats from other countries, but bear in mind 70% of the fish you sell, you sell into Europe. So unless British people are going to start eating an awful lot more fish, you have a problem there. </p> \n   <p>But that\u2019s an area where you\u2019re in a strong position. An area where you\u2019re in a very weak position is one of the most valuable parts of the British economy which is financial services. It\u2019s such a crucial part of the of the British economy. And areas like the entertainment industry. And if financial services and entertainment, audio visual, are cut off from the single market, the European market, that will be a very severe blow to the British economy and the south-east, in particular in London. </p> \n   <p>So, you know, you may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services, and that\u2019s why things tend to be all in the one package.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This has always been implicit in the EU negotiating position, but generally EU leaders have not up to now been as blunt as this in saying: \u201cLet us keep fishing in your waters, or your banks will take a hit.\u201d</p> \n  <p>There is a lot more in the BBC interview, and I will post further extracts soon.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>8.45am:</em> Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, meets Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, in Dublin.</p> \n  <p><em>11am:</em> Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>2.30pm: </em>Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> \n  <p><em>3pm:</em> Barnier meets ministers from the Northern Ireland executive in Belfast.</p> \n  <p><em>5.30pm:</em> Barnier gives a speech at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has suggested he will arrive at a compromise solution over the decision on whether to let the Chinese company Huawei build parts of the UK\u2019s 5G network in the face of US warnings that it will compromise intelligence-sharing. In the Commons a large number of Conservative MPs have expressed strong opposition to this prospect, saying Huawei should be totally excluded from the 5G network. (See 5.14pm.) Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM), has suggested the UK will fail to get a trade deal allowing its banks access to the EU\u2019s financial services market unless it agrees to let EU boats carry on fishing in its waters. (See 10.18am.) Downing Street has not ruled out using fishing as a bargaining chip in the trade talks in this manner. (See 11.24am.) The European Union\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, have warned that a united bloc \u2013 \u201cteam 27\u201d \u2013 will give the UK a stark challenge in the next phase of Brexit negotiations. Boris Johnson has appointed David Frost, his chief Europe adviser, to lead trade negotiations with the EU on his behalf, with no apparent role for Liz Truss, the trade secretary. Nicola Sturgeon has called for Scotland to have its own visa and immigration strategy to deal with the country\u2019s falling birth rate and the impacts of Brexit. Any attempt by the British government to seek full access to European markets without alignment was \u201cabsurd\u201d and would be voted down, one of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s top allies in the European parliament has said. Gimmicky policies, horrible inefficiency and factional promotions are among the catalogue of errors behind Labour\u2019s dismal performance at the general election, according to party members. The former chancellor Philip Hammond has taken his second job since quitting frontline politics last year, joining the British business bank OakNorth as an adviser. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is the afternoon when Boris Johnson\u2019s post-election honeymoon came to an end. The Conservative backlash over his proposed decision to allow Huawei a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network does not mean that Johnson faces any sort of immediate risk in the Commons. The Huawei decision is not one that will have to be put to a vote and, even if it were, he has a majority of 80-plus (the exact figure depends how you count it). But until now he has encountered virtually no opposition from his own MPs in parliament on anything. This afternoon that all changed, as one Tory MP after another stood up to question the wisdom of giving Huawei even a limited role in the 5G network. And it was not just the usual foreign policy hawks who were sounding off on this. There were mainstream loyalists expressing concern too, like Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, Damian Collins, the former culture committee chair, and Tim Loughton, the former first minister. In one sense this just marks the return of normal politics. But it is unusual to hear a minister receive so little support from the government backbenches during an urgent question like this. Johnson should be at least a bit concerned - not least because Iain Duncan Smith implied that Johnson is breaking a promise made in private to Tory MPs on this matter. Here are some of the quotes from Tory MPs during the Huawei UQ. From Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and former cabinet minister Given the fact that we are at war, in a sense - there is a cyber war going on, in which China is arguable the single biggest participant - that we should think about giving a company which is heavily subsidised by China, a country that has set out to steal data non-stop, and also technology, that we think of giving to them that right to be in what is essentially a very, very delicate area of our technology, the idea that we would do that seems to me utterly bizarre. I was led to believe that this government would not make that decision. I hope that they will now reject Huawei immediately. From Bob Seely Why is it argued that you could limit Huawei to the periphery of the network when Australia and the United States don\u2019t agree, and when of the head of Australia\u2019s cyber agency says the distinction between core and edge in 5G collapses? A threat in the network anywhere is a threat everywhere. Why is it said that the risks are manageable, when our allies say not? Why have previous ministers claimed that Huawei is a private firm when in no way is that true? Why are we told that there are no alternatives when there are? Why are we told that the quality of Huawei\u2019s work is high when the Cell in Banbury says their work is sloppy? Why do we need high-risk vendors in our network at all? Whoever controls 5G will affect significantly our rule of law, our data privacy, our security and our freedom to support our allies. We have had so little parliamentary debate on this issue. From Owen Paterson, the former Tory cabinet minister I find this absolutely extraordinary. If there is such a risk, and we know Sir Richard Dearlove, ex head of MI6 has said there is, we know there is a risk of losing key intelligence from our closest allies, what is the overwhelming advantage of this equipment that we are looking to take this risk? From Andrew Bridgen Does the minister agree with me that, however cheaply Huawei are offering this country the benefits of their 5G technology, if as a result of their participation in this project we risk any jeopardising of our position within the five eyes, and access to shard intelligence in the future, then I\u2019m afraid that Huawei\u2019s price is too high for us to pay. From Tim Loughton, a former children\u2019s minister Given that some of our most important major allies have said no thanks to Huawei, given that the costs of cyber attacks can ultimately far outweigh the outweigh on networks and hardware, what exactly is the downside of shopping around for a low-risk vendor from a country we can call an ally. Ed Conway, Sky\u2019s economics editor, has posted a good thread on Twitter about why the Huawei/5G decision is so important. During work and pensions questions earlier Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, said the government would continue with the so-called bedroom tax, the policy that reduces housing benefit payments for claimants with spare room. In response to a question from the SNP\u2019s Martyn Day, who said the Scottish government was spending \u00a350m a year reversing the impact of the policy in Scotland, she said the policy was an \u201cimportant part\u201d of changes in housing policy in order to tackle homelessness. She went on: \u201cI absolutely think that we will continue with that policy.\u201d The Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney is now asking an urgent question about the police use of live facial recognition technology. Kit Malthouse, the Home Office minister, says the use of this technology, which involves looking for particular suspects, mirrors the use of existing police techniques (such as the use of \u201cspotters\u201d in crowds). He says when the police use this technology, they have to follow certain rules. They are looking for people on watch lists. He says data about people not on these list is not kept. And he says the police need his permission to use this technology. Olney says 93% of matches using this technology have been shown to be wrong. And he says the technology is more likely to make mistakes with women or minority ethnic people. She asks what ministers are doing to address these concerns. Malthouse is responding to Olney. He says the Metropolitan police has not found a disproportionality problem with this technology. Many democratic institutions are looking at this issue, he says. And he says the Met will be publishing information about when this is used, and what their success rate is. Tim Loughton, a Conservative, asks what is the downside of shopping around for a low-risk vendor from a country that could be called an ally. Warman says there are not as many vendors of this kit as we would like. But he says Loughton is right to say the long-term consequences must be considered. Andrew Bridgen, a Tory, says however cheap the Huawei technology is, that would not be worth jeopardising the UK\u2019s place in the five eyes intelligence network. Warman says these intelligence considerations will be at the top of the list of priorities when this decision is being taken. Labour\u2019s Geraint Davies says it does not seem right to be important technology used for mass control in China. Damian Green, the Conservative former first secretary of state, asks if the UK still has the capacity to provide large chunks of its own telecoms infrastructure. Warman says it is important that the UK has this capacity. The government is investing to improve it, he says. The SNP\u2019s Martin Docherty-Hughes says this session is like an unofficial hustings for the chairmanship of the foreign affairs committee. Crispin Blunt, Bob Seely and Tom Tugendhat are all standing for the post. The election is on Wednesday. Damian Collins, the Tory MP who chaired the culture committee in the last parliament, asks why Huawei is being considered for 5G when there are concerns about the work it has already done on 4G. Warman says these are issues that will be taken into account. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant says Huawei has been engaged in state sponsored espionage. He says it would not be an appropriate partner. Warman says the government is aware of these concerns. Owen Paterson, the former Tory cabinet government, says he finds this decision extraordinary. He asks why the government is considering taking this risk. This is from Nick Timothy, who was co-chief of staff to Theresa May when she was home secretary and when she was PM until the 2017 general election. Most of the Tory MPs who have spoken out against Huawei so far are already on the record as being opposed to the prospect of Huawei playing a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network. But the strength of feeling on this issue is still striking. It is the first time since the election that Boris Johnson has faced any proper opposition from Tory MPs in the Commons on a matter of policy. Jeremy Wright, the former Tory culture secretary, asks for an assurance that any decision taken by the government will be in accordance with advice from the intelligence agencies. Warman says he can give this assurance. Bob Seely, another Conservative, says whoever controls 5G will control significantly our rule of law, our data privacy, and our ability to protect our allies. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and former work and pensions secretary, says the UK is effectively involved in a cyber war with China. He says the idea of giving Huawei a role in the 5G network is \u201cbizarre\u201d. He also says he was told Boris Johnson would not let Huawei play a role in constructing 5G. I was led to believe that this government would not make that decision. Kevan Jones, a Labour former defence minister, says from the briefings he has had, he thinks any risk posed by Huawei could be mitigated. Crispin Blunt, the former Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, says the US position \u201cthinly disguises\u201d a protectionist position. Unless the US can prove that its security concerns are valid, the government should ignore them, he says. The SNP\u2019s John Nicolson asks if Huawei is really the only firm that could produce this infrastructure. Warman says Huawei is not the only company in this market. There are other providers too, he says. Julian Lewis, the former Tory chair of the Commons defence committee, says the intelligence and security committee report should investigate this. He says the ISC published a report on this in 2013. Most of what it said was not made public on security grounds, he says. Warman says the government would cooperate with any ISC inquiry. Tracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary, says she is deeply dismayed that the PM is not making a statement on this. She says she agrees with Keir Starmer about how the PM is \u201cdoing a runner\u201d. She says, if Huawei is limited to non-core parts of the network, how will that be enforced? Warman says the PM will, of course, take responsibility for the decisions he takes. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP, is responding now. He says there is a risk that this decision could \u201cnest a dragon\u201d within the UK\u2019s telecoms infrastructure. He says any decision taken on this tomorrow will affect the UK for years to come. He says Vietnam has rejected Huawei. The Czech government has rejected Huawei. He says Germany is taking a decision today. He says ministers should understand the concerns MPs feel about this. He says allowing Huawei to play a role in 5G would amount to letting \u201cthe fox into the henhouse\u201d. Warman says this decision will not be taken lightly. Matt Warman, a junior culture minister, is responding to the UQ. He says 5G networks can change our lives for the better. But he says the UK must be sure its infrastructure is secure. The government commissioned a review of its telecommunications network, he says. It was published last summer. But it did not make recommendations on the controls to be placed on high-risk companies, he says. He says the UK would never take a decision that would threaten the security of the UK, or its allies. The national security council will discuss this matter tomorrow, he says. We are about to get an urgent question in the Commons on Huawei. It has been tabled by Tom Tugendhat, who chaired the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament and is standing for election to chair it in this parliament. The elections are on Wednesday. Tugendhat wrote an article on this subject in the Mail on Sunday yesterday. Here is an extract. Rightly, we shouldn\u2019t rely on essential services that have only one reserve parachute. Huawei, however, is not like the others. It\u2019s incompatible with rivals, meaning that once the hardware is in, you\u2019re stuck with it. Such a dependency, combined with allegations about state subsidies, lead many to believe that Huawei\u2019s bid isn\u2019t a sales pitch but tech dumping \u2013 selling its products cheaply to achieve a dominant position. In 4G, there\u2019s a distinction between core and non-core equipment, dividing the heart of the system from the antennas, but that difference is less clear in a 5G network that handles more data at higher speeds. Speaking at Kings College London Boris Johnson also said that he did not agree with Leo Varadkar about how it might be necessary to extend the post-Brexit transition beyond December 2020 (a move Johnson has ruled out) to ensure time for a proper UK-EU trade deal to be negotiated. Johnson said: I have to say this is one of those rare occasions where I\u2019m going to be obliged to respectfully disagree with my friend the taoiseach and just say I think we can wrap all this up in the time we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ve got till, as you know, the end of the year and we will be doing things very fast, [in a] very friendly and respectful way, and in a way also, I think it\u2019s important to stress, that really ensures we look after the interests of the Republic of Ireland as well. Boris Johnson has been speaking to journalists at King\u2019s College London mathematics school, where he was at an event promoting the government\u2019s plans for a new visa system intended to attract highly skilled scientists and others to the UK. Asked to respond to the claims from the Tory MP Tom Tugendhat (and endorsed by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo) that letting Huawei have a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network would hand power to the Chinese government, Johnson denied it. But, in doing so, he effectively confirmed that Huawei would get a role in constructing the 5G infrastructure. He said: I think there\u2019s a very, very important strategic win for the UK. The way forward for us clearly is to have a system that delivers for people in this country the kind of consumer benefits that they want through 5G technology or whatever but does not in any way compromise our critical national infrastructure, our security or jeopardise our ability to work together with other intelligence powers around the world. The five eyes security relationships we have, we\u2019ve got to keep them strong and safe. Asked what the government was planning, he said: We are going to come up with a solution that enables us to achieve both those objectives and that\u2019s the way forward. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have technological progress here in the UK, allow consumers, businesses in the UK to have access to fantastic technology, fantastic communications, but also protect our security interests and protect our key partnerships with other security powers around the world. On the BBC\u2019s World at One, Tim Morrison, a former adviser to President Trump on his national security council, said that if the UK were to go ahead and give even a limited role to Huawei in building its 5G network, he did not think Congress would approve a UK-US trade deal. A decision of this kind \u2013 which Boris Johnson is expected to announce tomorrow (see 9.36am) \u2013 could do \u201cincalculable\u201d damage to the special relationship, he said. I\u2019m concerned that, as the United Kingdom finally appears to be at least at the end of the beginning for Brexit, what this could mean for a US-UK trade agreement. When asked if he was saying that there would be no UK-US trade deal if Johnson refused to boycott Huawei, Morrison replied: It becomes extremely difficult to see how you could get the votes on Capitol Hill [for such a deal]. Morrison, who was on the US national security council until October last year, said that letting Huawei play a role in building 5G would be like allowing the KGB into UK or US telecommunications networks during the cold war. He said: We are talking about allowing the Chinese Communist party into the telecommunications system, into the healthcare data, into the personal financial records of every Briton, and, frankly, into the heart of the most successful security alliance, the five eyes, the world has ever known. Morrison said that, if the UK did go ahead with allowing Huawei a role in building its 5G networks, Americans would see that as London putting its desire to protect Chinese inward investment ahead of its security relationship with the US. Asked whether the US would withhold intelligence from the UK as a result, he said: \u201cWe have seen members of Congress call for that.\u201d And he dismissed claims that it would be possible to mitigate the risks by restricting Huawei\u2019s role to non-core parts of the network. He explained: In 5G there is no fringe. There is only core. And or if Huawei is allowed into any part of your network, it is allowed into every part of your network. And the risk for the United States, the risk for Australia, the risk for Canada, the risk for your other security partners, is if it\u2019s in your network, it could wind up in our network. From the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley Boris Johnson is expected to hold an extensive government reshuffle next month. But, according to a report out today (pdf) from the Institute for Government, he should think twice before he does. The IfG says that in Britain ministers move post too often and that the government would be better run if they stayed put for longer. According to the report, since 1997, secretaries of state have stayed in post for just two years on average. The IfG says this means they move almost as often as football managers, and more than twice as often as the CEOs of major companies. The IfG says that in countries such as Germany and Sweden senior ministers stay in post for much longer than they do in the UK. And the IfG says junior ministers tend to get moved even more often. Since 1997 the average housing minister has stayed in the job for just 14 months. Tom Sasse, an IfG researcher and one of the authors of the report, said: Playing musical chairs with the ministers in charge of key public priorities is not a serious way to run the country. It is disruptive, wasteful and hinders government efforts to deliver the kind of long-term reforms needed to improve people\u2019s lives. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trained to lose,\u201d the Tory Brexiter Mark Francois once famously claimed. But it is remarkable how easy it is to pick up new skills, even in middle age, and the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn says Francois has admitted defeat in his campaign to use crowdfunding to get Big Ben to chime on Friday night to mark Brexit. This morning the Scottish government published a 94-page paper (pdf) explaining how the Scottish government could take charge of its own immigration policy and start issuing its own \u201cScottish visa\u201d. Ostensibly it is an immigration policy paper, but the Scottish government does not have responsibility for immigration policy in Scotland, Westminster does, and so perhaps it would be better to see this as a devolution policy paper, or a contribution to a manifesto for Scottish independence. There is a Scottish government news summary of the plans here. Speaking at the launch of the document in Edinburgh, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said: The hard reality is this: without continued inward migration in the years ahead, there\u2019s a real risk that Scotland\u2019s working-age population will fall \u2026 A common, UK-wide approach to immigration simply hasn\u2019t worked in Scotland\u2019s favour for some time now. I hope the UK government will be prepared to work with us to deliver a Scottish visa. Asked what would happen if the UK government refused her proposal to allow the Scottish government to take joint charge with London of immigration policy for Scotland (as seems likely \u2013 see 11.16am), Sturgeon said: I\u2019m not going to sit here and say that they\u2019re going to jump and say yes. But equally, I know what the risks and the realities will be if we don\u2019t have this. If there is a complete blanket refusal to discuss these things, then the view that the Westminster system is incapable of accommodating Scotland\u2019s distinctive interest just becomes more and more of a real thing. There are two urgent questions this afternoon. Here are some more lines from the press conference that Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach (Irish PM), held earlier. Barnier said he would present a draft negotiating mandate for the trade talks to EU member states next Monday. He said: Brexit is not going to go away. We have some important work ahead of us. The protocol of Ireland/Northern Ireland now needs to be implemented in all its dimensions - we will watch over its implementation very closely. We also need to begin negotiations on our future relationship - an ambitious relationship with the UK. It\u2019s time for round two and time will be very short. We will maintain the EU unity, and we want to find an agreement that works in the interest of the whole EU. He also described the next stage as the second round of the negotiation. It\u2019s time for the second [Brexit] round. This time it is very short, [we] have no time to lose in any politics. Barnier said the amount of access the UK got to the single market post-Brexit would depend on the level of its commitment to keeping a level playing field with the EU. He said: The level of access for the UK and particular for the UK products to the single market will be proportionate to the level of commitments taken by the UK vis-a-vis our rules in particular for the state regulations. Varadkar said that, although he was \u201cambitious\u201d about the UK-EU future partnership, there was also a need for \u201crealism\u201d. He said he did not see the next stage of the negotiations a contest. He said: I think if you see this as a contest, the European Union is in a very strong position - we\u2019re 27 countries, we have a population of 450 million people and the single market is the largest economy in the world. But I don\u2019t think we have to see it as a contest. There is a possibility for us to work together with the United Kingdom over the next few months and come to a future relationship and a trade agreement that\u2019s mutually beneficial and that\u2019s the spirit in which we will be entering these talks. From Boris Johnson Here is the Times\u2019s Steven Swinford on the significance of the PMOS\u2019s comments on fishing. The PMOS is not talking about some of the post-Brexit Whitehall arrangements. He says there will be 40 officials working in a government taskforce on the EU future partnership. He says after Friday the UK will no longer sit with the EU at international meetings. Our permanent representative to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, will become ambassador to the EU. And he says the ministers will be making visits abroad to promote the UK. Q: Who is in charge of the taskforce on Europe? The PM. Q: So there will be no other minister in charge. Who will Michel Barnier speak to? The PMOS says Barnier will be able to speak to David Frost, the PM\u2019s EU adviser. Q: Who will update parliament on Brexit? The PMOS says Michael Gove will oversee the withdrawal agreement, but the PM will oversee the negotiation. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. The PMOS says after Friday night the Brexit department will not exist. Asked about Stephen Barclay\u2019s position as Brexit secretary, he says that there will be no department, but that cabinet reshuffle decisions are a matter for the PM. Yesterday Barclay said that his gut feeling was that HS2 would go ahead. Asked if the PM trusts Barclay\u2019s gut, the PMOS says: In relation to HS2, discussion is ongoing. Once a decision is reached, we will let you know. Q: Leo Varadkar said this morning that British ignorance of Ireland was a problem. Does the PM agree? The PMOS says he has not seen those remarks. Q: Does the PM accept, as Varadkar implied, that the UK would have to trade access to fishing waters for UK access to financial services in Europe? The PMOS says: We are taking back control of our waters \u2026 We have been clear on that. He says this was made clear in the PM\u2019s election manifesto. Asked if this means the government is ruling out linking the two issues in trade talks, the PMOS repeats the point about taking back control of fishing waters. He says the PM has left the EU in \u201cno doubt of our determination on that issue\u201d. He says the government will decide for itself who accesses its fishing waters. Q: We can determine that we are going to let the French into our waters? The PMOS says the government has been very clear that the UK will determine who fishes in British waters. Q: Fishing leaders themselves have said that some EU boats will continue to fish in British waters after Brexit. The PMOS says he has not said anything that contradicts this. No 10 does not rule out using fishing as bargaining chip in wider UK-EU trade talks. Q: Why is there a delay in getting people out of Wuhan? The PMOS says the Foreign Office has said this morning it is exploring its options. The safety of British nationals is its priority, it says. Q: Is an airlift possible? The PMOS says the government is exploring options. Q: Why is the government announcing a visa scheme for highly skilled people now? The PMOS says there are concerns that the government is not bringing in enough highly talented people. By announcing the scheme now, the government will be able to bring it in more quickly. Q: What is your reaction to the Scottish government\u2019s visa plans announced today? Immigration policy is a matter for the UK government, the PMOS says. We\u2019re very clear that we want an immigration system that works for the whole UK. Immigration policy is a matter for the UK government. No 10 rules out giving Scottish government control over immigration policy for Scotland. Back to Harry Dunn. Q: Does the UK government think Anne Sacoolas was covered by diplomatic immunity? The PMOS says the government\u2019s view is that she should come back to face justice. The PMOS says the government will consider the recommendations made by the migration advisory committee in a report coming this week, and then bring forward an immigration bill in due course. Asked about the US refusal to extradite the US diplomat\u2019s wife accused of killing Harry Dunn in a road accident, the PMOS says the PM sees this as a denial of justice. What more will the government do? We said on Friday that we were urgently looking at our options, the PMOS says. He says this point will be made to Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, when he visits the UK this week. The PM will be speaking shortly at the UK\u2019s commemorative ceremony for Holocaust Memorial Day, the PMOS says. The briefing is taking place in 9 Downing Street. These briefings used to be held in the Commons, but No 10 changed the arrangements this year, ostensibly to make it easier for officials to brief journalists, as well as the PMOS (prime minister\u2019s official spokesman). The spokesman starts by reading out a list of what the PM and other ministers are doing today. I am at the No 10 lobby briefing, where the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, James Slack, is briefing journalists. In the past these briefings were embargoed until they were over. But the rules were changed last week, and so now I can live blog from the meeting. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, have been holding a press conference in Dublin. Varadkar said that, if Brexit does not work out and the UK wants to rejoin the EU, it would be welcome back. These are from Sky\u2019s Stephen Murphy, the BBC\u2019s Chris Page and the Irish government (aka Merrion Street). The BBC\u2019s interview with Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, was thorough and candid. Laura Kuenssberg has written a blog about what Varadkar told her that you can read here, and I\u2019ve already posted some quotes. Here is a fuller summary. Varadkar suggested that the UK would fail to get a trade deal allowing its banks access to the EU\u2019s financial services market unless it agree to let EU boats carry on fishing in its waters. (See 9.02am.) He said he thought the EU would be in a stronger position than the UK in the forthcoming trade negotiation. Asked if the EU would have the upper hands in the talks, he said: The reality of situation is that the European Union is a union of 27 member states. The UK is only one country. And we have a population and a market of 450 million people. The UK, it\u2019s about 60. So if these were two teams up against each other playing football, who do you think has the stronger team? So long as we\u2019re united. He said the British did not understand Ireland very well, and this was a problem for London during the first round of the Brexit talks. He said: A lot of people, unfortunately, in Westminster, and in Britain, don\u2019t understand Ireland, or know much about Ireland. And that\u2019s one thing that we actually find hard to understand because if you grow up in Ireland, you know, we speak English as our first language, most of us do anyway. We watch the BBC, we watch Graham Norton, we watch your television, your news. We really understand a lot about Britain. But I think a lot of British people don\u2019t understand a lot about Ireland, including your politicians. And that\u2019s what was very badly exposed I think during the whole Brexit process \u2026 I think that a lot of people in Britain underestimated the fact that European partners will stay by us. You know, Britain has a very powerful history, a very colonial history. And I think there were people in Britain who thought that France, Germany and Britain would get together at a big summit and tell the small countries what\u2019s what. That\u2019s not the way the 21st century works. That\u2019s certainly not the way the European Union works. There is plenty of evidence to support what Varadkar is saying, and the Atlantic\u2019s Tom McTague came up with a new anecdote last week which supports the claim that the cabinet underestimated Ireland. In an article about how the UK could emulate Canada after Brexit, he says: In Britain\u2019s negotiations with Ireland over Brexit, some senior politicians in London were dismissive of the effectiveness of Irish diplomacy. One cabinet minister, who asked for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations, told me that Ireland was a small country, which meant that the quality of its ministers could not match that of those in the UK. And yet this attitude proved part of London\u2019s undoing in the negotiations, which saw Ireland win more of its objectives than Britain did. Varadkar said he did not know if Brexit would increase the chances of Ireland reuniting. He said he thought it would be \u201cpossible\u201d but \u201cdifficult\u201d to conclude a UK-EU trade deal before the end of this year. He said Johnson had personally assured him that he did not want the UK to undercut EU standards after Brexit. He said: I think the area where it\u2019s going to become tricky is this whole idea of a level playing field. Because there\u2019s a genuine concern across the European Union that part of the motivation behind Brexit was for the UK to undercut us in terms of environmental standards, labour standards, product standards, food standards, all of those things. Now when I meet Prime Minister Johnson he says: \u2018No, absolutely not. That\u2019s not the kind of United Kingdom that I want or need as prime minister.\u2019 But we want that written down in law. We want that in a treaty so that we know that the UK will not be undercutting the EU with lower standards. Varadakar insisted that there would be a need for some checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland after Brexit. Johnson has repeatedly played down the need for these checks, telling a news conference in Belfast recently that these checks would only apply in the absence of a zero-tariff, zero-quota trade deal. But Varadkar said: Goods coming into Northern Ireland, which may come across the border into the European Union, Ireland, the single market \u2013 then there will be checks required at ports and airports in Northern Ireland. But it is absolutely our wish and our desire that they should be minimised. This week Boris Johnson is due to take a decision on whether or not to allow the Chinese firm Huawei to play a part in constructing the UK\u2019s 5G network. He is expected to say it should be allowed to play a role, subject to certain conditions. On the Today programme this morning Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary and Johnson\u2019s main rival in the Tory leadership contest last summer, said that when he was in government he was sceptical about allowing Huawei to take on this role. He explained: I must admit I always wondered whether it was wise to allow ourselves to become technologically dependent on another country, whichever country, for something as critical as 5G technology. That is my view, but I would say if the decision goes the other way this week, as some of the signs seem to indicate it might, I hope there will also be some reflection in the US because we have never needed the western alliance to be stronger than now. Hunt also said that, even if the intelligences services thought they could contain any risk, he was worried about how the situation might develop in the future. He said: I do accept the word of our intelligence community that they are pretty good at protecting our core national infrastructure. But I think the issue is what happens if we get to the situation where no western companies that are really able to compete with Huawei going forward and, like it or not, in a decade\u2019s time people will look back and say: \u2018Was this really wise to take this decision in 2020 that has led to this dependency?\u2019 According to the Financial Times, Johnson is expected to say that Huawei can play a role in building the 5G network, subject to a market cap. In their story (paywall) George Parker and Nic Fildes say: The NSC [national security council] will be asked to consider two options: the total ban on Huawei demanded by Mr Trump; or a ban on the company providing \u201ccore\u201d services, coupled with a limit on market share. Non-core equipment refers to the antennas and base stations that sit on masts and rooftops, which are considered less vulnerable than the core servers and systems where customer information is processed. Telecoms companies have been bracing for months for the introduction of a limit to how much Huawei equipment can be used in a city or region. Mobile phone companies typically source equipment from more than one vendor but build the network in clusters. That means a single city, such as Manchester, may be dominated by Huawei radio equipment if all the mobile networks \u2013 Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three \u2013 use Huawei in that region. The push to impose a market share threshold \u2013 considered by Theresa May\u2019s government last year \u2013 would require networks to swap out equipment in exchange for Ericsson, Nokia or Samsung kit. That would add cost for the industry rolling out 5G but would be less of a setback than a total ban on using Huawei. As the Guardian reports, yesterday Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, claimed that choosing Huawei would amount to a threat to UK sovereignty. Good morning. At the end of this week the UK will leave the European Union. But if Boris Johnson thinks that this will amount to getting Brexit done, he\u2019s wrong, according to his Irish opposite number, Leo Varadkar. \u201cWe\u2019re only at halftime on Brexit. It\u2019s not done yet,\u201d he told the BBC, in an interview with its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. In the interview Varadkar more or less explicitly said that if the UK wanted British banks to be able to continue to have access to the EU financial services market after Brexit, it was going to have to let EU boats continue to fish in British waters. Asked if the proposed UK-EU trade deal would end up being limited or piecemeal, Varadkar, who is of course in the middle of a general election campaign, replied: I think we\u2019ll have to be comprehensive. You could have a bare bones interim agreement, but whatever final future economic partnership we come up with, I think it will have to be quite detailed. Because what happens in these things is trade-offs. For example, the United Kingdom has a very strong position on fisheries. The UK has a lot of waters, and a lot of fish is taken out of your waters by boats from other countries, but bear in mind 70% of the fish you sell, you sell into Europe. So unless British people are going to start eating an awful lot more fish, you have a problem there. But that\u2019s an area where you\u2019re in a strong position. An area where you\u2019re in a very weak position is one of the most valuable parts of the British economy which is financial services. It\u2019s such a crucial part of the of the British economy. And areas like the entertainment industry. And if financial services and entertainment, audio visual, are cut off from the single market, the European market, that will be a very severe blow to the British economy and the south-east, in particular in London. So, you know, you may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services, and that\u2019s why things tend to be all in the one package. This has always been implicit in the EU negotiating position, but generally EU leaders have not up to now been as blunt as this in saying: \u201cLet us keep fishing in your waters, or your banks will take a hit.\u201d There is a lot more in the BBC interview, and I will post further extracts soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.45am: Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, meets Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, in Dublin. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Therese Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3pm: Barnier meets ministers from the Northern Ireland executive in Belfast. 5.30pm: Barnier gives a speech at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

The research \u2013 conducted by the playwright Jennifer Tuckett and the Sphinx Theatre Company \u2013 paints a bleak picture of British theatre, with a bigger gender gap in certain areas compared with eight years ago, when the Guardian conducted an in-depth study of the issue. The research in 2012 \u2013 in collaboration with Elizabeth Freestone, then artistic director of Pentabus theatre \u2013 revealed that women were vastly underrepresented, with a persistent 2:1 male-to-female ratio in British theatre roles. Tuckett\u2019s latest research has found that in some cases the situation has worsened \u2013 for instance, only 31% of artistic directors are women, compared with 36% in the 2012 study. The authors of the report, which looked at gender representation at all UK theatres that are classified by ACE as a national portfolio organisation (NPO) \u2013 say it shows theatre is lagging behind other art forms, after ACE recently released figures revealing 46% of artistic directors across NPO institutions were female. The study, inspired by the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, was conducted by Tuckett and a team of researchers who looked at the output of British theatres across their 2018-19 programmes.

As two of the best-funded institutions in the UK, the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company were singled out in the report. The RSC featured no productions by female writers between December 2018 and September 2019, while 25% of the National\u2019s plays were written by women from November 2018 to April 2019. The 2012 research found 29% of new plays at the RSC were written by women, while 18% of plays at the National were by female playwrights. Awards were another area of concern, with no new writing prizes awarded to female playwrights in 2018-19 at either the WhatsOnStage awards or the Olivier awards. The report follows research by Loughborough University that found theatre criticism was another area dominated by men, with 10% of critics being female in 2017. The same study found that only 27% of university professors teaching theatre and drama were women. Polly Kemp, the actor and founder of gender equality campaign group Era 50:50, said the research supported anecdotal accounts from female actors and directors, who have experienced sexism in UK theatre. \u201cThere\u2019s still a sense that you\u2019re taking a risk when you go with a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re even still talking about it in 2020 should be shocking, but as an actor who is campaigning for increased representation, it doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d The research comes in the same week that ACE published its 10-year strategic plan for the arts, which identified the \u201cpersistent and widespread lack of diversity across the creative industries and in publicly funded cultural organisations\u201d as a key issue that needed to be addressed. Sue Parrish, artistic director of Sphinx Theatre Company, said she was stunned by ACE\u2019s lack of focus on gender in its strategy document. \u201cDespite our efforts and reassurances that representation was being taken seriously, it clearly is not,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not listed in priorities or outcomes at all, there\u2019s no separate reference made to 51% of the population.

Winsome Pinnock, a black British female playwright, said the lack of progress with artistic directors was significant because women in these roles, including Jules Wright \u2013 the late founder of the Women\u2019s Playhouse Trust in 1984 \u2013 have been instrumental in her progress. \u201cI\u2019ve been supported all my career, predominantly by women artistic directors,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not have a career if Jules Wright had not supported my work.

It\u2019s the 1980s, and the O\u2019Haras are leaving their suburban American setting to live in the UK, where father Rory (Jude Law) was born. His American wife Alison (Carrie Coon) is unsure, having moved four times in the past 10 years, but he\u2019s convinced there are financial opportunities they simply can\u2019t afford to turn down.

He\u2019s hungry and wants to give his family more, even if they might already have enough. His background was one of limited means and so his idea of happiness is somewhat skewed, forever trying to play the part of a man he never thought he could become, tirelessly constructing an extravagant self-image to mask his working-class origins. But it means he\u2019s often blinded to what his family really needs, and so as he pushes them further and further into a financial bracket they cannot easily sustain, cracks start to appear.</p> <p>There\u2019s a deftly controlled interplay between a man who wants to be in control in a traditional sense and a quietly strong-willed wife who wants to allow him this but fears for the price his reckless decision-making might have on their family. Alison is constantly told she doesn\u2019t need to concern herself with the bigger picture (\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to worry,\u201d Rory tells her at one point) but she\u2019s smart enough to know something is awry. The ridiculously ostentatious house they live in, the hunt for a Mayfair apartment, talk of a condo in the Algarve \u2013 it\u2019s all, embarrassingly, obviously too much. Watching Alison gain the strength to challenge Rory, sometimes in darkly amusing ways, gives the film some of its most dramatically juicy moments but the film avoids feeding us the more predictably telegraphed conflict we might expect from the set-up.</p> <p>Because The Nest is a slow burn, requiring extreme, dedicated patience even from those familiar with Durkin\u2019s last film.

Law is an actor known for his magnetic charm, but it\u2019s always more compelling to watch it backgrounded by a certain darkness, and this is him at his best, playing a man who starts to question the bullshit he\u2019s lived by for so long. Coon, an actor who typically finds a way of stealing whatever film she\u2019s in no matter how small the role, is also on top form, gently crumbling while also finding herself as a woman.

Not only did they allow it to happen but they enforced it and encouraged regular people to become killers,\u201d said Benjamin Lesser, a 92-year-old Polish-born Jew whose family was sent to Auschwitz in 1944. More than 1.1 million people were murdered at the camp, most of them Jews.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have returned so that I don\u2019t forget any of the details of what happened to me, so I can keep the memories alive, and stop the world from acquiring amnesia,\u201d he added, emphasising widespread concern over the rise in antisemitic attacks, in particular in Europe and North America.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"637d8d45-855a-4f7b-b459-d36a9ff53af0\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Auschwitz concentration camp complex in south-west Poland was the site of the largest mass murder in a single location in human history. While precise numbers are still debated, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/liberation-of-auschwitz\">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1-1.3 million Jews deported to the camp. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp.</p>\n    <p>When the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945, Soviet troops found grisly evidence of the horror. About 7,000 starving prisoners were found alive, and millions of items of clothing that once belonged to men, women and children were discovered along with 6,350kg of human hair.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In January 1942, the Nazi party had decided to roll out the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d. Camps dedicated solely to the extermination of Jews had been created before, but this was formalised by SS Lieut-Gen Reinhard Heydrich in a speech at the Wannsee conference. The extermination camp Auschwitz II was opened in the same year.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz II had the largest prisoner population of any of the three main camps on the site. In January 1942, the first chamber using lethal Zyklon B gas was built. Four further chambers were built, and these were used for systematic genocide up until November 1944.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz was also the site of disturbing medical experimentation on Jewish and Roma prisoners, including practices such as castration and sterilisation. SS captain Dr Josef Mengele was one of the physicians practising there.</p>\n    <p>More than 7,000 Nazi personnel are thought to have served at Auschwitz but only a few hundred have been prosecuted for the crimes committed there. The pursuit of justice has not ceased, with German justice officials saying in 2013 that there were 30 surviving Auschwitz officials who should face prosecution.

A spokesperson for the company has claimed that: \u201cMany millennials are seeking ways to soothe the everyday stresses of life.\u201d</p> <p>I am one of these millennials, and I can safely say that I am far more likely to be cradling an old-fashioned hot drink before bed than chugging back an old-fashioned cocktail. From herbal teas to pillow sprays, non-medical sleep aids are ubiquitous in the modern era. But does a hot drink before bed actually work to aid sleep?</p> <p>Yes, says the sleep expert Neil Stanley. \u201cThey\u2019re a wind-down in a mug,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the drink. You\u2019ve got to wait for it to cool down. Nobody\u2019s ever hoovered or argued with their partner while drinking Horlicks.\u201d Crucially, though, he points out that it is the calming associations and routine provided by the drink, rather than any \u201cmagic ingredient\u201d, that does the job.</p> <p>How about teas that claim to specifically aid nocturnal relaxation, from Clipper\u2019s <a href=\"https://shop.clipper-teas.com/products/clipper-organic-sleep-easy-20-bag\" title=\"\">Sleep Easy infusion</a> to Celestial Seasonings\u2019 <a href=\"http://www.celestialseasonings.com/products/herbal/sleepytime-classic\" title=\"\">Sleepytime</a> blend? \u201cWe know that valerian is good for sleep and that\u2019s in some of the teas. But whether it\u2019s in the teas in any decent amount ...\u201d He sounds sceptical.</p> <p>According to Emilie Holmes, the founder of the loose-leaf tea company <a href=\"https://www.goodandpropertea.com/\" title=\"\">Good &amp; Proper Tea</a>, it doesn\u2019t really matter if it is a placebo or not. It is all part of the dysfunctional attitude common in the wellness age that if things feel healthy, then they are healthy. Or, as she puts it, \u201cWe might be really busy and doing all the wrong things in some ways \u2013 but we are drinking really good teas.\u201d</p> <p>Stanley notes that it may be our obsession with getting enough sleep that is driving us to the mugs of milky drinks in the first place. \u201cWorrying about sleep is probably the biggest cause of not sleeping,\u201d he says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shock news: millennials are capable of consuming things other than avocados. People in this age group are allegedly boosting sales of the traditional hot milky drink Horlicks. A spokesperson for the company has claimed that: \u201cMany millennials are seeking ways to soothe the everyday stresses of life.\u201d I am one of these millennials, and I can safely say that I am far more likely to be cradling an old-fashioned hot drink before bed than chugging back an old-fashioned cocktail. From herbal teas to pillow sprays, non-medical sleep aids are ubiquitous in the modern era. But does a hot drink before bed actually work to aid sleep? Yes, says the sleep expert Neil Stanley. \u201cThey\u2019re a wind-down in a mug,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make the drink. You\u2019ve got to wait for it to cool down. Nobody\u2019s ever hoovered or argued with their partner while drinking Horlicks.\u201d Crucially, though, he points out that it is the calming associations and routine provided by the drink, rather than any \u201cmagic ingredient\u201d, that does the job. How about teas that claim to specifically aid nocturnal relaxation, from Clipper\u2019s Sleep Easy infusion to Celestial Seasonings\u2019 Sleepytime blend? \u201cWe know that valerian is good for sleep and that\u2019s in some of the teas. But whether it\u2019s in the teas in any decent amount ...\u201d He sounds sceptical. According to Emilie Holmes, the founder of the loose-leaf tea company Good &amp; Proper Tea, it doesn\u2019t really matter if it is a placebo or not. It is all part of the dysfunctional attitude common in the wellness age that if things feel healthy, then they are healthy. Or, as she puts it, \u201cWe might be really busy and doing all the wrong things in some ways \u2013 but we are drinking really good teas.\u201d Stanley notes that it may be our obsession with getting enough sleep that is driving us to the mugs of milky drinks in the first place. \u201cWorrying about sleep is probably the biggest cause of not sleeping,\u201d he says.",

The prime minister said he would unveil a compromise plan to restrict the Chinese company\u2019s role in 5G, although it has to be accepted by senior cabinet ministers at a crunch meeting of the national security council (NSC) on Tuesday. Priti Patel, the home secretary, heads the sceptical ministers, whose numbers are also said to include Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, but others in Westminster say they are mounting \u201ca rearguard action\u201d that will ultimately make little difference. On the eve of one of his government\u2019s first major decisions since his election win, Johnson said that the \u201cway forward\u201d was to have a system that \u201cdelivers for people in this country the kind of consumer benefits that they want through 5G technology\u201d. But the prime minster added that it \u201cdoes not in any way compromise our critical national infrastructure, our security, or jeopardise our ability to work together with other intelligence powers around the world\u201d. The expectation is that the UK will allow Huawei to supply 5G equipment, which phone companies Vodafone and BT say is more advanced and cheaper than its rivals \u2013 but with a string of restrictions aimed at placating Washington. Sources believe that Huawei will be designated a high-risk vendor and subject to a series of controls such as a market share cap and a ban on supplying 5G technology to sensitive parts of the public sector and strategically important sectors. But an emergency Commons debate highlighted the scale of unhappiness amongst Conservative ranks, following an urgent question from the Conservative backbencher Tom Tugendhat. He told MPs that allowing Huawei to supply 5G technology would \u201cnest a dragon\u201d in the heart of the UK\u2019s \u201ccritical national infrastructure\u201d. Several senior Conservatives joined in, including former minister Owen Paterson, and Julian Lewis, a former chairman of the defence select committee.

      "body": "<h2>Jim Peterik, former keyboardist</h2> <p>Survivor had released two albums, neither of which had done particularly well, and we were worried our label was going to drop us. One day I came home, pressed play on the answering machine and I heard: \u201cYo Jim, give me a call, it\u2019s Sylvester Stallone.\u201d I went: \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p> <p>Stallone had said to his friend Tony Scotti [co-founder of Scotti Brothers Records] \u201cI\u2019m looking for a new sound for my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcjvKVfG1sQ\">Rocky III</a> movie\u201d and Tony had played him a couple of our songs. So I\u2019m talking to Stallone on the telephone. He said: \u201cI want something for the kids. Something street, something with a pulse. Can you help me out?\u201d I told him: \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity like this since I started my career in music.\u201d</p> <p>The next day Frankie Sullivan, our guitarist, came over and a FedEx arrived with a giant Betamax video cassette on which was a rough cut of the first three minutes of the movie. Man, the energy of it \u2013 with Mr T rising up and Rocky getting soft and doing commercials. But there was music on there already. BOMP, BOMP, BOMP \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/26/queen-freddie-mercury-50-uk-singles-ranked\">Another One Bites the Dust by Queen</a>! Stallone couldn\u2019t get the publishing rights. I said: \u201cFrankie, we got our work cut out for us. Because Another One Bites the Dust is fucking perfect.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPJPFnesV4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/btPJPFnesV4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btPJPFnesV4\">Watch the video for Eye of the Tiger</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It was a few days later in the car when I came up with the riff and the idea of timing the chord changes with the punches. Frankie got the ball rolling with the lyrics: \u201cBack on the street, doing time, taking chances.\u201d But we had to call Stallone and say: \u201cYou gotta send us the whole movie because we can\u2019t get any further with the story.\u201d Then we heard that phrase when Apollo says: \u201cYou had that eye of the tiger, man, the edge \u2026. You gotta get it back.\u201d That had to be the hook.</p> <p>We went out to Hollywood for the premiere and were on the red carpet with celebrities. But I only really got how big the film was about a month later, when I snuck into my local theatre in Illinois, and the place was packed. People were clapping and standing up, cheering.</p> <p>The Grammy is still sitting on my recording console. The money doesn\u2019t suck, but the best royalty is that I\u2019ll be in the supermarket and meet random people who tell me the song has affected their lives in a positive way. It\u2019s helped people through cancer or a heart attack. I know people that have been on the operating table and asked to have Eye of the Tiger playing. That\u2019s the real shit.</p> <h2>Frankie Sullivan, guitarist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"527b0dd3d93f8e3483763ea697ca6fe24fee7801\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/527b0dd3d93f8e3483763ea697ca6fe24fee7801/0_0_5332_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I played it on a glued-together guitar\u2019 \u2026 from left, Stephan Ellis, Jim Peterik, Dave Bickler, Mark Droubay, Frankie Sullivan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I played it on a glued-together guitar\u2019 \u2026 from left, Stephan Ellis, Jim Peterik, Dave Bickler, Mark Droubay, Frankie Sullivan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GAB Archive/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We sent Sly the song and didn\u2019t hear back from him for a while and were wondering what was going on. I\u2019m friends with his brother Frank, and so I asked him. He said: \u201cI was up at Sly\u2019s last night, he was banging and slamming his head to it so much he was sweating.\u201d I thought: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p> <p>Fast forward and we were about to go out to Hollywood to put the music to the film, and Jim got sick with pneumonia. So I ended up on my own, 23 years old, at the soundstage at Warner Brothers. After two days Sly said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have balls. I don\u2019t care what the hell you do, I want it to kick ass.\u201d</p> <p>All I did was push the faders up a single decibel and, boom, you could feel the difference. It was kicking and he loved it. He said: \u201cPrint it!\u201d I told him: \u201cBut that\u2019s the demo!\u201d Sly said: \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck what it is.\u201d That\u2019s his attitude. He\u2019s a really cool guy.</p> <p>A week after the film came out I was driving on the freeway and I heard it on the radio. I switched over and I heard it on another station. I switched again and heard it on a third station, and then I pulled over because it was one of those moments I never wanted to forget.

      "bodyText": "Jim Peterik, former keyboardist Survivor had released two albums, neither of which had done particularly well, and we were worried our label was going to drop us. One day I came home, pressed play on the answering machine and I heard: \u201cYo Jim, give me a call, it\u2019s Sylvester Stallone.\u201d I went: \u201cYeah, right.\u201d Stallone had said to his friend Tony Scotti [co-founder of Scotti Brothers Records] \u201cI\u2019m looking for a new sound for my Rocky III movie\u201d and Tony had played him a couple of our songs. So I\u2019m talking to Stallone on the telephone. He said: \u201cI want something for the kids. Something street, something with a pulse. Can you help me out?\u201d I told him: \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity like this since I started my career in music.\u201d The next day Frankie Sullivan, our guitarist, came over and a FedEx arrived with a giant Betamax video cassette on which was a rough cut of the first three minutes of the movie. Man, the energy of it \u2013 with Mr T rising up and Rocky getting soft and doing commercials. But there was music on there already. BOMP, BOMP, BOMP \u2013 Another One Bites the Dust by Queen! Stallone couldn\u2019t get the publishing rights. I said: \u201cFrankie, we got our work cut out for us. Because Another One Bites the Dust is fucking perfect.\u201d It was a few days later in the car when I came up with the riff and the idea of timing the chord changes with the punches. Frankie got the ball rolling with the lyrics: \u201cBack on the street, doing time, taking chances.\u201d But we had to call Stallone and say: \u201cYou gotta send us the whole movie because we can\u2019t get any further with the story.\u201d Then we heard that phrase when Apollo says: \u201cYou had that eye of the tiger, man, the edge \u2026. You gotta get it back.\u201d That had to be the hook. We went out to Hollywood for the premiere and were on the red carpet with celebrities. But I only really got how big the film was about a month later, when I snuck into my local theatre in Illinois, and the place was packed. People were clapping and standing up, cheering. The Grammy is still sitting on my recording console. The money doesn\u2019t suck, but the best royalty is that I\u2019ll be in the supermarket and meet random people who tell me the song has affected their lives in a positive way. It\u2019s helped people through cancer or a heart attack. I know people that have been on the operating table and asked to have Eye of the Tiger playing. That\u2019s the real shit. Frankie Sullivan, guitarist We sent Sly the song and didn\u2019t hear back from him for a while and were wondering what was going on. I\u2019m friends with his brother Frank, and so I asked him. He said: \u201cI was up at Sly\u2019s last night, he was banging and slamming his head to it so much he was sweating.\u201d I thought: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d Fast forward and we were about to go out to Hollywood to put the music to the film, and Jim got sick with pneumonia. So I ended up on my own, 23 years old, at the soundstage at Warner Brothers. After two days Sly said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have balls. I don\u2019t care what the hell you do, I want it to kick ass.\u201d All I did was push the faders up a single decibel and, boom, you could feel the difference. It was kicking and he loved it. He said: \u201cPrint it!\u201d I told him: \u201cBut that\u2019s the demo!\u201d Sly said: \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck what it is.\u201d That\u2019s his attitude. He\u2019s a really cool guy. A week after the film came out I was driving on the freeway and I heard it on the radio. I switched over and I heard it on another station. I switched again and heard it on a third station, and then I pulled over because it was one of those moments I never wanted to forget. Did we know it was going to go to No 1 in the US for six weeks, and to No 1 in 29 other countries? No, course not, but I felt in my gut that people were going to relate to the song because it\u2019s about getting your ass out of bed. It\u2019s about saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to go to the gym Monday \u2013 I am going to go to the gym Monday.\u201d When we were writing Tiger, I was living with a friend, renting a room for $150 a month and he was waiving the rent half the time.

      "body": "<p>Gary Lineker is surprisingly cheerful in his kitchen. He has even made us chicken soup for lunch which, on a midwinter afternoon, is as tasty as it is comforting. The world outside might be reeling but here, in the affluent enclave of Barnes, it is easier to feel sanguine. As the BBC\u2019s highest-paid presenter, Lineker is seemingly insulated from the world\u2019s miseries and woes. Yet he is also one of the most politically outspoken and compassionate people in British sport and, as a waspish critic of Brexit, he is entitled to feel gloomy that the UK will leave the European Union on Friday.</p> \n<p>Instead, he is resigned to a reality he has argued against for four years. \u201cI find it difficult to comprehend,\u201d Lineker says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a done deal, so get on with it now. I don\u2019t tweet about it any more.

Britain has become even more insular but he is still in thrall to a worldly game. It hardly matters that J\u00fcrgen Klopp is German, or Pep Guardiola is from Catalonia, as Lineker celebrates the \u201cunprecedented\u201d football played by Liverpool and Manchester City in the last few years. Football, for all its ills, looks much less parochial than British politics and so it seems appropriate, this week, to ask Lineker more about Brexit.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy disappointment is not even with the result,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought the referendum was fair at first and accepted it \u2013 even as a Remainer. It was more when we became aware of the lies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/18/boris-johnson-350-million-claim-bogus-foreign-secretary\" title=\"\">the \u00a3350m</a> [which the Leave campaign claimed the UK paid every week to the EU], or various things about sovereignty, were a complete nonsense. But it was too negative a campaign from Remain. Really good EU policies on the environment, workers\u2019 rights and freedom of movement were not highlighted. So much venom and division\u2019s come out of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In his new acceptance of Brexit, can he now see any advantages in leaving the EU? \u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be. I haven\u2019t seen any yet. We might become a unified nation and throw the flag around.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lineker offers a weary smile which is soon replaced by sheer pleasure as he turns to the game he loves. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing football that\u2019s unprecedented for a variety of reasons but, obviously, there\u2019s the influence of Pep and of Klopp. They\u2019re contrasting, but they\u2019re both exhilarating. They are certainly in the top five coaches, perhaps even the top two, in world football. Their different styles add to the rivalry. I love them both but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/23/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-champions-league-roma-mo-salah-brexit\" title=\"\">Klopp\u2019s probably more engaging</a>. You can see Pep\u2019s pretty intense in his post-match interviews. He\u2019s hard work whereas Klopp can always put it on. I guess we\u2019ve seen Pep\u2019s dark side.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut what Guardiola\u2019s done is special. He was a very <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/07/pep-guardiola-exclusive-interview-johan-cruyff-unique\" title=\"\">young coach at Barcelona</a> but he still transformed their players. Obviously they played a system based on Cruyff \u2013 which both Pep and I played under at Bar\u00e7a. That\u2019s to make the pitch as big as you can when you\u2019ve got the ball, and then shrink it when you haven\u2019t. Klopp introduced his own style \u2013 this dynamic high-octane pressing game. It\u2019s generated fitness and mental belief within his players. What Klopp did at Dortmund was remarkable and what he\u2019s built at Liverpool is even better.

But did we think he was this good? Henderson was there and everyone goes: \u2018Nah. He\u2019s nothing special.\u2019 Everybody had a go at him. Now people are realising this kid\u2019s a bloody good football player and a real leader. We all knew Van Djik was good but he came from Celtic and Southampton. Wijnaldum came from Newcastle.

Sometimes I think Klopp, sometimes Guardiola. They both improve players but I\u2019d be more suited to Man City. At Liverpool the front three drop a lot into midfield and that was not my great strength. I was more the side-on striker who likes to spin behind. More like Ag\u00fcero. I\u2019d score a hell of a lot of goals for City. But I would\u2019ve adapted to Liverpool. I always think holding the ball up was difficult, but I remind myself the pitches we played on were shit.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m envious about now. The playing surfaces today are like billiard tables. When I played, once you got past August it started cutting up. Then it got heavy. It got frosty. Then when it dried, you got bouncy. The pitches were more testing than the opposition sometimes. You get balls rattled into you, and it\u2019s bouncing all over the place. Now it\u2019s \u2018boom-boom-boom\u2019. It\u2019s made the game so much better.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou also can\u2019t just kick people any more. Imagine Messi in the 80s. Like Maradona they\u2019d be whacking him down. One of the things I love about Messi is he never play-acts and he always tries desperately to stay on his feet. But if he\u2019d played in the 80s, when basically you had to commit GBH to get sent off, it would have been harder. But there\u2019ve been a lot of changes in football. The grounds are better \u2013 modern and beautiful. And it\u2019s still loved.

Man City also. Their numbers in a competitive league tell you that. The game evolves and so, if you put my team from 1990 against a modern team, we\u2019d get murdered.

I went to see the Ifab [International Football Association Board] a few weeks ago. They were very affable and wanted my views. I said the dot thing has to go. As soon as the blue dots come out you\u2019re in trouble. None of us know exactly where the dots start \u2013 and it\u2019s not a clear and obvious error. So go with the on-field decision.</p> \n<p>\u201cI told them what I think VAR should be. The referee on the pitch needs a mate sitting with all these monitors. He\u2019s watching the game and he lets it go, lets it go, and then he says: \u2018Mate, you absolutely fucked up there. You\u2019ve got to change that otherwise you\u2019re going to look a complete dick.\u2019 That stops the Maradona/Thierry Henry handballs. The absolute howler. That\u2019s all you need VAR for.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ab249e288556a67ca5ff396cc157a01469a9e4a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ab249e288556a67ca5ff396cc157a01469a9e4a/3_326_2031_1218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"VAR should be used for incidents such as Thierry Henry\u2019s handball for France against Republic of Ireland, says Lineker, but not borderline calls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">VAR should be used for incidents such as Thierry Henry\u2019s handball for France against Republic of Ireland, says Lineker, but not borderline calls.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky News/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unlike Peter Shilton, whom I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/15/peter-shilton-respect-diego-maradona-england-hand-of-god\" title=\"\">interviewed recently</a>, Lineker is admirably philosophical about Maradona\u2019s Hand of God goal from the 1986 World Cup. \u201cThe Diego thing doesn\u2019t bother me. Never has. He got away with it. I would never think of doing it but some Argentinian footballers grew up in the roughest conditions. They were ready to do anything to win.\u201d</p> \n<p>I was contacted by a few people in Argentina who, after reading the Shilton interview, pointed out that if there had been VAR then Steve Hodge would have been sent off first for elbowing Maradona in the face. \u201cYeah. And Diego\u2019s [second] miracle goal wouldn\u2019t have been allowed because Glenn Hoddle was hacked down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lineker laughs. \u201cAnyway, if we\u2019d had VAR it would have been 1-0 to us and I scored the winner. Happy days.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is 30 years this summer since Italia 90 when Lineker and England were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jul/15/sport.comment8\" title=\"\">knocked out of the World Cup semi-finals by Germany</a>. \u201cI look back with a mixture of joy, because we were such a good side, and a feeling we didn\u2019t do ourselves justice. We didn\u2019t always play well. Cameroon were brilliant in the quarters. They outplayed us most of the game but Shilts made three world-class saves. I scored the two penalties and we won. Then Germany. I only watched it back a couple of years ago. I didn\u2019t realise we were that good.

Post-Hillsborough, post-Heysel, post-awful 80s hooliganism, it wasn\u2019t just a working class sport anymore. It was the national sport for everybody. Women and the middle classes became interested. The reaction after 1986 was extraordinary but 1990 \u2013 my God.\u201d</p> \n<p>That tournament propelled Lineker towards his role at the BBC \u2013 which is again beset by problems. \u201cThe BBC is something that I am genuinely passionate about,\u201d Lineker says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with them for 25 years. And I think it\u2019s something we should be proud of in this country.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for the BBC,\u201d he admits. \u201cThey are the standard bearer and balance is difficult. Both the right wing and the left wing complain like mad that the BBC are biased. The truth is the BBC is full of thousands of people with varying political views. To say the BBC is fundamentally leftist, or fundamentally rightist, is wrong. It\u2019s been a difficult time because of Brexit and people have been very tribal. But the BBC is unbelievably respected around the world.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe licence fee is our fundamental problem. You\u2019re forced to pay it if you want a TV, and therefore it\u2019s a tax. The public pay our salaries, so everyone is a target. I would make the licence fee voluntary. I\u2019ve always said for a long time, I would make it voluntary. I don\u2019t know the logistics of how it would work. You would lose some people, but at the same time you\u2019d up the price a bit. It\u2019s the price of a cup of coffee a week at the moment.

For all the grief I occasionally get on Twitter, people are a lot kinder face to face. I\u2019ve only had one incident. About two years ago I was getting the train at Euston to Manchester. I got shoved in the back. I turned around and it was a little old lady. She\u2019s going: \u2018You let her in?\u2019 I think she was talking about the girl who came back from Isis \u2013 which I made no comment on. She said: \u2018You let her in, have her in your house. Effing this, effing that.\u2019 She was on her way to a Tommy Robinson rally outside the BBC. But people are usually incredibly warm.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Lineker stretches out on his sofa for a photo in his front room, I remind him he will turn 60 this year.</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says wryly, \u201cbut it\u2019s just a number. I\u2019m still in good shape. Seventy is the one to worry about. I would love another 10 years of working like this and having a good time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gary Lineker is surprisingly cheerful in his kitchen. He has even made us chicken soup for lunch which, on a midwinter afternoon, is as tasty as it is comforting. The world outside might be reeling but here, in the affluent enclave of Barnes, it is easier to feel sanguine. As the BBC\u2019s highest-paid presenter, Lineker is seemingly insulated from the world\u2019s miseries and woes. Yet he is also one of the most politically outspoken and compassionate people in British sport and, as a waspish critic of Brexit, he is entitled to feel gloomy that the UK will leave the European Union on Friday. Instead, he is resigned to a reality he has argued against for four years. \u201cI find it difficult to comprehend,\u201d Lineker says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a done deal, so get on with it now. I don\u2019t tweet about it any more. Some people keep going on about it \u2013 but I\u2019m not going to bother saying: \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201d Football is a consolation and, for the next 80 minutes, Lineker is engaging company. Britain has become even more insular but he is still in thrall to a worldly game. It hardly matters that J\u00fcrgen Klopp is German, or Pep Guardiola is from Catalonia, as Lineker celebrates the \u201cunprecedented\u201d football played by Liverpool and Manchester City in the last few years. Football, for all its ills, looks much less parochial than British politics and so it seems appropriate, this week, to ask Lineker more about Brexit. \u201cMy disappointment is not even with the result,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought the referendum was fair at first and accepted it \u2013 even as a Remainer. It was more when we became aware of the lies \u2013 the \u00a3350m [which the Leave campaign claimed the UK paid every week to the EU], or various things about sovereignty, were a complete nonsense. But it was too negative a campaign from Remain. Really good EU policies on the environment, workers\u2019 rights and freedom of movement were not highlighted. So much venom and division\u2019s come out of it.\u201d In his new acceptance of Brexit, can he now see any advantages in leaving the EU? \u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be. I haven\u2019t seen any yet. We might become a unified nation and throw the flag around.\u201d Lineker offers a weary smile which is soon replaced by sheer pleasure as he turns to the game he loves. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing football that\u2019s unprecedented for a variety of reasons but, obviously, there\u2019s the influence of Pep and of Klopp. They\u2019re contrasting, but they\u2019re both exhilarating. They are certainly in the top five coaches, perhaps even the top two, in world football. Their different styles add to the rivalry. I love them both but Klopp\u2019s probably more engaging.

I guess we\u2019ve seen Pep\u2019s dark side. \u201cBut what Guardiola\u2019s done is special. He was a very young coach at Barcelona but he still transformed their players. Obviously they played a system based on Cruyff \u2013 which both Pep and I played under at Bar\u00e7a. That\u2019s to make the pitch as big as you can when you\u2019ve got the ball, and then shrink it when you haven\u2019t. Klopp introduced his own style \u2013 this dynamic high-octane pressing game. It\u2019s generated fitness and mental belief within his players. What Klopp did at Dortmund was remarkable and what he\u2019s built at Liverpool is even better.

The playing surfaces today are like billiard tables. When I played, once you got past August it started cutting up. Then it got heavy. It got frosty. Then when it dried, you got bouncy. The pitches were more testing than the opposition sometimes. You get balls rattled into you, and it\u2019s bouncing all over the place. Now it\u2019s \u2018boom-boom-boom\u2019. It\u2019s made the game so much better. \u201cYou also can\u2019t just kick people any more. Imagine Messi in the 80s. Like Maradona they\u2019d be whacking him down. One of the things I love about Messi is he never play-acts and he always tries desperately to stay on his feet. But if he\u2019d played in the 80s, when basically you had to commit GBH to get sent off, it would have been harder. But there\u2019ve been a lot of changes in football. The grounds are better \u2013 modern and beautiful. And it\u2019s still loved. While there\u2019s always a dark side to football, it\u2019s better placed than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d Is Klopp\u2019s current Liverpool side among the best teams he has seen? \u201cUnquestionably. Man City also. Their numbers in a competitive league tell you that. The game evolves and so, if you put my team from 1990 against a modern team, we\u2019d get murdered. But if we had time to adapt, the best players then would still be among the best now.\u201d This season the introduction of VAR has been less successful. \u201cIt was always going to have teething problems,\u201d Lineker says. \u201cBut they\u2019re hamstrung by the laws \u2013 and the offside law really annoys me. I went to see the Ifab [International Football Association Board] a few weeks ago. They were very affable and wanted my views. I said the dot thing has to go. As soon as the blue dots come out you\u2019re in trouble. None of us know exactly where the dots start \u2013 and it\u2019s not a clear and obvious error. So go with the on-field decision. \u201cI told them what I think VAR should be. The referee on the pitch needs a mate sitting with all these monitors. He\u2019s watching the game and he lets it go, lets it go, and then he says: \u2018Mate, you absolutely fucked up there. You\u2019ve got to change that otherwise you\u2019re going to look a complete dick.\u2019 That stops the Maradona/Thierry Henry handballs. The absolute howler. That\u2019s all you need VAR for.\u201d Unlike Peter Shilton, whom I interviewed recently, Lineker is admirably philosophical about Maradona\u2019s Hand of God goal from the 1986 World Cup. \u201cThe Diego thing doesn\u2019t bother me. Never has. He got away with it. I would never think of doing it but some Argentinian footballers grew up in the roughest conditions. They were ready to do anything to win.\u201d I was contacted by a few people in Argentina who, after reading the Shilton interview, pointed out that if there had been VAR then Steve Hodge would have been sent off first for elbowing Maradona in the face. \u201cYeah. And Diego\u2019s [second] miracle goal wouldn\u2019t have been allowed because Glenn Hoddle was hacked down.\u201d Lineker laughs. \u201cAnyway, if we\u2019d had VAR it would have been 1-0 to us and I scored the winner. Happy days.\u201d It is 30 years this summer since Italia 90 when Lineker and England were knocked out of the World Cup semi-finals by Germany. \u201cI look back with a mixture of joy, because we were such a good side, and a feeling we didn\u2019t do ourselves justice. We didn\u2019t always play well. Cameroon were brilliant in the quarters. They outplayed us most of the game but Shilts made three world-class saves. I scored the two penalties and we won. Then Germany. I only watched it back a couple of years ago. I didn\u2019t realise we were that good. We were the better side. \u201cItalia 90 was a watershed for English football. Post-Hillsborough, post-Heysel, post-awful 80s hooliganism, it wasn\u2019t just a working class sport anymore. It was the national sport for everybody. Women and the middle classes became interested. The reaction after 1986 was extraordinary but 1990 \u2013 my God.\u201d That tournament propelled Lineker towards his role at the BBC \u2013 which is again beset by problems. \u201cThe BBC is something that I am genuinely passionate about,\u201d Lineker says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with them for 25 years. And I think it\u2019s something we should be proud of in this country. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for the BBC,\u201d he admits. \u201cThey are the standard bearer and balance is difficult. Both the right wing and the left wing complain like mad that the BBC are biased. The truth is the BBC is full of thousands of people with varying political views. To say the BBC is fundamentally leftist, or fundamentally rightist, is wrong. It\u2019s been a difficult time because of Brexit and people have been very tribal. But the BBC is unbelievably respected around the world. \u201cThe licence fee is our fundamental problem. You\u2019re forced to pay it if you want a TV, and therefore it\u2019s a tax. The public pay our salaries, so everyone is a target. I would make the licence fee voluntary. I\u2019ve always said for a long time, I would make it voluntary. I don\u2019t know the logistics of how it would work. You would lose some people, but at the same time you\u2019d up the price a bit. It\u2019s the price of a cup of coffee a week at the moment. If you put it up you could help older people, or those that can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Does his position at the BBC, and over Brexit, expose him to the threat of physical attack? \u201cNo, it\u2019s remarkable. For all the grief I occasionally get on Twitter, people are a lot kinder face to face. I\u2019ve only had one incident. About two years ago I was getting the train at Euston to Manchester. I got shoved in the back. I turned around and it was a little old lady. She\u2019s going: \u2018You let her in?\u2019 I think she was talking about the girl who came back from Isis \u2013 which I made no comment on. She said: \u2018You let her in, have her in your house. Effing this, effing that.\u2019 She was on her way to a Tommy Robinson rally outside the BBC. But people are usually incredibly warm.\u201d As Lineker stretches out on his sofa for a photo in his front room, I remind him he will turn 60 this year. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says wryly, \u201cbut it\u2019s just a number. I\u2019m still in good shape. Seventy is the one to worry about. I would love another 10 years of working like this and having a good time.\u201d",

In late November, the Queensland government introduced legislation that would, among other amendments to health legislation, make the practice of conversion therapy to change or suppress a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity punishable by up to 18 months in jail. The examples provided in the legislation include aversion therapy, psychoanalysis or hypnotherapy with the aim of changing or suppressing a person\u2019s sexuality, but it also extends to counselling and group activities. The legislation \u2013 which followed a 2018 Human Rights Law Centre review into conversion therapy practices in Australia \u2013 has the strong support of medical bodies, such as the Australian Psychological Society, and human rights organisations, such as the Queensland Human Rights Commission.

The association also argued that adults giving informed consent should be able to freely participate in counselling regarding their sexuality and gender.

      "bodyText": "Last year was an average year for employment, which is not completely damning with faint praise. Given the low overall economic growth that existed through 2019, it is somewhat surprising that employment growth remained as solid as it did. But the story of the 2019 labour market also reflects the ongoing trends that have led to the low wages growth that unfortunately looks set to continue for the new year. We began 2019 with the unemployment rate at 5.0% and we left it with the rate at 5.1%. This in itself suggests not much happened, but if we look at the chart of the unemployment rates for men and women, we see that last year was one where these two genders had very different outcomes. Both men and women also had 5.0% unemployment in December 2018, but while women\u2019s unemployment rate remains at that level (and with a rate of 4.96% close to being rounded down to 4.9%), the rate for men has risen to 5.3%. We can also see that while the labour market began improving for women in August, for men it was not until the very end of the year that any gains occurred. This is reflected in the employment growth for men and women: 2019 saw employment grow by 2.05% overall \u2013 pretty much on the post-1990s average of 2%, although the slowest since 2016. Full-time employment growth was marginally down on the long-term average, while part-time employment growth was marginally above average. Last year there were 132,600 full-time jobs created, compared to 128,300 part-time jobs. It translated to full-time employment growth being the slowest since 2016, while part-time employment growth was the fastest since that year. And it was men who mostly missed out on the growth in full-time jobs. Male full-time employment grew by just 0.5% in 2019, compared to 3.3% for women. The relatively poorer growth of full-time employment is reflected in the overall weak growth in the average hours worked per capita. At the end of last year the average person over 15 years of age worked 86 hours and 15 minutes a month, compared to 86 hours and 9 minutes at the end of 2018. That 0.1% growth was again the worst since 2016 and well down on the very strong 1.4% growth of 2017. This also continues the story of the past five years, where the rate of people in employment has risen almost back to pre-GFC levels, while the average hours worked remains well below the peak of 2008. And with that weak growth of hours worked comes the rise in underemployment \u2013 the biggest factor keeping wages growth low. The situation of workers trading off between more hours or higher wages growth appears set to continue, because not only was there little change in the overall unemployment rates, neither was there any great improvement in the level of underemployment. Last year saw underemployment effectively stay flat at 8.3% overall, but with big rises for workers over 55 years of age and for those aged 25-34. And this means that the split of unemployment and underemployment remains in place. Over the past five years while unemployment has improved, underemployment has either worsened or remained flat, to the point where the underemployment rate is now 3.2 percentage points higher than unemployment \u2013 almost double the long-term gap. And of course you would be right to think this split is due to the lack of full-time employment growth for men. It is no surprise that if fewer men are working full-time then more men overall are going to be unhappy with the number of hours they are working. But men now make up only 52% of all workers in Australia (compared to 56% at the start of the century), so while men being more underemployed than in the past is going to have an impact, it is worth remembering that women have always had higher levels of underemployment. This is because more men work full-time than women (men make up 62% of all full-time workers). But even as more women have come into the workforce, the level of underemployment has remained high. And women as well have seen a split in the movement of the two rates. Prior to the end of 2014 women\u2019s unemployment and underemployment moved in sync, but since then they have gone their separate ways. In the later part of last year, while the unemployment rate for women aged 25-64 fell significantly, from 4.2% to 4.0%, the underemployment rate for these women in their prime-earning ages rose slightly, from 8.45% to 8.51%. The reason is that women, like men, have seen a decline in the level of full-time work. Just 54.2% of women in employment work full-time \u2013 a level that is actually lower than what was the case for most of the time prior to 2014. It means that while 2019 was a generally fine year for workers, there were not enough full-time jobs around to not just reduce unemployment but \u2013 crucially \u2013 underemployment. And while that remains the case, our wages growth will remain at the current low levels. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

The Morrison government claims the federal money \u201ccomplemented\u201d the state grant, but the club was forced to go back to the council for permission to use the local government money to instead build women\u2019s changerooms, after winning funding multiple times for the same project. The example highlights a feature of the program identified by the auditor-general in a scathing report: that the federal guidelines did not ban \u2013 and even encouraged \u2013 clubs to seek funding from multiple sources. It raises new questions about the lack of federal responsibility for sports funding and the potential for double-dipping in the community sport infrastructure grant program. Despite the report\u2019s finding that the program had a distributional bias towards marginal electorates, the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie is still staring down calls for her to resign over her handling of the program and has received the backing of Nationals leader Michael McCormack. Scott Morrison has referred the issue to his department for investigation. Brisbane council gave North Brisbane FC $110,000 to upgrade the playing surface and install perimeter fencing at Prentice Park, Lutwyche in the 2018-19 round of its building stronger communities program. In January 2019 Football Queensland announced that North Brisbane FC had received $137,916 under the Queensland government\u2019s Get Playing Places and Spaces initiative. The treasurer of North Brisbane FC, Greg Vitulano, told Football Queensland the grant was to get \u201cthe playing surface updated but we are also getting a perimeter fence around it\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt is actually very picturesque down here at Prentice Park,\u201d he reportedly said. The club then won $150,395 in the second round of the federal community sport infrastructure grant program. On 28 February 2019 the Liberal MP for Brisbane, Trevor Evans, announced the federal grant on Facebook, explaining the funding was to upgrade the playing surface and perimeter fencing at Prentice Park. On 9 December, the Brisbane council\u2019s establishment and coordination committee approved a variation to reallocate the $110,000 grant. North Brisbane FC announced on Facebook that \u201cfunding was initially granted to the club for the purposes of the field upgrade but with other funding sources for that project already secured\u201d it would now be used to build \u201ctwo additional female-compliant dressing rooms\u201d at the Swinbourne Street end of its clubhouse. The club thanked Liberal National Party councillor Fiona Hammond for her support of the project and the community leasing department of the council for their advice and facilitation of the process. Vitulano told Guardian Australia the club had submitted three separate applications to have the field upgraded because it \u201chad a compelling business case\u201d. \u201cThe state and local government also approved the purpose of our project \u2013 so you can safely conclude we had a compelling business case and the project was judged correctly, on its merits.\u201d Applying for separate grants for the same proposed project does not appear to contravene guidelines of any of the three programs. The Queensland guidelines require disclosure of other intended funding sources. The Brisbane council guidelines warn that projects that \u201care considered to be the core responsibility of other levels of government\u201d will not be funded. However, as legal academic Anne Twomey has noted, sports funding is not a core responsibility of the federal government, a fact that could render the federal grants unconstitutional. The federal community sport infrastructure grants program guidelines, published by Sport Australia, require disclosure of co-contributions and state that projects with co-contributions \u201cwill be considered favourably and scored higher\u201d. A spokesman for the sports minister, Richard Colbeck, said: \u201cNorth Brisbane FC declared all relevant details of Queensland government funding, which complemented the community sport infrastructure project but did not replicate it.\u201d The Australian National Audit Office noted that the sports minister\u2019s staff had considered whether funding should be denied on the basis that applicants had obtained funding from other sources, including other Australian government grants programs, and state and territory funding. It noted that some projects that received Australian government funding from other sources got sports grants as well, and that \u201cdeclining to fund projects on the basis that they had secured additional state or territory funding was inconsistent\u201d with the program\u2019s guidelines, which encouraged co-contributions. The ANAO also noted that eight projects were potentially ineligible because they were completed by the time funding agreements were executed by Sport Australia, a situation which \u201csuggests that \u2026 those selected for funding under the program may not have required Australian government funding in order to deliver their projects\u201d. In August 2018 the Liberal state MP Anthony Roberts announced $1m towards a proposed redevelopment of Boronia Park, in the federal electorate of North Sydney. The Hunters Hill rugby club also won $500,000 in the third round of the federal program to build new amenities and refurbish the existing facilities at Boronia Park. Federal Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman is an honorary patron of the club and has advocated for the upgrade, although he insists the club took the lead in applying for federal funds. The draft plan of management for the project, dated October 2019, states the project will include a refurbishment of an existing pavilion and new building of up to two storeys and 525 square metres, to include female-friendly changerooms. Guardian Australia contacted McKenzie for comment.",

Bryant had retired only three years before his death, after a 20-year career in the NBA, all of it with the league\u2019s most glamorous team, the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he signed his first contract when he was only 17.</p> \n<p>Five NBA championships and one Most Valuable Player (MVP) award later, he retired with the third-highest total of points in league history, 33,643, <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/article/2018/12/05/legendary-moments-kobe-bryant-youngest-30k-points\" title=\"\">the youngest player to cross that 30,000 barrier</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/lebron-james-kobe-bryant-nba-all-time-points-scoring-list-basketball\" title=\"\">his total </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/lebron-james-kobe-bryant-nba-all-time-points-scoring-list-basketball\" title=\"\">was overtaken by James</a> on the day before Bryant died.</p> \n<p>Bryant grew up on basketball. His father, Joe \u201cJellybean\u201d Bryant, played at La Salle University in Philadelphia, and then for the first half of an eight-year NBA career for the Philadelphia 76ers. His mother, Pamela, was the sister of Chubby Cox, another local star who played collegiately at Villanova University in Philadelphia. After the NBA Joe played another eight years in Europe, seven of them in Italy, and though Kobe was born in Philadelphia, he spent much of his childhood in Italy, adopting Milan as his favourite football team. His name came from the Japanese steak his parents saw on a menu; his middle name, Bean, came from his father.</p> \n<p>Kobe returned home to play basketball at Lower Merion high school in suburban Philadelphia. By his third year he was the target of college recruiters and was scrimmaging \u2013 taking part in practice games \u2013 against the 76ers\u2019 players. Although he could have had his pick of universities, after <a href=\"https://www.pennlive.com/sports/2020/01/looking-back-at-kobe-bryants-time-at-lower-merion.html\" title=\"\">a senior year when he led Lower Merion to a state championship</a>, averaging 31 points per game, he decided to forgo college and enter the NBA draft.</p> \n<p>It was a gamble; <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/garneke01.html\" title=\"\">Kevin Garnett</a> had made the move successfully the year before, but he was the first high-schooler drafted in 20 years, and was a big man, as the others had been. <a href=\"https://basketballnoise.com/kobe-bryant-height/\" title=\"\">At 6ft 6in</a> Bryant was very much a shooting guard, though tall for that position. Whether he was physically mature enough to take the demands of an 82-game season against grown men was a more pressing consideration than whether he was emotionally mature enough to handle it.</p> \n<p>In the end, the North Carolina side Charlotte Hornets took him as part of a pre-arranged deal by which they traded him to the Lakers for the centre Vlade Divac. As he was not yet 18, Bryant\u2019s parents signed his contract.</p> \n<p>He joined the Lakers at a time when they had also acquired the league\u2019s top star, the 7ft 1in centre Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Bryant did not move into the starting lineup until his third season, but for the 1999-2000 campaign the Lakers general manager, Jerry West, hired Phil Jackson, who had coached Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls to massive success, and he assembled a team of canny veteran players based around Bryant and O\u2019Neal, who shared the scoring limelight. The result was three consecutive titles \u2013 in 2000, 2001 and 2002 \u2013 and superstar status for both Bryant and O\u2019Neal. The two had disparate personalities: \u201cwhen you ask Shaq to do something he says no, sulks, and does it,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cKobe says OK, then does what he wants.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2001, aged 22, Bryant married 18-year-old Vanessa Laine, whom he had met when she was dancing in a music video. Two years later he was accused of sexual assault by a woman who worked at the resort where he stayed before having post-season knee surgery. In the end his accuser declined to press charges and Bryant settled a civil lawsuit out of court. </p> \n<p>After a 2004 season that saw the Lakers add two more stars, Karl Malone and Gary Payton, but fall in the finals to Detroit Pistons, Jackson was let go and O\u2019Neal traded away. The Lakers were now firmly Kobe\u2019s team, but after one disastrous year in which coach Rudy Tomjanovich quit in mid-season, Jackson returned. The Lakers improved slowly, though in 2006 Kobe scored 81 points in a game against Toronto Raptors, the most anyone had scored since Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s 100 in 1962. They lost to arch rivals Boston Celtics in the 2008 final, after a season in which Kobe won the league\u2019s MVP trophy. The next two years saw Kobe\u2019s fourth and fifth NBA titles; in 2010 the Lakers defeated Boston in the final game of a seven game series.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0f1c7cfe-63d3-4207-a0d4-063f2385e9d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-PaaJAUMHDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Outside the US, Bryant\u2019s profile was further lifted by his performance in the 2008 Beijing Olympics; he was at his peak and turned in a spectacular showing against the hosts, China, plus a brilliant fourth-quarter burst that led the USA to the gold medal over Spain in the final, cementing his status as an international star. By the time of the London games in 2012, however, it was James who sparked another American gold medal win in the final minutes, also against Spain.</p> \n<p>The contrast between Bryant and James was telling: James went on to auction his services between teams, famously going to Miami after organising his own \u201cdream team\u201d there, while Bryant stayed put in Los Angeles to build his Laker legacy, though after 2010 he would win no more titles. He was remarkably durable, playing through injuries until a ruptured achilles sidelined him in 2013.</p> \n<p>The knock-on effects of that condition slowed him down for his final three seasons and eventually he announced, with a poem called Dear Basketball, that the 2015-16 season would be his last. That swansong was his 20th with the Lakers, breaking John Stockton\u2019s record of 19 years with one team (Utah Jazz). Bryant was voted on to the All-NBA Team of the best players for each season no fewer than 11 times, and played in 18 All-Star games. </p> \n<p>After his playing days he looked after his substantial business interests and led many charitable activities, including a fund for young people in China.</p> \n<p>He wrote and narrated an adaptation of Dear Basketball for a short animated film which won an Academy Award in 2018. And he returned frequently to Lakers\u2019 games, recently with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, a promising young player herself. He was flying with Gianna and others to a youth game, to be played at his own sports centre, when the helicopter in which they were flying crashed in the hills near Calabasas in California, killing everyone on board. Former president Barack Obama expressed a nation\u2019s shock, noting that Bryant \u201cwas a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act\u201d.</p> \n<p>He is survived by Vanessa, by their daughters Natalia, Bianka and Capri and by his parents.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Kobe Bean Bryant, basketball player, born 23 August 1978; died 26 January 2020 </p>",

Outside the US, Bryant\u2019s profile was further lifted by his performance in the 2008 Beijing Olympics; he was at his peak and turned in a spectacular showing against the hosts, China, plus a brilliant fourth-quarter burst that led the USA to the gold medal over Spain in the final, cementing his status as an international star. By the time of the London games in 2012, however, it was James who sparked another American gold medal win in the final minutes, also against Spain. The contrast between Bryant and James was telling: James went on to auction his services between teams, famously going to Miami after organising his own \u201cdream team\u201d there, while Bryant stayed put in Los Angeles to build his Laker legacy, though after 2010 he would win no more titles. He was remarkably durable, playing through injuries until a ruptured achilles sidelined him in 2013. The knock-on effects of that condition slowed him down for his final three seasons and eventually he announced, with a poem called Dear Basketball, that the 2015-16 season would be his last. That swansong was his 20th with the Lakers, breaking John Stockton\u2019s record of 19 years with one team (Utah Jazz). Bryant was voted on to the All-NBA Team of the best players for each season no fewer than 11 times, and played in 18 All-Star games. After his playing days he looked after his substantial business interests and led many charitable activities, including a fund for young people in China. He wrote and narrated an adaptation of Dear Basketball for a short animated film which won an Academy Award in 2018. And he returned frequently to Lakers\u2019 games, recently with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, a promising young player herself. He was flying with Gianna and others to a youth game, to be played at his own sports centre, when the helicopter in which they were flying crashed in the hills near Calabasas in California, killing everyone on board. Former president Barack Obama expressed a nation\u2019s shock, noting that Bryant \u201cwas a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act\u201d. He is survived by Vanessa, by their daughters Natalia, Bianka and Capri and by his parents. \u2022 Kobe Bean Bryant, basketball player, born 23 August 1978; died 26 January 2020",

Huawei is a private company, although as the Snowden leaks showed, the US and the UK have been able to obtain backdoor access into high-tech firms\u2019 communications networks and technology. A determined Chinese state could do the same, relying on powers contained within its laws, meaning that the security of 5G and other technologies like it will depend on other measures the UK can take.

      "bodyText": "Almost 3,000 people, including nearly 800 members of the clergy, have signed an open letter to the archbishops of Canterbury and York, saying guidance issued by bishops last week saying sex is only for married heterosexuals has made the Church of England a \u201claughing stock\u201d. The signatories express \u201canger and disappointment\u201d at the bishops\u2019 \u201cpastoral statement\u201d, which says a same sex or opposite sex civil partnership should be celibate. The letter says the statement is \u201canything but \u2018pastoral\u2019 \u2013 it is cold, defensive, and uncaring of its impact on the millions of people it affects. \u201cThe Church of England has \u2026 become a laughing stock to a nation that believes it is obsessed with sex.\u201d The letter expresses dismay that the bishops made a public pronouncement while the C of E is undergoing a major review of sexuality and marriage. The church is deeply divided on the issue, with progressives arguing for inclusivity and equality, and conservatives stressing traditional biblical teaching on sexuality and marriage. In 2017, the C of E\u2019s ruling body, the General Synod, narrowly threw out a bishops\u2019 report that upheld traditional teaching on marriage. In response, the two archbishops set up two working groups and four sub-groups to \u201chelp us understand better the issues and the points of conflict\u201d. The archbishops said a \u201cradical new Christian inclusion in the the church\u201d was needed, founded in scripture, tradition and faith while also based on \u201ca proper 21st-century understanding of being human and being sexual\u201d. The working groups are due to deliver a report, Living in Love and Faith, this year. The open letter to the archbishops says: \u201cSince the public defeat of your Marriage and Same Sex Relationships report to General Synod in 2017, we have waited for you to deliver on your promise of \u2018a radical new Christian inclusion\u2019. \u201cWe have been patient, believing that nothing further would be said regarding sexuality and relationships until after the publication of the Living in Love and Faith report. It seems our trust has been misplaced and we feel badly let down.\u201d The bishops\u2019 statement had \u201cbroken the trust of those it seeks to serve\u201d, it adds. The guidance from bishops, which was issued in response to the recent introduction to mixed-sex civil partnerships, said: \u201cSexual relationships outside heterosexual marriage are regarded as falling short of God\u2019s purpose for human beings.\u201d The church sought \u201cto affirm the value of committed, sexually abstinent friendships\u201d within civil partnerships, it added. Signatories to the open letter include the bishop of Buckinghamshire, Alan Wilson, several retired bishops, and dozens of members of the synod. A separate letter to the archbishops, sent by the Rev Canon Simon Butler, who chairs the House of Clergy within the synod, and the Rev Canon Chris Newlands, also an officer of the synod, calls for the bishops\u2019 guidance to be withdrawn and an apology issued. Writing as \u201cpartnered gay men\u201d, they say: \u201cWe believe that the ill-considered statement demonstrates once more the inability of the House of Bishops to connect with public attitudes\u201d.",

To get into the top 50 run scorers you\u2019d to have played at least 150 innings, so out of those 50 you\u2019d expect less than 1/3 of a player to have an exact average (and none of them do). As the number of innings decreases it becomes be easier for a player to have an exact average.</p> <p>For batsmen with fewer than 100 completed innings, it is impossible to have a decimal part starting .00 (where it is not exact), as there will always be part of the decimal expansion of the fraction creeping in.

First, how immensely difficult it is to get in the zone, which is why most cricketers fail. Second, drinks is not always a positive thing. It\u2019s like when you are at work and really getting stuff done and then someone announces its Susan from reception\u2019s birthday. Sure, who doesn\u2019t like cake, but it also involves breaking off what you are doing, and usually standing around chatting to people you have nothing to say to, which I\u2019m sure is often true of batting partners. Its always a good ten minutes before you get back in the zone, if ever.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, that\u2019s spot on. But it isn\u2019t so much Susan from reception as something they know is going to happen at the top of the hour. To that end, I wonder why more hasn\u2019t been done to prepare for the break so they don\u2019t leave the zone? <br></p> <p>Steve Nicholson is with us as well on players commentating while on the field. <br></p> <p>\u201cI clearly remember (mid 1960s?) Denis Compton doing this while playing in a televised match between (I think) Old England and the Lords Taverners. Compton (who was obviously long retired from 1st class cricket playing but a regular tv commentator) wore the microphone while he was bowling, and informed viewers what he was intending to do with his next ball. I don\u2019t recall if he also wore it while batting - but in any case, the BBC had probably gone over for the 4.00 race at Catterick by then.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2eba898f08e97ed212b0ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T10:26:58.403Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>This needs an post all on its own, </strong>as I\u2019ll be watching it <em>very</em> closely. \u201cAll lovers of round averages need to stop what they are doing a pray to Alistair Cook\u2019s Cricket Gods (TM) that Faf is out for a score of 54,\u201d writes Paul Gilham. \u201cThat will leave him with an average of bang on 40. At which point he surely should do the decent thing and bunk the West Indies tests to leave his Test career there.\u201d</p> <p>Yes! Speaking of Cook, in his final innings I spent the better part of a day going back and forth with Andrew Samson as we watched him track to the number he required to guarantee a career average of 45. From memory, that was 80. Of course, he went on to make a lot more than that before he was done. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2eb8358f0879d539effc7a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T10:24:35.537Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Righto, let\u2019s get though some emails. <br></strong></p> <p>\u201cThis has been done a few times,\u201d Bertie Wooster says of the task linking players from dawn of Test Criket time. \u201cThe war is an issue (Hutton is needed there) and then there\u2019s a bit of fiddling in the 70s.

Any thoughts on Anderson (this one might be a bit more tricky, what with managing the body and all)? Will he coast past Kumble?

We <em>did</em> have him going beyond Kumble. Like Broad, we reckon they will take him to India and Australia but in a squad rotation. That might even apply to his output at home this coming season.

But I\u2019m not sure he should go to his retirement without someone mentioning that he plays the wonderful solo at the end of t<a href=\"https://youtu.be/FyH6bnt56mU\">his beautiful Divine Comedy song</a>.\u201d <br></p> <p>Yep, it\u2019s contested space, that\u2019s for sure. Every major political party has used it at one time or another. In fairness to the Barmy Army (I\u2019m sometimes a little nasty about them on twitter) the <em>did</em> start the Jerusalem thing. Per the piece I posted, it was their idea back in 1998, which the ECB picked up in 2003.

So, the best they can do is resist and hope for rain.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll be back very soon \u2013 the ODI series starts a week tomorrow. Ta-ra. So there we are: England beat South Africa again, and in fine style. What an enjoyable series that was \u2013 intense, hard Test cricket with plenty of skill and momentum shifts. There is nothing like it. Here\u2019s our report of the day\u2019s play. Silverwood will talk to Moeen when he comes out about whether he\u2019s available for Tests, and with Sri Lanka coming, there\u2019s a chance for him. He\u2019s very happy with his pool of bowlers, and says he can rotate if he needs to. They\u2019re trying to make sure Wood doesn\u2019t waste deliveries in the nets, because he\u2019s so wholehearted all the time. He goes on to mention Jamie Overton and Ollie Stone, along with yer Andersons, yer Broads and yer Woakeses (of this world). Chris Silverwood is very pleased. He says that illness in Centurion pulled the side together, and he\u2019s not surprised by how well they played subsequently. He\u2019s happy that the team have made big first innings runs, and the bowlers are learning to take 20 wickets with the Kookaburra. He\u2019a slo learnt about conditions - when the clouds come over pitches go flat, which affects who you bring on when. Wood says he\u2019s had some \u201chorrible days\u201d where he doubted himself. Can he get back, does he want to get back, is he as good as he thinks he can be? He\u2019s felt an England player since St Lucia but then had to come back again. Well done him; it is impossible to overstate the joy in typing, reading and thinking about that. Stokes is encouraged by the development of the team, says Pope is at the start of a \u201cvery long international career\u201d, and praises Sibley for facing down a quality attack. Stokes then says that the side is better with Wood in it and the dressing room will be noisier with him in it - and that his nervous energy explains the batting. Stokes comes over to say that the team were relentless, and they knew that South Africa were allowed to play well at times. Wood then laughs at Stokes\u2019 \u201cTV accent\u201d, saying he\u2019s not a \u201cnorthern lad\u201d, which was what Root called them. He says he was bowling cross-seam, trying to hit on a length but short rather than full. Root goes on to say that now the team have seen that the strategy works, they can deploy it with greater confidence. \u201cIt always felt like it was a bang bang sort of wicket,\u201d Root tells Sky. Ward notes that all he has to do is throw the ball to Stokes and Root agrees; Stokes wanted a day off tomorrow, and made sure he got one. He then notes that when the ball went soft, his team persevered and this is an example of what\u2019s changed this series: the mental strength to persevere. The team were told very clearly what the strategy for the winter was: big runs, then moving the game forward with the ball. He says the fitness calls were taken out of players\u2019 hands, and by batting first they gave Wood the best chance to succeed. He goes on to praise Crawley and Sibley, then goes back to Wood, who was sore but able to deliver his skill. Also, with five seamers, there was a chance to nurse the injury, and given the confidence he has, it was an easy decision. \u201cVery special; very special indeed,\u201d says Joe Root. He\u2019s especially happy with the reaction to losing the first Test, and very grateful to the support from the crowd. He says how pleased he is with how well his players have responded to opportunities they\u2019ve been given through injury and such, and is excited by the blend of youth and experience in the changing room. He says South Africa is a great place to tour and that the cricket is always of a high standard \u2013 hmmm, not sure we can say that about the home side\u2019s batting \u2013 and that\u2019s pretty much that. I fancy he and his mates might need to take on board fluids round about now. It\u2019s pretty emotional watching epochal talent fulfil itself, but make no mistake, this is it - we are privileged to be living in his time. He says the main thing is that England won the series and says he hopes his dad, sat in a hospital bed, will be proud. Team-man that he is, he then references his mates, especially the younger ones, and says how proud he is of them. He says he wasn\u2019t sure if he was going to make it, but \u201cboy am I glad I played now\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of dark days,\u201d he says, and thanks the medical staff, his team-mates and Chris Silverwood, who told him to go out there and have fun. \u201cGive it everything I\u2019ve got,\u201d he says, when asked what his job in the team is. \u201cLet if fly\u201d. It\u2019s beautiful to hear. Faf, who has very bald legs, says his team played well in the first Test but England were \u201cbetter in every compartment\u201d and gives credit to them for that. He namechecks Anrich Nortje and his skill in landing the ball in the same areas, at pace, before noting how hard it is to replace the \u201cDale Steyns and Morne Morkels\u201d of this world. He also says that Van der Dussen was close to one of the great innings, and thanks Bigvern for his service and for being a \u201cchampion guy\u201d. The team will sit in the dressing room and share the memories he\u2019s bestowed and sacrifices he\u2019s made. Bigvern is honoured with a presentation and says this isn\u2019t the way he\u2019d like to go out, but appreciates the response of both teams to his final Test. He says it was an honour to play for South Africa and wants to find young talent to mentor. \u201cVernon, you\u2019ve been a treasure,\u201d says Mike Haysman, and so say all of us. \u201cUnless my maths is dodgy, in the space of three tests, Wood\u2019s bowling average has fallen from just under 42 to just over 31!\u201d says Kevin Wilson. It\u2019s absolutely mad, is this: Athers, Nasser and Ian Ward are going through the England team bigging up nearly all of them. I don\u2019t know where to put myself! Nasser rhapsodises Root\u2019s improving captaincy, before reverting to the old cliche: Ben Stokes is the main man. He\u2019s right, of course: at the key moments he made the key interventions, and it\u2019s thrilling to consider that we\u2019ve got at least four more years of him putting eejits in their places. Looking again at the England celebrations, it\u2019s actually quite moving to see Mark Wood held aloft. To haul yourself back from injury as many times as he has requires a phenomenal amount of mental strength, and he must\u2019ve thought that his chance of being a top Test-match bowler had gone. That\u2019s hard enough for the likes of us to take, never mind for someone who actually has the talent to do it. His performance in St Lucia might\u2019ve given him more joy because no one saw it coming, but to do what he\u2019s done here must be more satisfying because he\u2019s shown it was no fluke, that he can do it in consecutive Tests, and established himself as key man in a side who can feel something happening. On top of that, he\u2019s very clearly an absolutely lovely man, who fully deserves everything he\u2019s getting. Souh Africa have a lot of expertise on which they can call and which they\u2019re now retaining \u2013 Smith, Kallis, Langerveldt. Whether they\u2019re as good at organising as they are at playing, who knows \u2013 and they\u2019ll need to be because the problems are structural. On the other hand, Markram has missed the whole series and they\u2019ve found one in Van der Dussen, so it\u2019s not all misery. But no attack can lose Steyn, Philander and Morkel and simply carry on winning Test matches. Nortje Nortje, very Nortje! Another short one, leg side again, and Nortje can\u2019t get his hands out of the way. England have been absolutely brilliant these last three Tests and for the first time in a while look a serious proposition. South Africa have problems. 78th over: South Africa 274-9 (Nortje 4, Paterson 0) Wood goes short again and gets a wide for his trouble; just what Nortje wants, another ball to face. And the next one seems to flick something ... England appeal ... no says the umpire ... and England review! 77th over: South Africa 268-9 (Nortje 4, Paterson 0 ) And that\u2019s drinks. Oh dear. Nortje knocks to mid on and Hendricks sets off without paying attention to the existence of the world around him. Sibley collects well, hurls to the striker\u2019s end, and Buttler does the rest. 76th over: South Africa 268-8 (Nortje 2, Hendricks 1) Wood will be smelling another fifefer, and sets a field that suggests he\u2019s going either short or full, with one slip and one leg slip. Hendricks gets off the mark with a pull behind square on the on side. De Kock\u2019s batted beautifully here, but he takes one liberty too many, trying to shmice a full one down the ground. But he\u2019s a little late on it, splicing high behind the bowler where Woakes takes easily. 75th over: South Africa 265-7 (De Kock 39, Nortje 2) In commentary, KP reckons De Kock can\u2019t go higher than five, while Athers suggest finding another keeper; I\u2019m not sure. Why would they want to, if he\u2019s batting well doing both? 74th over: South Africa 265-7 (De Kock 38, Nortje 1) Wood bangs one into to Nortje and he edges, but it drops short, in front of square on the off side. This brings De Kock onto strike \u2013 he\u2019s batted beautifully today, again \u2013 and when Wood bangs in again from around, he simply watches it onto his bat that he positions at the diagonal, but with the toe at ten o\u2019clock as he looks at it, feathering four through backward point. He has some of the greatest eyes I\u2019ve ever seen - looks do not deceive us. \u201cIf you plot \u2018batting average to two decimal places\u2019 against \u2018Number of innings played\u2019,\u201d says James Debens, \u201cthe pattern is so unreadable that you might as well just draw a chain of Dickie Bird heads on sticks. And if you do that, an interesting thing happens: the Dickie Bird heads flash, and the phrase \u201cLet\u2019s have a cuppa tea instead\u201d forms above the head of the second Dickie Bird portrait in a cottonwool speech bubble. I believe this is the correct conclusion to be drawn.\u201d And that\u2019s that on that. And I don\u2019t even drink tea. What a player Vernon Philander has been, an absolute mainstay of one the greatest, toughest sides we\u2019ve loved in recent times. De Kock hugs him and as he emerges from the tunnel his team-mates form a guard of honour. Oh, and he gloved a leg-side bouncer behind. 73rd over: South Africa 260-6 (De Kock 34, Philander 10) Let\u2019s talk about Big Vern. I remember when he first toured England thinking that his stats might not survive! Shaaaame on me. You have to be so skilful to be so successful bowling his pace. Anyway, Root continues and Vern adds one then De Kock clouts six over cow. 72nd over: South Africa 253-6 (De Kock 28, Philander 9) Wood replaces Broad \u2013 I\u2019m surprised they managed to prise the ball out of his death grip. Perhaps he\u2019s just changing ends, but he was doing quite nicely previous. Anyway, Philander pounces on one that\u2019s short and wide, humping four through cover, then picks up a short one and monsters it through midwicket for four more. A single then brings De Kock onto strike and when Wood goes around the wicket, he picks him up from outside off and deposits him over mid on. He strikes me as one of those who\u2019s good at everything. Incidentally, there look to be a lot of insects out there. 71st over: South Africa 240-6 (De Kock 24, Philander 0) Root fancies finishing this so brings himself on. De Kock plays ot a maiden. \u201cThoroughly enjoyed \u2018WICKET! Bavuma c Buttler b Broad 27 (South Africa 235-5)\u2019\u2019 says Kim Thonger. \u201cI wonder when the next most recent alliterative dismissal was?\u201d 70th over: South Africa 240-6 (De Kock 24, Philander 0) Out comes Big Vern for his final Test go-around. De Kock takes another single, and he sees away the final delivery of the over. Have England ever had a better fourth-innings bowler than Stuart Broad? He goes short again and Pretorious hooks higher than the sun. But Broad has lived, he has tasted, fantastical places, his soul an oasis, and Curran takes the catch, running in and diving forward. 70th over: South Africa 238-5 (De Kock 22, Pretorius 2) Broad looks serious, and after De Kock gets himself down the other end Pretorious almost loses his throat to another bouncer. 69th over: South Africa 235-4 (De Kock 22, Pretorius 2) That Broad bouncer though, my absolute days. It was the perfect line and the perfect length, forcing the batsman to engage - Bavuma actually did pretty well to a glove to it. Stokes\u2019 next over is pretty much a non-event \u2013 that\u2019s how good it was. It yields a leg bye and two to Pretorious. STUART BROAD! STUART BROAD! STUART BROAD! Broad charges in and bangs in a monster that spits and screeches at Bavuma, lifting him off his feet as he tries to get out of the way. He cannot, and the ball flicks his gloves before knocking him over, Buttler taking the catch easily. Brilliant. 68th over: South Africa 235-4 (De Kock 22, Bavuma 27) Broad returns for a burst before, presumably, returning again - can one return again? \u2013 for the new globule. His second ball is full and straight, pitching not far off where he\u2019d like it to pitch, but De Kock is so nimble and leans into it, driving four down the ground. He then pokes to gully, bringing Bavuma on strike, and what a shot he plays, rocking back to square cuts hard to the fence. 67th over: South Africa 226-4 (De Kock 17, Bavuma 23) Bavuma has a plan: if it moves, hit it. Stokes drops short and wide, so he zetzes him over square leg, then gets off strike with one square on the off side. De Kock then adds a single, before a little more bounce surprises Bavuma, who goes back, goes hard, and sends the ball flying over the hand of the leaping Crawley at slip. Ten off the over. \u201cA Wikipedia wormhole during tea informs me that six lads made their Test debut for England in the 2010s without going on to play another one,\u201d writes Darrien Bold. \u201cKerrigan was probably the most painful. Which of them do you reckon was the most unlucky? Shahzad Kerrigan Borthwick Rankin Crane Stone.\u201d Stone will be back, but I don\u2019t think any of these were unlucky not to be invited back. The ill-luck that resonantes with me was suffered by those who played in the 80s and 90s - either never getting a run because the team kept losing so management kept fiddling, or only getting a game or two because management kept fiddling. 66th over: South Africa 216-4 (De Kock 16, Bavuma 14) England complain about the ball again and this time it doesn\u2019t pass through the hole so they get a new one with magic swinging powers. Woakes can\u2019t find them though, and after De Kock cracks a drive to mid on, he pulls four to square leg then cleanses four more through cover. That\u2019s a lovely shot - not aesthetically so, but in terms of hand-eye, it\u2019s perfection. 65th over: South Africa 208-4 (De Kock 8, Bavuma 14) After De Kock takes a single, Bavuma adds two to fine leg then, when Stokes finds bounce off a length, he half-commits to a drive and gets nowhere near it. He\u2019s not hanging about here, because next ball, he goes again and this time finds it, but well away from his body and without a semblance of control. It gets him four through backward point, but too many more of those and it\u2019ll get him back to the hutch. \u201cI had something similar last season,\u201d says Carl Jones of my pulsating tale related earlier. \u201cOpening the batting for my village team and going well. The opposition captain set a 9-1 onside field to which I made a suitably disparaging remark about the obviousness of the ploy. Got caught out at long on two balls later. Departed, with suitable chagrin, to a rather smug \u2018Worked though didn\u2019t it\u2026\u2019\u201d Yes, but not because you fell for it. 63rd over: South Africa 202-4 (De Kock 7, Bavuma 8) After De Kock cuts a single, Woakes gets four balls at Bavuma, who\u2019s yet to score. Not anymore! He doesn\u2019t just stands there, he gets to it, striking a pose, there\u2019s nothing to it ... or something. A luscious cover drive goes to the fence for four, and so does a fence through third man which elicits a response from the normally mild-mannered Woakes. In the meantime, we see footage of Du Plessis and Buttler jostling after the former\u2019s dismissal, along with the exchange of sentiments. It\u2019s not hard to plot a narrative of stress for either of those two chaps. 62nd over: South Africa 192-4 (De Kock 6, Bavuma 0) Stokes continues \u2013 of course he does. It\u2019s funny really, that however many seamers they pick, partly to limit his workload, he invites it upon himself. How many overs might he have bowled before they invented the internet? Anyway, a maiden. \u201cThis feels like the series where Root\u2019s captaincy has come of age, do you think that\u2019s fair?\u201d asks Mark Hooper. \u201cI\u2019ve not been a huge fan, but I don\u2019t think he can be fully blamed for coming into the England side in an era \u2013 under first Strauss and then Cook \u2013 where an over-cautious, no-risk, no surprises approach was the norm. So fair play for mixing things up, being proactive in the field and looking to make things happen and take the initiative. Oddly, Faf du Plessis seems to be captaining like an English man this series\u2026!\u201d The main problem with Root\u2019s captaincy was the effect on his batting - England couldn\u2019t afford to be without the best of it. In this series, there\u2019s been a virtuous circle in which his numbers have improved, those around him have stepped up, and he\u2019s made better decisions. I\u2019m not making assumptions just yet, but the signs are positive. 61st over: South Africa 192-4 (De Kock 6, Bavuma 0) England will feel that one more wicket and they can finish this tonight; in that regard, Chris Woakes has the ball. De Kock sees away for dots, then fends at one with soft enough hands, sending four through gully. \u201cIn a bid for cognitive harmony, I like to put the kettle on when they stop for \u2018tea\u2019\u201d says Bill Hargeaves. \u201cWould a slice of Battenberg cake, spirit of intermarrying royal families, help cricketing detente in the changing rooms, almost as First Nation people shared the peace pipe?\u201d I had my lunch, partly because I\u2019m not yet mature enough to enjoy hot drinks. However, I\u2019d love some ... Battenballberg. I don\u2019t think I properly appreciated cake until I was in my 30s, but now have this plan to make a jam sponge, with that sour sugar they stick on Astrobelts sprinkled on the top. Did you know: that same sour sugar can also be used as dishwasher salt? Right, we go again... What a session that was. South Africa batted brilliantly, but then Ben Stokes benstoked them and here we are. England need six wickets, South Africa need 278 runs. See you shortly. 60th over: South Africa 188-4 (De Kock 2, Bavuma 0) Stokes scrapes his foot on the ground like a bull \u2013 he\u2019d prefer to go at Bavuma, not De Kock, I shouldn\u2019t wonder \u2013 but De Kock plays away two dots, then nudges a single before Bavuma sees it through to tea. 60th over: South Africa 187-4 (De Kock 1, Bavuma 0) \u201cBrilliant captaincy\u201d, who ever supposed to type those words about Joe Root? He\u2019s been much, much better in this series \u2013 might it be that having a balanced team is helpful? Anyway Bavuma plays out three dots and we\u2019ve got time for one more over before tea. Oh, Rasssie! Oh, Rassie, Rassie, Rassie! Wood goes around the wicket and Root puts in a man at short extra; Wood sends down a ball that looks driveable, here comes the maiden Test century ... AAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH! It\u2019s a little short, so Van der Dussen has to stretch and picks out the man at short extra! Brilliant innings, brilliant captaincy. The walls are closing in on South Africa. 59th over: South Africa 187-3 (Van der Dussen 98, De Kock 1) De Kock has been good this series and immediately gets off the mark to backward square. So Stokes finds some lift off a full one and Van der Dussen only just gets it away and down, before gliding the next, shorter one, to the fence at long on. Stokes is furious with himself, shouting about bowling full, and Van der Dussen then adds a further single; he\u2019s so close. Stokes is making him think, though. Cometh the hour, cometh the Superman! Stokes tells the pitch it wouldn\u2019t dare be so unresponsive outside so it keeps one low and Du Plessis plays a tentative prod, sending the ball racing into the stumps! Is that the last we see of Faf in Tests? 58th over: South Africa 181-2 (Van der Dussen 93, Du Plessis 35) South Africa might just have batted like this in their previous five innings. Van der Dussen, though, is exempt from much of the criticism, and he opens the face away from his body \u2013 it\u2019s not a great shot, but his hands are soft enough \u2013 inching into the 90s with four through the slips. So Wood keeps charging in, and when he offers a short one, Van der Dussen sways but can\u2019t evade, wearing it on the chest.While he recovers, I should add that I missed some aggravation in the previous over, a throw from Curran hitting Du Plessis\u2019 handle and initiating some fervent pleasantries between him, Broad and Pope. Exactly what no one likes to see. \u201cIf a batsman has played n innings,\u201d says Andrew Milligan, \u201cyou would expect a 1/n chance of them having an exact average (where their total runs is an exact multiple of their innings, such as Wessels mentioned earlier). To get into the top 50 run scorers you\u2019d to have played at least 150 innings, so out of those 50 you\u2019d expect less than 1/3 of a player to have an exact average (and none of them do). As the number of innings decreases it becomes be easier for a player to have an exact average. For batsmen with fewer than 100 completed innings, it is impossible to have a decimal part starting .00 (where it is not exact), as there will always be part of the decimal expansion of the fraction creeping in. Once you reach 100 innings it tends towards a 1% chance.\u201d Just what I was thinking. 57th over: South Africa 177-2 (Van der Dussen 89, Du Plessis 35) England need a wicket so Root turns to Stokes, whose first ball is short and wide, so Van der Dussen leaps off his tippy-toes and crumps four through point. That was very nicely done, and a single through backward square follows. \u201cTo be scrupulously fair and in answer to Alec F\u2019s contention that the chances of an exact average diminish the more matches are played,\u201d says Ian Forth, \u201cI went on statsguru. I picked the halfway mark of aggregate scores in test cricket (page 31 of 61). These players scored in total between 144 and 156 test runs. And indeed, 11 out of the 50 have averages ending in .00, contrasted with zero for the top 50 test batsmen of all time.\u201d 56th over: South Africa 172-2 (Van der Dussen 84, Du Plessis 35) Du Plessis is into this now, deflecting Wood\u2019s first ball to the fence at backward square. The remainder of the over yields no further runs \u2013 but only because Broad hurls himself left to stop a further boundary. \u201cIn the matter of round number averages, I offer Pommie Mbwanga - average 2.00 (15 matches, 25 innings, 8 not outs, 34 runs, HS 8)\u201c says Geoff Wignall. \u201cIt\u2019s not merely a round number but also the lowest ever test match average. On the broader probability question, as a non-mathematician it strikes me that what has to be determined is the likelihood of one given number being exactly divisible by another from a restricted set. The restriction is that bar the one obvious outlier, all completed careers have averages between 2 and 59 and form quite a steep bell curve with a heavy concentration between 15 and 45. With total runs between 34 and 15921 and again bell curved, I suspect this introduces too many variables to be accurately calculated (and I\u2019ve no idea how many prime numbers there below 16000; it must be quite a lot. I do know there are 168 of them below 1000) - but would love to be proved wrong.\u201d 55th over: South Africa 168-2 (Van der Dussen 84, Du Plessis 31) Root challenges the batsmen to keep going by keeping Denly on; it reminds me of the time I was batting to save a game, aged 14, and the captain of the opposing team had someone toss one up in the hope I\u2019d lose my childish mind and try to whack it, then get caught. I knew he was doing that, so decided to show him I knew what he was doing by whacking it and not getting caught. i think there\u2019s a philosophical term for this - when you do something that someone isn\u2019t expecting, but you know they\u2019re expecting it so do thew other thing, but they know you\u2019re expecting them to expect it, so you then do the thing you were originally going to do and so on. One off the over. Oh, and obviously it was all irrelevant, because i mishit it. 54th over: South Africa 165-2 (Van der Dussen 84, Du Plessis 30) Wow! Wood smashes in another bumper that hits the handle and sends Du Plessis reeling back towards the stumps. He leaps, crouches, staggers, and just avoids trampling his stumps. Two off the over, along with a very stern warning. \u201cIf time at work saved by the internet is x, and time at work wasted by the internet is y, does x=y? And if not, why haven\u2019t bosses been discussing an incredible drop or rise in productivity?\u201d Richard Claydon has a response to this brain-teaser: \u201cArguably, because digital technology connects us to work 24/7, meaning we just spread our work over longer and longer hours. Productivity and performance stay the same, but we get less sleep and recuperation, and, as the tech distracts and interrupts us more too, we tend to work in quick, intense bursts. Unfortunately, long hours and little rest make us sick, and long-term work intensity makes us sicker. We really need to manage the distractions and work shorter, high-focus hours. Then productivity should improve.\u201d Ahahahahahahahahaha! I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or die! 53rd over: South Africa 165-2 (Van der Dussen 83, Du Plessis 29) In commentary, KP is very much enjoying Van der Dussen, who is not, according to his mantra, \u201cjust letting him bowl\u201d \u2013 \u201chim\u201d being Dnely, who again sends down a full toss, which goes over mid on for four. As a consequence, men are on the fence, not around the bat. 52nd over: South Africa 159-2 (Van der Dussen 78, Du Plessis 28) At what point do England start to worry? Not quite yet, but as we near the end of a wicketless session, they\u2019ll be wondering what they have to do to improve matters. Van der Dussen looks extremely relaxed out there, evading a terrifying bumper from Wood in the process of playing out a five dots, following a single to Du Plessis. 51st over: South Africa 158-2 (Van der Dussen 78, Du Plessis 27) One for James Debens: Joe Denly has the ball and begins with a flighted dipper that Van der Dussen nudges to cover for one. Du Plessis then taps to mid on and ends up pegging it because Curran shies ... and only just misses! This brings Van der Dussen onto strike, and when Denly drops short, he carts him over midwicket for six! That\u2019s his highest score for South Africa! So Denly pitches fuller and Van der Dussen sees him coming, taking a huge stride to turn it into a full toss and driving very nicely down to long on for four. He\u2019s enjoying himself out there. \u201c1 in 100 to have an average of XX.00,\u201d says Alistair Connor, \u201cBUT that\u2019s beside the point. Speaking as a numbers obsessive, the only interesting stat is if the average is a WHOLE NUMBER, i.e. if the number of runs can be divided exactly by the number of outs. For example: a hypothetical batter with a total of 4131 runs for 153 outs would have an average of 27. Point nothing. No ifs, no buts. (did I mention I\u2019m a numbers obsessive ?) This is obviously going to be much rarer than 1 in 100, but I have no inclination to calculate the odds (obsessive but lazy).\u201d 50th over: South Africa 146-2 (Van der Dussen 67, Du Plessis 26) Wood replaces Woakes, who handsomed his way through another decent spell. England could really do with him finding some reverse, but this ground isn\u2019t conducive to it and Van der Dussen bunts him to cover for one before Du Plessis plays out the rest of the over, during which time the complaints about the ball begin. That\u2019s drinks. \u201cMike Morris\u2019s logic (over 43) seems watertight,\u201d reckons Ian Forth. \u201cIt\u2019s lent credence by the the fact that the first batsman on the list of all time test run scorers (Daniel Vettori, as noted earlier) to register an \u2018exact\u2019 average (30.00) is 108th on the list, while the next, with an average of 41.00, is Kepler Wessels at 218th.\u201d Spooky. 49th over: South Africa 145-2 (Van der Dussen 66, Du Plessis 26) Eeesh! Curran finds some bounce and Du Plessis leans into a poke ... edging through the slips for four. So to rebalance the cosmos, when one sits up for him, he waits and crunches it through midwicket for four. \u201cTo get an exact average,\u201d tweets Alec F \u2013 brother of Axel, I trust \u2013 \u201cthe number of runs must be a multiple of the number of completed innings. So the chances of an exact average diminishes as a player completes every innings. For a player who has completed 100 innings there is a 1% chance of an exact average. As number of completed innings of higher profile batsmen tends to be some way over 100 it\u2019s not surprising that few have an exact average. But if you look at players with less than 50 gaps you\u2019ll see it happening &gt;1% of the time.\u201d I\u2019m out of my element. 48th over: South Africa 136-2 (Van der Dussen 65, Du Plessis 18) The runs are coming more freely now, and Du Plessis takes two, then glances Woakes around the corner for four; no more than he deserves for disrespecting his glorious babyface with a beard. \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to get Denly on and give the ball some air and flat fizz?\u201d asks James Debens. \u201cSlow balls with some languid loop. Try to hit that, VDD! Get Bairstow on as sub fielder, marshalling the boundaries for a skied one, whizzing off the ropes like a Catherine Wheel. What, what?\u201d I\u2019d look forward to seeing how Bairstow managed to get himself bowled fielding at deep backward point. 47th over: South Africa 130-2 (Van der Dussen 65, Du Plessis 12) Now Curran decides to go around and from wide of the crease. Du Plessis takes one to backward square, then Van der Dussen chucks bat at a full one and gets enough of it to send it to the fence. It\u2019s not as good a stroke as those recent ones which, combined, earned him a princely total of 0 \u2013 which i believe is ironic. \u201cRe Mike Morris, that can\u2019t be right,\u201d says Peter Salmon. \u201cThe one in a hundred on .00, as I said in earlier email numbers repeat. So you only need two players whose averages end .94 or .23 and it\u2019s thrown out of whack. Mind, that was my original idea, then I went for one in a thousand, but no idea why. Still panicking here. Where are the maths people?!\u201d 46th over: South Africa 125-2 (Van der Dussen 61, Du Plessis 11) Given we\u2019ve been discussing matters mathematical, I\u2019ve got a question: if time at work saved by the internet is x, and time at work wasted by the internet is y, does x=y? And if not, why haven\u2019t bosses been discussing an incredible drop or rise in productivity? In the meantime, Maharaj takes a break from playing Words With Friends and brings out some drinks before Du Plessis gets his feet stuck in cement and looks away while playing an airy drive at Woakes, missing everything. But he recovers and nips down the other end after nurdling one behind square on the on side. 45th over: South Africa 124-2 (Van der Dussen 61, Du Plessis 10) Currany replaces Broady and looks to be doing around the wicket to Du Plessis before changing his mind. Du Plessis takes one, then Van der Dussen is denied by Sibley again. So Curran charges in again, angry face deployed, and raps his man on the pad; the ball loops to slip and there\u2019s an appeal for whatever\u2019s going, but no review. England are starting to exert a bit of pressure now, and Van der Dussen looks a little frustrated; Faf has a word and he takes his helmet off to reset. 44th over: South Africa 123-2 (Van der Dussen 61, Du Plessis 9) Van der Dussen misses out on 12 runs; Sibley and Pope make decent stops, then he misses a leg-stump half-volley. Maiden. 43rd over: South Africa 123-2 (Van der Dussen 61, Du Plessis 9) The current state of play has Stuart Broad written all over it, and he\u2019s certainly trying to make it happen, but after Van der Dussen takes one more to cover, Du Plessis sees out the rest of the over. Talking of whom, have we discussed his hair this series? Like that of Judd Trump, I\u2019m struggling to understand precisely how it works \u2013 both remind me of an exam I did as a kid in which I had to copy shape out of paper and scissors, without touching the one on the table in front of me. \u201cNot one of your better efforts, Daniel,\u201d said the teacher. \u201cThere\u2019s 100 permutations from .00 to .99,\u201d tweets Mike Morris, \u201cso I would think the chance of a cricketer having a .00 average is one in a hundred ... but I feel like I\u2019ve ruined the fun if that\u2019s true.\u201d I\u2019m not sure about this. I\u2019m no mathematician, but might the manner of scoring in cricket \u2013 hardly any fives, not many sixes, relatively speaking \u2013 have an impact? 42nd over: South Africa 122-2 (Van der Dussen 60, Du Plessis 9) I\u2019ve decided that Bess could just as easily have replaced Woakes, the selectors will be chuffed to learn \u2013 despite his lovely hair. But the pitch is misbehaving for him now and, after Du Plessis takes one to cover, he has Van der Dussen leaping as the ball spits off a length; he wears it on the pelvis, then nudges a single to point. 41st over: South Africa 120-2 (Van der Dussen 59, Du Plessis 8) It\u2019s lucky England didn\u2019t pick a spinner isn\u2019t it? No one wants to leave out Sam Curran, but we are where we are. Anyway, Stuart Broad roars in, and after a single to each batsman persuades his fourth ball to leap onto the splice; perhaps a short-leg might be sensible, in case he gets more of the same. Also, you can email me on daniel.harris.casual@theguardian.com or tweet @DanielHarris. 40th over: South Africa 118-2 (van der Dussen 58, du Plessis 8) RvdD has played some lovely drives in his innings so far today and that\u2019s the best of them, jumping on the front foot and slamming Woakes through the gap at cover, racing away for four. He bounces back with a sharp bumper, just getting out the way. To finish off, he\u2019s a touch shorter again to du Plessis, the ball smashing into his right glove. The skipper immediately drops his bat - that hurt him. But it was on this ground in 2018 against Australia he broke his finger but still went on to post three figures, so don\u2019t worry too much about how he responds. As the medical staff come out to take a look, the umpires decide to call drinks. With that, I\u2019ll say goodbye for the day, Daniel Harris on to replace me. Thanks for your company. Chat tomorrow? Quite possibly with the way South Africa are going at the moment. Bye for now. 39th over: South Africa 113-2 (van der Dussen 53, du Plessis 8) Shot, Faf. It wasn\u2019t a good delivery from Broad on his pads but he still had to put it away and did with style. It was the only pitched-up delivery, too. He\u2019s gotta give it a chance to swing. We have another route, albeit to nine rather than eight, from Dominic Murphy. 1) Root played against 2)Tendulkar who played his first test v 3)Imran Khan who played against 4) Ray Illingworth who played against 5) Bert Sutcliffe, who played against 6) Wally Hammond, who played against 7) Herbie Taylor, who played against 8) Syd Gregory, who played with 9)Jack Blackham 38th over: South Africa 109-2 (van der Dussen 53, du Plessis 4) Stokes continues and is much more accurate this time, angling from wide of the crease in towards the hip. du Plessis stays still and flicks out to midwicket, keeping the strike. Pete Salmon is back with us and he has a question. \u201cI got it stuck in my head that one in a thousand players should end with round figures, but this doesn\u2019t work obviously as double digits (eg .94) repeat, but I can\u2019t make the next step. One in how many batting averages should end .00? And so how many test cricketers should that be?\u201d Yeah, good luck with that! My sense is that since games had sped up, this is less of a thing. I agree, in the 1990s setting a target of 250-300 was fairly common, but usually that was with only three or four sessions to come. These days, teams are getting so far ahead in the Test that they can set 450-500 with five or six sessions to finish the job. 37th over: South Africa 107-2 (van der Dussen 52, du Plessis 3) Broad is back, steered away for one early in the over by Rassie. Faf defends the rest carefully. Steve Hudson has nailed it! \u201cIf we move the rules to Test careers that overlapped (and not necessarily playing against each other in Test cricket), you can do it thus: Shaw Grace Rhodes G Headley Close Gooch Tendulkar Loads of players.\u201d The next question: who might be the young teammate/opponent of Tendulkar who is going to crack on until age 40? Is Root the most likely? 36th over: South Africa 106-2 (van der Dussen 51, du Plessis 3) I said in the preivous over that Stokes is mixing up his lengths and it\u2019s a more exaggerated version of that this time around, dropping a bouncer too short - called a wide - before sending down a waist-high full toss. Regardless, van der Dussen is in control. du Plessis gets a couple away to finish, albeit off the inside edge. \u201cIf you are including opponents,\u201d writes Ian Andrew, \u201cdidn\u2019t Rhodes play with Grace and against Bradman?\u201d Sadly, not. He missed out on the latter, not on the 1928-29 tour, and finished before Australia arrived in 1930. Quite a shame, really! 35th over: South Africa 102-2 (van der Dussen 50, du Plessis 1) \u201cHe has been absolutely brilliant,\u201d declares KP of the South African No3 as he advances to a third Test half-century, pushing Wood into the off-side to reach the mark in 67 balls. Considering he walked out there on a pair, and was given out lbw second ball, he has batted with such freedom. Good on him. Earlier in the over, he tucked the England quick out to midwicket for three before du Plessis got off the mark with a similar stroke for one. The 100 is also up for South Africa. Positive vibes for all. \u201cThat love of right angles and round numbers?\u201d notes Gary Naylor. \u201cYou\u2019re about to share your life with a scaled down version of Keith Moon. It\u2019s like being inside a Jackson Pollock 24/7/52.\u201d So I\u2019m told! I\u2019ve packed my partner, on her first day of maternity leave, off to a posh spa thing today. Resting while she can and all that. 34th over: South Africa 97-2 (van der Dussen 46, du Plessis 0) It\u2019s a rapid over from Stokes, now consistently hitting the radar at over 90mph. The captain, in defence throughout, still isn\u2019t off the mark after 17 balls. Nothing easy about this. NOT OUT! No, he is not. The noise the England captain detected was the ball clipping the elbow as he shouldered arms, not the glove. IS FAF CAUGHT BEHIND FOR A DUCK? Root has sent it upstairs! 33rd over: South Africa 96-2 (van der Dussen 45, du Plessis 0) That\u2019s a lovely shot, van der Dussen driving Wood straight back past him for four. His pace is up, the radar is on. This is going to be a very good contest over the next few overs. \u201cStop getting Ghost wrong!\u201d insists James Debens. \u201cIt\u2019s starred Patrick Moore, Jessica Tandy and Yahoo Serious. Who could forget Patrick Moore making a Toby jug for his darling at the potter\u2019s Wheel? Or Yahoo Serious summoning up the spirits as his legs dangled from his ute? The soundtrack by Slayer topped things off choicely.\u201d The Righteous Bros covered by Slayer, is it? Now we\u2019re talking. 32nd over: South Africa 91-2 (van der Dussen 40, du Plessis 0) du Plessis is doing it tough here, so badly out of sorts through this series. Stokes is mixing up his lengths, keeping the captain thinking. He finds the edge with a full offering, albeit from the bottom of the bat, along the ground into the cordon. He\u2019s faced 14 balls. Josh Robinson has a twist on the chain \u201cI\u2019m not sure if we\u2019re limiting the list to teammates (Paul Headon\u2019s initial query including playing against the next on the list), but you can shave one off Bertie Wooster\u2019s list by replacing Thorpe and Bell with Tendulkar, who played against Gooch (I think first in the summer of 1990), and then against Root at Nagpur in December 2012.\u201d Might more efficiencies be found using this formulation? Can we get it to nine? Nathan Cooper is in my inbox with a sensible thought, too. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed by the work at 10.24, and it is undoubtedly more pleasing to have a whole 11, but Thorpe to Anderson surely? Cuts it to ten.\u201d 31st over: South Africa 91-2 (van der Dussen 40, du Plessis 0) Rassie (who I always want to identify as RANDY), has broken his bat. Rather, Mark Wood has broken it for him with his second ball of the session and a fresh spell. After the delay, the new blade is beaten with a beauty from Wood, angled in before shaping away. We saw him pick up thre wickets with deliveries just like that after tea on Saturday. \u201cPeter Salmon\u2019s example of being wrenched from The Zone because it\u2019s Susan from reception\u2019s birthday is called (at least in my field, which is software development) \u2018context switching\u2019,\u201d explains Edward Collier. \u201cAll sorts of things can trigger it - emails arriving, fire drill, meetings, cake, a visitor from Porlock. Or, in my present case, an alert that a wicket has fallen.\u201d 30th over: South Africa 91-2 (van der Dussen 40, du Plessis 0) van der Dussen into the 40s with a square drive along the carpet, out to the sweeper. Oooh, Stokes beats du Plessis with a lovely little outswinger straight away. He had to play at that, just outside the line of off-stump. Come on, Faf. Get yourself in here. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Kim Thonger. \u201cIncurable romantic that I am, I\u2019ve just booked tickets to take She Who Must Be Obeyed to a 30th Anniversary showing of Ghost, which starred Demi Moore and Devon Malcolm if I remember correctly. Or was it Eddie Hemmings?\u201d Yep, it was Eddie Hemmings on the pottery wheel, if I recall correctly. The players are back on the field. Will Rassie keep bashing and crashing? Can Faf get to 54 in order to guarantee his career average (if it ends here) finishes with a \u20184\u2019 in front of it? Can England end this quickly? Let\u2019s find out. Stokes to bowl. PLAY! A couple more before we return. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Peter Salmon. \u201cI think we forget a couple of things when we get cross at batsmen getting out after drinks. First, how immensely difficult it is to get in the zone, which is why most cricketers fail. Second, drinks is not always a positive thing. It\u2019s like when you are at work and really getting stuff done and then someone announces its Susan from reception\u2019s birthday. Sure, who doesn\u2019t like cake, but it also involves breaking off what you are doing, and usually standing around chatting to people you have nothing to say to, which I\u2019m sure is often true of batting partners. Its always a good ten minutes before you get back in the zone, if ever.\u201d Of course, that\u2019s spot on. But it isn\u2019t so much Susan from reception as something they know is going to happen at the top of the hour. To that end, I wonder why more hasn\u2019t been done to prepare for the break so they don\u2019t leave the zone? Steve Nicholson is with us as well on players commentating while on the field. \u201cI clearly remember (mid 1960s?) Denis Compton doing this while playing in a televised match between (I think) Old England and the Lords Taverners. Compton (who was obviously long retired from 1st class cricket playing but a regular tv commentator) wore the microphone while he was bowling, and informed viewers what he was intending to do with his next ball. I don\u2019t recall if he also wore it while batting - but in any case, the BBC had probably gone over for the 4.00 race at Catterick by then.\u201d This needs an post all on its own, as I\u2019ll be watching it very closely. \u201cAll lovers of round averages need to stop what they are doing a pray to Alistair Cook\u2019s Cricket Gods (TM) that Faf is out for a score of 54,\u201d writes Paul Gilham. \u201cThat will leave him with an average of bang on 40. At which point he surely should do the decent thing and bunk the West Indies tests to leave his Test career there.\u201d Yes! Speaking of Cook, in his final innings I spent the better part of a day going back and forth with Andrew Samson as we watched him track to the number he required to guarantee a career average of 45. From memory, that was 80. Of course, he went on to make a lot more than that before he was done. Righto, let\u2019s get though some emails. \u201cThis has been done a few times,\u201d Bertie Wooster says of the task linking players from dawn of Test Criket time. \u201cThe war is an issue (Hutton is needed there) and then there\u2019s a bit of fiddling in the 70s. I *think* the answer is eleven. Shaw takes you 1877-80, then Grace, then Rhodes. Rhodes played with Ames. Ames played with Hutton. Hutton played with Close. Close played with Woolmer. Woolmer played with Gooch. Gooch played with Thorpe. Thorpe played with Bell. Bell played with Root. That\u2019s 11. Toodle pip.\u201d Beautifully done. Let\u2019s assume Root plays for another eight years? Root might play with... Athers\u2019 son, who is making his way nicely through the junior ranks. Sky Cricket are now showing a package on his 185 at Jo\u2019burg in 1995, if you fancy it. Now to Alistair Connor is diving deep into my mind. \u201cIt\u2019s not cricket, it\u2019s an earworm,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom my youth. You set me off in Over 4 with your need for round numbers and right angles. So here\u2019s your new theme song : Never leaves a gap unfilled Always pays on time Always fits the bill He comes well prepared Cube top, squared-off Eight corners, 90 degree angles Flat top, stares straight ahead Stock parts, blockhead -- Devo, Blockhead, 1979 As the kids say, I feel... seen. A quirky addition from Mark Slater. \u201cWhile his test appearances are not likely to have featured in the missing gap mentioned in the 20th over discussion, I think there should be recognition of Fred Titmus of Middlesex and England - who played first class cricket in as many decades as did WG Grace (because Mike Brealey spotted him in the crowd and invited him to bowl on a wet pitch some few years after his official retirement). To think that the powers that be would not allow such a thing to happen nowadays.\u201d If only so! Not quite the same, but always liked the story about the day Harry Redknapp let an angry fan come on a play for West Ham. Brian Withington on drinks-break psychology. \u201cMay I be the first to offer advice for any batsman facing a drinks break: \u2018Make sure you end up at the non-striker\u2019s end going into the break\u2019. However, we might then need to start investigating the prevalence of run outs the ball before a drinks break, but that\u2019s for another day.\u201d It\u2019s definitely a thing and absolutely shouldn\u2019t be these days. A cheeky lookalike from David Brown before I hit send \u201cAre Rassie Van Dussen and Laurence Fox related?\u201d I feel dirty including the name of the latter in the OBO. 29th over: South Africa 90-2 (van der Dussen 39, du Plessis 0) Far more chilled out from RvdD off Root after the loss of Elgar, taking a single into the legside. du Plessis defends the rest. With that, we have reached LUNCH. South Africa are still 376 runs away from their notional target at the end of a hard-fought session, England eight wickets away. But the visitors return to their dressing room on a positive note with Stokes removing Dean Elgar just minutes before the interval. 28th over: South Africa 89-2 (van der Dussen 38, du Plessis 0) I thought that would be lunch but it\u2019s not - we must be making up some time in this session. du Plessis, playing what will probably be his final Test innings on home soil, defends the one delivery he has to deal with to complete the successful Stokes over. The Stokes bouncer does it again! He went at Elgar\u2019s body from the get-go in this spell and gets his wicket with it now. The opener was unable to access his pull shot in time, the hurried stroke instead coming off the splice and back to the bowler. 27th over: South Africa 89-1 (Elgar 24, van der Dussen 38) Lunch time? PARTY TIME! van der Dussen is really going after Root, sweeping him for four then launching him over long on for SIX! Have that! Helped by four byes down the legside earlier in the over, they have reached their 50 partnership in 70 balls. Good times. So, Root\u2019s last three overs in Test cricket have had 54 runs taken off them. 26th over: South Africa 75-1 (Elgar 24, van der Dussen 28) So much for shutting up shop before a break, van der Dussen\u2019s approach is to go through the gears. After taking Root on in the previous over, he\u2019s hammered a stand-and-deliver slap from the crease off Stokes through extra cover, his sixth boundary out of 28 runs. \u201cGood morning Adam (rather early morning in snowy Ottawa).\u201d Welcome aboard, Nicholas von Malzahn. \u201cEasier than Paul Headon\u2019s head-scratcher (over 20): has anyone other than Rhodes played Tests in five different decades? Warm thanks while I\u2019m at it for OBO coverage.\u201d My pleasure. I know that Brian Close and Sachin Tendulkar spanned four and Shoaib Malik recently participated in his fourth decade of white-ball cricket for Pakistan. But surely Rhodes stands alone with five. I\u2019ll double check at lunch. 25th over: South Africa 69-1 (Elgar 23, van der Dussen 23) Root brings himself on - the only spin option for England this week, of course. van der Dussen starts positively, taking him on with a reverse sweep second ball, striking it expertly down to the rope. He plays an even better stroke later in the set, jumping down the track and getting to the pitch, clipping beautifully out to the midwicket boundary. A third boundary to finish, back to that trusty reverse sweep. After having a lot of trouble against the turning ball last week, the Proteas No3 is backing himself. 24th over: South Africa 57-1 (Elgar 23, van der Dussen 11) Stokes is fuller at Elgar this time around, jumping around the wicket to slam a shorter ball in there. They exchange singles behind square to finish. There\u2019ll be four more overs until lunch. \u201cAndrew Milligan\u2019s observations n exact decimals and rounding had me dangerously close to resurrecting last summer\u2019s NRR inspired debate about 0.9 recurring (ie 0.9999... ad infinitum) being exactly equal to one,\u201d writes Ian Forth. \u201cDangerously close.\u201d I reckon I was on the OBO that day? Let\u2019s steer clear of that for now! 23rd over: South Africa 55-1 (Elgar 22, van der Dussen 10) Three maidens on the bounce for England, Curran v RvdD quickly turning into a good little contest. \u201cYour point about batsmen getting out immediately following drinks may not be recorded, but I\u2019d take a stab at once every other innings.\u201d Feels right to me, John Starbuck. \u201cWhen it happens once, the rest of the side may be more attentive.\u201d It feels like a logical area for a team psychologist to look into. They all have one. 22nd over: South Africa 55-1 (Elgar 22, van der Dussen 10) Ben Stokes is into the attack for the first time today. It\u2019s a different approach from the all-rounder to the other seamers used this morning, banging it in at Elgar. But the opener has been around long enough to know full well what was coming, handling it comfortably. \u201cEvening Adam.\u201d A good evening to you, Phil Withall. \u201cWith regard to Ian Forth\u2019s 10th over email. One of the few benefits of getting older is the ability to recall obscure things that have little interest to the younger generation. I\u2019m on a mission to befuddle and confuse anyone younger than me with obscure sporting facts, for instance, I believe that Derek Randall was the first on field player to provide live commentary, during a game at Don Valley stadium in Sheffield in the late 1980\u2019s. A game that also included a very young (18/19 year old) Sachin Tendulkar.\u201d You might have to define live commentary for me, here? As in, he was mic\u2019ed up? Bob Woolmer and Hansie Cronje tried their own version of that during the 1999 World Cup, you may recall. Always thought it was harsh to crack down on that. 21st over: South Africa 55-1 (Elgar 22, van der Dussen 10) Curran gives Rassie something to flick and he takes full advantage, moving into double figures are his reprieve on zero. The all-rounder is still getting a fair bit of conventional swing. \u201cHi Adam!\u201d Andrew Milligan, welcome to the OBO. \u201cI was intrigued by the discussion of round averages so had a look on statsguru. According to that, Vettori has scored 4531 runs and been out 151 times (174-23).This actually works out as 30.0066. So they are truncating his average to 2dp rather than rounding up to 30.01 which would be the correct thing to do. The most runs scored with a truly exact average I can find is Keppler Wessels with 2788 @ 41 (71 innings; 3 not outs).\u201d Controversy! Ian Forth, what say you? One decimal point or two? It is, when you think about it, kinda bonkers that we measure batting averages by two DPs, no? 20th over: South Africa 50-1 (Elgar 21, van der Dussen 6) Woakes to van der Dussen, forced to use his bat throughout, giving him nothing. Maiden. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Paul Headon. \u201cLoved your little nugget about Wilf Rhodes. It got me wondering (Knowledge-style) what the smallest number of players is, in a list from first test ever to most recent test for each nation, where each player must have played with or against the preceding player in the list. W.G. Grace to Wilf Rhodes gets you from 1880 to 1930 in one mighty leap, but how many other players are required to cover 1877-1880 and 1930 to 2019? I haven\u2019t got time to research it this morning, but a fun one to throw out to your readers\u2026\u201d Thank you! Yes, we have done this one before. I know that Brian Close and Graham Gooch are involved; Alec Stewart and Jimmy Anderson too. There are gaps! One challenge is that Hammond didn\u2019t quite crossover with Close, from memory. 19th over: South Africa 50-1 (Elgar 21, van der Dussen 6) The 50 is up for the hosts, Elgar driving nicely past mid-off; his fourth boundary of the morning. Curran did beat him on the outside edge earlier in the over - a lovely bit of bowling - but on the whole, he\u2019s looked far more comfortable than has been the case of late. 18th over: South Africa 46-1 (Elgar 17, van der Dussen 6) Big Rassie is off his pair with a classy pull shot off Woakes down to the rope, along the turf all the way. Shot. He then pushes a couple behind point to finish. That\u2019s better. \u201cEarly play has done nothing to dissipate the after effects of a classic anxiety dream,\u201d writes Brian Withington. Good morning to you. \u201cReport deadline approaching fast, first half written but second half still just section headings with no text. And someone\u2019s debating what shade of paper it should be printed on! I\u2019m sure this has no read across to the cricket whatsoever, and was more likely triggered by my son limping off to A&amp;E two weeks before crunch FA Vase 5th round tie. Nothing broken, fingers crossed. A wicket or two now would be nice.\u201d I\u2019m meant to be writing down my dreams at the moment but neglected to do so when starting this OBO earlier. I do know it was equally anxious. Standard! 17th over: South Africa 40-1 (Elgar 17, van der Dussen 0) Slammin\u2019 Sam is back to Elgar and nearly completes a tidy maiden himself but going for the bumper to finish, it flies high enough over the lid for a wide to be called. Good set, though. \u201cGood morning Adam, good morning everyone.\u201d My man Greg Hensman! Great to see you pop up in my inbox. \u201cYou mention your group-estimation of the Test wickets Broad will finish on. Any thoughts on Anderson (this one might be a bit more tricky, what with managing the body and all)? Will he coast past Kumble? And presumably get nowhere near to Warne (that\u2019d surely be way too much, even for the machine that is Anderson\u2019s body)?\u201d We did do that, but it was one pint later so we were less definitive. We did have him going beyond Kumble. Like Broad, we reckon they will take him to India and Australia but in a squad rotation. That might even apply to his output at home this coming season. Then again, he\u2019ll clean up against the Windies and Pakistan. 16th over: South Africa 39-1 (Elgar 17, van der Dussen 0) ANOTHER big lbw appeal to finish! Umpire Joel Wilson was under pressure having gotten the previous one wrong but made the right decision here - there as an inside edge, which he detected. The end of a superb over from Chris Woakes, a wicket maiden. Malan will be furious with his dismissal, just after the break - how often do you see it? It was Woakes\u2019 fullest delivery this morning. Sure, it did a bit in the air but it was never a delivery he had to play at in the first place. NOT OUT! Excellent review, it\u2019s going over the top. The No3 survives a pair. For now, anyway... IS VAN DER DUSSEN LBW THIRD BALL? He\u2019s given out on the field but after consulting Elgar, it has been sent upstairs for review. Stand by! First ball after the break! Malan has batted well but throwing his hands at a ball outside the off stump, he\u2019s edged Woakes to the big hands of Stokes in the cordon. 15th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 22, Elgar 17) Wood is hitting the high notes on the radar but Malan really doesn\u2019t seem to mind, playing another really compact shot through cover from four. Not a lot of backswing; all timing. A quick single closes out the first hour- positive running. He\u2019s into the 20s. They take a drink. 14th over: South Africa 34-0 (Malan 17, Elgar 17) Woakes is digging into a channel just outside the off stump at Malan for the majority of the over before bringing an off-cutter back, played well to midwicket. He keeps the strike with one to cover. 13th over: South Africa 33-0 (Malan 16, Elgar 17) Shot of the morning, Elgar lashing Wood\u2019s first ball through cover point. Not a lot of footwork but he nailed the timing. An encouraging start from a man who could really do with a Leo Sayer. Oh, hold that positive thought: he\u2019s beaten wafting outside the off-stump to finish. \u201cSurely the most famous exact average is G. F. Grace\u2019s 0.0,\u201d notes Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cA pair on debut, fell ill during the game and died a fortnight later. It wasn\u2019t his best month.\u201d Cripes. Oh, that gives me an excuse to relay something I found the other day! I\u2019m sure somebody else has written about it before but, well, I\u2019m happy with it. It relates to Wilfred Rhodes. We all know that he was playing Test cricket when he was nearly 53 years old. But how about this. His first Test Match in 1899 was WG Grace\u2019s final outing, at Nottingham against the touring Australians. His last Test, in 1930, was the match where Andrew Sandham made the first triple ton (325) in Test cricket, against the West Indies in Jamaica. Isn\u2019t that cool? 12th over: South Africa 29-0 (Malan 16, Elgar 13) Edge, four! Malan went at the cut with hard hands, angling his bat so the ball went over the cordon. Earlier in the over, he had to get through a shout for leg before from Woakes who jagged back at him off the seam, but it made contact outside the line. A bit more going on now. 11th over: South Africa 25-0 (Malan 12, Elgar 13) Wood is sure he has Elgar caught around the corner but it is turned dow! Technology confirms that there is no bat involved, it\u2019s all hip/thigh pad. Root, once again, is right not to review. He\u2019s already consistently beyond 90mph, building with each delivery. This\u2019ll be fun. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Chris Dew. \u201cSo you like right angles? The hotel 70 degrees in Colwyn Bay was anything but at right angles. Gone now, but I had many lovely afternoon teas there. At least Colwyn Bay still hosts the biannual thrashing of Glamorgan by Lancashire.\u201d We spent a weekend staying in Colwyn Bay (albeit in an Airbnb) just before Christmas, a Babymoon of sorts. Absolutely loved the two brewries and Snowdonia Ale at the Pen y Bryn. Looped around to Conwy, Llandudno, Snowdonia (albeit, without climbing), Angelsey and Denbigh - where many of my family are from. Indeed, that\u2019s where my grandad, the old scallywag, evaded courtmartial after the war and met my nan. In short, can\u2019t wait to get back! 10th over: South Africa 25-0 (Malan 12, Elgar 13) Chris Woakes bowled magnificently in the first innings for limited returns, especially when the game was there to be won on that second afternoon. He\u2019s into the attack now, replacing Sam Curran. He\u2019s right on the button here too. Nice start. \u201cDaniel Vettori has the most number of runs for a test batsman with an \u2018exact\u2019 average,\u201d reports Ian Forth. \u201cHis is exactly 30.00. I made another slightly pedantic point to someone on a Guardian forum the other day and the reply came \u2018You\u2019re old, impotent and out of touch. Comes to us all eventually. There\u2019s always steam trains and writing letters to the local paper. Now I\u2019m going to make cheese scones with my daughter\u2019. I was chortling so much I didn\u2019t even bother reporting her for personal abuse.\u201d Great stat... even better sledge! 9th over: South Africa 24-0 (Malan 12, Elgar 12) Mark Wood it is, to replace Stuart Broad. What a joy he has been to watch bowl, bat and talk over the last couple of weeks. Elgar gets one to begin the spell, out to cover, Malan forced to get out the way of a quick bouncer soon enough. He\u2019s stroking them well this morning though, able to time the quick down the ground for a couple to finish his over. 8th over: South Africa 21-0 (Malan 10, Elgar 11) A productive start to the Curran over, Malan pushing a couple through cover then pushing one to midwicket. Elgar is in on the act too, clipping the third ball in front of the square leg umpire for four. Lovely timing. I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing Mark Wood very soon. \u201cMorning Adam, morning everyone.\u201d Good morning to you, Robert Ellson. \u201cHave to say I have mixed feelings about Jerusalem. I was at the Galle Test last winter, where Billy the Trumpet played it from the top of the Fort, and the overall effect was both dodgily colonial and thrillingly magnificent. But I\u2019m not sure he should go to his retirement without someone mentioning that he plays the wonderful solo at the end of this beautiful Divine Comedy song.\u201d Yep, it\u2019s contested space, that\u2019s for sure. Every major political party has used it at one time or another. In fairness to the Barmy Army (I\u2019m sometimes a little nasty about them on twitter) the did start the Jerusalem thing. Per the piece I posted, it was their idea back in 1998, which the ECB picked up in 2003. The marketing boss at the time had been to watch some professional wrestling and decided the England team needed some walk-on music. And there it was born for home Tests. 7th over: South Africa 13-0 (Malan 7, Elgar 6) Sure enough, Broad beats Elgar with his first delivery, around the wicket in at the left-hander, tailing away in the manner he did so magnificently and repeatedly to David Warner during the Ashes. But the opener keeps his cool, pushing one from the next delivery to give Malan the strike. Broad is up for leg before to the right-hander with a ball that slips past the edge and hits the back pad from wide of the crease but it hits him well outside the line and is missing the off-stump. Root was wise not to entertain a review. 6th over: South Africa 11-0 (Malan 6, Elgar 5) Ooh, Curran finds Elgar\u2019s inside edge when cutting and it was nearly all over for the opener - not far away from the woodwork. He\u2019s off strike later in the over to backward point, which will now give Stuart Broad a chance at the left-hander for the first time in this innings. 5th over: South Africa 10-0 (Malan 6, Elgar 4) That\u2019s a lovely cover drive from Malan, getting well forward to Broad and stroking him through the line out to the boundary. Earlier in the over the England cordon were up for leg before when he missed a flick but it was going to miss leg stump. The series might be over for South Africa but there\u2019s plenty of time here for Malan to leave a lasting mark. 4th over: South Africa 6-0 (Malan 2, Elgar 4) Curran beats Elgar to begin with a delivery moving away both in the air and off the seam. He has another little victory later in the over when finding his leading edge, which spits out through the cordon for four. We talked a lot about Denly and Butter\u2019s need of runs yesterday and the same applies to Elgar. His decline is getting problematic. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Hello, Michael Anderson. \u201cOn the topic of Philander\u2019s pleasingly rounded stats, a score of 56 not out or 81 out in this innings would leave him with an overall test average of exactly 25. Unlikely perhaps but would be nice.\u201d That\u2019d be a thing of beauty - 5000 runs conceded; averaging 25 when batting. I\u2019m one of those aforementioned weirdos who likes/craves/needs even/round numbers. And right angles, much to the enduring annoyance of my partner. 3rd over: South Africa 2-0 (Malan 2, Elgar 0) South Africa are off the mark via Malan, who tucks a couple off Broad through midwicket. It\u2019s a less probing over than his first, the opener able to shoulder arms for the most part. I spent some time in the pub after the second day of this Test with Daniel Norcross and Andy Zaltzman trying to work out how many wickets Stuart Broad will finish with. We landed on 560. The assumptions: he\u2019ll play every Test in England over the next two years but only every other in India/Australia during the winter. And I can\u2019t imagine why they would take him to Sri Lanka in March - let him rest. 2nd over: South Africa 0-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 0) Slammin\u2019 Sammy Curran has the new ball from the other end, as he has throughout the second half of this series. He\u2019s generating some nice shape away from Elgar from the get-go, the opener defending when he has to and leaving the rest outside the off stump. Nice. An old/discontinued email address of mine was featuring at the top of the page earlier today, which is fixed now. Hit refresh for it to automatically correct on your browster. If you want to get in touch at any stage, this is how you do it. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 0) Nice and full from Broad to begin, which is always encouraging. He beats Malan\u2019s inside edge to finish, whacking into his back pad. There\u2019s half an appeal but it is going well over the top. Nice start. There is a lot of love for Jerusalem as Billy the Trumpeter enjoys his final rendition before \u2018retiring\u2019 in his role. Four years ago, I spent too much time going back through the history of the poem, looking at how it became England\u2019s cricket anthem. The piece featured in The Nightwatchman and is online these days. The players are on the field. Stuart Broad has the new ball, Pieter Malan the man facing up first. Three slips and a gully are his catchers, a short leg too. PLAY! What a gem from Andrew Samson. Of course, this is Vernon Philander\u2019s final Test, which prompts plenty of discussion around stats. But they don\u2019t get much better than this for those of us who always have their TV volume on multiples of five. An email from overnight to get us going. \u201cAll this mention of what we can and can\u2019t hear on stump mic brings to mind some of the epic exchanges that we heard in the early days during World Series Cricket,\u201d writes Scott Probst. \u201cThe best, and least repeatable were the conversations between those two poets Dennis Lillee and Garth Le Roux. Kept us up nights at boarding school, waiting for those two to go at it from either end of the pitch.\u201d This always comes up in South Africa. I remember (fondly?) when Australia visited for the first time since readmission in 1994... you could hear everything. Shane Warne and Merv Hughes would have faced lengthy bans by today\u2019s standards. \u201cIt\u2019s not a minefield,\u201d says Athers of the track on TV, \u201cbut there\u2019s plenty there for the bowlers.\u201d Indeed, there\u2019s a healthy string of cracks at one end. Joe Root walks up and takes a look. \u201cHe\u2019s the new Jim Laker,\u201d Athers adds. The Sky coverage, both their callers on the SuperSport team and panels in London, has been excellent. Hello and welcome to the fourth day at the Bull Ring - the fourth and final day if the visitors have anything to do with it. They would never admit as much, but surely on days like today they arrive thinking about how wonderful life would be if they could wrap up the match half an hour before tea before settling into a lengthy session as the sun sets on the series and their successful Test tour. England have earned themselves a finish like that, just as their South African hosts are deserved the drubbing coming their way. It\u2019s a simple game now, Joe Root\u2019s men needing ten wickets to salute 3-1 with two full days to go. For Faf du Plessis\u2019 charges, their target is 466 - colossal. So, the best they can do is resist and hope for rain. Indeed, they need to do what England did to them at this ground in 1995, but I can\u2019t see any Mike Athertons floating around in this Proteas\u2019 dressing room. We had a good old time on the OBO yesterday, let\u2019s continue in that spirit throughout the morning; do drop me a line or ping me a tweet. G\u2019morning.",

      "body": "<p>Stephen Joyce, the last direct descendant of James Joyce who was known for his fierce guardianship of his grandfather\u2019s works, has died at the age of 87 in Ile de R\u00e9.</p> <p>Stephen was the son of Giorgio Joyce, the son of James and Nora Joyce.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s embassy in Beijing has said it is \u201cworking to make available an option\u201d for British nationals to leave the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus as the UK\u2019s response was contrasted with that of other countries with active evacuation plans. As other countries prepared to airlift their citizens from the worst affected region of China, the prime minister insisted plans were being worked on to help UK citizens in Wuhan, the city from where the outbreak is believed to have originated, adding that \u201cwe are doing everything\u201d to screen people arriving from affected regions. The announcement by the embassy in Beijing on Monday also came as the former foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, backed the idea of airlifts for British citizens in China and Public Health England said the first case of the virus was likely to come from somebody already in the UK. \u201cOur view is that, although airports are important, the most likely place that we might find a case is somebody in the country already, and it\u2019s absolutely critical that the public health service and the NHS are ready to diagnose that and are able to designate the person to the right facilities,\u201d said Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director and director of health protection for PHE. \u201cThat\u2019s the most likely scenario we are dealing with,\u201d she added in an interview with Sky News. Efforts are continuing to trace the 2,000 people who have entered the UK from China on international flights. Some 73 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK and all tests have come back negative, the Department of Health and Social Care said. In an interview at the King\u2019s College London Mathematics School after launching a post-Brexit visa plan, Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe are looking at everything we can to give reassurance to those people in Wuhan and you will be hearing a bit more in due course but I don\u2019t want to pre-empt the decisions we are going to make,\u201d he replied. \u201cObviously, we are doing everything we can to ensure that people who do come to this country are properly screened and checked if they have come from an area that is known to have the infection. So far there is still no case of somebody with coronavirus here the UK but clearly there are a lot of cases in China and it is spreading.\u201d The home secretary, Priti Patel, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, have said ministers are considering an evacuation plan, but both have stopped short of committing to one. By comparison, the French government has said its citizens who want to leave Wuhan, will be taken on a direct flight to France in the middle of this week, then held in quarantine for 14 days. Japan has chartered evacuation flights to take out 560 Japanese citizens who are confirmed in Hubei and the US consulate in Wuhan is arranging a charter flight on Tuesday to evacuate its personnel and some other Americans. Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan, and elsewhere, Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think I would be very sympathetic and I\u2019m sure the Foreign Office would be too.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a very difficult time of year for the NHS \u2013 it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies.\u201d \u201cThe thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what is necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.\u201d UK in China, the official Twitter account of Britain\u2019s embassy in Beijing, tweeted: \u201cWe are working to make available an option for British nationals to leave Hubei province.\u201d Providing details of a 24-hour helpline British nationals could use if they required assistance, it added it was continuing to monitor developments closely and was in close touch with Chinese authorities.",

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/jan/20/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from the last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s begin with <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16564625\">ignicapilla</a>, who has finally cracked Iain M Banks thanks to a read of The Player Of Games:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019ve struggled in my previous attempts with Iain M Banks, twice failing to complete Consider Phlebas, once when I was over 200 pages in but couldn\u2019t find enough interest in the characters or story to keep going. Despite that and having enjoyed almost all of his non Sci Fi novels and seeing the love that his \u2018Culture\u2019 novels receive both here and elsewhere I thought I\u2019d try The Player of Games. For the first 50 pages it was touch and go if I would carry on but then something clicked and I read the rest of the book in one session scarcely able to stop to even make a cup of tea or answer the door. So now I\u2019m hooked.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cPiqued by the title,\u201d <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13400011\">Dennis89</a> decided to try The Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A highly readable coming of age novel which traverses the classic themes of sex, class, money and desire in 1980s Britain. That search for belonging in life is beautifully handled whilst the decade is captured so perfectly that I had to keep reminding myself that the book was only published in 2004.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI eventually finished Jack London\u2019s Klondike Tales,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful</a>, \u201cwhich I started in November\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And, it went out with a bang, with To Build A Fire, which I have read a few times before, originally some forty-plus years ago, and it has never left me, such is its power. It\u2019s a tragic tale of arrogance and a gross under-estimation of the dangers of the wilds. A fable that all who take in the outdoors in any form, would be wise to read.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13472965\">SydneyH</a> has enjoyed Robert Walser\u2019s Berlin Stories:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the title suggests, it is a collection of \u2018prose pieces\u2019 thematically linked by that German metropolis, which was a cultural hive at the turn of the nineteenth century to the twentieth\u2026 in the fragments that were Walser\u2019s speciality, his prose is almost Dickensian, especially when the world around him seems to radiate goodwill. There is a sort of running joke in Walser\u2019s work that he is an insignificant, almost mouse-like human, and as a simple man he takes great pleasure in simple things: like taking a walk on Market day, or stuffing his face at a sort of German pub, or breathing in the musty smell of a room that hasn\u2019t been lived in.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sing, Unburied, Sing by Jesmyn Ward has impressed <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4515468\">vermontlogger</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s nothing pleasant about the subject of this award-winning novel, which is drug abuse, unthinking violence and unhappy family tangles and feuds down in the Mississippi delta, and insane racist brutality at the old prison farm in upstate Parchman (in the news again for gang-war killings over New Year). But the story is well told and the author has a deep flowing stream of expressive local language. There are revenants who show a way out, and you are left with a sense that some humanity survives.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cIn JD Salinger\u2019s For Esm\u00e9 with Love and Squalor \u2013 the great events of the Second War form a backdrop to a tender anecdotal encounter,\u201d writes <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2791828\">julian6</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Is the young soldier preparing for D Day, who encounters young Esm\u00e9 and discovers a brief friendship with her, Salinger himself? Esm\u00e9 and her kid brother chat to him and joke with him \u2013 it is such a sweet story. The second half is more sombre but there is always humour at the edge of the picture and the menacing reality is so much stronger for the small details enacted offstage in memory. I found the emotion so affecting \u2013 it is a beautifully played out drama that could easily be filmed or dramatised but the rhythm of the prose and dialogue would never stand out as strongly as it does on the page.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13035061\">BobHammond2</a> has just finished Sealed by Naomi Booth:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An unsettling piece of dystopian fiction about heavily pregnant Alice, who retreats from the city with her boyfriend Pete to a new home in rural Australia as a horrific skin sealing epidemic spreads and puts massive strain on public services. It\u2019s a short book that convincingly explores the implications of such an epidemic and I like the way Booth conveys a strong sense of paranoia on Alice\u2019s part, so although you feel increasingly uneasy as the book progresses you\u2019re not quite sure, until the end, just how serious the situation is. Recommended.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, Shadowplay by Joseph O\u2019Connor has won over <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1659807\">boguscoleman</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ghosts, monsters and celeb cameos abound in O\u2019Connor\u2019s latest \u2013 a fictional treatment of Bram Stoker\u2019s life, centring on the time he spent as manager of the Lyceum theatre in London and his relationships there with Henry Irving and Ellen Terry.</p> <p>I loved this. O\u2019Connor is a little fond of the odd digressions which sometimes sit a little uncomfortably in the whole. There\u2019s a short chapter consisting of a description of a town on the coast of England which seems completely overdone for no apparent reason, but even that is well-written so there\u2019s little to complain about really. It\u2019s a grim story, but sprinkled with lightness and a lot of humour. A definite recommend.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sounds like one we can count on.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>Arthur Brand, the \u201cIndiana Jones of the Art World\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/dutch-art-sleuth-finds-rare-stolen-copy-prince-persian-poets-2904605\">has recovered a lost book by the Persian poet Hafez</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/issue-36/the-intellectual-situation/smorgasbords-dont-have-bottoms/\">n+1 magazine on publishing in the 2010s</a>.

BobHammond2 has just finished Sealed by Naomi Booth: An unsettling piece of dystopian fiction about heavily pregnant Alice, who retreats from the city with her boyfriend Pete to a new home in rural Australia as a horrific skin sealing epidemic spreads and puts massive strain on public services. It\u2019s a short book that convincingly explores the implications of such an epidemic and I like the way Booth conveys a strong sense of paranoia on Alice\u2019s part, so although you feel increasingly uneasy as the book progresses you\u2019re not quite sure, until the end, just how serious the situation is. Recommended. Finally, Shadowplay by Joseph O\u2019Connor has won over boguscoleman: Ghosts, monsters and celeb cameos abound in O\u2019Connor\u2019s latest \u2013 a fictional treatment of Bram Stoker\u2019s life, centring on the time he spent as manager of the Lyceum theatre in London and his relationships there with Henry Irving and Ellen Terry. I loved this. O\u2019Connor is a little fond of the odd digressions which sometimes sit a little uncomfortably in the whole. There\u2019s a short chapter consisting of a description of a town on the coast of England which seems completely overdone for no apparent reason, but even that is well-written so there\u2019s little to complain about really. It\u2019s a grim story, but sprinkled with lightness and a lot of humour. A definite recommend. Sounds like one we can count on.

Consumption and travel were most affected. Retail sales growth fell to 4.3% y/y in May 2003 from an average of 9% in the previous six months ... However, [it was] quick to rebound. </p> <p>Similarly, industrial value added growth slowed to 13.7% y/y in May 2003 from 17.5% at the beginning of 2003. But it recovered to 17% in June and stayed robust for the rest of 2003. Investment and property market activities, on the other hand, were largely unaffected, in part bolstered by monetary easing. </p> </blockquote> <p>Similar to the Sars outbreak, he expects the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus to be mostly be felt on consumption (through retail and tourism-related sectors) and to a lesser degree on other economic drivers (such as investment and industrial value added). </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We also anticipate the economic impact to be less severe compared to the Sars episode, at least for now. The faster reaction time by the Chinese authorities this time around, with increased transparency and firm actions taken recently, are certainly helpful in mitigating the impact on public health, confidence and the economy... </p> <p>We also expect the government to roll out measures, if needed, to stabilise growth.

      "bodyText": "Global stock and commodity markets have been rocked by the coronavirus outbreak in China, as the death toll and infection rates continue to climb and the outbreak has spread to 10 other countries, including France, Japan and the US. It took one day for European stocks to give up all their gains so far this year. Investors are fretting about the impact on travel, tourism and the wider economy. The common view is that economic output is likely to be hit in the short term, as Chinese authorities have widened travel restrictions and extended the lunar new year holiday by three days until Sunday to contain the outbreak. China\u2019s Shenzhen stock exchange says it will re-open next Monday. Oil, copper and iron ore prices have sold off, as demand from commodity-hungry China is expected to weaken. Brent crude fell as low as $58.50 and is now at $49.17 a barrel, down $1.52 or 2.5%. US crude has shed 2.3% to $52.92 a barrel. Copper prices fell to a three-month lower and panic selling also spread to other industrial metals. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister has cautioned against \u201cextreme pessimism,\u201d though \u2013\u2013 he noted that during the Sars outbreak in 2002-3, there was a similar amount of pessimism but the virus did note cause a significant reduction in oil demand. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 2% while many other Asian markets were closed for the lunar new year holiday. European shares followed suit: the FTSE 100 index in London has slid 2.1%, or 160 points, to 7425. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 2.6%, France\u2019s CAC, home to many top luxury brands, has slid 2.7% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 1.85% lower. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 1.54%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.57% and the Nasdaq shed 2.05%. The panic selling sparked a flight to safe-haven investments such as gold, which rose as much as 1% to $1,585.80 an ounce, the highest since 8 January, and later traded 0.56% higher at $1,579.33 an ounce. Thank you for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Good-bye! There are also heavy losses on Wall Street after the opening bell. Dow Jones down nearly 530 points, or 1.8%, at 28,459 S&amp;P 500 down nearly 60 points, or 1.8%, at 3235 Nasdaq down 220 points, or 2.36%, at 9094 The oil price has come back a bit, but is still down $1.46 at $59.23 a barrel, a fall of 2.4%. But mining companies are not the only ones suffering during the equity sell-off. Europe\u2019s top luxury names \u2013\u2013 including LVMH, Kering, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Burberry and Hermes \u2013\u2013 have seen nearly $50bn wiped off their market value since the virus outbreak. Analysts at Bernstein calculate that Chinese consumers spent $149bn during the lunar new year holiday last year and that\u2019s unlikely to be repeated this year due to the travel restrictions. The outbreak couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time \u2013\u2013 millions of Chinese usually travel during the holiday period, but many have been forced to ditch their plans. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, says: The market is back in panic mode about China\u2019s coronavirus. An extended lunar New Year holiday is nothing to celebrate for China, instead it represents an escalation of attempts to contain the deadly virus by restricting travel and locking down major cities. As the death toll rises, all eyes are on the World Health Organisation. So far it has resisted calls to declare the outbreak a health emergency. Should that change there could be restrictions on international trade and travel, putting pressure on a fragile global economy. The difficulty for investors is that it is extremely difficult to predict what turn events might take in the coming days and weeks. Until there are signs the virus has been contained equities look set to be dogged by uncertainty. Previous experience of global health crises does at least suggest there could be a fairly rapid recovery once the number of cases has peaked. The FTSE 100 index in London is one of the worst performers outside China because it is heavily weighted towards the resources sector, whose fortunes are closely tied to the commodity-hungry Chinese economy. The sell-off on stock and commodity markets continues, as investors panic about the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, which has spread to more than 10 other countries. Here is our markets story. Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at the Aim-listed wealth management firm Kingswood, has also compared the Wuhan outbreak with the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s. He says the short term impact on the Chinese economy is \u201clikely to be considerable\u201d but he is fairly relaxed about the impact on the global economy \u2013\u2013 and stock markets. Global equities had started to looked vulnerable to a correction following their gain of close to 14% since early October, and the coronavirus has provided the catalyst for just such a setback. [The Sars] outbreak hit Chinese growth and the Chinese equity market significantly but the impact was short-lived with both rebounding within a matter of months. As for global equities, there was minimal impact at all. This time round, the Chinese economy is much larger and much more connected with the global economy. The Chinese authorities have also imposed much more draconian measures to try and halt the virus. Turning to the world economy and equity markets: We continue to expect global growth to recover a little over the coming year on the back of the relaxation of monetary policy and easing in trade tensions. As for global equities, the risk is clearly that the news gets worse before it gets better and the market correction could well have further to run as a result. Indeed, corrections of 5-10% are surprisingly common. In the past, however, even when global health scares have impacted markets, the effect has been short-lived. At the peak of Ebola fears in 2014, global equities fell back 9% over the course of a month but had recouped these losses within weeks. Tommy Wu, senior Asia economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, says the current coronavirus outbreak could \u201cpotentially be a high impact but short-lived event, similar to the Sars experience in 2003\u201d. He reckons it could drag GDP growth lower in China in the first quarter and possibly also the second, but beyond that the impact should begin to fade. Following the Sars outbreak, China\u2019s GDP growth fell to 9.1% y/y in Q2 2003 from 11.1% in the previous quarter and subsequently recovered to 10% in H2 2003. Consumption and travel were most affected. Retail sales growth fell to 4.3% y/y in May 2003 from an average of 9% in the previous six months ... However, [it was] quick to rebound. Similarly, industrial value added growth slowed to 13.7% y/y in May 2003 from 17.5% at the beginning of 2003. But it recovered to 17% in June and stayed robust for the rest of 2003. Investment and property market activities, on the other hand, were largely unaffected, in part bolstered by monetary easing. Similar to the Sars outbreak, he expects the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus to be mostly be felt on consumption (through retail and tourism-related sectors) and to a lesser degree on other economic drivers (such as investment and industrial value added). We also anticipate the economic impact to be less severe compared to the Sars episode, at least for now. The faster reaction time by the Chinese authorities this time around, with increased transparency and firm actions taken recently, are certainly helpful in mitigating the impact on public health, confidence and the economy... We also expect the government to roll out measures, if needed, to stabilise growth. Though we do not expect significant monetary easing amid the ongoing campaign to rein in financial risks. My colleague Joanna Partridge writes: Brexit uncertainty plus political turmoiled equalled financial distress for almost half a million British businesses in the final three months of last year, according to a new survey which measures corporate health. About 494,000 companies were found to be in significant distress in the last quarter of 2019 by the latest red flag alert from insolvency firm Begbies Traynor, representing about 14% of all economically active firms and the highest number since the survey began in 2004. Significant distress is described as firms which have county court judgments of of less than \u00a35000 filed against them, or businesses which have been identified by its credit risk system. The number of businesses in significant distress has risen by 81% since the start of 2016. The uncertainty following the European referendum result is partly to blame, according to Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor. \u201cDistress increased to record levels on the back of ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. These figures clearly demonstrate the impact of this indecision, and with political certainty and a clear Brexit path, UK businesses should, at last, be able to plan for 2020 with a greater sense of clarity,\u201d she said. Retail, real estate and property and construction sectors suffered more than others, although significant distress at businesses rose in 15 out of 22 sectors of the economy. The highest year-on-year increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress was seen in the real estate and property sector, with a 13% rise in the number of businesses affected. The survey finds financial difficulties affecting both bricks-and-mortar and online retailers. On currency markets, sterling has risen slightly versus the dollar and the euro (to $1.3087 and \u20ac1.1872), as the Brexit date of 31 January approaches. Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit in London, has sent us her thoughts on the decline in oil prices. The recent drop in Brent crude oil prices, below $60 a barrel, reflects two main factors: a recent spike in concerns over the impact of the coronavirus stemming from China, and deeper, more lingering concerns about the health of the global economy. Our China experts believe that the economic impact of the coronavirus will depend on how quickly it is contained and the confidence of the public in the authorities\u2019 ability to take effective measures. The experience of previous disease outbreaks, including Sars in 2002-03, suggests that consumer spending could be negatively affected in the next 2-3 months, but that this is likely to be compensated for later in the year. The oil market\u2019s initial reaction is relatively in line with this outlook. Confidence in global oil demand growth had strengthened slightly in December and early January, buoyed by the signature of the US-China phase-one trade agreement. The virus outbreak has been a setback. She expects oil prices to remain around $60 to $65 a barrel in the coming months, provided that the virus remains contained, as the negative effects have largely been priced in. \u201cIf conditions in China were to deteriorate, however, Brent crude prices could dip by another $3-$5 per barrel.\u201d Global markets have been rocked by the spread of the deadly coronavirus, which originated at a sea food market in Wuhan in southern China and has claimed the lives of 81 people so far, with thousands more infected. About 44 cases have been confirmed outside China in more than 10 other countries, including the US, France and Japan. Many Asian stock markets were closed for the lunar new year holiday (which has been extended to Sunday in China), but Japan\u2019s Nikkei index shed 2%, its biggest one-day drop in five months. In Europe, 586 stocks on the pan-European 600 Stoxx index are in the red. Mining, luxury and travel shares have been badly hit. Wall Street futures are pointing to falls of 1.4% on the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones, and a steeper drop of 1.9% on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 185 points, or 2.45%, at 7400.46 Germany\u2019s Dax down 284 points, or 2.09%, at 13,292 France\u2019s CAC down 132 points, or 2.2%, at 5891 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 386 points, or 1.6%, at 23,583 Oil, copper and iron ore prices have fallen, on expectations that the virus could exacerbate the economic slowdown in China and the rest of the world. This would translate into weaker demand for commodities. Brent crude has slid more than $2, or 3.36%, to $58.65 a barrel. US crude has lost 3.43% to $52.33. Investors are buying safe-haven assets instead of stocks, for example the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, gold and US Treasury bonds. Spot gold jumped 1% to a near three-week high, and later traded 0.82% higher at $1,583 an ounce. Silver also rose 1% to $18.25 an ounce. However, consumer credit was relatively weak, according to the UK Finance figures. It grew by 4% year-on-year in December, the joint-weakest pace since April. Within this, credit card lending rose 2.4%, the second-weakest performance since late 2014. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets on Thursday and will discuss whether to cut interest rates in response to the economic slowdown at the end of 2019 \u2013\u2013 or to stay put amid signs of recovery since December\u2019s election. It will be the last meeting chaired by Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor. He and two other policymakers have spoken publicly about the possibility of a rate cut after economic growth in the 12 months to November slowed to 0.6%, the weakest pace since 2012. The meeting takes place a day before the UK leaves the European Union. Carney\u2019s last day at the Bank is 15 March, before he becomes the UN\u2019s special envoy for climate action and finance. Separate figures from UK Finance, which represents UK banks and building societies, show that lenders approved the highest number of mortgages in more than four years in December. Mortgage approvals for house purchase hit 46,815, the most since August 2015. The value of mortgage lending rose the most since March 2016, up a net \u00a33.77bn. House price surveys are also pointing to a pick-up in the housing market since the general election in mid-December. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, says: December\u2019s jump in mortgage approvals adds to a growing amount of firmer data and survey evidence suggesting that the housing market could well be changing up a gear after a lacklustre 2019. In other news... Business morale in Germany worsened unexpectedly this month, after the economy narrowly avoided slipping into recession last year. Europe\u2019s largest economy expanded 0.6% in 2019, the weakest growth since 2013. The closely watched business climate index from the Ifo institute fell to 95.9 from 96.1 in December. Ifo president Clemens Fuest said companies had become more pessimistic looking ahead, while their assessment of the current situation had improved slightly. The German economy is starting the year in a cautious mood. Interestingly, business confidence in the service sector slumped while the struggling manufacturing sector showed signs of recovery. How will Hong Kong be affected? Its economy dipped into recession last year as the pro-democracy protests took their toll. Hong Kong has six confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and has banned residents of China\u2019s Hubei province from entering. According to Reuters, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has climbed to 81 and the virus has spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Japan, Canada and the United States. On the stock markets, shares of mining companies have been hit, as they are hugely dependent on demand from China. Evraz is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index in London, down 5.6%, and fellow miners Anglo American, Antofogasta and Rio Tinto have also tumbled. Luxury goods companies are also down again across Europe \u2013\u2013 Burberry, LVMH, Kering and L\u2019Or\u00e9al. London-listed Burberry has lost 5.3%, for example. Chinese consumers usually go on a spending spree during lunar new year, but this won\u2019t happen this time as the travel bans imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak have restricted the movement of tens of millions of people. Airline and travel stocks are in the red, including the UK cruise company Carnival. Prudential, Britain\u2019s biggest insurer, has slid 5.2%, as it makes a large chunk of its profits in Asia. The sell-off on stock markets is gathering pace. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index has tumbled more than 2%, or 154 points, to 7431.77. Germany\u2019s Dax down 206 points, or 1.52%, at 13,370 France\u2019s CAC down 100 points, or 1.68%, at 5923 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 204 points, or 0.85%, at 23,766 The Saudi energy minister mentioned the Sars outbreak. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) first appeared in November 2002 in southern China and killed more than 750 people in 37 countries. It was contained by placing patients in quarantine. The outbreak ended in 2004 and the disease has never resurfaced. The diseases are similar \u2013\u2013 Sars and the new virus are from the same coronavirus family, and both attack the lungs \u2013\u2013 but China has responded differently to the latest outbreak, which originated at a seafood market in Wuhan. Sars was traced back to virus-infected bats. Thomas Abraham, author of Twenty-First Century Plague: The Story of Sars, wrote in the Guardian last week: In 2002, China was in denial and concealed the existence of Sars not merely from the outside world but from its own people. Newspapers were forbidden from reporting the disease, except for occasional statements from government officials assuring the public that there was nothing to worry about ... The fallout from China\u2019s handling of Sars forced a move towards greater openness that has been apparent in other outbreaks of disease. In the case of the Wuhan flu, the World Health Organization as well as the public were informed on 31 December about the new disease. By early January, the virus had been identified as a coronavirus by Chinese scientists, and its genetic sequence had been shared globally. Both of these moves were essential for an effective global response to the disease. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, is closely monitoring developments in global oil markets as the deadly coronavirus spreads, amid \u201cgloomy expectations\u201d for the impact on the Chinese and global economy, the country\u2019s energy minister said on Monday. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the Opec oil cartel and its allies could act to restore the stability of the oil market if needed \u2013\u2013 but added he was confident that the Chinese government and international community would be able to contain the spread of the virus and eradicate it. Brent crude is down $1.1, or 1.83%, at $59.58 a barrel, after hitting $58.68 earlier, the lowest level since late October. US crude slid 1.1% to $53.1 a barrel, after falling as low as $52.1, the lowest since early October. Prince Abdulaziz said in a statement: Such extreme pessimism occurred back in 2003 during the Sars outbreak, though it did not cause a significant reduction in oil demand. He said the kingdom and other members of Opec, along with a group of other oil producers known as Opec+, have the capability and flexibility needed to respond to any developments, by taking the necessary actions to support oil market stability, if the situation so requires. Opec+, which includes Russia, has been pumping less oil to support prices. The Saudi energy minister said all options were open when Opec+ meets in Vienna in March, but added that it was too early to say whether more cuts to supply were needed. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen more than 110 points in early trading, losing 1.49% to 7473.29. Over on the continent, stocks have also tumbled. France\u2019s CAC has slid 1.7% while Germany\u2019s Dax and Spain\u2019s Ibex are both down 1.5%. You can follow the latest news about the spread of the deadly virus on our main news blog. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The year of the rat has not got off to a good start. Shares tumbled in the Asian markets that were open on Monday, as the death toll due to the coronavirus rose to at least 80 and the virus continued to spread. China extended its week-long lunar new year holiday by three days to 2 February and widened the restrictions that have curbed the movement of tens of millions of people. The head of the World Health Organisation will hold a special meeting with officials in Beijing today to discuss how to contain the coronavirus, as more cases were confirmed outside China. More than 400 people are critically ill and over 2,700 people are known to be infected in China, although experts are warning that up to 100,000 could be infected around the world. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 2%, its biggest one-day fall in five months. Markets in China, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong were closed for the lunar new year holiday. A Tokyo-listed China proxy, the ChinaAMC CSI 300 index ETF, shed 2.2%. European shares are expected to open more than 1% down, while safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, gold and US Treasury bonds are in demand. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, slumped below $59 a barrel, and later traded at $59.38, down $1.3 or 2.2%. China is the world\u2019s biggest oil importer.

While precise numbers are still debated, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/liberation-of-auschwitz\">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1-1.3 million Jews deported to the camp. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp.</p>\n    <p>When the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945, Soviet troops found grisly evidence of the horror. About 7,000 starving prisoners were found alive, and millions of items of clothing that once belonged to men, women and children were discovered along with 6,350kg of human hair.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In January 1942, the Nazi party had decided to roll out the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d. Camps dedicated solely to the extermination of Jews had been created before, but this was formalised by SS Lieut-Gen Reinhard Heydrich in a speech at the Wannsee conference. The extermination camp Auschwitz II was opened in the same year.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz II had the largest prisoner population of any of the three main camps on the site. In January 1942, the first chamber using lethal Zyklon B gas was built. Four further chambers were built, and these were used for systematic genocide up until November 1944.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz was also the site of disturbing medical experimentation on Jewish and Roma prisoners, including practices such as castration and sterilisation. SS captain Dr Josef Mengele was one of the physicians practising there.</p>\n    <p>More than 7,000 Nazi personnel are thought to have served at Auschwitz but only a few hundred have been prosecuted for the crimes committed there. The pursuit of justice has not ceased, with German justice officials saying in 2013 that there were 30 surviving Auschwitz officials who should face prosecution.

He is dangerous when his muscles are warm and loose, and his head clear. He feeds off good vibes and suffers when railing against demons, real and perceived.</p> <p>What mixed baggage, then, he took on to Rod Laver Arena on Monday night against Rafael Nadal, whom he respects but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/16/nick-kyrgios-slams-cringeworthy-djokovic-and-salty-nadal-ahead-of-french-open\" title=\"\">does not regard</a> with particular affection.

His heart pumped loudly through his salmon pink T-shirt, as ever. Would his emotions overwhelm him?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/nick-kyrgios-shows-resilience-but-cannot-halt-defeat-to-rafael-nadal\">Nick Kyrgios wins hearts but ruthless Rafael Nadal takes the spoils</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The backdrop of tragedy created a complicated narrative for Kyrgios, who is 25 in April. He had business to take care of. He was playing an opponent who owns 19 majors. Sure, he\u2019d beaten Nadal before: memorably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/01/nick-kyrgios-rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2014\" title=\"\">as a teenager at Wimbledon in 2014</a>, and twice on hard courts, in Cincinnati in 2017 and in Acapulco last year when their rivalry bubbled up into acrimony. But he had lost to him four times, as well. No shame there. Just accrued frustration.</p> <p>Kyrgios said after the win in Mexico that Nadal was a \u201csuper salty\u201d loser. Reminded this week of the barbed comment, Nadal said: \u201cI don\u2019t know him personally, honestly, to have a clear opinion.\u201d Which is opinion enough.</p> <p>The last time they played, Kyrgios affected swaggering, dude-like nonchalance, preparing with a couple of pints in Wimbledon village last summer, the night before their second-round match. When they went at it, Kyrgios speared the Spaniard with a full-blooded shot from the baseline which produced a long, withering stare from Nadal. Kyrgios loved that immensely. And lost.</p> <p>This time, he left a week between a quiet midnight libation at a Melbourne bar and the serious stuff of trying to get into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open for the second time. That\u2019s dedication for you.</p> <p>From the opening bell, this fourth-round ding-dong felt more like a world title fight, the Australian doing his best to knock the old boy\u2019s head off. Kyrgios\u2019s best chance was a quick knockout. Three aces in the first quarter of an hour signalled his bad intentions. But his early, wild haymakers caught the net too often, or strayed long. Round one whizzed by.</p> <p>The tattoo on Kyrgios\u2019s right hand reads \u201cInspire others\u201d \u2013 which is a better message than some he has sent down the years. However \u2013 whether because of the probation period which has shackled his outbursts recently or his late maturing \u2013 he has recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/16/nick-kyrgios-how-tenniss-loudest-talent-became-a-hero-to-the-quiet-australians\" title=\"\">gone from villain to good guy in Australia</a>, lifting a nation\u2019s morale by leading the charity calls to help bushfire victims. His tennis has hit a new pitch as well.</p> <p>Invariably, Kyrgios is involved in the most engrossing matches at any tournament, often for the right reasons. Even against the unseeded Italian, Lorenzo Sonego, he needed two tense tie-breaks to squeeze into the second round. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/23/nick-kyrgios-wins-war-with-himself-gilles-simon-australian-open-tennis\" title=\"\">Gilles Simon stretched him over four sets</a>, and another tie-break; then he had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/25/australian-open-tennis-nick-kyrgios-beats-karen-khachanov-report\" title=\"\">get into the trenches with Karen Khachanov</a>, who kept him on his favourite battlefield, Melbourne Arena, for nearly four-and-a-half hours, four sets and three more tie-breaks. Only John Isner, surely, plays in more shootouts in big tournaments.</p> <p>When Kyrgios stood on court on Saturday night, plainly drained, answering questions from Jim Courier after his third win of the week, he looked despairingly at his American inquisitor and said: \u201cMate, both my legs weigh about 40kg at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>They did not look a lot lighter in the early exchanges against Nadal, who was as feather-footed as ever. He sensed Kyrgios would, at some point, let his heart tell his racket what his head would not \u2013 and going for a second-serve ace at 6-6 in the tie-break was it.</p> <p>For all that Nadal has as much flair in him as anyone, he will opt for the correct and safe option nearly every time \u2013 which unsettled Kyrgios, who wanted to trade genius.

      "bodyText": "Nick Kyrgios invariably plays his best tennis when he generates his own drama rather than when someone else writes the script \u2013 like an army of moralists poring over his every twitch. He is dangerous when his muscles are warm and loose, and his head clear. He feeds off good vibes and suffers when railing against demons, real and perceived. What mixed baggage, then, he took on to Rod Laver Arena on Monday night against Rafael Nadal, whom he respects but does not regard with particular affection. That was the edginess punters came to witness. They wanted a tennis punch-up. They got one of the best contests of the first eight days, and a Nadal victory in four sets: 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4). There was more than a tennis match going on here, though. Kyrgios, a passionate basketball fan and admirer of Kobe Bryant, warmed up in a Lakers shirt to mark his hero\u2019s passing in a helicopter crash in Los Angeles on Sunday. His heart pumped loudly through his salmon pink T-shirt, as ever. Would his emotions overwhelm him? The backdrop of tragedy created a complicated narrative for Kyrgios, who is 25 in April. He had business to take care of. He was playing an opponent who owns 19 majors. Sure, he\u2019d beaten Nadal before: memorably as a teenager at Wimbledon in 2014, and twice on hard courts, in Cincinnati in 2017 and in Acapulco last year when their rivalry bubbled up into acrimony. But he had lost to him four times, as well. No shame there. Just accrued frustration. Kyrgios said after the win in Mexico that Nadal was a \u201csuper salty\u201d loser. Reminded this week of the barbed comment, Nadal said: \u201cI don\u2019t know him personally, honestly, to have a clear opinion.\u201d Which is opinion enough. The last time they played, Kyrgios affected swaggering, dude-like nonchalance, preparing with a couple of pints in Wimbledon village last summer, the night before their second-round match. When they went at it, Kyrgios speared the Spaniard with a full-blooded shot from the baseline which produced a long, withering stare from Nadal. Kyrgios loved that immensely. And lost. This time, he left a week between a quiet midnight libation at a Melbourne bar and the serious stuff of trying to get into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open for the second time. That\u2019s dedication for you. From the opening bell, this fourth-round ding-dong felt more like a world title fight, the Australian doing his best to knock the old boy\u2019s head off. Kyrgios\u2019s best chance was a quick knockout. Three aces in the first quarter of an hour signalled his bad intentions. But his early, wild haymakers caught the net too often, or strayed long. Round one whizzed by. The tattoo on Kyrgios\u2019s right hand reads \u201cInspire others\u201d \u2013 which is a better message than some he has sent down the years. However \u2013 whether because of the probation period which has shackled his outbursts recently or his late maturing \u2013 he has recently gone from villain to good guy in Australia, lifting a nation\u2019s morale by leading the charity calls to help bushfire victims. His tennis has hit a new pitch as well. Invariably, Kyrgios is involved in the most engrossing matches at any tournament, often for the right reasons. Even against the unseeded Italian, Lorenzo Sonego, he needed two tense tie-breaks to squeeze into the second round. Gilles Simon stretched him over four sets, and another tie-break; then he had to get into the trenches with Karen Khachanov, who kept him on his favourite battlefield, Melbourne Arena, for nearly four-and-a-half hours, four sets and three more tie-breaks. Only John Isner, surely, plays in more shootouts in big tournaments. When Kyrgios stood on court on Saturday night, plainly drained, answering questions from Jim Courier after his third win of the week, he looked despairingly at his American inquisitor and said: \u201cMate, both my legs weigh about 40kg at the moment.\u201d They did not look a lot lighter in the early exchanges against Nadal, who was as feather-footed as ever. He sensed Kyrgios would, at some point, let his heart tell his racket what his head would not \u2013 and going for a second-serve ace at 6-6 in the tie-break was it. For all that Nadal has as much flair in him as anyone, he will opt for the correct and safe option nearly every time \u2013 which unsettled Kyrgios, who wanted to trade genius. The older man is also a master at husbanding his resources, rarely looks near collapse, always moving with economy. At 6-5 in the third, Nadal did more running in one point than Mo Farah does in a week. It bamboozled his younger opponent. Under pressure, Nadal goes back to basics; Kyrgios often, but not this night, goes to pieces. At 1-2 and a break down in the fourth, the world No 26 was on the ropes; there would be no knockout. He did not give up. After three hours, he was still banging down aces, his 22nd for the match, 97th for the week. With sponsors kicking in, that was worth nearly A$100,000 (\u00a351,000) to the victims of the bushfires still roaring in the distance. Kyrgios would love a century of aces, for symmetry and charity. Serving to stay in the tournament, he added two down the T for 99, and held. Then he broke. The script was in his hand once more. But he stumbled again. So did Nadal. Tie-break time \u2013 and the 100th ace arrived, but too late. Economy of thought and movement triumphed over anarchic freewheeling. It was done, a minor masterpiece lasting three hours and 38 minutes. The Entertainment Man and his Spanish straight man had given everyone something to smile about \u2013 including themselves.

      "bodyText": "The number of mortgages approved by Britain\u2019s high street banks jumped to the highest level for almost five years in December, in the latest sign of a revival in the housing market. Mortgage approvals for house purchases increased to 46,815 in December compared with 44,058 a month earlier, according to UK Finance \u2013 hitting the highest level since April 2015. The trade body that represents major high street banks across the country said the value of mortgage lending increased the most since March 2016, rising by a net \u00a33.8bn. The figures come as the Bank of England weighs up cutting interest rates on Thursday after the UK economy flatlined at the end of last year amid intense political uncertainty over Brexit and the snap general election. City economists believe a decision between holding borrowing costs steady and cutting the key rate from the current level of 0.75% rests on a knife edge before Mark Carney\u2019s final meeting in charge of the monetary policy committee on Thursday. The Bank\u2019s governor will be replaced by Andrew Bailey, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, in March. Retail sales unexpectedly plunged in December while inflation dropped, in a reflection of weakness in the economy at the end of the year. However, a rise in mortgage borrowing, a jump in employment levels and increasing business confidence since Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory could encourage the Bank to leave rates on hold. According to the property website Rightmove, house prices rose on the month in December at the fastest rate on record for the time of the year, as buyers and sellers felt more confident about the outlook for the housing market. Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said it was likely that mortgage approvals were lifted by increased confidence since the election. \u201cPrior to November, mortgage approvals for house purchases had fallen back for three successive months to be at a seven-month low in October, indicating that activity was being pressurised by heightened uncertainties over the domestic political situation and Brexit,\u201d he said. However, Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said any post-election bounce would be shown in the January data, as it took about two weeks for buyers to receive a mortgage offer. He said the jump in December probably reflected falling borrowing costs for households in the second half of 2019. The rise in mortgage approvals comes amid intense competition among high street banks to sell home loans. According to the consultancy Capital Economics, the average quoted rate on a five-year fixed, 75% loan-to-value mortgage fell from 2.05% in January 2019 to 1.69% in December \u2013 the lowest on record. Gabriella Dickens, an assistant economist at the consultancy, said: \u201cSo instead of reflecting a broader expansion in credit, much of the annual rise recorded by UK Finance reflects these lenders competing for market share.\u201d Despite the upturn in mortgage approvals, the outlook for the housing market will also depend on the next phase of the Brexit talks with Brussels, as the government attempts to strike a trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020. Andrew Montlake, the managing director of the mortgage broker Coreco, said: \u201cIt goes without saying that a huge amount is riding on the outcome of the trade negotiations and so there is still the potential for significant volatility.\u201d",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

When the outbreak of a virulent new disease such as the coronavirus is identified, the starting gun is fired on a vast, multimillion-dollar international effort to try to contain it. But nothing can start before a health professional determines that, against the odds, they are confronting something exceptional. \u201cYou need to work through that process, establish that this is an out-of-the-ordinary disease and say, let\u2019s do lab tests on it,\u201d says Jonathan Quick, an adjunct professor of global health and author of The End of Epidemics. Sometimes the signs are clear: health workers becoming infected, or patients growing sicker or dying faster than expected. Other cases rely on a hunch. In 2003, the Italian specialist Carlo Urbani was asked to examine a patient in a Vietnamese hospital with symptoms of influenza. Urbani saw a different pattern. He commissioned tests, reinforced infection controls around the patient and alerted the World Health Organization. A global alert for a virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was declared 12 days later. Urbani died from it the following month. Advances in medical science by the late 1960s led some experts to declare that humanity had conquered infectious diseases. It was wishful thinking. Two decades into the 21st century, viruses are breaking out more frequently than in the past, data shows.

The same urgent need for transparency applies to scientists studying the disease, some of whom have been incentivised in the past to withhold important findings in a crisis for fear they may not be able to publish them in medical journals later. The impulse for secrecy even extended to Liberian villages afflicted with Ebola, where out of fear and mistrust some families would hide sick or deceased relatives from medical teams. \u201cInformation sharing is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d says Rebecca Katz, the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know something is happening, you can\u2019t stop it.\u201d Once an outbreak is identified, the focus can shift to stopping its spread, which in theory is straightforward. \u201cYour rate of growth needs to be less than one,\u201d says Joshua Ginsberg, the president of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. \u201cIf every person who gets the disease gives it to slightly less than one person, then the disease will go away.\u201d That requires determining who is already sick, and who may become so.

      "body": "<p>A high-profile civil rights activist has been arrested in Pakistan on charges of sedition in the latest incident in a mounting crackdown on critics of the army.</p> <p>Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen was arrested in the north-western city of Peshawar at around 2am on Monday morning on five charges, including criminal conspiracy and sedition.</p> <p>The 28-year-old is the charismatic leader of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), which defends the rights of of Pakistan\u2019s largest ethnic minority, the Pashtuns.</p> <p>He has established himself as a thorn in the side of the powerful military, publicly accusing it of human rights abuses including kidnappings and forced disappearances, and of secretly allying with the Pakistani Taliban. The PTM has also drawn thousands of people on to the streets in protests against the military over the past two years.</p> <p>The civilian Pakistan government, led by the prime minister, Imran Khan, is notorious for its alleged close ties to the military. Since Khan\u2019s election, journalists, activists and critics of the military have increasingly been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/extreme-fear-and-self-censorship-media-in-pakistan-under-attack\">targeted, silenced and detained.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/extreme-fear-and-self-censorship-media-in-pakistan-under-attack\">'Extreme fear and self-censorship': media freedom under threat in Pakistan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with the Guardian hours before his arrest, Pashteen emphasised how the PTM was \u201cnon violent\u201d and simply seeking \u201cjustice and the Pakistani courts to do their job\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe PTM has demanded the formation of a \u2018truth commission\u2019 to investigate extrajudicial killings, land mines in former federally administered tribal areas region and enforced disappearances,\u201d he said over the phone as he drove to Peshawar. He was detained hours later.</p> <p>Pashteen added: \u201cWe want fundamental rights ensured by Pakistani constitution. We are against human rights abuses and torture. Our movement is to provide justice to [the] Pashtun minority who have been affected due to the war against terror.\u201d</p> <p>The police\u2019s first incident report (FIR), seen by the Guardian, stated that Pashteen was arrested on the basis of a speech made on 18 January, in which he called the Pakistan constitution \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cagainst human rights\u201d because it enshrined the rule of the Punjabi majority and stripped the Pashtuns of power.</p> <p>Pashteen will be held in pre-trial police detention for the next two weeks. Some of the charges he is facing carry life sentences.</p> <p>Pashteen was born in the war torn region of Pakistan\u2019s South Waziristan, formerly referred to as federally administered tribal areas (FATA), which borders Afghanistan and has been decimated by years of fighting between militants and government forces. Pashteen\u2019s family was one of millions who fled the region during clashes between the Pakistani military and insurgents between 2004 and 2017.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/02/pakistani-army-manzoor-pashteen-pashtun\">He shot to fame as a civil rights activist in January 2018</a> when he and others in the Pashtun community began protests against the extrajudicial killing of a young man at the hands of the anti-terrorism police officer Rao Anwar in Karachi. Anwar also is accused of the extrajudicial deaths of 444 people.</p> <p>Pashteen began the PTM two years ago but it quickly gathered momentum in its opposition to the military\u2019s actions in the former FATA, despite an almost blanket media blackout on their activities. In turn, the authorities have increasingly targeted PMT members and activists and the military publicly accused the PMT of being funded by foreign intelligence services.</p> <p>Sanna Ejaz, a female leader of the PTM, said: \u201cManzoor was arrested last night on false charges. We never have been anti-state nor anti-constitution. We demand constitutional rights.\u201d</p> <p>Ejaz described how members of PTM had been targeted and said she had lost her job as a TV host because of her involvement with PTM activism. \u201cMy family has been harassed, I am harassed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a female activist, our pictures get used in negative ways to threaten our families. The military establishment has developed a sense of fear by killing our activists and harassing them so that people don\u2019t join PTM and ask for democratic rights.\u201d</p> <p>In May, two of senior PTM figures, Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir, were detained after a clash between PTM members and army personnel in North Waziristan, and held for four months on no charges.</p> <p>In a Twitter post, Dawar condemned Pashteen\u2019s arrest. \u201cThis is our punishment for demanding our rights in a peaceful democratic manner,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Manzoor\u2019s arrest will only strengthen our resolve.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A high-profile civil rights activist has been arrested in Pakistan on charges of sedition in the latest incident in a mounting crackdown on critics of the army. Manzoor Ahmad Pashteen was arrested in the north-western city of Peshawar at around 2am on Monday morning on five charges, including criminal conspiracy and sedition. The 28-year-old is the charismatic leader of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), which defends the rights of of Pakistan\u2019s largest ethnic minority, the Pashtuns. He has established himself as a thorn in the side of the powerful military, publicly accusing it of human rights abuses including kidnappings and forced disappearances, and of secretly allying with the Pakistani Taliban. The PTM has also drawn thousands of people on to the streets in protests against the military over the past two years. The civilian Pakistan government, led by the prime minister, Imran Khan, is notorious for its alleged close ties to the military. Since Khan\u2019s election, journalists, activists and critics of the military have increasingly been targeted, silenced and detained. In an interview with the Guardian hours before his arrest, Pashteen emphasised how the PTM was \u201cnon violent\u201d and simply seeking \u201cjustice and the Pakistani courts to do their job\u201d. \u201cThe PTM has demanded the formation of a \u2018truth commission\u2019 to investigate extrajudicial killings, land mines in former federally administered tribal areas region and enforced disappearances,\u201d he said over the phone as he drove to Peshawar. He was detained hours later. Pashteen added: \u201cWe want fundamental rights ensured by Pakistani constitution. We are against human rights abuses and torture. Our movement is to provide justice to [the] Pashtun minority who have been affected due to the war against terror.\u201d The police\u2019s first incident report (FIR), seen by the Guardian, stated that Pashteen was arrested on the basis of a speech made on 18 January, in which he called the Pakistan constitution \u201cwrong\u201d and \u201cagainst human rights\u201d because it enshrined the rule of the Punjabi majority and stripped the Pashtuns of power. Pashteen will be held in pre-trial police detention for the next two weeks. Some of the charges he is facing carry life sentences. Pashteen was born in the war torn region of Pakistan\u2019s South Waziristan, formerly referred to as federally administered tribal areas (FATA), which borders Afghanistan and has been decimated by years of fighting between militants and government forces. Pashteen\u2019s family was one of millions who fled the region during clashes between the Pakistani military and insurgents between 2004 and 2017. He shot to fame as a civil rights activist in January 2018 when he and others in the Pashtun community began protests against the extrajudicial killing of a young man at the hands of the anti-terrorism police officer Rao Anwar in Karachi. Anwar also is accused of the extrajudicial deaths of 444 people. Pashteen began the PTM two years ago but it quickly gathered momentum in its opposition to the military\u2019s actions in the former FATA, despite an almost blanket media blackout on their activities. In turn, the authorities have increasingly targeted PMT members and activists and the military publicly accused the PMT of being funded by foreign intelligence services. Sanna Ejaz, a female leader of the PTM, said: \u201cManzoor was arrested last night on false charges. We never have been anti-state nor anti-constitution. We demand constitutional rights.\u201d Ejaz described how members of PTM had been targeted and said she had lost her job as a TV host because of her involvement with PTM activism. \u201cMy family has been harassed, I am harassed,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a female activist, our pictures get used in negative ways to threaten our families. The military establishment has developed a sense of fear by killing our activists and harassing them so that people don\u2019t join PTM and ask for democratic rights.\u201d In May, two of senior PTM figures, Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir, were detained after a clash between PTM members and army personnel in North Waziristan, and held for four months on no charges. In a Twitter post, Dawar condemned Pashteen\u2019s arrest. \u201cThis is our punishment for demanding our rights in a peaceful democratic manner,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Manzoor\u2019s arrest will only strengthen our resolve.\u201d",

The south-east division of Counter Terrorism Policing was forced to recall the document, which listed the climate crisis group alongside neo-Nazis and jihadists, after it was exposed by the Guardian. After the Guardian revealed the document\u2019s existence Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) branded it an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d and said it \u201cwas produced at a local level\u201d. But now, after an internal review, the unit has confirmed the guide was sent to the Home Office, the Department for Education, NHS England, the Ministry of Defence, HM Prison Service, Probation Service and Ofsted, as well as 20 local authorities, five police forces and Counter Terrorism Policing headquarters (CTPHQ) in London. The guide placed Extinction Rebellion alongside neo-Nazi groups and jihadists and encouraged public sector workers to report any individuals with links to them to Prevent, the controversial anti-radicalisation programme. The distribution list shows a wide range of organisations across the country were in receipt of it for more than a month before it was recalled and prompted questions over the lack of action taken by CTPHQ, the Home Office and others to flag its contents. Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP and chair of the home affairs select committee in the last parliament, said: \u201cThe Home Office should explain what action they took when they received the CTPSE guidance and also whether they have yet asked other regional counter-terror units to review and share with the Home Office their counter-terror guidance to make sure they aren\u2019t getting it wrong in the same way. \u201cThe Home Office should show some leadership and responsibility on this.

As for breeding its own scientists, that is apparently beyond its capacity.</p> <p>It is not for want of trying. The Cult of Science has been an obsession since the 1979 general election, when Thatcher first declared that Britain needed more scientists. The humanities and social sciences were treated as subversive, unproductive, valueless and, worst of all, unquantifiable. In both Britain and the US, education policy had been traumatised by the Soviets putting a man in space \u2013 the result, it was believed, of making all young Russians study science. No one noticed that they were starved of politics and economics.</p> <p>For decades, every British election manifesto became a Kitchener-like plea for recruits to the cause. Science and its acolyte maths were elevated to \u201ccore subjects\u201d. By the turn of the century, science was virtually a new religion. To question it was heresy.

Economic success was based instead on finance, design, marketing and trade. Everyone knows this, yet it remains anathema to say so. The priests have even brainwashed an erstwhile classicist prime minister.</p> <p>At which point, another neglected discipline might raise its head: ethics. By what right does Britain slam the door on \u201cuntalented\u201d economic migrants from the world\u2019s poorer countries, while boasting it will raid their reserves of scientific talent? The NHS already devastates the medical graduate pools of India and Africa. Now Britain is to poach whatever scientists they have left. This is aid-in-reverse: \u201csoft power\u201d at its crudest and most imperial.</p> <p>There is no rhyme or reason to the new populism. It is driven by chauvinism and outdated cliches. Britain does not \u201cneed\u201d more scientists. It needs what its employers will pay to recruit. A Tory government should accept that the labour market knows best.

      "bodyText": "Now we know. Boris Johnson\u2019s exclusive \u201cglobal talent visa\u201d, to be launched in February, is aimed at \u201cthe world\u2019s scientists and mathematicians\u201d. It will prove, he says, that post-Brexit \u201cthe UK is open to the most talented minds in the world\u201d \u2013 so long as they are scientists. As for entrepreneurs, economists, humanitarians, historians, artists, let alone mere caring human beings, they should stay put. Johnson\u2019s home secretary, Priti Patel, says it is \u201cabout time\u201d Britain learned to breed its own lesser class of worker. As for breeding its own scientists, that is apparently beyond its capacity. It is not for want of trying. The Cult of Science has been an obsession since the 1979 general election, when Thatcher first declared that Britain needed more scientists. The humanities and social sciences were treated as subversive, unproductive, valueless and, worst of all, unquantifiable. In both Britain and the US, education policy had been traumatised by the Soviets putting a man in space \u2013 the result, it was believed, of making all young Russians study science. No one noticed that they were starved of politics and economics. For decades, every British election manifesto became a Kitchener-like plea for recruits to the cause. Science and its acolyte maths were elevated to \u201ccore subjects\u201d. By the turn of the century, science was virtually a new religion. To question it was heresy. Its priesthood ruled the curriculum, crammed the honours list and received acres of uncritical airtime from the BBC. What happened was nothing. The British car, ship, airline and computing industries all but collapsed. A draconian emphasis on maths has merely led to Britain having to rely on the Chinese for digital infrastructure. Economic success was based instead on finance, design, marketing and trade. Everyone knows this, yet it remains anathema to say so. The priests have even brainwashed an erstwhile classicist prime minister. At which point, another neglected discipline might raise its head: ethics. By what right does Britain slam the door on \u201cuntalented\u201d economic migrants from the world\u2019s poorer countries, while boasting it will raid their reserves of scientific talent? The NHS already devastates the medical graduate pools of India and Africa. Now Britain is to poach whatever scientists they have left. This is aid-in-reverse: \u201csoft power\u201d at its crudest and most imperial. There is no rhyme or reason to the new populism. It is driven by chauvinism and outdated cliches. Britain does not \u201cneed\u201d more scientists. It needs what its employers will pay to recruit. A Tory government should accept that the labour market knows best. Britain\u2019s economic performance \u2013 and its wider culture \u2013 has long benefited from immigrants, be they rich or poor at the point of entry. Turning them away makes no sense. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Newly released emails between the office of Mike Pompeo and NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly cast further doubt on the secretary of state\u2019s extraordinary claim that the journalist lied to him before a contentious interview. Pompeo, who reportedly subjected Kelly to an expletive-ridden rant in his private living room after an interview during which he was asked about his role in the Ukraine scandal, issued a statement in which he accused the reporter of violating \u201cthe basic rules of journalism and decency\u201d. Kelly maintained that her meeting with Pompeo after the recorded interview was not agreed to be off the record. NPR has stood by its reporter and emails quoted by the Washington Post show Kelly clearly expressing that Ukraine would be discussed. Donald Trump weighed in over the weekend, questioning the legitimacy of the independent nonprofit media outlet, one of America\u2019s most trusted news sources. In a tweet on Sunday, Trump agreed with comments that labelled the station, which reaches 120 million monthly listeners, a \u201cbig-government, Democrat party propaganda operation\u201d and asked: \u201cWhy does NPR still exist?\u201d \u201cA very good question!\u201d the president responded. Pompeo was subjected to rigorous questioning on the administration\u2019s handling of Iran and the Ukraine scandal last Friday by Kelly, a veteran foreign policy reporter. He grew audibly frustrated as the interview continued. The secretary of state, at the centre of the scandal that has engulfed Trump\u2019s presidency and led to his impeachment, was asked why he had not expressed support for the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted from her position as Trump pressed for investigations into his domestic political rivals. The email exchanges obtained by the Post, between Kelly and Pompeo press aide Katie Martin, were sent a day before the interview and clearly show Pompeo\u2019s office was told he should expect questions on the issue. \u201cJust wanted to touch base that we still intend to keep the interview to Iran tomorrow,\u201d Martin stated. \u201cKnow you just got back from Tehran so we would like to stick to Iran as the topic as opposed to jumping around.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How many people have been affected?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.

Other companies, including the banking firm Standard Chartered, imposed travel bans to the city of Wuhan.

According to the Financial Times, the bank is also offering temperature checks at its main office.</p> \n<p>Standard Chartered, which is based in London but makes most of its profits and has most of its staff in Asia, is reducing face-to-face working in China and Hong Kong alongside its travel restrictions. It is also offering training on disinfecting and deep-cleansing buildings, teaching staff to recognise symptoms, and providing masks and hand sanitisers. </p> \n<p>Luxury goods makers with significant sales in China and Asia plunged on financial markets across Europe, including Burberry and LVMH.

However, GDP growth recovered to 10% in the second half of 2003.</p> \n<p>This time around, the Chinese economy is much larger and more connected to the global economy. However, analysts said the government response to the coronavirus outbreak appeared to be tougher and more transparent, which could help limit the impact.</p> \n<p>Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said Chinese GDP growth would be significantly damaged by the outbreak. Rail passenger numbers on Saturday, the first day of the lunar new year, were 42% lower than on the equivalent day in 2019 and road passengers 25% lower. The declines in May 2003, the peak month of the Sars outbreak, were 57% and 45% respectively.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control quicker than Sars was in 2003, the economic impact now looks likely to be of at least a similar scale,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Financial markets around the world have been rocked as an exodus of foreign workers from China intensified fears over the impact of the coronavirus on the world\u2019s second largest economy. Major global companies have begun pulling staff from the province of Hubei at the hear of the outbreak or imposed travel restrictions on staff across Asia, telling any workers who visited the region to stay at home. Global shares slid despite the Chinese authorities stepping up their response, with more than 2,700 cases and 81 deaths confirmed. The FTSE 100 closed down by more than 2%, or 174 points, at 7,412 and other European markets sustained heavy losses as concerns increased over China\u2019s economy as it attempts to bounce back from its long-running trade conflict with the US. Shares dropped on Wall Street and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by about 400 points, tumbling from record high levels recorded earlier this year. The French automotive group Peugeot said it was working to evacuate 38 international employees and their families from Hubei, where it has three production sites. Other companies, including the banking firm Standard Chartered, imposed travel bans to the city of Wuhan. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, also restricted travel, while HSBC said it was closely monitoring the situation for the safety of its employees. In a signal of the impact on international business, Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, sent staff in Hong Kong a memo telling them to work from home and not to travel to its headquarters in the city if they had visited the mainland in the last 14 days. According to the Financial Times, the bank is also offering temperature checks at its main office. Standard Chartered, which is based in London but makes most of its profits and has most of its staff in Asia, is reducing face-to-face working in China and Hong Kong alongside its travel restrictions. It is also offering training on disinfecting and deep-cleansing buildings, teaching staff to recognise symptoms, and providing masks and hand sanitisers. Luxury goods makers with significant sales in China and Asia plunged on financial markets across Europe, including Burberry and LVMH. Such firms would usually stand to benefit from a rise in sales from the lunar new year celebrations last Saturday. Airlines and hotel groups, which could face losses because of travel bans, came under heavy selling pressure, while mining firms that have benefited from China\u2019s manufacturing boom in recent years also fell in value. Anglo American and Glencore also suffered, while the price of a barrel of oil fell by around 3% to below $60 amid concerns that the outbreak could exacerbate an economic slowdown in China and the rest of the world. Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at the financial trading group IG, said: \u201cThe further this virus spreads, the worse it will be for Chinese economic output. We are also seeing commodity stocks slump, with the prospect of a decline in Chinese growth hurting expectations of demand in the sector.\u201d Safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds jumped. Chinese financial markets were closed for the lunar new year, while Bloomberg reported that stock markets in the country could remain closed until at least next Monday as Beijing grapples with the worsening crisis. Comparisons with the 2003 Sars outbreak have highlighted the potential for a prolonged process that could damage economic growth. After the Sars outbreak, China\u2019s annual GDP growth fell to 9.1% in the second quarter of 2003 from 11.1% in the previous three-month period, as the government imposed travel restrictions. However, GDP growth recovered to 10% in the second half of 2003. This time around, the Chinese economy is much larger and more connected to the global economy. However, analysts said the government response to the coronavirus outbreak appeared to be tougher and more transparent, which could help limit the impact. Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said Chinese GDP growth would be significantly damaged by the outbreak. Rail passenger numbers on Saturday, the first day of the lunar new year, were 42% lower than on the equivalent day in 2019 and road passengers 25% lower. The declines in May 2003, the peak month of the Sars outbreak, were 57% and 45% respectively. \u201cEven if the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control quicker than Sars was in 2003, the economic impact now looks likely to be of at least a similar scale,\u201d he said.",

At one stage the company was valued at more than \u00a31bn, but the price has tumbled since the company\u2019s shares started trading on the London Stock Exchange at 275p in June 2018. They plunged again on the latest announcement, down 20% to 53p. Benamor\u2019s Richmond Group investment vehicle owns a 61% stake in Amigo, and the lender said it had been informed by Richmond that it was a \u201cwilling seller\u201d of its holding. Amigo said no approaches had been made, though John Cronin, an analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said: \u201cOur own suspicion is that talks have taken place and there is some confidence that there is at least one buyer(s) for the business. This should smoke more out.\u201d Amigo offers loans of between \u00a3500 and \u00a310,000 at a representative interest rate of 49.9% APR, but has faced challenges on a number of fronts. The Financial Conduct Authority has been taking a growing interest in the sector because it is worried that the proportion of guarantors who are having to step in to cover missed loan repayments has been growing. The regulator recently completed a review of the industry, forcing Amigo to give more information to family and friends about the risks associated with backing loan agreements. Meanwhile, there has been a sharp increase in the number of customer complaints about Amigo to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The FOS received 266 new cases during the first six months of 2019, more than double the 117 in the first half of 2018. A surge in costly complaints was one of the key factors that led to the demise of payday lender Wonga. In its latest statement, Amigo said it faced a \u201cchallenging operating environment\u201d, and that while it remained confident about the robustness of its approach to lending, \u201cwe are concerned there may be increased pressure on our business and a continual evolution in the approach of the Financial Ombudsman Service\u201d. Cronin said his firm had previously highlighted complaints as \u201cthe number one risk\u201d in terms of Amigo as an investment. The City regulator is looking into affordability measures across the whole subprime sector, which could spark further changes at Amigo. In December, there was a boardroom shake-up at the company, with an announcement that chief executive Hamish Paton and chairman Stephan Wilcke would both be stepping down.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump was tweeting about John Bolton before dawn on Monday, after news of former national security adviser\u2019s forthcoming book roiled Washington during the president\u2019s impeachment trial. But if Trump looked elsewhere on his phone, to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released on Monday, he might have found consolation. Amid signs that more voters are in general less worried about the economy and their own economic wellbeing, and a week out from the Iowa caucuses, the national poll gave the president encouraging scores against contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. In notional general election match-ups, Trump trailed former vice-president Joe Biden with registered voters by four points (50%-46%); Vermont senator Bernie Sanders by two (49%-47%); and Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar by one (48%-47%). Those deficits against the top Democrats have roughly halved since a similar poll at the end of 2019. Less comfortingly for Trump, the poll found that he trailed the former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg by three points, 49%-46%. The billionaire, who has taken jabs at Trump\u2019s relative lack of wealth, is not competing in Iowa and has not appeared on the debate stage. The poll found Trump level with the Des Moines Register-endorsed Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, at 48% each, and put him ahead of one leading contender for the Democratic nomination. Trump led former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg by three points, 48% to 45%. Buttigieg\u2019s camp this weekend responded to a surge from Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire by sending out fundraising messages which read: \u201cBernie Sanders could be the nominee \u2026 we risk nominating a candidate who cannot beat Donald Trump in November. And that\u2019s a risk we can\u2019t take.\u201d The former mayor, 38, held a Fox News town hall in Iowa on Sunday night, seeking to reach out to disaffected Republican voters. The Post/ABC poll was conducted before news of Bolton\u2019s claims regarding Trump and Ukraine broke over Washington like a thunderclap. Asked who they thought would win the White House in November, 49% of respondents picked the president to 43% for his Democratic challenger. Reporting its own poll and its findings about the economy under Trump, ABC said: \u201cOne year before he took office, 63% of Americans said they were worried about maintaining their standard of living. Today, 43% say so, a broad 20-point drop in personal economic uncertainty.\u201d It also reported \u201ca vast gender gap\u201d, with the Democrats leading Trump by 23 to 30 points among women but Trump leading by 15 to 24 among men. If the gap was in evidence on election day, ABC said, it would \u201cnearly double the previous record gender gap in exit polls dating to 1976, 24 points in 2016\u201d. Controversy lingered over the weekend about Sanders\u2019 apparent endorsement by the comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan. The Vermont senator celebrated the coup, which many observers said could help him win white male voters from Trump. But Rogan\u2019s enthusiasm for Sanders prompted a backlash from progressive groups.",

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has called for Scotland to have its own visa and immigration strategy to deal with the country\u2019s falling birth rate and the impacts of Brexit. The first minister urged the UK government to start talks on devolving migration powers to the Scottish parliament, to allow it to introduce a flexible \u201cScottish visa\u201d without the tight restrictions in force across the rest of the UK. Holyrood would scrap the hefty application fees, salary threshold and employer sponsorship required by the Home Office, she said. This regional model is already used by Canadian provinces and Australian states. Sturgeon said the prime minister should accept the need for a more flexible immigration system tailored to meet Scotland\u2019s particular needs during his government\u2019s review of the post-Brexit immigration system. The UK government announced on Monday it would launch a fast-track visa system for talented scientists on 20 February, amid widespread concern that the UK\u2019s research capacity will be hit by Brexit. Sturgeon said ending free movement from within the EU would harm the UK as a whole but would be \u201cuniquely\u201d damaging for Scotland\u2019s economy and public services, because it is particularly vulnerable to population decline. \u201cA common UK-wide approach to immigration simply hasn\u2019t worked in Scotland\u2019s interests for some time now. Brexit will undoubtedly exacerbate what was already a significant challenge,\u201d she said. The Scottish government would be the sole sponsor of applicants for a Scottish visa and would screen applications. It would then recommend people to the Home Office, which would undertake final security and identity checks, and could refuse entry if applicants failed those tests. Applicants for a Scottish visa would need to get a Scottish income tax code from HM Revenue and Customs to prove they were resident in Scotland, and that visa would lapse if they left for any other part of the UK. Sturgeon said Scotland was facing a population crisis because its falling birth rate and ageing population left its economy and public services heavily dependent on migration, both from within the UK and from overseas. Population forecasts showed Scotland\u2019s pensioners would grow from 19% of the population in 2018 to 23% in 2043, while the working-age population would fall from 64% to 62%, and the number of children drop from 17% to 15%. Scotland\u2019s population would shrink over that period, while increasing by 9% for the UK as a whole by 2043. Rural depopulation in remote parts of Scotland would also accelerate, with the working-age populations projected to fall by 33% in sparsely populated areas. To tackle that issue, the UK government should also implement its promise to trial a visa targeted at rural areas, she added. The proposed Scottish visa was welcomed in principle by Scottish Labour, Universities Scotland, which represents the higher education sector, the industry body Food and Drink Scotland, and immigration campaigners. While Sturgeon said the Scottish approach would be liberal and flexible, the policy paper she released on Monday, Migration: Helping Scotland Prosper, said there was likely to be a cap or limit to the number of migrants allowed into Scotland. The paper said that limit would be negotiated with the UK government, as long as it did not involve an arbitrary cap set by UK ministers for political reasons. The document said other changes were possible, including a regional approach across the UK that allowed some adaptations for local needs which would initially have a lower cap or quota. Sturgeon said it was too early to be specific on the numbers involved but said it should reflect the needs of specific industries, such as tourism and catering, or rural areas experiencing depopulation. \u201cIn principle, the system should be as open and as flexible as possible,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>Before celebrities and their publicists figured out that a goofy, faux-homeboy named Ali G was actually the smart, edgy comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, a succession of political and cultural figures \u2013 Newt Gingrich, C Everett Koop, James Baker, Gore Vidal, EPA chief Christine Todd Whitman, among others \u2013 agreed to sit for televised interviews with the \u201crapper.\u201d Almost always, Ali G\u2019s calculatedly crass, good-humored stupidity brought out his subjects\u2019 petty vanity and condescension, their humorless self-importance. The unmaskings \u2013 the glimpses of bad character \u2013 were at once horrifying and hilarious.</p> <p>I thought of those episodes while listening to NPR journalist Mary Louise Kelly\u2019s January 24 interview with secretary of state Mike Pompeo. One imagines Pompeo or his staffers assuming that a pretty blonde woman with such a good-girl name, Mary Louise Kelly, would lob softballs and take notes as he explained the government\u2019s Iran policy. Someone must have failed to do due diligence, alerting the secretary to Kelly\u2019s paradoxically calm and hard-hitting approach, to the unperturbed persistence with which \u2013 in interviews and in reporting from Russia, China and Iran \u2013 she has pursued the facts.</p> <p>On air, Pompeo cited the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdeep diplomatic efforts\u201d and success in \u201cbuilding out\u201d a \u201csignificant\u201d coalition of nations to deal with Iran. He blamed Iran\u2019s problems on Obama\u2019s policies and characterized the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">US assassination of Iranian </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">general </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/baghdad-airport-iraq-attack-deaths-iran-us-tensions\">Qassem Suleimani </a>as an act that delivered a \u201cmessage of freedom\u201d to the oppressed and grateful Iranians.</p> <p>Throughout, their conversation provided the upsetting yet oddly pleasurable experience, so reminiscent of Ali G, of hearing Pompeo\u2019s manner change as he began to realize that he\u2019d underestimated the reporter. In this case, the interviewer\u2019s true identity wasn\u2019t the issue, but rather the fact that Kelly is so good at her job, persistent and tough in asking questions that Pompeo didn\u2019t want asked. A model of inquisitorial technique, she calmly talked over him even when he was loud and insistent. She knew when to reframe his assertion as a question, when to pose her query in the simplest possible terms. She knew when to cite the facts that contradicted Pompeo\u2019s claims.</p> <p>It was hard to miss the unease that crept into Pompeo\u2019s voice when Kelly shifted the subject from Iran to Ukraine, which, he said, he hadn\u2019t agreed to discuss. Kelly replied that his staff okayed it. Pompeo steeled himself to continue, praising the current administration for working to repair the neglect and damage that, he asserted, Ukraine had suffered under Obama.</p> <p>Meanwhile Kelly was finding ways to pierce Pompeo\u2019s doggedness: his robotic armor. When he portrayed the state department as an efficient, congenial unit, Kelly mentioned the career department officials who had resigned because of mismanagement and lack of support. When the Secretary rejected these \u201canonymous\u201d allegations, Kelly quietly pointed out that they were made by a senior officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/16/pompeo-ignored-pleas-to-support-former-ukraine-envoy-ex-adviser-says\">Michael McKinley, testifying under oath</a>. Did Pompeo do anything to protect \u2013 or apologize to \u2013 ousted US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch? Did he, at any time, object to the \u201cback-channel\u201d foreign policy governing our relationship with Ukraine?</p> <p>At that point a Pompeo aide announced that the interview was over. Kelly thanked Pompeo, who refused to speak to her but only glared.</p> <p>What followed was more disturbing. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/01/24/politics/mike-pompeo-interview-ukraine/index.html\">According to Kelly</a>, a staffer asked her to meet with Pompeo in his office, where Pompeo shouted at the journalist. Ferocious and vulgar, he claimed that America didn\u2019t give an \u201cf word\u201d about Ukraine \u2013 a chillingly undignified pronouncement from our secretary of state. Then, as he raged on, he produced a map of the world with the names of countries scrubbed out. He asked Kelly to identify Ukraine, which she did, correctly. Pompeo\u2019s vague threat at the end of their meeting \u2013 \u201cPeople will hear about this\u201d \u2013 darkly echoes Donald Trump\u2019s warning about former ambassador Yovanovitch, \u201cThings are going to happen to her,\u201d and more recently about representative Adam Schiff: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/26/trump-impeachment-trial-showdown-senate-democrats\">He has not paid the price, yet</a>.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard it suggested that Pompeo would never have treated a male reporter the way he behaved toward Kelly. It\u2019s possible, but hard to prove. Males do bully males, and one imagines a certain amount of that transpiring regularly in the Oval Office. In fact Pompeo\u2019s demeanor provides a window into White House culture: the shouting, intimidation, vindictiveness and untruth.</p> <p>Things further degenerated the next day when Pompeo channeled his fury at Kelly into a statement attacking the \u201cunhinged\u201d media\u2019s efforts to damage the president. \u201cIt is no wonder the American people distrust many in the media when they consistently demonstrate their agenda and the absence of integrity.\u201d This prompted five Democratic senators to write a letter condemning Pompeo\u2019s assertions as \u201ccorrosive\u201d.</p> <p>The senators couldn\u2019t be more correct, nor could this situation \u2013 like so many we face today \u2013 be more alarming. And yet I couldn\u2019t help thinking, with grim amusement, of the panicked aides likely ordered to produce, in minutes, a map of the world without words. I pictured the chaos \u2013 the perpetual damage-control hysteria \u2013 that\u2019s business as usual for the staffers on the brilliant HBO series Veep.</p> <p>Ali G, Veep \u2013 the egregious character flaws that Pompeo revealed in his treatment of Kelly might seem simply grotesque or even comical if it were a TV series, if our democracy weren\u2019t at stake. How happily we could chuckle at Pompeo\u2019s public meltdown if our future weren\u2019t threatened by his \u2013 and every politician\u2019s \u2013 disregard for the truth, by every attempt to bully, discredit and silence our all-important free press.</p> <p>\u2022 Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences</p>",

On air, Pompeo cited the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cdeep diplomatic efforts\u201d and success in \u201cbuilding out\u201d a \u201csignificant\u201d coalition of nations to deal with Iran. He blamed Iran\u2019s problems on Obama\u2019s policies and characterized the US assassination of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani as an act that delivered a \u201cmessage of freedom\u201d to the oppressed and grateful Iranians. Throughout, their conversation provided the upsetting yet oddly pleasurable experience, so reminiscent of Ali G, of hearing Pompeo\u2019s manner change as he began to realize that he\u2019d underestimated the reporter. In this case, the interviewer\u2019s true identity wasn\u2019t the issue, but rather the fact that Kelly is so good at her job, persistent and tough in asking questions that Pompeo didn\u2019t want asked. A model of inquisitorial technique, she calmly talked over him even when he was loud and insistent. She knew when to reframe his assertion as a question, when to pose her query in the simplest possible terms. She knew when to cite the facts that contradicted Pompeo\u2019s claims. It was hard to miss the unease that crept into Pompeo\u2019s voice when Kelly shifted the subject from Iran to Ukraine, which, he said, he hadn\u2019t agreed to discuss. Kelly replied that his staff okayed it. Pompeo steeled himself to continue, praising the current administration for working to repair the neglect and damage that, he asserted, Ukraine had suffered under Obama. Meanwhile Kelly was finding ways to pierce Pompeo\u2019s doggedness: his robotic armor. When he portrayed the state department as an efficient, congenial unit, Kelly mentioned the career department officials who had resigned because of mismanagement and lack of support. When the Secretary rejected these \u201canonymous\u201d allegations, Kelly quietly pointed out that they were made by a senior officer, Michael McKinley, testifying under oath. Did Pompeo do anything to protect \u2013 or apologize to \u2013 ousted US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch? Did he, at any time, object to the \u201cback-channel\u201d foreign policy governing our relationship with Ukraine? At that point a Pompeo aide announced that the interview was over. Kelly thanked Pompeo, who refused to speak to her but only glared. What followed was more disturbing. According to Kelly, a staffer asked her to meet with Pompeo in his office, where Pompeo shouted at the journalist. Ferocious and vulgar, he claimed that America didn\u2019t give an \u201cf word\u201d about Ukraine \u2013 a chillingly undignified pronouncement from our secretary of state. Then, as he raged on, he produced a map of the world with the names of countries scrubbed out. He asked Kelly to identify Ukraine, which she did, correctly. Pompeo\u2019s vague threat at the end of their meeting \u2013 \u201cPeople will hear about this\u201d \u2013 darkly echoes Donald Trump\u2019s warning about former ambassador Yovanovitch, \u201cThings are going to happen to her,\u201d and more recently about representative Adam Schiff: \u201cHe has not paid the price, yet.\u201d I\u2019ve heard it suggested that Pompeo would never have treated a male reporter the way he behaved toward Kelly. It\u2019s possible, but hard to prove. Males do bully males, and one imagines a certain amount of that transpiring regularly in the Oval Office. In fact Pompeo\u2019s demeanor provides a window into White House culture: the shouting, intimidation, vindictiveness and untruth. Things further degenerated the next day when Pompeo channeled his fury at Kelly into a statement attacking the \u201cunhinged\u201d media\u2019s efforts to damage the president. \u201cIt is no wonder the American people distrust many in the media when they consistently demonstrate their agenda and the absence of integrity.\u201d This prompted five Democratic senators to write a letter condemning Pompeo\u2019s assertions as \u201ccorrosive\u201d. The senators couldn\u2019t be more correct, nor could this situation \u2013 like so many we face today \u2013 be more alarming. And yet I couldn\u2019t help thinking, with grim amusement, of the panicked aides likely ordered to produce, in minutes, a map of the world without words. I pictured the chaos \u2013 the perpetual damage-control hysteria \u2013 that\u2019s business as usual for the staffers on the brilliant HBO series Veep. Ali G, Veep \u2013 the egregious character flaws that Pompeo revealed in his treatment of Kelly might seem simply grotesque or even comical if it were a TV series, if our democracy weren\u2019t at stake. How happily we could chuckle at Pompeo\u2019s public meltdown if our future weren\u2019t threatened by his \u2013 and every politician\u2019s \u2013 disregard for the truth, by every attempt to bully, discredit and silence our all-important free press. \u2022 Francine Prose is a former president of PEN American Center and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences",

Just Sardinia and Just Corsica are also making it easier to reach islands without flying, building train and ferry crossings into their trips. Inn Travel, the walking and cycling specialist, has made all of its European mainland holidays, plus the Balearics and Sicily, available by rail, and trebled the size of its in-house rail team to cope with demand. 6 What about ferries? Ferries could hardly be called green, but emissions for each passenger are considerably less than short-haul flights and the sector is endeavouring to reduce them. This year, Brittany Ferries is launching the Honfleur, its first liquified-natural-gas-powered ship, to run on the Portsmouth to Caen route, followed by the Salamanca in 2022 and the Santo\u00f1a in 2023 on the Portsmouth-Bilbao service. South of Caen, connect to the V\u00e9losc\u00e9nic cycle route that runs between Paris and Mont Saint-Michel, cutting across Normandy, stages of which are easy enough to do with kids. The French are masters of camping, with thousands of excellent sites offering waterparks (Brittany\u2019s Domaine des Ormes), sandy beaches (Domaine de la Bergerie between Cannes and Saint Tropez), alpine views (Campsite de Martini\u00e8re in the Chartreuse regional park, where the owner has a sideline in amazing land art) and more. Start your search on lefrenchtime.co.uk, which lists 78 sites from seaside to mountain, river to town, or coolcamping.com\u2019s French glampsites. Stena Line is also investing in new technology and ships. Its rail-and-sail service to Amsterdam is an alternative to Eurostar \u2013 and a good option for families. Go to little-clogs-holidays.co.uk for holiday park suggestions. The Dutch invented Center Parcs, but holiday parks are often cheaper there than in the UK. 7 The great Brexscape This month, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) issued a statement reassuring travellers that holidays won\u2019t be affected by Brexit in 2020. Valid passports can still be used as normal, the cost of making calls, using the internet and sending texts will remain the same, and coaches and trains from the UK to the continent will be unaffected. The peaks and lakes of central Norway should help clear your head of all thoughts of the B-word. Walks Worldwide\u2019s nine-day self-guided tour follows routes through the Jotunheimen mountains, staying in a mix of hotels, cabins and a lodge (\u00a31,499 each). You are also unlikely to be bothered by the news on the biking tour of rural Albania offered by Much Better Adventures (seven nights, \u00a3774 each). Too adventurous? Switch off in comfort at the isolated Instants d\u2019Absolu Ecolodge, a former farmhouse in the Auvergne, France, with a spa, delicious farm-to-table food and limited wifi and phone signal (Neussargues station is 10km away; from \u00a3122 a night through i-escape.com). Or keep it simple \u2013 with a book by the (small) pool, wine in hand and views of the Umbrian hills at Wild Umbria, a holiday home for four (book through sawdays.co.uk). Cycling specialist BSpoke Tours has a new coastal tour along the wild coast of northern Spain\u2019s Asturias region (from \u00a31,095pp, excluding travel; take Brittany Ferries from Portsmouth to Santander). For sporty families, Adventure Creators puts together multi-activity trips in the French Pyrenees with rock climbing, high ropes and river rafting \u2013 ensuring kids will be so exhausted they may even forget about screens. 8 You could always stay in the UK If the disastrous start to the new decade has left you feeling too weary to contemplate venturing beyond our shores, set your sights on an escape closer to home. The number of secluded cottages, cabins, bothies and boltholes in the UK is on the rise. The National Trust\u2019s collection of remote cottages includes the diminutive Bird How, tucked away in Eskdale valley in the Lake District, which doesn\u2019t even have a TV. Canopy and Stars specialises in places to stay in nature, such as The Woodcock, an eco-cabin on a Norfolk farm with no electricity or wifi. Or browse the idyllic Welsh cottages on underthethatch.co.uk. In the Carmarthenshire hills, you will find T\u0177 Barddu, a modernist cottage with cedar hot tub, but no neighbours or wifi, and the rustic Bryn Eglur, a place, the website says, \u201cto step back in time\u201d \u2013 perfect for pretending the past few years never happened. For guaranteed isolation, Much Better Adventures\u2019s Castaway weekend is a chance to set sail up the Kyles of Bute in Argyll for two nights\u2019 wild camping on a remote island \u2013 and the added bonus of learning survival skills (could come in handy).

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

      "bodyText": "Dear Basketball was always a bittersweet piece of work. This was the Oscar-winning short film from 2017 directed by the Disney animator Glen Keane, with stirring music by John Williams and written, produced and narrated by Kobe Bryant, on the occasion of his retirement from basketball. It is not merely a love letter to the sport that had given him so much, but a deeply sad farewell to it: almost an expression of grief, or therapy for grief. In the previous few years, he had been agonised by injuries that were making continued top-flight competition an impossibility; the fragility of human bodies is always a particular agony for athletes of Bryant\u2019s calibre. \u201cI can\u2019t love you obsessively for much longer,\u201d Bryant says to basketball. \u201cMy body knows it\u2019s time to say goodbye.\u201d Now, of course, these thoughts have a new layer of sadness, as well as a jarring irony. The goodbye that Bryant envisaged in Dear Basketball was a natural progression to other things, and he mused on what his post-basketball career was going to bring him. Clearly, some work in movies was a very real possibility. But it was not to be. Dear Basketball is also a tender meditation on Bryant\u2019s own boyhood: the fluid pencil-stroke-style animation morphs the adult Bryant back and forth between a stylised representation of his magnificent triumphs on the court with Bryant as the little kid in his bedroom dreaming of glory. He was the basketball-obsessed kid who took his dad\u2019s tube socks, rolled them up into a ball and kept shooting it into a little hoop on the other side of the room.

I have a very close friend that was playing with him for a long time, Pau Gasol, and he always told me that his spirit of overcoming, his spirit of hard work. He always wanted more, he always wanted to increase his level. He\u2019s always been a true inspiration for the world of sport and for a lot of kids, so yeah it\u2019s one of those days that you want to forget. But Kobe Bryant will be in our heart and our minds for the rest of our lives.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2ecf828f0879d539effd58\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T11:56:00.708Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Rafael Nadal defeats Nick Kyrgios 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After a huge wobble against a tired Kyrgios, the Spaniard recovers to reach the quarterfinal. will face Dominic Thiem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/nick-kyrgios-shows-resilience-but-cannot-halt-defeat-to-rafael-nadal\">Nick Kyrgios shows resilience but cannot halt defeat to Rafael Nadal</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b02f7b08be42f627d923ff559b7a63fc1ddb366\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b02f7b08be42f627d923ff559b7a63fc1ddb366/0_0_2850_1900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadal celebrates his victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadal celebrates his victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T12:33:14.310Z\">at 12.33pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2eceae8f0879d539effd4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T11:54:34.473Z\">11.54am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) 6-6 (*5-4) Nick Kyrgios:</strong> After a long series of big serving and quick service points, the first mini-break goes to Nadal at 5-3, thanks to a failed drop shot from Kyrgios.

Ever since Kyrgios burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2014, shocking Nadal in four stunning sets in the fourth round, this has been one of the truly gripping matchups of the past 6 years.</p> <p>There is no big match player like Nick Kyrgios. On any given day against a lowly ranked opponent, he could find himself drawn into endless rallies but he almost always elevates his game against the elite. His first priority will be to take care of his service games, but he will also be looking to keep points as short as he possibly can. He will flatten out his groundstrokes and thump winners off both wings and he will throw in a constant variety of drop shots and net forays to keep Nadal off balance.</p> <p>For Nadal, serving well will also be key and so it\u2019s helpful that he is in the serving form of his life. He will also look to slip into the net when he can and he spend a lot of time working on Kyrgios\u2019 backhand and moving him side-to-side when he can. He will certainly look to be aggressive and open up his forehand down the line, but he will also force Kyrgios to be perfect, to always find the huge forehand winner or perfect dropshot on the biggest points. If Kyrgios is not perfect, he will lose.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T08:25:28.586Z\">at 8.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e2e940b8f08e97ed212affd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T07:44:58.922Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stan Wawrinka upsets 4th seed Daniil Medvedev 6-2 2-6 4-6 7-6(2) 6-2</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A solid upset to start the morning as Stan Wawrinka takes out US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev.

Welcome to day 8 of our Australian Open coverage as the first half of fourth round action comes to an end. Tonight\u2019s session will feature three singles matches: On Melbourne Arena, 22 year-olds Alexander Zverev and Andrey Medvedev will fight to reach the quarters. Rublev has been the in-form player this year and he is currently on a 15 match winning streak having won two tournaments in the first two weeks of the year. On Margaret Court Arena, 2016 champion Angelique Kerber will attempt to return to the quarterfinals when she faces last year\u2019s quarterfinalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who scuppered Karolina Pliskova in the third round.</p> <p>But most eyes will be on Rod Laver Arena as Nick Kyrgios takes on Rafael Nadal in front of his home crowd for the first time. The world number one has mostly coasted through the tournament playing high quality tennis and he still hasn\u2019t dropped a set. Kyrgios arrives in the third Australian Open fourth round with the crowd firmly behind him. He has played well and fought even harder, edging out a 5th set tiebreak win over 16th seed Kharen Khachanov to reach the fourth round. The question is how his body has recovered after the first four and a half hour battle of his career, and if he has recovered, whether it even that be enough to topple the in-form world number one.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T07:30:54.770Z\">at 7.30am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Finally, here is the order of play for Tuesday. An enormous match between Ashleigh Barty and Petra Kvitova awaits. Thanks for following and I will be back tomorrow. Here is Russell Jackson\u2019s match report from Melbourne. That was some match. The first half was high quality, creative and delightful. The second half was riddled with mental and physical doubts from both players. Despite how patchy the final 45 minutes were, Kyrgios is clearly an anxious match-up for Nadal and overcoming those nerves will surely power Nadal as he faces an in-form Thiem. As for Kyrgios, there is no doubt that he left everything out on the court both tonight and throughout the tournament. He will depart the Australian tennis summer with a so much more goodwill than when the season began. The big question remains what his game and his career looks like when he is playing tennis thousands away from home and he doesn\u2019t really want to be there. Rafael Nadal\u2019s comments about Nicholas Hilmy Kyrgios were quite pointed: Well, what can I say about Nick? When he is playing today with his positive attitude, he brings a lot fo positive things to our sport. So I encouraging him to keep working like this because he is one of the highest talents that we have on our tour and I like the Nick Kyrgios during the whole of this tournament. Nadal on the low margins when facing Kyrgios and his fourth set wobble: Have been a very tough match. Since in the beginning, I was a little bit under control. But, you know, against Nick, you are never under control because if you have a mistake, like I had in the second set with one serve of mine, then he has the break and it\u2019s so difficult to break him again. Happened again in the fourth. He played a good game, but I played a scary game at 5-4! But that\u2019s part of the sport. Accept that, and then I try to recover mentally and try to recover mentally for 6-5 and the end of the tiebreak. Kontaveit, Halep, Muguruza and Pavlyuchenkova are all into the women\u2019s quarters. Nadal was asked by John McEnroe about the passing of Kobe Bryant: What can I say? I wake up this morning with this terrible news. Super sad. He has been one of the greatest sportsman in the history, so he just deserves a round of big applause. I didn\u2019t spend time with him but I met him. I have a very close friend that was playing with him for a long time, Pau Gasol, and he always told me that his spirit of overcoming, his spirit of hard work. He always wanted more, he always wanted to increase his level. He\u2019s always been a true inspiration for the world of sport and for a lot of kids, so yeah it\u2019s one of those days that you want to forget. But Kobe Bryant will be in our heart and our minds for the rest of our lives. After a huge wobble against a tired Kyrgios, the Spaniard recovers to reach the quarterfinal. will face Dominic Thiem. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) 6-6 (*5-4) Nick Kyrgios: After a long series of big serving and quick service points, the first mini-break goes to Nadal at 5-3, thanks to a failed drop shot from Kyrgios. Kyrgios pulled Nadal back to 5-4 but the Spaniard stands two service points from victory. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) 6-6 Nick Kyrgios: Another tiebreak will decide set 4. Nadal returned to his serving of old in that last game, flitting through an easy love hold to level the set. If only he could have served like that when it really mattered, no? Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) *5-6 Nick Kyrgios: This sport plays tricks with your mind. Despite breaking back, Kyrgios was still suffering and he immediately haemorrhaged a flurry of tired errors to fall down 15-40. On the first break point, Nadal missed a bad return but then Kyrgios produced a brilliant dropshot on the second, finishing the point with a backhand winner. At deuce, Kyrgios landed a big unreturned first serve and a nervy backhand error from a struggling Nadal handed over the game. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) 5-5* Nick Kyrgios: Astoundingly, Kyrgios breaks back! The Australian forced Nadal to deal with the tension of serving out the match, and the Spaniard clearly blinked. He opened the game with a missed forehand, he double faulted at 15-30 and he missed first serves throughout. Kyrgios stepped in on the second break point and crushed his forehand until the ball didn\u2019t come back. A great effort. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) *5-4 Nick Kyrgios: Kyrgios holds to 30 and Nadal will serve for the match. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) 5-3* Nick Kyrgios: Kyrgios skipped to the baseline and he really tried to bring some intensity to the opening point. He crushed three forehands, he thought he had at least dragged Nadal wide and then he watched as Nadal chased down the third forehand and flicked a sickening angled backhand winner in response. Needless to say, Nadal held serve. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) *4-3 Nick Kyrgios: After Nadal\u2019s 9th(!) love hold of the day, Kyrgios digs out another hold from deuce to keep the set at a fourth break. He looks an exhausted, broken figure and he spent the change of ends muttering at nobody in particular, but the Aussie is still there. Other results: Alexander Zverev battered Andrey Rublev 6-4 6-4 6-4 to end his friend\u2019s 15 match winning streak with ease. Angelique Kerber played a great match but was edged out 7-6(5) 6-7(4) 6-2 by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) *3-2 Nick Kyrgios: A good effort from Kyrgios there to find a couple of big serves, utter a quiet cheer of \u2018c\u2019mon\u2019, force a Nadal error and at least keep himself in the match. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) 3-1* Nick Kyrgios: As Kyrgios\u2019 energy levels wane, Nadal\u2019s just seemed to ascend to another level. He held with a wicked second serve ace (Kyrgios still had enough energy to pronounce it a \u201chell of a serve\u201d) at 30-0 and then an absurd running forehand down the line winner. Nadal has now won 12 points in a row. No mercy. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) *2-1 Nick Kyrgios: The question of Kyrgios\u2019 condition has been answered quite quickly. His footwork is kaputt and he is slapping tired groundstrokes. After two forehand errors, Kyrgios handed over the break to love with a double fault. That was a great set of tennis and an even more astonishing climax. Nothing sums up Rafael Nadal quite like the point at *6-6 in the tiebreak. After double faulting on set point and facing the possibility of Kyrgios serving for the tiebreak, many players would have crumbled. Nadal simply reset and the second he had the opportunity to attack his forehand down-the-line, he went for the shot without a hint of doubt. He does this so often yet seeing him work and thrive under suffocating pressure is never any less impressive. Kyrgios didn\u2019t do too much wrong until those final points. Let\u2019s see what he still has in the tank. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 7-6(6) Nick Kyrgios: Nadal stands one set away! Even after double faulting on set point, Nadal simply reset and refused to back down. A brilliant forehand down the line followed by an awkward volley winner brought him another set point. A forehand into the net from Kyrgios handed him the set. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 6-6 (*6-6) Nick Kyrgios: My word. Kyrgios dragged himself back to 5-5 only attempt a 117mph second serve and double fault. On his set point, Nadal responded with his own double fault. Everyone is nervous! Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 6-6 (*4-3) Nick Kyrgios: Nadal leads after the break. Kyrgios missed a backhand passing shot at 2-1 and totalled his racquet. Nadal then hooked a great forehand crosscourt to lead 4-1. Nadal missed a loose forehand at for 4-2 and Kyrgios pegged Nadal back to 4-3 with a forehand winner. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 6-6 Nick Kyrgios: A tiebreak will decide this wonderful third set. This time, it was Kyrgios\u2019 turn to play the pressure points exceptionally. The Aussie generated three game points from his 40-30 lead, but each time he self-sabotaged with an unforced error. On the fourth game point, he switched things up with a serve and volley, forcing a Nadal return error. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 6-5* Nick Kyrgios: The stress is rising and it\u2019s fair to say that Nick Kyrgios is no longer having fun. After a correct challenge with Nadal leading 30-15, the Australian began to mouth off at umpire James Keothavong as he criticised the officiating. As Kyrgios seethed, Nadal produced a big serve to complete an uncomplicated service hold. A tiebreak looms. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 5-5* Nick Kyrgios: This time, it was Kyrgios\u2019 turn to face a nerve-wracking point on his serve at 30-30. He shrugged off any nerves and crushed two unreturned serves to hold. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 5-4* Nick Kyrgios: Incredible. Nadal survives the toughest hold of the set. Kyrgios dragged Nadal back to deuce from 40-15 and then he beautifully opened up the court and before missing an easy forehand. After scuppering a third break point, Kyrgios once had Nadal on the ropes at deuce. This time, Nadal desperately defended every last shot and when Kyrgios unloaded on a forehand down the line on the run, he flipped the point with an incredible crosscourt forehand in response, ending the point in one attacking blow. On his fourth game point, Nadal finally held to move to within a game of the set. Nadal had lost 4 points on serve all set. He just lost 4 in one game. The pressure is rising. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 *4-4 Nick Kyrgios: That was some hold from Nick Kyrgios. At 15-0, Kyrgios attempted an underarm serve that landed in the net. Nadal was all over the following second serve, ending the point with a violent forehand down the line winner and then riding the momentum to 30-40. Down break point and after a heavy-handed drop volley on the previous point, Kyrgios scuppered the danger with an absurd, gorgeous dropshot off his serve. From deuce, two huge serves. Danger averted. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 4-3* Nick Kyrgios: At the moment, Nick Kyrgios is enjoying this match as much as the fans who paid to watch. As Nadal drilled a 141kmh backhand passing shot past him before holding to 15 with a serve and forehand combo, he was laughing. Both players are playing extremely well now and showing the breadth of their hand skills. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 3-2* Nick Kyrgios: After a series of quick holds, Nadal inched ahead with another love hold. At 40-0 and on a short ball, Kyrgios feigned to hammer the ball away before throwing in a drop shot. Nadal chased it down and responded with a slick, angled no-look passing shot winner. Kyrgios was laughing as he returned to his chair, Nadal was not. Let\u2019s have a score update: Over on Margaret Court Arena, Angelique Kerber and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova are in the midst of a ridiculous, high quality slugfest. Kerber just saved three set points, the final saved with a sweeping forehand combination, to push them into a second set tiebreak. Pavlyuchenkova has hit 52 winners, 28 unforced errors and she\u2019s losing. On Melbourne Arena, Alexander Zverev is well on his way to reaching the quarters without dropping a set. He leads Andrey Rublev 6-4 *4-3. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 *1-1 Nick Kyrgios: The pair opened with two holds, but the holds could not have been more different. While Nadal\u2019s hold was to love, Kyrgios watched a Nadal backhand down the line passing shot fly past him for 0-30. How did Kyrgios respond to the 0-30 deficit? He crushed a forehand down the line winner at 0-30, then reeled off three unreturned serves in succession to hold. Alexander Zverev is having a lovely time on Melbourne Arena. He now leads Andrey Rublev 6-4 *1-0 with a break in the second set. According to Mats Wilander on Eurosport, a woman in the crowd kept on calling Nadal\u2019s name between points. Kyrgios\u2019 response? \u201cHe\u2019s married\u201d Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-6 Nick Kyrgios: Kyrgios levels! As Nadal tookhis final stand in the second set, the game opened with long, gruelling rallies. Nadal dumped a backhand into the net at 15-15, but then he responded at 30-15 by sweeping into the net behind a huge backhand down the line. Kyrgios shook off the pressure without thinking twice, slamming down two aces in a row to hold and take the set. Game on. Rafael Nadal 6-3 3-5* Nick Kyrgios: As expected, Nadal has recovered from the earlier blip and he sealed another hold with a bread-and-butter serve and forehand combination. Kyrgios will attempt to serve out the set. Rafael Nadal 6-3 *2-5 Nick Kyrgios: The tennis has become obscenely good here. Kyrgios opened with a sickly sweet angled drop volley and then he immediately returned to the net and dispatched another lovely drop volley. Kyrgios closed off the hold to love with a final huge forehand, backed up with another pointedly loud and long grunt. He stands one game from levelling the match at one set all. Rafael Nadal 6-3 2-4* Nick Kyrgios: Nadal responds with a quick, businesslike love hold and a running forehand winner so good that it had Kyrgios giggling like a child. This is getting fun. Rafael Nadal 6-3 *1-4 Nick Kyrgios: Absolutely no problems for Kyrgios in this service game. If there was any doubt that the momentum had shifted, he made it clear by opening the game with successive aces and punctuating each with loud, drawn out grunts. Nadal dumped a backhand long on the final point to hand Kyrgios a hopeful love hold. Rafael Nadal 6-3 1-3* Nick Kyrgios: Out of nowhere, Nick Kyrgios breaks! Kyrgios was finally rewarded for his perseverance through his opening service game as Nadal dumped a forehand into the net at 15-15 and then a backhand into the net at 30-30. The rallies are long, gruelling and tactical in these slow conditions and after one such exchange, the Aussie flicked an incredible running passing shot winner past a seething Nadal. Other scores: On Margaret Court Arena, Angelique Kerber has taken the first set 7-6(5) against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and the score is 2-2 in the second set. Pavluchenkova led 5-2 and played a great set, but the 2016 champion seems to be finding her feet and, most importantly, her grit. Andrey Rublev and Alexander Zverev are just starting on Melbourne Arena. Rublev leads 2-1 on serve. Rafael Nadal 6-3 *1-2 Nick Kyrgios: Kyrgios is looking a lot happier than he was 10 minutes ago. A much better hold from the Aussie; he slammed down his 9th ace of the day and dismounted with a drop shot-lob combination, leaping into the air as it landed in. After tossing a bit of abuse towards his camp, he is now laughing and joking with them. Rafael Nadal 6-3 1-1* Nick Kyrgios: After the endless drama on Kyrgios\u2019 serve, Nadal marches through a hold to 15, sealed with an ace down the T. Easy. Rafael Nadal 6-3 *0-1 Nick Kyrgios: Goodness, that was tough. Kyrgios opened up the second set with his back to the wall, Nadal desperate to snatch a break to open the set. Kyrgios immediately fell down double break point before pegging Nadal back to deuce by winning long rally that included a Kyrgios tweener. After a long tug of war, Kyrgios found his magic hands and two beautiful forehand dropshots before closing with an ace. The Aussie could not afford to lose that game. After their win, Coco Gauff and Caty McNally dedicated their celebration to Kobe. Rafael Nadal 6-3 Nick Kyrgios: The world number one takes the first set. Quite a routine set for the Spaniard - he took advantage of one weak service game from the Australian and easily held onto his serve. These slow conditions and aren\u2019t helping Kyrgios, but neither is the opponent across the net. Rafael Nadal *5-3 Nick Kyrgios: After a couple of quick holds from both, Nadal looked to make another move by reaching 15-30 on Kyrgios\u2019 serve. This time, Kyrgios found two important first serves to move up 40-30 before playing a decent drop volley. Nadal chased down the dropshot and sent his response wide, handing Kyrgios another hold. The world number one will serve for the set. You thought the Coco Gauff story was over for another tournament? Think again. 15 year-old Gauff and 18 year old Caty McNally just recovered from a set and break down to defeat the 10th seeds in doubles, Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara, 4-6 7-5 6-3 to reach the first slam quarterfinal of their careers. They will face second seeds Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic. Rafael Nadal 4-1* Nick Kyrgios: Nadal consolidates the break fairly well. The Spaniard opened his service game on fire, with a searing backhand crosscourt winner followed by a forehand down-the-line winner. Kyrgios showed some encouraging signs by pegging him back to 30-30 by grinding through a couple of physical points and forcing a Nadal error. At 30-30, Nadal found two great unreturned first serves to seal the hold. Here are Nadal\u2019s comments on Kyrgios from Saturday. Nadal was asked if he likes the Australian: I don\u2019t know him personally, honestly, to have a clear opinion. Yeah, my answer is better to... It\u2019s clear, of course, that when he does stuff that in my opinion is not good, I don\u2019t like. When he plays good tennis and he shows passion for this game, he is a positive player for our tour, and I want my tour bigger, not smaller. So the players who make the tour bigger are important for the tour. When he\u2019s ready to play his best tennis and play with passion, is one of these guys. When he\u2019s doing the other stuff, of course I don\u2019t like. Rafael Nadal *3-1 Nick Kyrgios: Nadal breaks first. The good news for Kyrgios is that he slammed down two aces and a service winner to lead 40-15, but otherwise that was a dire service game. From 40-15 up, he dumped two consecutive drop shots into the net. After an ace to generate a third game point, he missed two easy backhands in a row. On the third deuce, he missed an easy open court backhand. He then lost his serve with a backhand well long. A bit of a mess. \u201cF*ck, man,\u201d he says. Rafael Nadal 2-1* Nick Kyrgios. This time, a quick love hold from Nadal to retain his early lead. Some great serving from the world number one to reach 40-0 and then he closed it off with a moment of pure class, hooking a gorgeous angled forehand for a clean winner while on the run. Rafael Nadal *1-1 Nick Kyrgios. A quick hold for Kyrgios to open his account. Nadal very quickly showed that he will be going after his forehand whenever he can; at 30-15 he crushed an inside out forehand that just skidded out. Kyrgios sealed his first hold of the day with a service winner. There will be many more. Rafael Nadal 1-0* Nick Kyrgios: The world number one seals his opening hold, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Nadal double faulted twice in the game, including at 40-30 to bring them back to deuce. From deuce, he found a big serve and then forced a Kyrgios error with a firm crosscourt backhand to hold. There is no love lost between these two and Kyrgios has always been very happy to discuss that. Here are Kyrgios\u2019 comments on Nadal during his wide-ranging interview with Ben Rothenberg on the No Challenges Remaining podcast last year. \u201cHe\u2019s my polar opposite. Literally my polar opposite. And he\u2019s super salty. \u201cWhen he wins it\u2019s fine, he won\u2019t say anything bad, he\u2019ll credit the opponent - \u2018he competed well today, he\u2019s a great player\u2019 - but then as soon as I beat him, it\u2019s just like \u2018he has no respect for me, my fans and no respect to the game\u2019. I\u2019m like \u2018what are you talking about? I literally played this way that I beat you the other previous times and nothing changed\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look. And then Uncle Toni [Nadal\u2019s coach] came out saying \u2018he lacks education\u2019. I\u2019m like \u2018I did 12 years at school, you idiot. I\u2019m very educated. I understand that you\u2019re upset I beat your family again.\u201d The players are on-court. Kyrgios is a huge NBA fan and he unsurprisingly warmed up wearing Kobe Bryant\u2019s laker jersey. As he sat down in his chair, Kyrgios was crying. So, where will this match be won? Rafael Nadal narrowly leads the head to head 4-3 with the pair splitting their matches in 2019. Kyrgios famously toppled Nadal in Acapulco, with the Aussie playing an underarm serve and complaining about Nadal taking his time between points. Nadal followed up a few months later with a statement win at Wimbledon. Ever since Kyrgios burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2014, shocking Nadal in four stunning sets in the fourth round, this has been one of the truly gripping matchups of the past 6 years. There is no big match player like Nick Kyrgios. On any given day against a lowly ranked opponent, he could find himself drawn into endless rallies but he almost always elevates his game against the elite. His first priority will be to take care of his service games, but he will also be looking to keep points as short as he possibly can. He will flatten out his groundstrokes and thump winners off both wings and he will throw in a constant variety of drop shots and net forays to keep Nadal off balance. For Nadal, serving well will also be key and so it\u2019s helpful that he is in the serving form of his life. He will also look to slip into the net when he can and he spend a lot of time working on Kyrgios\u2019 backhand and moving him side-to-side when he can. He will certainly look to be aggressive and open up his forehand down the line, but he will also force Kyrgios to be perfect, to always find the huge forehand winner or perfect dropshot on the biggest points. If Kyrgios is not perfect, he will lose. A solid upset to start the morning as Stan Wawrinka takes out US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev. A result like this has been coming for the three-time slam champion in recent months. He has played well for a while now but he just hasn\u2019t quite been able to reach his top level over 5 sets against the very best. He did today. As we wait for the night session to begin, one match is reaching its dramatic conclusion. 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka has rediscovered some vintage form against 4th seed Daniil Medvedev and he currently leads Medvedev by a double break in the fifth set at *5-2. He is on the brink of perhaps his best win since he underwent knee surgery in 2017. Hello! Welcome to day 8 of our Australian Open coverage as the first half of fourth round action comes to an end. Tonight\u2019s session will feature three singles matches: On Melbourne Arena, 22 year-olds Alexander Zverev and Andrey Medvedev will fight to reach the quarters. Rublev has been the in-form player this year and he is currently on a 15 match winning streak having won two tournaments in the first two weeks of the year. On Margaret Court Arena, 2016 champion Angelique Kerber will attempt to return to the quarterfinals when she faces last year\u2019s quarterfinalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who scuppered Karolina Pliskova in the third round. But most eyes will be on Rod Laver Arena as Nick Kyrgios takes on Rafael Nadal in front of his home crowd for the first time. The world number one has mostly coasted through the tournament playing high quality tennis and he still hasn\u2019t dropped a set. Kyrgios arrives in the third Australian Open fourth round with the crowd firmly behind him. He has played well and fought even harder, edging out a 5th set tiebreak win over 16th seed Kharen Khachanov to reach the fourth round. The question is how his body has recovered after the first four and a half hour battle of his career, and if he has recovered, whether it even that be enough to topple the in-form world number one.",

      "body": "<p>As we enter 2020 and survey the state of the world, two competing storylines seem to dominate the present.</p> <p>The first is ruthless, relentless inequality. We see this not only in <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2019-01-22/report-26-richest-people-have-wealth-of-poorest-38-billion\">the imbalance of our economy</a>, but also in our politics and government, in education and expression, and in the ways that our social structures and cultural practices dismiss and disregard people because of their gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and more.</p> <p>Then there is the corollary: People standing up, speaking out, and fighting back. Young, inspirational figures like Kynan Tegar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/greta-thunberg\">Greta Thunberg</a>, and Artemisa Xakriab\u00e1 are spearheading movements to address the global climate crisis, because their future is at risk. And in places like Hong Kong, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Sudan and many others around the globe, ordinary citizens are demanding better treatment, more transparency, greater equality, and human dignity. They demonstrate, time and again, their willingness to sacrifice everything \u2013 their time, their efforts, even their safety \u2013 in service of a better future for us all.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the truth is, the courageous individuals leading the change \u2013 the people driving the conversation and making the largest sacrifices \u2013 too often are the very people most threatened by inequality. And so, I find myself asking: Why is it that those with the least tend to sacrifice the most? How can it be that the most comfortable among us contribute, in relative terms, the least? What crisis needs to befall us in order to act?</p> <p>To be sure, many with power and privilege already give with extraordinary generosity. As the president of the Ford Foundation, an organization originally endowed by a family of great means, I have seen firsthand how the generosity of a few can affect the lives of many.</p> <p>But this kind of generosity is too often superseded by the pervasive inequality of sacrifice \u2013 which we see both day to day and in the data. For example, a<a href=\"https://www.philanthropy.com/article/As-Wealthy-Give-Smaller-Share/152481#note\"> survey from The Chronicle of Philanthropy</a> found that, during the Great Recession, American households that earned more than $200,000 reduced their giving by more than 4%, while households that earned less than $100,000 did just the opposite. In fact, as they saw the need increase, they increased their giving, in turn \u2013 by more than 4%. And this despite the fact that tax codes in the US, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703787304575075400171203026\">Europe,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/specialreports/budget2018/budget-2018-government-to-extend-250-tax-deductions-for-9970836\">other</a> parts of the world have built-in incentives that reward the wealthy for their charitable donations.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Generosity is too often superseded by the pervasive inequality of sacrifice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This all-too-common discomfort with sacrifice is not about good versus bad. The disconnect \u2013 and disconnection \u2013 follows from isolation and insulation. Separation breeds selfishness, despite the best of intentions.</p> <p>In the United States, for instance, segregation was outlawed over 65 years ago. Yet, a recent <a href=\"https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/integration-and-diversity/harming-our-common-future-americas-segregated-schools-65-years-after-brown/Brown-65-050919v4-final.pdf\">Civil Rights Project report</a> found that America\u2019s schools remain both separate and unequal. We see similar trends of geographical divide <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/segregation-us-cities/,%20https:/www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2016.1228371\">in cities across America and Europe</a>, where a lack of economic opportunity has led to the disintegration of our social fabric.</p> <p>Restoring unity and trust will take more than generosity and good will. Charity, while wonderful, ameliorates the symptoms of inequality, but it does not address its root causes. And we must address the root causes. Keep in mind that large swaths of people around the world are growing increasingly impatient with the status quo, and we with power will feel their ire if we ignore their righteous demands for a fair and just society. So those of us with privilege need to find ways to do more justice. That means not only helping those who are often excluded, but also undoing the systems and structures that create inequities and imbalances in the first place. That will sometimes also mean working to transfer our own power, and giving up some of the privileges we currently enjoy.</p> <p>Toward the end of last year, <a href=\"https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/ford-forum/the-future-of-philanthropy/ideas/#popup-12974\">when our foundation hosted a conference on the future of philanthropy</a>, I was struck by something Luis Miranda Jr, philanthropist and father of the entertainer Lin-Manuel Miranda, said about the philosophy with which he was raised. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Miranda argued, \u201cif you\u2019re not not-doing something else, then you\u2019re not giving enough.\u201d</p> <p>This conception of sacrifice is profound: only when it is uncomfortable or even painful to give do you know that you are giving for reasons beyond your own benefit. And it is worth remembering that, despite this prick of pain, sacrifice has a value beyond what is given up. When you make this kind of sacrifice, you do not give up something for nothing; you give up some of your privilege for something far more valuable: justice.</p> <p>If we want to address the inequality of sacrifice, therefore, those of us with the most ought to recommit ourselves to doing the most. Perhaps that means paying a higher tax rate to finance public goods or wielding our influence to promote inclusive public policies. Or perhaps it means devoting more time, money, and effort toward rebuilding the broken systems that perpetuate inequality.</p> <p>We all must ask ourselves what system, status, or status quo we are willing to part with to benefit others. Only then \u2013 only when we have paired our generous impulses with acts of justice \u2013 will we diminish the inequality of sacrifice, and build a better, more equitable world.</p> <ul> <li><p>Darren Walker is president of the Ford Foundation</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "As we enter 2020 and survey the state of the world, two competing storylines seem to dominate the present. The first is ruthless, relentless inequality. We see this not only in the imbalance of our economy, but also in our politics and government, in education and expression, and in the ways that our social structures and cultural practices dismiss and disregard people because of their gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and more. Then there is the corollary: People standing up, speaking out, and fighting back. Young, inspirational figures like Kynan Tegar, Greta Thunberg, and Artemisa Xakriab\u00e1 are spearheading movements to address the global climate crisis, because their future is at risk. And in places like Hong Kong, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Sudan and many others around the globe, ordinary citizens are demanding better treatment, more transparency, greater equality, and human dignity. They demonstrate, time and again, their willingness to sacrifice everything \u2013 their time, their efforts, even their safety \u2013 in service of a better future for us all. Unfortunately, the truth is, the courageous individuals leading the change \u2013 the people driving the conversation and making the largest sacrifices \u2013 too often are the very people most threatened by inequality. And so, I find myself asking: Why is it that those with the least tend to sacrifice the most? How can it be that the most comfortable among us contribute, in relative terms, the least? What crisis needs to befall us in order to act? To be sure, many with power and privilege already give with extraordinary generosity. As the president of the Ford Foundation, an organization originally endowed by a family of great means, I have seen firsthand how the generosity of a few can affect the lives of many. But this kind of generosity is too often superseded by the pervasive inequality of sacrifice \u2013 which we see both day to day and in the data. For example, a survey from The Chronicle of Philanthropy found that, during the Great Recession, American households that earned more than $200,000 reduced their giving by more than 4%, while households that earned less than $100,000 did just the opposite. In fact, as they saw the need increase, they increased their giving, in turn \u2013 by more than 4%. And this despite the fact that tax codes in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world have built-in incentives that reward the wealthy for their charitable donations. This all-too-common discomfort with sacrifice is not about good versus bad. The disconnect \u2013 and disconnection \u2013 follows from isolation and insulation. Separation breeds selfishness, despite the best of intentions. In the United States, for instance, segregation was outlawed over 65 years ago. Yet, a recent Civil Rights Project report found that America\u2019s schools remain both separate and unequal. We see similar trends of geographical divide in cities across America and Europe, where a lack of economic opportunity has led to the disintegration of our social fabric. Restoring unity and trust will take more than generosity and good will. Charity, while wonderful, ameliorates the symptoms of inequality, but it does not address its root causes. And we must address the root causes. Keep in mind that large swaths of people around the world are growing increasingly impatient with the status quo, and we with power will feel their ire if we ignore their righteous demands for a fair and just society. So those of us with privilege need to find ways to do more justice. That means not only helping those who are often excluded, but also undoing the systems and structures that create inequities and imbalances in the first place. That will sometimes also mean working to transfer our own power, and giving up some of the privileges we currently enjoy. Toward the end of last year, when our foundation hosted a conference on the future of philanthropy, I was struck by something Luis Miranda Jr, philanthropist and father of the entertainer Lin-Manuel Miranda, said about the philosophy with which he was raised. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Miranda argued, \u201cif you\u2019re not not-doing something else, then you\u2019re not giving enough.\u201d This conception of sacrifice is profound: only when it is uncomfortable or even painful to give do you know that you are giving for reasons beyond your own benefit. And it is worth remembering that, despite this prick of pain, sacrifice has a value beyond what is given up. When you make this kind of sacrifice, you do not give up something for nothing; you give up some of your privilege for something far more valuable: justice. If we want to address the inequality of sacrifice, therefore, those of us with the most ought to recommit ourselves to doing the most. Perhaps that means paying a higher tax rate to finance public goods or wielding our influence to promote inclusive public policies. Or perhaps it means devoting more time, money, and effort toward rebuilding the broken systems that perpetuate inequality. We all must ask ourselves what system, status, or status quo we are willing to part with to benefit others. Only then \u2013 only when we have paired our generous impulses with acts of justice \u2013 will we diminish the inequality of sacrifice, and build a better, more equitable world.

She often felt overwhelmed at work \u2013 and whenever she took out her phone and saw \u201call these messages coming up\u201d, she felt worse. \u201cIt was very easy to get distracted from why I\u2019d pulled my phone out, or to feel like there were so many people that I needed to reply to immediately.\u201d When we talk about the fragmenting effect of technology on our attention, or the dopamine hits that keep us refreshing our feeds as if they are buttons on fruit machines, we are often thinking about notifications: the pings, pop-ups and glowing red dots that pull us back into our phones, and push us from app to app. According to one small study conducted in 2014, mobile phone users receive an average of 63.5 alerts every day, with most viewed within minutes \u2013 whether the phone is on silent or not. A 2016 study by Deloitte found that people check their phone, on average, 47 times a day \u2013 often in response to alerts. It is hardly any wonder some people are undergoing a notification detox. These might be messages from friends, family, your boss or your bank. They might be breaking news alerts, or reminders to drink water or meditate, or simply apps alerting you to their presence on your phone. (Turn those ones off, right now.)

      "body": "<p>Joanne and Julien met at the scene of a bank robbery, just after the police had shot and killed the culprit. It was 1988, and \u201cthere were a lot of bank robberies that year,\u201d Joanne says. Montreal, continues Julien, \u201cused to have the reputation of being the bank robbery capital of the world\u201d. He was the political reporter for the Montreal Daily News. It was a boring beat compared with the action happening on the streets, he says, so he and a colleague, the photographer Aussie Whiting, would listen out for police reports of robberies and rush off to them. \u201cWe were always the first on the scene,\u201d he says. On that summer\u2019s day: \u201cWe got in his car and he zoomed through all the red lights.\u201d They got exclusive photographs and interviews with the police.</p> <p>By the time Joanne, a radio reporter for Canada\u2019s national broadcaster, CBC, arrived, everyone had gone, although there was still some blood on the pavement. \u201cIt was pretty grisly in those days,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one else was around and then I saw Julien sitting on a bench.\u201d They got talking and he offered to give her his recorded interviews. \u201cI saved her story,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It was a generous act. \u201cHe was very nice. I remember what he was wearing \u2013 a red-and-white striped shirt. He was very handsome,\u201d says Joanne. Julien thought Joanne was \u201cvery friendly and very pretty. Despite what we say about CBC reporters \u2013 they\u2019re kind of the top shelf of journalism, but print reporters think they\u2019re better \u2013 I was kind of impressed.\u201d</p> <p>She knew his name, though they had not bumped into each other on jobs before. They met again a few weeks later at a party held by a mutual friend. \u201cOnce I heard he was a city hall reporter, I started asking for a lot more city hall stories,\u201d she says. It wasn\u2019t hard, as nobody else in her newsroom particularly wanted to cover them. \u201cThen we did start seeing each other a lot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff3351ae03d80c355bb9adb43ae153dcabe75dd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3351ae03d80c355bb9adb43ae153dcabe75dd9/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joanne and Julien on holiday in Montana in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joanne and Julien on holiday in Montana in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Joanne Bayly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In those days, Julien says, \u201cI had an office at city hall.

      "bodyText": "Joanne and Julien met at the scene of a bank robbery, just after the police had shot and killed the culprit. It was 1988, and \u201cthere were a lot of bank robberies that year,\u201d Joanne says. Montreal, continues Julien, \u201cused to have the reputation of being the bank robbery capital of the world\u201d. He was the political reporter for the Montreal Daily News. It was a boring beat compared with the action happening on the streets, he says, so he and a colleague, the photographer Aussie Whiting, would listen out for police reports of robberies and rush off to them. \u201cWe were always the first on the scene,\u201d he says. On that summer\u2019s day: \u201cWe got in his car and he zoomed through all the red lights.\u201d They got exclusive photographs and interviews with the police. By the time Joanne, a radio reporter for Canada\u2019s national broadcaster, CBC, arrived, everyone had gone, although there was still some blood on the pavement. \u201cIt was pretty grisly in those days,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one else was around and then I saw Julien sitting on a bench.\u201d They got talking and he offered to give her his recorded interviews. \u201cI saved her story,\u201d he says. It was a generous act. \u201cHe was very nice. I remember what he was wearing \u2013 a red-and-white striped shirt. He was very handsome,\u201d says Joanne. Julien thought Joanne was \u201cvery friendly and very pretty. Despite what we say about CBC reporters \u2013 they\u2019re kind of the top shelf of journalism, but print reporters think they\u2019re better \u2013 I was kind of impressed.\u201d She knew his name, though they had not bumped into each other on jobs before. They met again a few weeks later at a party held by a mutual friend. \u201cOnce I heard he was a city hall reporter, I started asking for a lot more city hall stories,\u201d she says. It wasn\u2019t hard, as nobody else in her newsroom particularly wanted to cover them. \u201cThen we did start seeing each other a lot.\u201d In those days, Julien says, \u201cI had an office at city hall. We had desks on the floor of the chamber with the elected officials and I noticed she was impressed.\u201d Joanne laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that.\u201d Julien smiles. \u201cOh yeah, she was impressed.\u201d \u201cThen I really made the next move,\u201d says Joanne. \u201cI got free tickets for the movie Mississippi Burning and I thought: \u2018This is the chance; I\u2019ll phone him and ask him if he wants to go.\u2019 That was our first real date.\u201d It went well \u2013 but, she says: \u201cJulien again was not very proactive and it was hard to communicate in those days.

It was retweeted by Bowie\u2019s son Duncan Jones, read by Jarvis Cocker and Benedict Cumberbatch at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/letters-live\">Letters Live</a> and turned into a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04zs6yb\">classical music composition for Radio 3 by composer John Uren</a>. It discussed how Bowie\u2019s last album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/david-bowie-blackstar-review-a-spellbinding-break-with-his-past\">Blackstar</a>, helped doctor and patient \u201ccommunicate very openly about death, something many doctors and nurses struggle to introduce as a topic of conversation\u201d. It also enabled his patient to convey the vision of her own dying moments: \u201cYou gave her a way of expressing this most personal longing to me, a relative stranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething happens when we talk about the music we love: it\u2019s more abstract, made by people who feel close to you, but not so close that you can\u2019t discuss them,\u201d Taubert says today. Music being played in a hospital or hospice or at home can also be a great comfort, he says, as hearing is often preserved as our other faculties deteriorate. \u201cPatients\u2019 eyes are often closed, so senses such as hearing mean much more.

While precise numbers are still debated, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-features/special-focus/liberation-of-auschwitz\">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, the German SS systematically killed at least 960,000 of the 1.1-1.3 million Jews deported to the camp. More people died at Auschwitz than at any other Nazi concentration camp.</p>\n    <p>When the camp was liberated on 27 January 1945, Soviet troops found grisly evidence of the horror. About 7,000 starving prisoners were found alive, and millions of items of clothing that once belonged to men, women and children were discovered along with 6,350kg of human hair.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In January 1942, the Nazi party had decided to roll out the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d. Camps dedicated solely to the extermination of Jews had been created before, but this was formalised by SS Lieut-Gen Reinhard Heydrich in a speech at the Wannsee conference. The extermination camp Auschwitz II was opened in the same year.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz II had the largest prisoner population of any of the three main camps on the site. In January 1942, the first chamber using lethal Zyklon B gas was built. Four further chambers were built, and these were used for systematic genocide up until November 1944.</p>\n    <p>Auschwitz was also the site of disturbing medical experimentation on Jewish and Roma prisoners, including practices such as castration and sterilisation. SS captain Dr Josef Mengele was one of the physicians practising there.</p>\n    <p>More than 7,000 Nazi personnel are thought to have served at Auschwitz but only a few hundred have been prosecuted for the crimes committed there. The pursuit of justice has not ceased, with German justice officials saying in 2013 that there were 30 surviving Auschwitz officials who should face prosecution. In 2019, a former guard at Stutthof concentration camp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/16/former-guard-93-at-nazi-concentration-camp-to-go-on-trial-in-hamburg\">was placed on trial</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/george-arnett\"><b>George Arnett</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>My grandmother, Ilse Stanley, was an actor in Berlin, daughter of the head cantor of Germany\u2019s largest congregation.

LA pays tribute to NBA great and daughter killed in crash Basketball players and fans, figures from sports, entertainment and politics are in mourning following the death in a helicopter crash of Kobe Bryant, the 41-year-old NBA legend described by Magic Johnson as the \u201cgreatest Laker of all time\u201d. Eight others died in the accident on Sunday, including Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter Gianna, herself a promising basketball talent. Bryant, writes Gabriel Baumgaertner, was \u201ca titanic figure who inspired a generation\u201d. Complicated legacy. Bryant\u2019s remarkable legacy was complicated by his 2003 arrest over accusations he had raped a teenager at a hotel in Colorado.

Billie Eilish wins big at Grammys overshadowed by tragedy Eighteen-year-old Billie Eilish was the biggest winner at Sunday night\u2019s Grammys, taking home five awards including best new artist, album of the year and song of the year for Bad Guy.

Here\u2019s the full list of winners. Academy row. This year\u2019s Grammys were already mired in controversy over the recent suspension of Recording Academy\u2019s president, Deborah Dugan, following misconduct allegations, which she countered with her own legal complaint.

More than 400 people are in a critical condition in China after being struck down by the virus, which experts warned may already have infected more than 100,000 people worldwide. Two cases were confirmed in California and Arizona on Sunday, bringing the total in the US to five. Simple precautions. The WHO has offered some basic advice on how to protect yourself from the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.

Miranda Bryant talks to the women who \u201crisked their lives\u201d by returning to work just two weeks after their children were born. Should architects work for repressive regimes?

Our full story on the death of Kobe Bryant is here: Kobe Bryant was apparently named after famous wagyu beef from the ancient Japanese city of Kobe. Mainichi, a Japanese newspaper, carried this statement from Tetsunori Tanimoto, secretary general of the Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association: We are shocked and saddened to hear of his sudden death and would like to offer our condolences. \u201c(Bryant) starred in the NBA and the Olympics and we are very grateful that he helped spread the name \u2018Kobe beef\u2019 the world over.\u201d Kobe Bryant\u2019s death has devastated his fans in the Philippines. Unlike many Asian countries, which are obsessed with football, basketball is the favourite sport in the former US colony, where there is a basketball court in every block. Senator Emmanuel Pacquiao, a world boxing icon, posted a photo of him with Bryant on his Twitter account. \u201cThe world lost a legend today but the impact and legacy he leaves behind will last forever! #RIPMamba,\u201d Pacquiao wrote. The death of the basketball legend was the banner headline on many news websites in the Philippines. Bryant visited the nation often, where he played exhibition games with local basketball superstars, college players, and even street kids. His last visit was in 2016, months after he retired. A spokesperson for President Rodrigo Duterte issued a statement: \u201cThe Office of the President is saddened after learning about the tragic news of the death of NBA superstar and legend, Kobe Bryant, and his daughter, who were killed in a helicopter crash. Mr. Bryant was a frequent visitor in the Philippines. He was well-loved by his Filipino fans.\u201d In China, where Bryant had a huge following, there has been an outpouring of grief. A hashtag referring to his death became the most read, with more than 1.7bn views on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter equivalent. Yi Jianlian, the all-time leading scorer of the Chinese Basketball Association who used to play in the NBA, said: \u201cWe both suffered a fractured finger. I rested for a month and a half, and you did not rest for a single day. Since then I learned from you what persistence meant.\u201d \u201cI watched you challenge Michael Jordan at the 1998 All-Star and fell in love with you. You were the reason that I became fond of basketball!\u201d Xinjiang Flying Tiger player Zeng Lingxu posted. \u201cFor 20 years, you had always been my inspiration ... I hope your dear basketball will keep you accompany in the paradise. R.I.P. my idol for life.\u201d Many winners at the Grammys have paid tribute to Kobe Bryant on Sunday night. Adrian Horton has a write up of the night: The shadow of basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others mere hours before the show, loomed large over a ceremony held at the Staples Center in which he played for the Los Angeles Lakers for over 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re all feeling crazy sadness right now,\u201d said returning host Alicia Keys to a room in which Bryant\u2019s retired jersey numbers shone brightly overhead. \u201cWe\u2019re literally standing here heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built.\u201d NBA great Kobe Bryant was on board a helicopter carrying nine people that crashed into a hill in Calabasas, approximately 30 miles west of Los Angeles Chief Daryl Osby of the Los Angeles County Fire Department says there were no survivors TMZ, citing a family representative, says Bryant\u2019s daughter Gianna was on board with her father Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva refuses to confirm the identities of those on board before a coroner\u2019s report is released Dr Jonathan Lucas, the County of Los Angeles\u2019s chief medical examiner, warns it may take a few days complete their recovery from the site Tributes pour in from all over the world, including from Barak Obama, Michael Jordan and Shaquille O\u2019Neal Fans from across the city gather at Los Angeles\u2019 Staples Center to pay tribute Gianna Bryant \u2013 who shared a passion for basketball with her father \u2013 dreamed of following in Kobe\u2019s footsteps and one day becoming a professional basketball player and playing in the WNBL. On Sunday those dreams were shattered. Read more here: Bryant\u2019s career was synonymous with standout moments, from the 81 point-haul against Toronto in 2006 to the 60 he dropped in his final game in 2016, via far too many more to mention. Do you have a favourite? Let us know, by using the form in the article below. Here\u2019s a few to get things going: The tributes continue to pour in for Bryant and his family. At the Grammys, being held at Staples Center in LA \u2013 the Lakers\u2019 home stadium and where Bryant spent the large majority of his career \u2013 global pop sensation Lizzo had this message: Dr Jonathan Lucas, the County of Los Angeles\u2019s chief medical examiner, has just provided an update to the media where he warned it may take a few days complete their recovery from the site. After offering his condolences, Lucas said he wanted to stress that his team will be \u201cworking thoroughly, quickly and with the utmost compassion\u201d to \u201cgive closure to the families involved\u201d. \u201cToday, our department had multiple members of our special operations response team that were on site,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cOur recovery efforts began today but ... given the terrain and the condition of the site, we expect that this will probably take at least a couple, if not a few days, to complete the recovery. \u201cOur priority is completing the recovery as quickly as possible, but safely and thoroughly, and doing that to make sure our staff, like I said, are safe. Lucas said authorities would then focus on identifying the victims and notifying their families. \u201cAll of which we\u2019ll do as soon as we possibly can.\u201d On the east coast, newspapers are sharing a preview of the front and sports pages that readers will find on the news stands on Monday. And here is some fascinating trivia from back when Bryant retired from the sport. An assistant girls basketball coach at an Orange County elementary school has been identified as among the victims of the helicopter crash that also claimed Kobe Bryant\u2019s life. Christina Mauser was a coach Harbor Day School in Corona Del Mar, CNN reported. Her husband, Matt Mauser, wrote on Facebook: \u201cMy kids and I are devastated. We lost our beautiful wife and mom today in a helicopter crash. Please respect our privacy. Thank you for all the well wishes they mean so much.\u201d Dwayne Wade, one of the first basketball stars to react to the news \u2013 with a tweet simply saying \u201cNo, God please No!\u201d \u2013 has taken to Instagram to share his grief. \u201cToday is one of the saddest days in my lifetime,\u201d an emotional Wade says on his Instagram story. \u201cIf you got the chance to really know Kobe, there ain\u2019t nobody better, man ...These are the moments when you ask why.\u201d Wiping away tears, Wade says that when Bryant retired, he \u201cleft a hole in my wanting to play\u201d. \u201cWhen I came in the league I chased him ... I wanted to be respected by him.\u201d \u201cKobe, thank you, man. Thank you for all the memories.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department has said the weather conditions on Sunday morning did not meet its minimum standards for flying, multiple outlets have reported. A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, Josh Rubenstein, told the LA Times that it had grounded its helicopters Sunday morning as a result of fog. They did not fly until the afternoon. \u201cThe weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,\u201d Rubenstein said. The Australian actor Hugh Jackman says he\u2019s \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by Bryant\u2019s death, crediting the former Lakers shooting guard and Shaquille O\u2019Neal as the reason he fell in love with basketball. The Los Angeles International Airport has paid tribute to Bryant by illuminating the building in yellow and purple. Hi everyone, this is Luke Henriques-Gomes taking over for a while. We mentioned earlier that Sunday\u2019s Pro Bowl game some fans could be heard chanting Kobe Bryant\u2019s name. Here\u2019s what that sounded like. The Los Angeles Times has spoken to Kurt Deetz, who said he used to fly Bryant in the same helicopter that crashed on Sunday. He said the S-76B, the model of helicopter that Bryant used, was considered safe, comparing it to \u201ca Cadillac, a limousine \u2014 it\u2019s limo-esque.\u201d Deetz said the foggy conditions in the area of the crash on Sunday were probably the cause of the tragedy. \u201cThe likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. However, one witness to the crash, Jerry Kocaharian, told the LA Times, that the aircraft sounded like it was struggling. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t sounding right, and it was real low,\u201d Kocharian said. \u201cI saw it falling and spluttering. But it was hard to make out as it was so foggy.\u201d Bryant\u2019s former team, the Los Angeles Lakers, played last night in Philadelphia, where Bryant was born and went to high school. The Lakers most famous current player, LeBron James, passed Bryant as the NBA\u2019s third-highest all-time scorer in that game and he was seen in tears after the Lakers\u2019 flight touched down in California earlier today. James has yet to make a public comment on Sunday\u2019s tragedy but he wore sneakers referencing Bryant\u2019s nickname, Black Mamba, during the game in Philadelphia. He also spoke of his admiration for Bryant after passing him on the scoring list. \u201cJust admiring him for so many years and seeing him from afar, and then being able to be in practices with him, and me watching and learning \u2014 it\u2019s just too much. The story is just too much. It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd just to make a long story short, now I\u2019m here in a Lakers uniform in Philadelphia, where he\u2019s from, where the first time I ever met him he gave me his shoes, it\u2019s just surreal.\u201d Sabrina Ionescu, the best player in women\u2019s college basketball and a future international star, was a close friend of Bryant, who had helped mentor her. She learned of Bryant\u2019s death before Sunday\u2019s game, in which she helped Oregon beat their rivals Oregon State, but insisted on playing. \u201cEverything I do, I do it for him,\u201d Ionescu, who was seen fighting back tears at one point, told ESPN. \u201c[He was a] really close friend. And this season\u2019s for him.\u201d Ionescu also knew Bryant\u2019s daughter, Gianna, who died in Sunday\u2019s crash. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing a family member [for Ionescu],\u201d Oregon coach Kelly Graves said. And what of that farewell game? Bryant didn\u2019t disappoint in a performance that featured everything that was glorious (and maddening) about No24. At the time Dave Schilling attempted to get to grips with why LA was so in love with him. Bryant retired from the NBA in April 2016, after five championships and countless brilliant plays. Here are some of the best moments of his career to savour: Like so many others the world over, Ben Simmons found Bryant an inspiration as a young basketballer. In a series of tweets, the Philadelphia 76ers player spoke of his admiration for Byrant, who was and \u201cwill continue to be an inspiration to this world\u201d. Barack Obama, the former President of the United States and a basketball enthusiast, tweeted earlier of his heartbreak at the news. Donald Trump followed suit some time later, as did another former president, Bill Clinton. The New York Times reports that Bryant was on his way to his Mamba Sports Academy to coach his daughter when they died in the crash. The Academy was hosting a tournament for young players on Sunday, and all games were cancelled when news of his death emerged. Another victim of Sunday\u2019s crash was John Altobelli, a baseball coach at Orange Coast College in California, where he had worked for 27 years. His family confirmed that two other relatives, Keri and Alyssa Altobelli, had died in the crash. \u201cJohn meant so much to not only Orange Coast College, but to baseball,\u201d said the college\u2019s athletic director Jason Kehler. \u201cHe truly personified what it means to be a baseball coach. The passion that he put into the game, but more importantly his athletes, was second to none - he treated them like family. Our deepest condolences go out to the Altobelli family during this time of tragedy.\u201d He also helped develop Jeff McNeil, an All-Star for the New York Mets. McNeil emerged as a top-rank player relatively late in his career, and credited Altobelli\u2019s influence when he spoke to ESPN on Sunday. \u201cHim taking that chance on me, having me on his team, got me drafted,\u201d said McNeil. The Grammys are taking place in the Staples Center, home of the Lakers tonight, and Alicia Keys and Boyz II Men sang in tribute to Bryant and his family at the start of the ceremony. Boyz II Men are from Philadelphia, where Bryant was born and where he attended high school before joining the NBA. \u201cWe love you, Kobe,\u201d said Keys at the end of the performance. \u201cHere we are together on music\u2019s biggest night celebrating the artists that do it best, but to be honest with you we are all feeling crazy sadness right now,\u201d Keys said. \u201cRight now, Kobe and his daughter Gianna ... are in our spirits, they\u2019re in our hearts, they\u2019re in prayers, they\u2019re in this building. Take a moment and hold them inside of you and share our strength and our support with their families.\u201d Bryant was one of the greatest players of all time, and he looked horns with one of the greatest coaches of all time, Gregg Popovich many times when the Lakers met the Spurs. Popovich always has something interesting and insightful to say about the game, and the wider world beyond, and he spoke powerfully about Bryant before the Spurs\u2019 game with the Raptors on Sunday. \u201cEverybody is pretty emotional about the tragedy with Kobe,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us know what a great player he was, but he went beyond great playing, he was a competitor, that goes unmatched. It\u2019s what made him as a player so attractive to everybody, that focus, that competitiveness, that will to win. And even more importantly than that, we all feel a deep sense of loss for what he meant to all of us in so many ways and so many millions of people loved him for so many different reasons. It\u2019s just a tragic thing. There are no words that can describe how everybody feels about it. We are all thinking about the family and the process that they\u2019re going to be going through now. That\u2019s where all our thoughts should be.\u201d Kobe Bryant was (and is) the fourth-highest points scorer in NBA history. The highest is his fellow Laker, and Guardian columnist, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He recorded some of his thoughts on Bryant, and their relationship in a video on Twitter on Sunday. Bryant was an intense, driven player who was almost unstoppable when he was on a scoring tear. Here\u2019s a look back at some of the highlights from an extraordinary 20-year career that took in five NBA championships and two Olympic gold medals. The BBC has apologised after mistakenly showing footage of LeBron James rather than Kobe Bryant in a report on the latter player\u2019s death. The BBC blamed \u201chuman error\u201d for the mistake. \u201cIn tonight\u2019s coverage of the death of Kobe Bryant on BBCNewsTen we mistakenly used pictures of LeBron James in one section of the report,\u201d wrote Paul Royall, editor of BBC News at Six and Ten, on Twitter. \u201cWe apologise for this human error which fell below our usual standards on the programme.\u201d Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, who also died in Sunday\u2019s crash was a talented basketball player who dreamed of one day playing in the WNBA. She was often seen with her father at games. In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Bryant spoke about how Gianna shared his fierce drive and love for the game. When someone said he should have had a son to carry on his basketball legacy, Gianna spoke up: \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Oy. I got this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s right. Yes, you do. You got this,\u2019\u201d Bryant recalled. The Grammys are taking place today at the Staples Center, where Bryant enjoyed some of his greatest games as a Laker. The ceremony was stopped for a minute\u2019s silence to remember him. Bryant lived in Italy between the ages of six and 13, while his father, Joe, played professionally there. He could speak Italian fluently, nearly returned to play there during the NBA lockout in 2011 and was a huge fan of AC Milan. \u201cAll of the NBA players are important, because they\u2019re legends, but he\u2019s particularly important to us because he knew Italy so well, having lived in several cities here,\u201d Italian basketball federation president Giovanni Petrucci told The Associated Press on Sunday. \u201cHe had a lot of Italian qualities. He spoke Italian very well. He even knew the local slang\u201d, Petrucci added. Milan also tweeted out a tribute to Bryant. \u201cWe have no words to express how shocked we are to hear of the tragic passing of one of the greatest sportsmen of all time and Rossonero fan, Kobe Bryant. All our thoughts are with the families of those affected by this tragic accident. You will forever be missed, Kobe.\u201d Sam Levin spoke to fans gathering at the Staples Center on Sunday, one man described the city as \u201cbleeding\u201d after his death, while others paid tribute to Bryant\u2019s daughter, Gigi: The French sports newspaper, L\u2019Equipe, has dedicated its front page to Bryant, describing him as \u201cL\u2019Etoile Bryant\u201d, a play on words on \u201c\u00e9toile brillante\u201d or \u201cbright star\u201d. Michael Jordan, widely regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time, has issued a statement on Bryant\u2019s death. \u201cI am in shock over the tragic news of Kobe\u2019s and Gianna\u2019s passing. Words can\u2019t describe the pain I\u2019m feeling,\u201d wrote Jordan, who won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. \u201cI loved Kobe \u2013 he was like a little brother to me. We used to talk often and I will miss those conversations very much. He was a fierce competitor, one of the greats of the game and a creative force. Kobe was also an amazing dad who loved his family deeply \u2013 and took great pride in his daughter\u2019s love for the game of basketball. [My wife] Yvette joins me in sending my deepest condolences to Vanessa, the Lakers organization and basketball fans around the world.\u201d Bryant was a huge supporter of women\u2019s basketball after his retirement. South Carolina women\u2019s basketball coach Dawn Staley spoke about his achievements following her team\u2019s game against Georgia today. \u201cAwful. Words can\u2019t describe it,\u201d Staley told the SEC Network. \u201cYou see Kobe supporting girls basketball, women\u2019s basketball. He pretty much dedicated his post-career to his daughters. It\u2019s a shame we lose such a great person. It\u2019s tragic. I\u2019m still in a state of shock. Our hearts and prayers go out to his family.\u201d Tiger Woods, a lifetime LA Lakers fan, said he was \u201cincredibly sad\u201d to learn of Bryant\u2019s death, just moments after he left the 18th green at the US PGA tournament at Torrey Pines he is currently playing in. Bryant\u2019s interest and promotion of women\u2019s soccer was well documented. The USWNT said it will carry the \u201cMamba Mentality forever\u201d. The Brazilian soccer star Neymar celebrated his goal for Paris Saint Germain on Sunday with a nod to Bryant. After he scored his second goal of the game against Lille, he flashed up a two and a four with his fingers, a reference to Bryant\u2019s No24 jersey, then pointed his fingers to the sky. One of Bryant\u2019s fellow Los Angeles Lakers greats, Magic Johnson, has given his thoughts on today\u2019s news. \u201cMy friend, a legend, husband, father, son, brother, Oscar winner and greatest Laker of all-time is gone,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players.\u201d A member of the Los Angeles Country sheriff\u2019s department gives more details. He does not confirm the identities of any of those who died in the crash. Initial reports said five people were on board the helicopter, but it seems that there were more. \u201cAs the chief indicated there were no survivors. We have a manifest to indicate there were nine people on board of the aircraft. The pilot plus eight individuals. There is wide speculation who the identities are, however it is entirely inappropriate right now to identify anyone by name until the coroner has made the identification through their process and made notifications to the next of kin. \u201cIt would be extremely disrespectful to understand that your loved one who has perished and you learn about it from TMZ. That is just wholly inappropriate. So we\u2019re not going to be going there. We\u2019re going to wait until the coroner does her job and we\u2019re assisting the families of those who believe they have been impacted and it\u2019s a tough process.\u201d The Los Angeles County fire chief, Daryl Osby, is giving details of the crash at a press conference. \u201cOur firefighters on the scene indicate that there was a debris field and steep terrain with a quarter acre brush fire that was occurring at the time. Our firefighters hiked into the site with medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the fire as it included the brush fire debris from the helicopter and the fire also included magnesium which is very hard for firefighters to extinguish because magnesium reacts with oxygen and water. \u201cIn addition to our firefighters hiking into the incident, we had one helicopter flying to the incident with firefighting paramedics on board. Those paramedics were hoisted down to the incident early into the incident. \u201cThey did a search of the area for survivors. Unfortunately all the survivors were determined to have perished. Firefighters and hand crews worked to extinguish the fire while carefully preserving the incident for investigation. Currently, the investigation is still ongoing.\u201d The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, has paid tribute to Bryant. \u201cThe NBA family is devastated by the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFor 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning. He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary: five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals. But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability. He was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna. \u201cWe send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Vanessa, and their family, the Lakers organization and the entire sports world.\u201d Our reporter Sam Levin has spoken to fans gathering at the Staples Center, where Bryant enjoyed countless brilliant moments during his career with the Lakers. \u201cHe was like a family member in our household,\u201d said Jerson Castillo, 41, in tears as he talked about Bryant. \u201cI kept praying it was all fake news. I\u2019m not going to be able to accept this for a long time.\u201d Edgar Ruiz had worked in security at the arena, and said he had met Bryant on a number of occasions through his job. \u201cThe city is bleeding right now,\u201d said Ruiz. \u201cI always felt the energy when he was in the building. That was my idol. Fans were inspired by his work ethic ... it\u2019s hard to take in because he had such a big impact in our community, he did so many great things in LA.\u201d Bryant was always kind to everyone at Staples, including janitors baristas and security workers, he added: \u201cHe would say hi to everyone He really was a person for the people.\u201d News of Bryant\u2019s death touched the rest of the sports world away from the NBA. At Sunday\u2019s Pro Bowl game, where the best players in the NFL gathered before next week\u2019s Super Bowl, some fans could be heard chanting Kobe Bryant\u2019s name: A minute\u2019s silence was held at the first NBA game to be played after Bryant\u2019s death, the match-up between the Denver Nuggets and Houston Rockets on Sunday afternoon. The Lakers, the team for which Bryant played for his entire career, next play on Tuesday. That game will be at their home court, the Staples Center, against cross-city rivals, the Clippers. Baskeball\u2019s legednary super star and fellow LA Laker Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who retired in 2011, has posted an emotional tribute to his close friend. Bryant\u2019s daughter Gianna, 13, known as Gigi, is believed to have been with him in the helicopter when it crashed on a hillside in Calabasas, California, earlier today. No survivors \u201cThis is a moment that leaves us struggling to find words that express the magnitude of shock and sorrow we are all feeling right now, and I am keeping Kobe\u2019s entire family in my prayers at this time of unimaginable grief,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement earlier, Reuters writes. First responders put out the flames of the crash site, Los Angeles County Sheriff said, posting a picture of a fire truck and smoke emerging from the brush in a ravine. Bryant was known to use a helicopter for travel dating to his days as a star player for the Los Angeles Lakers, when he commuted to games in a Sikorsky S-76 chopper, the celebrity news website TMZ said. The US Federal Aviation Administration identified the crashed helicopter as a Sikorsky S-76, saying in a statement that the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board would investigate. Bryant won five NBA championships with the Lakers and was named an NBA all-star 18-times in his 20-year career with the team. He was third leading scorer in league history with 33,643 points until LeBron James passed him on Saturday. Bryant and his wife, Vanessa, have four daughters: Gianna, Natalia, Bianca and Capri, who was born in June 2019. Bryant\u2019s star power translated into the entertainment world as he mingled with show business stars in Los Angeles. In 2018 he won an Oscar for his animated short film \u201cDear Basketball.\u201d But he was also accused of sexual assault in 2003 by an employee at a Colorado hotel, tarnishing his reputation and leading to a media storm to cover his trial. Bryant denied the claims and charges eventually were dropped after the woman refused to testify. Bryant and his wife Vanessa filed for divorce in 2011 after 10 years of marriage but in 2013 the couple said they had reconciled their differences. There is not yet official confirmation of Gianna\u2019s death, but multiple reports of same, the Guardian adds. There are no indications yet as to why the helicopter carrying Bryant crashed on a hillside in Calabasas, California, near Malibu on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Smoke could be seen rising from the crash site. A press conference is planned for 2pm local time (5pm ET), which may shed more light on what has happened. There are strong reports that Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter Gianna (known as Gigi) was with him in the helicopter and is among the dead. There were no survivors in the crash that killed five. Dwyane Wade, who played alongside Bryant on Team USA\u2019s gold medal winning squad at the 2008 Olympics, was one of the first basketball stars to react to the news on Sunday. Philadelphia NBA player Joel Embiid summed up some of the shock and admiration combined that the stunned sports world is feeling at the news that Bryant has been so suddenly taken. Rising Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has called the tragedy a \u201cdevastating moment\u201d. Olympic committee tweet tribute The official Twitter account of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee called Bryant, 41, a legend. Read our full breaking news story from earlier, here. We bring you the sudden and tragic news that basketball legend and LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant is dead. Please follow all developments, live, here. The NBA champion, 41, was killed earlier today in a helicopter crash in California, not far from Los Angeles, in which there were no survivors.

      "body": "<p>I love horse racing movies, or at least I love the fact that they are occasionally made. It\u2019s so encouraging when Hollywood turns the full wattage of its attention on your little world; it justifies your enthusiasm and is one in the eye for all those baffled by it.</p> \n<p>The movies themselves have generally proved hard to love, for a variety of reasons (NB: spoilers coming up soon). It\u2019s notoriously hard to make a good sports movie and when your cast is half full of animals, your difficulties multiply. I imagine many a racing project has stalled in week one, one producer turning to another with the fateful words: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give Spiderman another reboot instead?\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/aggrieved-nigel-twiston-davies-puts-bristol-de-mai-on-course-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing\">Aggrieved Twiston-Davies puts Bristol De Mai firmly on course for Gold Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One can hardly be proud of the great game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9lFUWxgZqk\">as portrayed in Dead Cert</a>, which reaches its climax when the villainous jockey is thrown from his horse during the Grand National and impaled on the spiked railings which, naturally, line the inside of the racecourse. And then celebrations continue in the winner\u2019s enclosure and nobody says: \u201cWait a minute, didn\u2019t one of the riders just die horribly?\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5l3p1a\">National Velvet is good fun</a>. I\u2019ve heard complaints about the race scenes but, considering they were shot in California, it seems to me a lot of effort went into recreating Aintree, with much success. I like the fact that the spectators have basically no idea of what\u2019s happened to which horse, which was the true Grand National experience until the advent of big screens on the infield.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s so irritating that Enid Bagnold has her heroine slide off the horse in a dead faint just after the winning post. What, so she can steer the beast over 30 fences but she can\u2019t stay on it long enough to walk round the back of the grandstands? Pffft.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv6RnFTlu4I\">Seabiscuit</a> is a fine movie adapted from a prize-winning bestseller and very enjoyable. But all pretence at gritty realism is cast aside in the portrayal of the final race, in which Gary Stevens reins back his horse to give the labouring Seabiscuit something to run with down the back stretch. Come on, man!</p> \n<p>These thoughts are timely again because Dream Horse, based on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/07/dream-alliance-grand-national\">the extraordinary story of Dream Alliance</a>, has just had its premier at the Sundance Festival in the US, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Film4/status/1220413388062224385\">a clip has been released online</a>. It shows the heroic chestnut being obstreperous when asked to exercise and the trainer lashing out at his fretful owners: \u201cWith a bit of work, it\u2019ll be worth giving him a crack at your local gymkhana.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ah well, I shall give it a chance to exceed my expectations. Who wouldn\u2019t be thrilled by a jump racing movie with Toni Collette and Damian Lewis in leading roles? I\u2019m a bit worried that, while Katherine Jenkins has been recruited to play herself, no racing people <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9883996/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast\">appear in the cast list</a>.

      "bodyText": "I love horse racing movies, or at least I love the fact that they are occasionally made. It\u2019s so encouraging when Hollywood turns the full wattage of its attention on your little world; it justifies your enthusiasm and is one in the eye for all those baffled by it. The movies themselves have generally proved hard to love, for a variety of reasons (NB: spoilers coming up soon). It\u2019s notoriously hard to make a good sports movie and when your cast is half full of animals, your difficulties multiply. I imagine many a racing project has stalled in week one, one producer turning to another with the fateful words: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give Spiderman another reboot instead?\u201d One can hardly be proud of the great game as portrayed in Dead Cert, which reaches its climax when the villainous jockey is thrown from his horse during the Grand National and impaled on the spiked railings which, naturally, line the inside of the racecourse. And then celebrations continue in the winner\u2019s enclosure and nobody says: \u201cWait a minute, didn\u2019t one of the riders just die horribly?\u201d National Velvet is good fun. I\u2019ve heard complaints about the race scenes but, considering they were shot in California, it seems to me a lot of effort went into recreating Aintree, with much success. I like the fact that the spectators have basically no idea of what\u2019s happened to which horse, which was the true Grand National experience until the advent of big screens on the infield. But it\u2019s so irritating that Enid Bagnold has her heroine slide off the horse in a dead faint just after the winning post. What, so she can steer the beast over 30 fences but she can\u2019t stay on it long enough to walk round the back of the grandstands? Pffft. Seabiscuit is a fine movie adapted from a prize-winning bestseller and very enjoyable. But all pretence at gritty realism is cast aside in the portrayal of the final race, in which Gary Stevens reins back his horse to give the labouring Seabiscuit something to run with down the back stretch. Come on, man! These thoughts are timely again because Dream Horse, based on the extraordinary story of Dream Alliance, has just had its premier at the Sundance Festival in the US, and a clip has been released online. It shows the heroic chestnut being obstreperous when asked to exercise and the trainer lashing out at his fretful owners: \u201cWith a bit of work, it\u2019ll be worth giving him a crack at your local gymkhana.\u201d Ah well, I shall give it a chance to exceed my expectations. Who wouldn\u2019t be thrilled by a jump racing movie with Toni Collette and Damian Lewis in leading roles? I\u2019m a bit worried that, while Katherine Jenkins has been recruited to play herself, no racing people appear in the cast list. Tom O\u2019Brien, who won the Welsh National on Dream Alliance, tells me he hasn\u2019t heard from the film-makers. However, the distributors tell me that real jockeys were used in some scenes. Which jockeys? We shall find out when the movie is released here in April, a fortnight after the National.

      "body": "<p>On his first weekend playing in Serie A, Ashley Young brought Inter back within touching distance of league leaders Juventus. OK, maybe that\u2019s oversimplifying things a smidge. There were twists and turns galore on a weekend when the top four sides picked up three points between them, scoring fewer goals collectively than Atalanta managed on their own.</p> \n<p>Still, let\u2019s begin with Young, and Inter. They were first to act in the title race, with a Sunday lunchtime kick-off at home to Cagliari. It felt like an opportunity to put pressure on Juventus and Lazio before they played at Napoli and Roma, respectively, in the evening.</p> \n<p>Young started at right wing-back in Inter\u2019s 3-5-2. Discussing the Englishman\u2019s arrival \u2013 as well as that of Victor Moses \u2013 at his press conference on the eve of the game, Antonio Conte stressed: \u201cThese are footballers who have not played much lately. It will take time to put them back on track.\u201d</p> \n<p>In fact, Young needed only 29 minutes to deliver his first Inter assist. Receiving a cross-field pass from Borja Valero outside the corner of the Cagliari penalty area, he drew two defenders before delivering a pinpoint centre to Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, who headed home from six yards.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1221403830593687553\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udd35\u26ab Inter in front!<br><br>\u26bd A perfect cross from debutant Ashley Young is nodded home by Lautaro Mart\u00ednez <a href=\"https://t.co/z5CdZnqzOX\">pic.twitter.com/z5CdZnqzOX</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1221403830593687553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Romelu Lukaku bounded over to celebrate, sporting a grin almost as broad as the one he wore while watching Young sing Bob Marley during <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B7ozHycBqSC/\">a team initiation</a> four nights before. Their bond can be an asset to Inter. In the 61st minute, Lukaku needed only a glance to recognise a familiar movement from his former Manchester United teammate. He released Young into the penalty area, but the run was crudely checked by Christian Oliva.</p> \n<p>It ought to have been a penalty, but none was given. A quarter of an hour later, Cagliari equalised. Lucas Castro\u2019s dummy bought Radja Nainggolan the space to shoot first-time from 25 yards, and a deflection off Alessandro Bastoni carried the ball in off the upright.</p> \n<p>A fortuitous goal, though the 1-1 final scoreline hardly felt undeserved. Inter should have scored more \u2013 Lukaku came inches away from restoring their lead at the end of a 40-yard run \u2013 but they had given up chances, too, including a Luca Pellegrini effort from Young\u2019s flank.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab66b11153b613634585dbce939bf00b538a38a0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab66b11153b613634585dbce939bf00b538a38a0/0_0_2000_1332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nainggolan is congratulated after scoring against his parent club.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nainggolan is congratulated after scoring against his parent club.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 34-year-old had tired towards the end. Conte demands a lot of his wing-backs, expecting them to advance with his centre-forwards at times. It was not Young, though, who cost his team. Several players were guilty of mistakes, and Mart\u00ednez especially merits criticism for losing his head in injury time \u2013 earning a second yellow for protests after a decision against him.</p> \n<p>Yet the greatest culprit was Conte. Asked before the game whether the arrivals of Young, Moses and, imminently, Christian Eriksen, might lead him to adapt his tactics, he replied rhetorically: \u201cWould you change something that is working?\u201d Even at the time, it felt an odd response. Inter had only won two of their previous six Serie A matches, drawing the other four.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/27/nagelsmann-reads-the-riot-act-after-leipzigs-rude-awakening-in-frankfurt\">Nagelsmann reads the riot act after Leipzig's rude awakening in Frankfurt | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sunday\u2019s stalemate marked the third consecutive game in which they have blown a lead inside the final 15 minutes. An inability to close out matches already cost them dearly in the Champions League, where they produced spellbinding first-half performances, and accompanying leads, at Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, only to lose both.</p> \n<p>Previously, Conte has blamed a lack of experience in his squad. This month\u2019s additions are intended to address that perceived weakness, though we might remind ourselves that Nainggolan \u2013 all of two years removed from a Champions League semi-final \u2013 is on loan from Inter.</p> \n<p>As Conte stormed out of San Siro at full time, refusing to speak to reporters, it seemed as though his team\u2019s title challenge was starting to fade. Instead, this would become a point gained.</p> \n<p>The Rome derby also finished 1-1 via some calamitous goalkeeping. Lazio\u2019s Thomas Strakosha was indecisive in the 26th minute, stepping forward to contest a high ball with Edin Dzeko but forgetting to raise his arms and stop the attacker from heading the ball beyond him. It was nothing compared to the error Pau L\u00f3pez made on the cusp of half-time.</p> \n<p>The ball was looping behind for a corner when the Roma goalkeeper inexplicably tipped it back into a crowded six-yard box. In a panic, he then barged Chris Smalling away from a potential headed clearance. Francesco Acerbi prodded the ball over the line, then took a long second to look around and make sure any of this was really happening before finally running off to celebrate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1221487776408973312\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\ude31 An absolute farce at the back gifts Lazio an equaliser!<br><br>\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642 Santon can't deal with it, Pau Lopez makes things worse, and then prevents Smalling from clearing it<br><br>\ud83d\udd35 Acerbi and Lazio won't mind! <a href=\"https://t.co/VDDAl0lxm3\">pic.twitter.com/VDDAl0lxm3</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1221487776408973312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Roma could take satisfaction from ending Lazio\u2019s run of 11 consecutive league wins, yet there was frustration at a failure to convert a dominant performance into a victory of their own. They stifled Lazio\u2019s attack more effectively <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OptaPaolo/status/1221513565288521729\">than any other team</a> in the last three years.</p> \n<p>And so Juventus were left with a chance to go six points clear. All they needed to do was beat a Napoli team that had lost four out of five league games under Gennaro Gattuso.</p> \n<p>They failed. Or rather, Napoli succeeded: thwarting the champions by keeping their lines compact and swamping the middle of the pitch. In the first half, they cut the supply lines completely to Cristiano Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. After the break, and especially once Miralem Pjanic had been forced off by injury, Napoli went for the jugular.</p> \n<p>Lorenzo Insigne \u2013 so disappointing for so much of this campaign \u2013 became the decisive figure. His shot from 20 yards was spilled by Wojciech Szczesny, and Piotr Zielinski forced home the rebound. Then Insigne volleyed home a second. Ronaldo grabbed a late consolation, but Napoli held on to win 2-1.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1221547560231473155\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udc4f INSIGNE WITH A BRILLIANT VOLLEY TO SEAL IT!<br><br>\ud83d\udd35 The skipper sends the San Paolo wild with a goal that doubles Napoli's lead over Juve <a href=\"https://t.co/wo2FvZ1Xx0\">pic.twitter.com/wo2FvZ1Xx0</a></p>\u2014 Premier Sports \ud83d\udcfa (@PremierSportsTV) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PremierSportsTV/status/1221547560231473155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Are Gattuso\u2019s team turning a corner? This was their first home win in the league since October, yet they eliminated Lazio from the Coppa Italia in midweek. Either way, this win meant a lot to a crowd who had jeered two perceived traitors \u2013 Higua\u00edn and Maurizio Sarri \u2013 throughout.</p> \n<p>The Juventus manager bears no ill-will. \u201cI\u2019m happy for [Napoli] players who I will share a bond with forever,\u201d he said at full time. \u201cIf they can lift themselves out of problems they\u2019ve been having, I\u2019ll be happy for them. Though I would have preferred it if they could have waited one more week!\u201d</p> \n<p>Inter and Lazio will be grateful they didn\u2019t. The title race will continue into February, though the pretenders to the throne need to show they can keep their heads as the pressure grows. Mart\u00ednez is expected to receive at least a two-game ban for his petulance at San Siro, which would cost him the Milan derby. If it becomes three, he will miss a trip to Lazio as well.</p> \n<p>At least Eriksen is inbound. Inter need him to hit the ground running, as Young already has.</p> \n<h2><strong>Talking point</strong></h2> \n<p>There aren\u2019t enough words to say all I want to about Atalanta here. The best I can do is encourage you to watch the highlights of their 7-0 demolition of Torino.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\"

      "bodyText": "On his first weekend playing in Serie A, Ashley Young brought Inter back within touching distance of league leaders Juventus. OK, maybe that\u2019s oversimplifying things a smidge. There were twists and turns galore on a weekend when the top four sides picked up three points between them, scoring fewer goals collectively than Atalanta managed on their own. Still, let\u2019s begin with Young, and Inter. They were first to act in the title race, with a Sunday lunchtime kick-off at home to Cagliari. It felt like an opportunity to put pressure on Juventus and Lazio before they played at Napoli and Roma, respectively, in the evening. Young started at right wing-back in Inter\u2019s 3-5-2. Discussing the Englishman\u2019s arrival \u2013 as well as that of Victor Moses \u2013 at his press conference on the eve of the game, Antonio Conte stressed: \u201cThese are footballers who have not played much lately. It will take time to put them back on track.\u201d In fact, Young needed only 29 minutes to deliver his first Inter assist. Receiving a cross-field pass from Borja Valero outside the corner of the Cagliari penalty area, he drew two defenders before delivering a pinpoint centre to Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, who headed home from six yards. Romelu Lukaku bounded over to celebrate, sporting a grin almost as broad as the one he wore while watching Young sing Bob Marley during a team initiation four nights before. Their bond can be an asset to Inter. In the 61st minute, Lukaku needed only a glance to recognise a familiar movement from his former Manchester United teammate. He released Young into the penalty area, but the run was crudely checked by Christian Oliva. It ought to have been a penalty, but none was given. A quarter of an hour later, Cagliari equalised. Lucas Castro\u2019s dummy bought Radja Nainggolan the space to shoot first-time from 25 yards, and a deflection off Alessandro Bastoni carried the ball in off the upright. A fortuitous goal, though the 1-1 final scoreline hardly felt undeserved. Inter should have scored more \u2013 Lukaku came inches away from restoring their lead at the end of a 40-yard run \u2013 but they had given up chances, too, including a Luca Pellegrini effort from Young\u2019s flank. The 34-year-old had tired towards the end. Conte demands a lot of his wing-backs, expecting them to advance with his centre-forwards at times. It was not Young, though, who cost his team. Several players were guilty of mistakes, and Mart\u00ednez especially merits criticism for losing his head in injury time \u2013 earning a second yellow for protests after a decision against him. Yet the greatest culprit was Conte. Asked before the game whether the arrivals of Young, Moses and, imminently, Christian Eriksen, might lead him to adapt his tactics, he replied rhetorically: \u201cWould you change something that is working?\u201d Even at the time, it felt an odd response. Inter had only won two of their previous six Serie A matches, drawing the other four. Sunday\u2019s stalemate marked the third consecutive game in which they have blown a lead inside the final 15 minutes. An inability to close out matches already cost them dearly in the Champions League, where they produced spellbinding first-half performances, and accompanying leads, at Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund, only to lose both. Previously, Conte has blamed a lack of experience in his squad. This month\u2019s additions are intended to address that perceived weakness, though we might remind ourselves that Nainggolan \u2013 all of two years removed from a Champions League semi-final \u2013 is on loan from Inter. As Conte stormed out of San Siro at full time, refusing to speak to reporters, it seemed as though his team\u2019s title challenge was starting to fade. Instead, this would become a point gained. The Rome derby also finished 1-1 via some calamitous goalkeeping. Lazio\u2019s Thomas Strakosha was indecisive in the 26th minute, stepping forward to contest a high ball with Edin Dzeko but forgetting to raise his arms and stop the attacker from heading the ball beyond him. It was nothing compared to the error Pau L\u00f3pez made on the cusp of half-time. The ball was looping behind for a corner when the Roma goalkeeper inexplicably tipped it back into a crowded six-yard box. In a panic, he then barged Chris Smalling away from a potential headed clearance. Francesco Acerbi prodded the ball over the line, then took a long second to look around and make sure any of this was really happening before finally running off to celebrate. Roma could take satisfaction from ending Lazio\u2019s run of 11 consecutive league wins, yet there was frustration at a failure to convert a dominant performance into a victory of their own. They stifled Lazio\u2019s attack more effectively than any other team in the last three years. And so Juventus were left with a chance to go six points clear. All they needed to do was beat a Napoli team that had lost four out of five league games under Gennaro Gattuso. They failed. Or rather, Napoli succeeded: thwarting the champions by keeping their lines compact and swamping the middle of the pitch. In the first half, they cut the supply lines completely to Cristiano Ronaldo, Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn. After the break, and especially once Miralem Pjanic had been forced off by injury, Napoli went for the jugular. Lorenzo Insigne \u2013 so disappointing for so much of this campaign \u2013 became the decisive figure. His shot from 20 yards was spilled by Wojciech Szczesny, and Piotr Zielinski forced home the rebound. Then Insigne volleyed home a second. Ronaldo grabbed a late consolation, but Napoli held on to win 2-1. Are Gattuso\u2019s team turning a corner? This was their first home win in the league since October, yet they eliminated Lazio from the Coppa Italia in midweek. Either way, this win meant a lot to a crowd who had jeered two perceived traitors \u2013 Higua\u00edn and Maurizio Sarri \u2013 throughout. The Juventus manager bears no ill-will. \u201cI\u2019m happy for [Napoli] players who I will share a bond with forever,\u201d he said at full time. \u201cIf they can lift themselves out of problems they\u2019ve been having, I\u2019ll be happy for them. Though I would have preferred it if they could have waited one more week!\u201d Inter and Lazio will be grateful they didn\u2019t. The title race will continue into February, though the pretenders to the throne need to show they can keep their heads as the pressure grows. Mart\u00ednez is expected to receive at least a two-game ban for his petulance at San Siro, which would cost him the Milan derby. If it becomes three, he will miss a trip to Lazio as well. At least Eriksen is inbound. Inter need him to hit the ground running, as Young already has. Talking point There aren\u2019t enough words to say all I want to about Atalanta here. The best I can do is encourage you to watch the highlights of their 7-0 demolition of Torino. Better yet, find somewhere to watch the whole 90 minutes, then just keep on doing that every week.",

Cluj has a big history with jazz too, and Jazz in the Park (25-28 June) was named best small festival 2019. Art, film and hair Cluj is a very creative place with a mix of established institutions like the National Art Museum and more underground galleries like Fabrica de Pensule (previously in a large warehouse-like building, it\u2019s currently closed but will reopen this year with events in different locations). One of the best modern art galleries is Galeria Quadro, while the Creic Center is a new creative hub for local artists. There\u2019s a big interest in film in Cluj too: the Transilvania International Film Festival (29 May-7 June) is the most important in Romania \u2013 it was started by a group of friends about 17 years ago and now runs for almost two weeks, attracting people from all over the world. CASA TIFF has events and exhibitions all year and has a cafe and restaurant too with vegan fare. An unusual place to check out is Hairgonomy Hair Salon, which regularly hosts DJs and live artists performing in the salon. It also holds art exhibitions. Visitors who want to see art should contact a friend of ours, Helga Thies, who recently started ArtCrawl Cluj, taking people to discover the city\u2019s diverse contemporary art. Creative bar scene Cluj is a lively student city with a great craft beer and cocktail scene. Joben Bistro is a steampunk bar with a focus on cocktails and Enigma also has a steampunk theme: the decor is amazing, with its kinetic sculptures, and it even has beer cocktails \u2013 try bloody beers with chilli sauce! Insomnia attracts artists and actors \u2013 it started as a photo gallery and became a bar \u2013 and Booha Bar is a must, especially at the weekend. Cafes to linger in Brunch has become really popular here and one great new place is District of Toast \u2013 though it does breakfast, lunch, dinner and good cocktails too! There are lots of inventive toast-based dishes, but make sure you try the clujentine eggs, served on a traditional cheese-filled pie with mushrooms and cream, and basil pesto. There\u2019s a cool outside space and inside the vibe is industrial chic. It makes its own ginger beer and uses homemade ingredients for its cocktails. It\u2019s the first place in Cluj to adopt a serious waste-free policy \u2013 which is why it serves cocktails in cute little bottles.

This \u201cmixed-income\u201d housing strategy has become an increasingly popular way to revamp crumbling public housing infrastructure in cities across the United States. In Marin City, officials contend it is needed to pay for the at least $66m in short-term and long-term repairs at the property.</p> <p>The local housing authority says it will take steps to ensure that no tenants are involuntarily displaced by the renovations. But years of delayed maintenance at Golden Gate Village, coupled with the region\u2019s history of discriminatory housing policies, has contributed to what the <a href=\"https://www.marincounty.org/-/media/files/departments/gj/reports-responses/2017-18/golden-gate-village--the-clock-is-ticking.pdf?la=en\">county\u2019s civil grand jury</a> described as a \u201cprofound level of distrust\u201d by some residents of officials\u2019 intentions for redeveloping the bayside real estate.</p> <p>And experts stress that this permanent low-income housing is often the only thing keeping many longtime residents in the area. \u201cMaking sure this kind of subsidized housing is healthy, safe and affordable is a key stabilizing factor for neighborhoods that would otherwise be facing gentrification,\u201d said Anna Cash, program director of the University of California\u2019s Urban Displacement Project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"701ed9a5a2ba37e8255b62271ab1636b53d51773\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/701ed9a5a2ba37e8255b62271ab1636b53d51773/0_523_8193_5524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Royce McLemore in front of a not-for-profit she runs out of one of the Aaron Green-designed buildings at Golden Gate Village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Royce McLemore in front of a not-for-profit she runs out of one of the Aaron Green-designed buildings at Golden Gate Village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Housing safe haven</h2> <p>About 400 of Golden Gate Village\u2019s 700 tenants are African American. As officials have spent over a decade discussing how to restore the ageing site, comprising eight high-rise and 20 low-rise buildings, these residents have watched as urban development and a tech-fueled housing crunch have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/01/from-black-panthers-to-bbq-becky-the-displacement-of-black-oakland\">reshaped black communities</a> in nearby San Francisco and east Bay Area cities such as Oakland.</p> <p>Between 2000 and 2015, the Longfellow neighborhood in Oakland lost 30% of its low-income black households, according to a <a href=\"https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/bay_area_re-segregation_rising_housing_costs_report_2019.pdf\">report</a> by the Urban Displacement Project. Meanwhile in San Francisco, low-income black households in historically African American neighborhoods dropped 17%.</p> <p>While Marin City\u2019s African American population \u2013 of which a quarter live below the poverty line, according to most recent census estimates \u2013 has declined over time, Golden Gate Village has protected many of the area\u2019s lowest-income black residents from being pushed out. But the unincorporated community has a legacy of displacement that can be traced back to the 1940s.</p> <p>Black families originally moved to Marin City to work at local shipyards during the second world war. There, thousands of workers and their families lived together in a fully integrated government housing.</p> <p>After the war, many white residents, aided by federal subsidies, bought homes in other parts of Marin county. Royce McLemore, the Golden Gate Village resident council president, remembers how black residents took over the businesses that white owners left behind.</p> <p>\u201cWe had everything: a barbershop, a grocery store, a pool hall, a beauty shop \u2013 it was very self-contained,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But in the early 1960s, the government tore down the wartime residences. Racist \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/21/roads-nowhere-infrastructure-american-inequality\">redlining</a>\u201d policies kept blacks from moving elsewhere in the county, and many eventually ended up in newly constructed housing projects including Golden Gate Village. The bustling neighborhood McLemore describes gave way to a segregated enclave with few black-owned stores and limited economic opportunity.</p> <p>Additional development in subsequent decades brought in new demographics to the area. Meanwhile, Marin became one of the most affluent counties in the region, with average rental costs now among the <a href=\"https://www.marinij.com/2019/06/20/marin-named-most-expensive-county-to-rent-a-home/\">very highest in the nation</a>.</p> <p>Even as Marin City became more diverse, patterns of discrimination persisted. In 2009, a federal investigation found that Marin county was failing to build enough affordable housing and that the shortage contributed to the concentration of minority residents in specific neighborhoods, including Marin City. The <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-marin-county-affordable-housing-20170107-story.html\">development-averse county</a> has since entered into an ongoing agreement with regulators to add more low-income units. Today, African Americans make up about a quarter of Marin City\u2019s 3,000 residents but just 2% of the county\u2019s total population, according to census estimates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"859b54dc2a46ea8e9974f7b95c324e6ddf727dad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/859b54dc2a46ea8e9974f7b95c324e6ddf727dad/0_598_7450_4470/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Gate Village in Marin City, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Golden Gate Village in Marin City, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Privatization or gentrification?</h2> <p>The Marin Housing Authority\u2019s final proposal for Golden Gate Village, which it aims to present to the county\u2019s board of supervisors in coming months, includes up to 170 new units of mixed-income housing, some of which could serve as temporary residences for tenants during renovations.</p> <p>The plan would also probably transfer ownership and management of Golden Gate Village to the project\u2019s developer, New Jersey-based Michaels Development Co, or another private entity.

      "bodyText": "Karen Ashby\u2019s apartment in a five-story high-rise in Marin City, California, sits on a hillside bordered by preserved open space, just above an estuary in a secluded arm of the San Francisco Bay. The surroundings are idyllic, but the two-bedroom apartment she rents there is falling apart. The window screens are coming loose, the cabinets and appliances are old and damaged, and the unit hasn\u2019t been painted in over a decade. Ashby is one of almost 700 low-income tenants at Golden Gate Village, a public housing project a few miles north of San Francisco, in one of California\u2019s wealthiest counties. Both the project\u2019s residents and local authorities agree the complex is in dire need of renovations. But some tenants fear plans to overhaul the site will lead to a cycle of gentrification and displacement that has played out in other parts of the Bay Area, and uprooted black communities. Some residents at the government-owned complex face even worse issues than Ashby does, including faulty heating systems, mold, hazardous electrical wiring and rodent infestations, according to a 2018 inspection report. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here, but they don\u2019t keep it up,\u201d Ashby said. As part of a plan to address the lamentable living conditions, officials have proposed building new market-rate and subsidized apartments and townhomes, and possibly demolishing dozens of existing units to make way for a portion of the construction. This \u201cmixed-income\u201d housing strategy has become an increasingly popular way to revamp crumbling public housing infrastructure in cities across the United States. In Marin City, officials contend it is needed to pay for the at least $66m in short-term and long-term repairs at the property. The local housing authority says it will take steps to ensure that no tenants are involuntarily displaced by the renovations. But years of delayed maintenance at Golden Gate Village, coupled with the region\u2019s history of discriminatory housing policies, has contributed to what the county\u2019s civil grand jury described as a \u201cprofound level of distrust\u201d by some residents of officials\u2019 intentions for redeveloping the bayside real estate. And experts stress that this permanent low-income housing is often the only thing keeping many longtime residents in the area. \u201cMaking sure this kind of subsidized housing is healthy, safe and affordable is a key stabilizing factor for neighborhoods that would otherwise be facing gentrification,\u201d said Anna Cash, program director of the University of California\u2019s Urban Displacement Project. Housing safe haven About 400 of Golden Gate Village\u2019s 700 tenants are African American. As officials have spent over a decade discussing how to restore the ageing site, comprising eight high-rise and 20 low-rise buildings, these residents have watched as urban development and a tech-fueled housing crunch have reshaped black communities in nearby San Francisco and east Bay Area cities such as Oakland. Between 2000 and 2015, the Longfellow neighborhood in Oakland lost 30% of its low-income black households, according to a report by the Urban Displacement Project. Meanwhile in San Francisco, low-income black households in historically African American neighborhoods dropped 17%. While Marin City\u2019s African American population \u2013 of which a quarter live below the poverty line, according to most recent census estimates \u2013 has declined over time, Golden Gate Village has protected many of the area\u2019s lowest-income black residents from being pushed out. But the unincorporated community has a legacy of displacement that can be traced back to the 1940s. Black families originally moved to Marin City to work at local shipyards during the second world war. There, thousands of workers and their families lived together in a fully integrated government housing. After the war, many white residents, aided by federal subsidies, bought homes in other parts of Marin county. Royce McLemore, the Golden Gate Village resident council president, remembers how black residents took over the businesses that white owners left behind. \u201cWe had everything: a barbershop, a grocery store, a pool hall, a beauty shop \u2013 it was very self-contained,\u201d she said. But in the early 1960s, the government tore down the wartime residences. Racist \u201credlining\u201d policies kept blacks from moving elsewhere in the county, and many eventually ended up in newly constructed housing projects including Golden Gate Village. The bustling neighborhood McLemore describes gave way to a segregated enclave with few black-owned stores and limited economic opportunity. Additional development in subsequent decades brought in new demographics to the area. Meanwhile, Marin became one of the most affluent counties in the region, with average rental costs now among the very highest in the nation. Even as Marin City became more diverse, patterns of discrimination persisted. In 2009, a federal investigation found that Marin county was failing to build enough affordable housing and that the shortage contributed to the concentration of minority residents in specific neighborhoods, including Marin City. The development-averse county has since entered into an ongoing agreement with regulators to add more low-income units. Today, African Americans make up about a quarter of Marin City\u2019s 3,000 residents but just 2% of the county\u2019s total population, according to census estimates. Privatization or gentrification? The Marin Housing Authority\u2019s final proposal for Golden Gate Village, which it aims to present to the county\u2019s board of supervisors in coming months, includes up to 170 new units of mixed-income housing, some of which could serve as temporary residences for tenants during renovations. The plan would also probably transfer ownership and management of Golden Gate Village to the project\u2019s developer, New Jersey-based Michaels Development Co, or another private entity. The housing authority would then start administering federal housing vouchers to residents to help cover rent. Similar privatization plans are under way at projects in urban, suburban and rural neighborhoods across the country. The US department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), which has long struggled to adequately fund public housing, touts the scheme as a way to quickly refurbish complexes falling into disrepair. In Marin City, the change would make it easier to take out loans and access federal tax credits to finance the overhaul, according to officials. \u201cWe understand the current formula of 100% public housing is not the way to fund these projects,\u201d said Lewis Jordan, director of the Marin Housing Authority. Jordan said the agency involved tenants in each step of the planning process, including in discussions for increasing community space and maintaining the historic heritage of the site. \u201cWhat people are saying is, \u2018I want a better housing choice\u2019, and we\u2019re working with them to provide that,\u201d he said. But the Golden Gate Village residents council, the tenants\u2019 elected official representation, opposes the agency\u2019s plan and has presented its own \u201cdeep green\u201d rehab proposal calling for no new development. \u201cWe want to make sure extremely low-income people can still afford to live here,\u201d said McLemore of her plan, which she said has garnered more than 200 resident signatures in support. \u201cWe have to look out for our rights and protections.\u201d The housing authority, for its part, said only a \u201csmall handful\u201d of residents actively oppose its revitalization plan.

But housing advocates say a lack of oversight can make it difficult to ensure private managers don\u2019t unlawfully evict tenants and worry about loopholes allowing for the removal of certain low-income units, Goetz added.

Washington invited the opposition leader to make sure whoever becomes Israel\u2019s next leader after the 2 March election will be on board in advance.</p> \n<p>Standing beside Netanyahu<strong> </strong>in the Oval Office, Trump said the plan would be announced on Tuesday at noon Washington time (5pm GMT). \u201cAnd it\u2019s a very big plan,\u201d he said, adding he had already secured Netanyahu\u2019s support.</p> \n<p>He said the initiative was something the Palestinians \u201cshould want\u201d but acknowledged they \u201cwon\u2019t want it initially\u201d. \u201cI think in the end they will. I think in the end they\u2019re going to want it. It\u2019s very good for them,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>In his remarks, Trump said he hoped Netanyahu would implement the plan in the next few weeks. It was not clear if he meant Israel unilaterally imposing the proposals or persuading the Palestinians to agree within that timeframe.</p> \n<p>Later on Monday, Gantz said he had held a \u201csuperb\u201d meeting with Trump. \u201cThe president\u2019s peace plan is a significant and historic milestone, indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cImmediately after the elections, I will work toward implementing it from within a stable functioning Israeli government, in tandem with the other countries in our region.\u201d</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and Trump will meet again on Tuesday and hold a joint press conference. The attention-grabbing event is sure to overshadow a planned discussion on the same day in Israel\u2019s parliament about Netanyahu\u2019s indictments.</p> \n<p>Few political aspects of the proposal have been disclosed, apart from an economic conference last summer that sought to raise money from Gulf countries to fund it. The plan was drafted by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, with input from the US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a vocal supporter of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p> \n<p>In a clear signal to his nationalist base, Netanyahu invited several settler leaders to join him in Washington for the trip.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that unlike previous attempts that have focused on getting Israeli and Palestinians leaders to find common ground, Washington\u2019s new plan is dozens of pages long and has been drafted as a set of detailed suggestions.</p> \n<p>Sensitive issues that have tripped up past efforts, such as the rights of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, will be addressed.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">administration</a> has promoted itself \u2013 especially to a large section of US evangelical voters who ardently back the Jewish state \u2013 as the most pro-Israel in the country\u2019s history. Washington has already implemented a number of historic changes in the region.</p> \n<p>It reversed decades of its policy by refraining from endorsing the internationally backed two-state solution.

Palestinians fear the plan is an attempt to bully or bribe them to relinquish long-held demands for a state and a resolution for Palestinian refugees. They anticipate the plan could be implemented by the US and Israel whether they agree to it or not.</p> \n<p>Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, referred to it as a \u201choax and fraud\u201d.</p> \n<p>The leader of Hamas, the militant group that is in power in the Gaza Strip, also warned that Trump\u2019s plan would not pass, and could lead to violence. This \u201cnew plot aimed against Palestine is bound to fail\u201d and could push the Palestinians to a \u201cnew phase in their struggle\u201d against Israel, Ismail Haniyeh said.</p> \n<p>Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, also dismissed the deal, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1221824383804755968\">tweeting </a>that the \u201cdelusional\u201d plan would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d.</p> \n<p>Last year, former European politicians \u2013 including six ex-prime ministers \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/15/europe-urged-to-reject-us-middle-east-plan-if-unfair-to-palestinians\">called on European governments</a> to reject any plan unless it is fair to Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Aid groups are also concerned about a negative impact. Noah Gottschalk, Oxfam America\u2019s Humanitarian Policy Lead, said last week that the proposal was not likely to be a peace deal, but \u201ca roadmap to permanent occupation\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has met Israeli leaders in Washington ahead of the unveiling on Tuesday of his much delayed Middle East \u201cpeace plan\u201d, amid a rising global chorus of doubt about its timing and substance. The choreography between the US and Israel has been interpreted as a convenient distraction for both Trump, who faces an impeachment trial, and Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces three criminal corruption indictments and an uncertain election campaign. Israeli media, citing unnamed Israeli officials, have reported that the measures would be extremely favourable to the country, allowing it to annex much of the Palestinian territories, including Jewish settlements, and all of contested Jerusalem. The Palestinians may be granted some form of self-rule, but under tight restrictions. The Palestinian prime minister called on Monday for world powers to boycott the initiative. \u201cThis is a plan to protect Trump from impeachment and protect Netanyahu from prison. It is not a Middle East peace plan,\u201d Mohammad Shtayyeh told a cabinet meeting. Netanyahu has sought to play up his cosy relationship with Trump domestically and to promote himself as uniquely able to extract concessions from the US. Before taking off for Washington, he said he hoped to \u201cmake history\u201d. On Monday, Trump had private meetings with both Netanyahu and his election opponent, Benny Gantz, in the Oval Office. Washington invited the opposition leader to make sure whoever becomes Israel\u2019s next leader after the 2 March election will be on board in advance. Standing beside Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Trump said the plan would be announced on Tuesday at noon Washington time (5pm GMT). \u201cAnd it\u2019s a very big plan,\u201d he said, adding he had already secured Netanyahu\u2019s support. He said the initiative was something the Palestinians \u201cshould want\u201d but acknowledged they \u201cwon\u2019t want it initially\u201d. \u201cI think in the end they will. I think in the end they\u2019re going to want it. It\u2019s very good for them,\u201d he said. In his remarks, Trump said he hoped Netanyahu would implement the plan in the next few weeks. It was not clear if he meant Israel unilaterally imposing the proposals or persuading the Palestinians to agree within that timeframe. Later on Monday, Gantz said he had held a \u201csuperb\u201d meeting with Trump. \u201cThe president\u2019s peace plan is a significant and historic milestone, indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cImmediately after the elections, I will work toward implementing it from within a stable functioning Israeli government, in tandem with the other countries in our region.\u201d Netanyahu and Trump will meet again on Tuesday and hold a joint press conference. The attention-grabbing event is sure to overshadow a planned discussion on the same day in Israel\u2019s parliament about Netanyahu\u2019s indictments. Few political aspects of the proposal have been disclosed, apart from an economic conference last summer that sought to raise money from Gulf countries to fund it. The plan was drafted by Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, with input from the US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a vocal supporter of Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. In a clear signal to his nationalist base, Netanyahu invited several settler leaders to join him in Washington for the trip. The Guardian understands that unlike previous attempts that have focused on getting Israeli and Palestinians leaders to find common ground, Washington\u2019s new plan is dozens of pages long and has been drafted as a set of detailed suggestions. Sensitive issues that have tripped up past efforts, such as the rights of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, will be addressed. Trump\u2019s administration has promoted itself \u2013 especially to a large section of US evangelical voters who ardently back the Jewish state \u2013 as the most pro-Israel in the country\u2019s history. Washington has already implemented a number of historic changes in the region. It reversed decades of its policy by refraining from endorsing the internationally backed two-state solution. It has also recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, cut millions of dollars in aid to Palestinians, and announced that it no longer views Israeli settlements in occupied territory as \u201cinconsistent with international law\u201d. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, said last week that the Palestinian leadership had a \u201cclear and unwavering position\u201d to reject any Trump-led initiatives. Palestinians fear the plan is an attempt to bully or bribe them to relinquish long-held demands for a state and a resolution for Palestinian refugees. They anticipate the plan could be implemented by the US and Israel whether they agree to it or not. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, referred to it as a \u201choax and fraud\u201d. The leader of Hamas, the militant group that is in power in the Gaza Strip, also warned that Trump\u2019s plan would not pass, and could lead to violence. This \u201cnew plot aimed against Palestine is bound to fail\u201d and could push the Palestinians to a \u201cnew phase in their struggle\u201d against Israel, Ismail Haniyeh said. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, also dismissed the deal, tweeting that the \u201cdelusional\u201d plan would be \u201cdead on arrival\u201d. Last year, former European politicians \u2013 including six ex-prime ministers \u2013 called on European governments to reject any plan unless it is fair to Palestinians. Aid groups are also concerned about a negative impact. Noah Gottschalk, Oxfam America\u2019s Humanitarian Policy Lead, said last week that the proposal was not likely to be a peace deal, but \u201ca roadmap to permanent occupation\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia has been named in a European commission report for its failure to crack down on a homegrown pirate TV and streaming service that reportedly provides illegal access to prime content including Premier League football internationally. The report has emerged at a highly sensitive time for Mike Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, who is attempting to sell the Premier League club in a potential \u00a3340m deal led by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2013 Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s investment vehicle. The biennial report lists the 13 countries the European commission deems have the worst track record for piracy and protecting intellectual property rights that \u201ccauses considerable harm to EU businesses\u201d. The Premier League, Spain\u2019s La Liga and Uefa are understood to be among at least eight rights holders and broadcasters to have submitted official complaints relating to the Saudi-based pirate TV service in the consultation stage of the commission\u2019s report. The inclusion of Saudi Arabia in the report for the first time follows two years of calls from sports bodies \u2013 including Fifa, Uefa, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga, La Liga and Italy\u2019s Serie A \u2013 as well as broadcasters including the BBC, Sky and NBCUniversal for Saudi Arabia to block the pirate service. The sporting bodies have attempted to take legal action in Saudi Arabia, but nine local legal firms declined to take on the copyright case. The report, which aims to help the European commission \u201cfocus efforts and resources\u201d on tackling piracy, says that Saudi Arabia\u2019s enforcement of intellectual property rights \u201cfeatures serious shortcomings\u201d. \u201cStakeholders report high-scale satellite and online piracy and ineffective enforcement measures to tackle them,\u201d the report says. \u201cAn allegedly Saudi operator called BeoutQ currently makes available \u2013 without authorisation \u2013 content belonging to EU sport event organisers and EU right holders in the territory of Saudi Arabia, the Middle East and North Africa as well as in the EU. Saudi Arabia has reportedly not taken sufficient steps to stop the infringement despite the fact that the satellite services of BeoutQ are being transmitted by the satellite of the partly state-owned Arabsat.\u201d The pirate TV service, which also provides access to illegal streaming apps, surged in popularity after making global headlines for broadcasting the entire football World Cup. The All England Lawn Tennis Club has condemned BeoutQ for illegally streaming Wimbledon worldwide for the past two years. BeoutQ was was launched in 2017 when Saudi Arabia mounted an economic boycott of Qatar. It initially only pirated the feed of Qatar\u2019s beIN Media, which spends $15bn (\u00a311.5bn) on sports rights and has 55 million pay-TV customers worldwide, as part of a wider political dispute. Saudi Arabia is named as a \u201cpriority 3\u201d country, which places it below countries including China and Russia which are ranked as \u201cpriority 1\u201d and \u201cpriority 2\u201d level infringers, although the European commission says any nation appearing on its list is causing considerable harm to businesses across Europe. \u201cInfringements of intellectual property, including piracy, threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs in the EU every year,\u201d said Phil Hogan, the EU trade commissioner. \u201cThe information gathered in the report will enable us to become even more efficient in protecting EU firms and workers against intellectual property infringements like counterfeiting or copyright piracy.\u201d Yousef al-Obaidly, the chief executive of beIN Media Group, said: \u201cThe European commission\u2019s latest report adds to the chorus of voices calling on Saudi Arabia to follow the most basic international norm \u2013 that is to uphold the rule of law.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This week Julian Nagelsmann had his players sit through a presentation on the importance of good sleep to athletic performance. Some supporters might have felt RB Leipzig had already overindulged on that score during the Bundesliga\u2019s hibernation period, with only a couple of high impact contributions from the red-hot Timo Werner rousing them from their slumbers against Union Berlin last week to take the points that maintained a healthy lead at the top of the table. Seven days later and Leipzig were still having trouble switching on for the full duration of proceedings, although the order of service was inverted this time around. Nagelsmann\u2019s team began the afternoon by breathing the sort of flames Germany\u2019s top flight has become used to in the last couple of years.

      "bodyText": "Private detectives were hired by the Sunday People newspaper to target the family of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler in 2002, it has been alleged. The claims are made in legal papers lodged as part of a civil action being taken by a range of claimants, including Prince Harry. Private investigators at a company, Starbase, are alleged to have been hired by executives at the newspaper as police tried to find the missing 13-year-old in March 2002. One of the Sunday People\u2019s rivals, the News of the World, closed in 2011 as its owner, Rupert Murdoch, sought to limit the political and commercial fallout from the phone-hacking affair and the revelation that an investigator working for it had hacked the schoolgirl\u2019s phone. But the new legal documents, lodged in the high court in November and first reported on by Byline Investigates, also allege that the Sunday People placed the Dowler family under \u201cunlawful\u201d surveillance before later publishing an article 10 days after the teenager disappeared. Reach plc, the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People, declined to comment. Neil Wallis was the editor of the Sunday People between 1998 and 2003 before going on to become the deputy editor of the News of the World. There is no suggestion that Wallis, who has also been approached for comment, was involved in engaging Starbase. He walked free from court in July 2015 after being cleared of conspiracy to hack phones at the News of the World and claimed his prosecution had been politically motivated. Andy Coulson, the former Downing Street adviser to David Cameron, was sentenced the year before for 18 months for plotting to hack phones while he was in charge of the News of the World. Press reform campaigners have said the allegations in the civil action raise the possibility that a second newspaper illegally hacked Dowler\u2019s phone. Prof Brian Cathcart, the journalism professor and co-founder of the Hacked Off campaign group, told the BBC: \u201cIf it is true, we need to know who authorised it and how many people knew. The Metropolitan Police refused to take the matter in hand, and the civil courts are not the place to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Nathan Sparkes, policy director of the Hacked Off campaign group, said if the new allegations are true \u201cthen the Sunday People\u2019s owners, Reach plc, will have serious questions to answer about why only now this is coming to light. \u201cThe government will face accusations of complicity in any cover-up, having cancelled the only means of exposing the true of extent of phone hacking and other illegality at national newspapers: Leveson Part Two. \u201cAlmost 18 years after Milly\u2019s death, there is still so much we don\u2019t know about the activities of the newspapers who targeted her phone for stories at the time and their relationship with the police, who knew that the News of the World hacked Milly\u2019s phone back in 2002 but failed to act.

The guilty verdict hinged on a written confession in which the teenager had withdrawn the complaint but which her defence team argued was extracted under duress, in the absence of a lawyer or translator, after eight hours of police questioning. During the newspaper interview, in which the woman described crawling \u201clike a crab across a floor\u201d to escape, she added she had felt \u201cmixed emotions\u201d upon returning home on 7 January. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached this milestone of getting back to the UK so I can begin to feel safe again but then we\u2019ve got this whole other aspect which is just so much bigger, that the case isn\u2019t finished,\u201d she said.

Accountants had once told him not to expect the band\u2019s success to last longer than four years \u2013 and it already had. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/05/kaiser-chiefs-songwriter-leaves-band\">Drummer Nick Hodgson</a> \u2013 who had written all their hits \u2013 was leaving the band and their last album with him, The Future Is Medieval, was their lowest charting to date.</p> <p>Fast forward just over seven years and that house is on the market; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/26/kaiser-chiefs-ducks-review\">Kaisers\u2019 latest, Duck</a>, has become their sixth Top Five album and the Leeds band have become an enduring and entertaining arena staple. In between, they have proved that they can write perfectly decent songs without Hodgson. Meanwhile, and perhaps more crucially, a stint as a judge on TV talent contest The Voice transformed the frontman from chubby, scruffy indie kid to sharply dressed, gym-toned, immaculately coiffured household name and mainstream entertainer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09889f5bddc7b4b34a6e60ab972918cfe270f58f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09889f5bddc7b4b34a6e60ab972918cfe270f58f/0_216_5681_3409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kaiser Chiefs in Birmingham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fairground attraction \u2026 Kaiser Chiefs in Birmingham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sachin Jethwa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the Wilson who bounds on, all blow-dried barnet, thrown shapes and colour-coordinated double denim.

He carries off Freddie Mercury\u2019s old \u201cday-oh\u201d call-and-response routine with aplomb, although it\u2019s wearying by the fourth time. There\u2019s even a fairground-style \u201chook-a-duck\u201d competition, during which a fan called Karen is hauled up to fish for a plastic bird to choose what they play next \u2013 2007\u2019s Thank You Very Much. </p> <p>It\u2019s a solidly choreographed arena show as all-round entertainment, with steam jets, stage sets, streamers and confetti cannons, and the Kaisers have very much become a mainstream band. Seven songs from Duck \u2013 a third of the setlist \u2013 are traditional but sharp pop constructions with hooks and catchy choruses that play safely but well in large arenas. The breezy Northern Holiday absurdly but endearingly rhymes \u201csandwiches\u201d with \u201cforeign languages\u201d. The infectiously chugging <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-ftzJ5E4bQ\">Target Market</a> is a slightly more oddball tale of attempted wooing using Powerpoint presentations. The keyboard-heavy Parachute eschews indie entirely for machine-polished, albeit slightly shouty, modern pop. There\u2019s nothing resembling a ballad, although <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPipMQvKgKk\">2014\u2019s Coming Home</a>, a U2/James-type anthem, triggers seas of swaying hands.</p> <p>Things <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObzgUfCl28\">up a gear for Ruby</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAkg4cwJp1Y\">Everyday</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAkg4cwJp1Y\"> I Love You Less and Less</a>, Oh My God and the other Blur-ry, Buzzcocks-y hits that so revitalised indie in the mid-2000s, by which time the audience is bellowing along with every number and eating from Wilson\u2019s outstretched hand.

      "bodyText": "In 2012, Kaiser Chiefs singer Ricky Wilson bought himself a house on the Cornish coast, preparing for retirement. Accountants had once told him not to expect the band\u2019s success to last longer than four years \u2013 and it already had. Drummer Nick Hodgson \u2013 who had written all their hits \u2013 was leaving the band and their last album with him, The Future Is Medieval, was their lowest charting to date. Fast forward just over seven years and that house is on the market; the Kaisers\u2019 latest, Duck, has become their sixth Top Five album and the Leeds band have become an enduring and entertaining arena staple. In between, they have proved that they can write perfectly decent songs without Hodgson. Meanwhile, and perhaps more crucially, a stint as a judge on TV talent contest The Voice transformed the frontman from chubby, scruffy indie kid to sharply dressed, gym-toned, immaculately coiffured household name and mainstream entertainer. This is the Wilson who bounds on, all blow-dried barnet, thrown shapes and colour-coordinated double denim. With a hint of an American accent during opener People Know How to Love One Another \u2013 an anthem for Brexit Britain that carefully avoids splitting their market by taking sides \u2013 the Yorkshireman is a very watchable fusion of indie rocker, Elvis impersonator and Blackpool entertainment compere. The 42-year old introduces \u201cthe world-famous international pop phenomenon the Kaiser Chiefs\u201d, reappears on a platform in the middle of the crowd yelling \u201cWe are back in town\u201d and divides the crowd into sections yelling \u201cKaiser\u201d and \u201cChiefs\u201d respectively. He carries off Freddie Mercury\u2019s old \u201cday-oh\u201d call-and-response routine with aplomb, although it\u2019s wearying by the fourth time. There\u2019s even a fairground-style \u201chook-a-duck\u201d competition, during which a fan called Karen is hauled up to fish for a plastic bird to choose what they play next \u2013 2007\u2019s Thank You Very Much. It\u2019s a solidly choreographed arena show as all-round entertainment, with steam jets, stage sets, streamers and confetti cannons, and the Kaisers have very much become a mainstream band. Seven songs from Duck \u2013 a third of the setlist \u2013 are traditional but sharp pop constructions with hooks and catchy choruses that play safely but well in large arenas. The breezy Northern Holiday absurdly but endearingly rhymes \u201csandwiches\u201d with \u201cforeign languages\u201d. The infectiously chugging Target Market is a slightly more oddball tale of attempted wooing using Powerpoint presentations. The keyboard-heavy Parachute eschews indie entirely for machine-polished, albeit slightly shouty, modern pop. There\u2019s nothing resembling a ballad, although 2014\u2019s Coming Home, a U2/James-type anthem, triggers seas of swaying hands. Things up a gear for Ruby, Everyday I Love You Less and Less, Oh My God and the other Blur-ry, Buzzcocks-y hits that so revitalised indie in the mid-2000s, by which time the audience is bellowing along with every number and eating from Wilson\u2019s outstretched hand. He removes his jacket before I Predict A Riot wittily, perfectly condenses the late-night carnage in our city centres (\u201cI tried to get my taxi, a man in a tracksuit attacked me\u201d) into a timelessly chanted chorus and audience pandemonium. The Angry Mob \u2013 a prescient tale of a nation fuelled by tabloid fury \u2013 carries more wallop now than when it was written. More such heft wouldn\u2019t go amiss, but with many of their old contemporaries long gone, it\u2019s hard not to marvel at the Chiefs\u2019 ability to shapeshift and survive. \u2022 At Plymouth Pavilions, 27 January. Then touring until 3 July.",

People travelled from all over the country for the first meeting of the UK climate assembly on Saturday. Over four weekends they will discuss a range of issues with experts and decide on a set of recommendations for how the government can reach its target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Assembly member Leia, 20, from Darlington, said giving up her time for the cause was an easy decision to make: \u201cYou don\u2019t get an opportunity to influence government policy very often and climate change is really important.\u201d Another participant, Amanda, 56, a healthcare project manager from Kent, said: \u201cI was really chuffed to be chosen. There were some things which I didn\u2019t know about that I\u2019ve learned today, which is really interesting, but I\u2019ve always been quite green.\u201d Invitations to the assembly were sent out to 30,000 households chosen at random, and of the over 1,500 people who responded asking to be considered, 110 were selected by a computer to be representative of society. There\u2019s a mix of ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds and education levels, but also a range of views about the climate crisis. Chris, a 32-year-old production engineer and father of two from Oxford, was unsure of the severity of the problem. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if it was a crisis. I\u2019m not a climate denier as people will quite quickly say. Climate is real, it does change, it has changed. I appreciate man is changing it. But whether we\u2019re at the level of crisis \u2013 I hadn\u2019t seen enough information.\u201d He was keen to hear directly from experts, and was pleased to see opinions being distinguished from facts. \u201cMy biggest fear coming here is that a decision would be made purely based on emotion with no logical steps or thought about the implementation or the impact.\u201d The assembly heard from speakers at organisations including Natural England, the New Economics Foundation and Wellcome, and were given the chance to ask questions.

      "bodyText": "Some blame the defenestration of Evo Morales on a racist, rightwing coup. Others credit a popular revolt against a leader who had overstayed his welcome. Luis Aruquipa Carlo, a hardline pastor from the de facto capital, La Paz, has other ideas. \u201cThe glory is God\u2019s,\u201d proclaimed the evangelical leader who heads a conservative coalition of Bolivian churches called the National Christian Council. Aruquipa claimed that in the hours before Morales\u2019s flight to Mexico the leftist received a divine decree: \u201cPharaoh, leave Bolivia in peace!\u201d \u201cAnd I believe that just as He freed Israel from the Pharaoh of Egypt, He freed Bolivia from the Pharaoh Evo,\u201d Aruquipa said, before declaring: \u201cEvo\u2019s era is coming to an end. And the era of Christ is being born.\u201d Aruquipa was on the frontline of Morales\u2019s toppling last November, urging congregants to flood the streets in prayer and protest. And his profoundly conservative worldview offers a glimpse of the South American country\u2019s possible future as it gears up for fresh elections in which Bolivia\u2019s fast-growing religious right hopes to catapult a supporter into power. \u201c[Under Morales] we were turning into a backwards nation \u2013 people wanted to legalize abortion, to legalize gay marriage, they wanted to legalize the satanistas!\u201d complained Aruquipa, whose business card features an image of an unborn fetus and the slogan: \u201cThou Shalt not Kill. Abortion is murder!\u201d Irene Squillaci, a female pastor from Bolivia\u2019s economic powerhouse, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, said she also saw \u201csupernatural\u201d support for Morales\u2019s downfall. \u201cI see it as a battle between Good and Evil,\u201d Squillaci said of the struggle between Morales\u2019s foes and followers. She added that she hoped Bolivia would elect \u201can ally of the principles in which we believe\u201d. That ally seems most likely to come in the form of Luis Fernando Camacho, an ultra-conservative Catholic activist who led the charge against Morales following October\u2019s disputed election and stormed Bolivia\u2019s presidential palace with a Bible under his arm to celebrate his fall. \u201cGod has returned to the palace,\u201d Camacho, who is also from Santa Cruz, wrote on Facebook. \u201cTo those who did not believe in this struggle I say God exists and is now going to govern Bolivia for all Bolivians!\u201d Camacho is part of Bolivia\u2019s Catholic majority, who form about 77% of the population, not one of the 16% who are Protestant. But Aruquipa, a longstanding foe of Bolivia\u2019s LGBT community, hinted he could back Camacho, calling him a fellow \u201cman of faith\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like Jesus said: \u2018If these become silent, the stones will cry out.\u2019 I believe that he has been used as a stone to elevate the church,\u201d Aruquipa said of Camacho. The prospect of a sharp turn to the religious right horrifies many indigenous Bolivians, whose traditions Morales sought to elevate (and, some say, exploit) \u2013 to the fury of hardliners such as Aruquipa. Some see not only a threat to Bolivia\u2019s indigenous customs and practices but also the country\u2019s very status as a secular state, enshrined in Morales\u2019s 2009 constitution. The swearing in of Bolivia\u2019s rightwing interim president, Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez, with a giant Bible further fuelled such fears. \u201cThey don\u2019t respect our traditions. Just because we have ancestral and cultural traditions does not mean we are satanic,\u201d said Arison Montes, a pro-Morales activist from El Alto, a largely indigenous city near La Paz. \u201cThese people are coming here with their Bibles like in the colonial times \u2026 They are coming with their Bibles to lie,\u201d the 27-year-old added. \u201cAnd people are allowing their brains to be washed.\u201d Edmundo Pacheco, a Aymaran spiritual guide who was once close to Morales, accused \u201cevangelical sects\u201d of trying to destroy indigenous teachings and wisdom in Bolivia but vowed they would fail. \u201cThey say we\u2019re satanic, that we\u2019re witches, that we destroy Jesus. Listen, I conduct rituals: rituals to nature, to the earth, to the spirits. I never even mention the name Jesus because it means absolutely nothing to me,\u201d said Pacheco, 60. Within Bolivia\u2019s Christian community there are also fears over the radical rhetoric being peddled by firebrand pastors who conflate Evo Morales with Satan. At a recent demonstration in Santa Cruz, attended by Camacho, a banner reading \u2018Jesus governs Bolivia\u2019 was unfurled while one orator reportedly bragged that, with Morales\u2019s exit, \u201call the demons of witchcraft have been tied up and cast into the abyss\u201d. \u201cSatan: be gone from Bolivia! Now!\u201d the speaker said. Sof\u00eda Vargas, a La Paz-based pastor, said such \u201coffensive\u201d language undermined the evangelical \u201cawakening\u201d sweeping Bolivia and threatened her ability to proselytize. But even more disturbingly it could spark violence. Vargas warned communities had the impression that just as \u201cthe Spanish came and brought the Bible and the crucifix and enslaved us \u2026 now they want to do the same again and have caused the exit of our representative [Morales]\u201d. \u201cThis is the message that is coming across and the church needs to work very hard to show that it is not like this,\u201d Vargas said. A victory for Camacho or Bolivia\u2019s right is not guaranteed in next year\u2019s presidential elections \u2013 scheduled for the start of May \u2013 even though Morales will not be running for the first time in 18 years. Jim Shultz, founder of the Bolivia-focused Democracy Centre, said much would hinge on the strength of the candidate for Morales\u2019s Movement Towards Socialism (Mas) party and the extent to which the right could unite. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely going to have a strong challenge from Camacho. But he might not be the only rightwing candidate,\u201d Shultz said. On Friday \u00c1\u00f1ez, who is evangelical, announced she would also run for president. While their conservative agendas overlap on issues such as abortion, the extent to which Bolivia\u2019s evangelical and Catholic churches might collaborate is unclear given their region-wide struggle for followers. But during a public assembly in El Alto last November, Pastor Aruquipa was bullish. \u201cToday a new republic is being born, with new Christian and biblical values and principles,\u201d he insisted. As a charcoal-coloured sky loomed over a crowd of flag-waving demonstrators, the minister took to a makeshift stage to lead a politically charged prayer. \u201cWhen the righteous pray, God will answer,\u201d he shouted. \u201cGod needs you. God needs us \u2013 to transform Bolivia. Amen!\u201d Additional reporting by Cindy Jim\u00e9nez Becerra in El Alto",

Or even medium ones. In fact, most are tiddlers. Yet when a former Wada president says he believes 10% of elite athletes are doping but only around 1% of tests globally come up positive, it is entirely reasonable to suspect that British stars are slipping through the net.</p> <p>That, I suspect, is why many athletes and anti-doping activists were so furious at reports last week that the Ukad chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/20/jessica-judd-ukad-mo-farah-samples\" title=\"\">was apparently reluctant</a> to hand over Mo Farah\u2019s blood and urine samples to the World Anti-Doping Agency without \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of banned substances.

      "bodyText": "Readers of this column are among the smartest, most brilliant and most knowledgeable sports fans in the country. But here is a question that may fox some of you: name a sports star who has been banned recently in Britain for doping? Go on, have a think. And no, Tyson Fury doesn\u2019t count given his ended in 2017. Does London City Royals\u2019 US-born basketball guard AJ Roberts, who received a two-year punishment for cannabis, ring a bell? Or Henry Hadfield, a League 2 North rugby union player who also got two years for a prohibited stimulant he insists was in a pre-workout drink? No? Me neither. There are no big fish on the list of currently banned athletes on UK Anti-Doping\u2019s website. Or even medium ones. In fact, most are tiddlers. Yet when a former Wada president says he believes 10% of elite athletes are doping but only around 1% of tests globally come up positive, it is entirely reasonable to suspect that British stars are slipping through the net. That, I suspect, is why many athletes and anti-doping activists were so furious at reports last week that the Ukad chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, was apparently reluctant to hand over Mo Farah\u2019s blood and urine samples to the World Anti-Doping Agency without \u201ccredible evidence\u201d of banned substances. Their concern wasn\u2019t just that Ukad is losing the war on doping, but that it wasn\u2019t even fully engaged in the battle. Jessica Judd, who competed for Britain over 5,000m at the recent world athletics championships, was blunter than most. After admitting that she was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by Ukad\u2019s stance, she then warned that athletics \u201cis dying a drug-fuelled death\u201d. Others flagged up the fact that Ukad refused to hand over Farah\u2019s samples when the US Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the Nike Oregon Project in 2015, where the Briton was training at the time.

HDD drilling is particularly susceptible to spills known as inadvertent returns, in which lubricating mud erupts through weak spots in the rock.</p> <p>But as the Tarrs\u2019 tap water became increasingly turbid and the pressure plummeted, the pipeline company Sunoco Logistics, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer LP, insisted the project was not to blame.</p> <p>The Tarr family, like <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/privatewells\">13 million or more American households,</a> rely on a private well for drinking water which they \u2013 not regulators \u2013 are responsible for monitoring and keeping safe. So, in October they installed a sophisticated filter system and drilled a new well in their picturesque wooded backyard, a couple of hundred meters from the worksite.</p> <p>The water seemed fine for a few days.

      "bodyText": "Every evening, Erica and Jon Tarr load up their car with towels, toiletries and dirty dishes, before driving their two-year-old daughter to a relative\u2019s home to bathe, wash up and eat a meal cooked in clean water. The Tarrs, who moved into their spacious detached home in semi-rural Pennsylvania last April, have relied upon bottled water and family generosity since June, when their crystalline tap water first turned murky. Since then, they\u2019ve spent more than $32,000 on new equipment, lab tests, bottled water, repairing pipes and parts damaged by the turbid water. It still isn\u2019t safe, and they don\u2019t know why. \u201cIt\u2019s sad and frustrating, I can\u2019t bathe my daughter, wash my hands or do a load of laundry, it\u2019s like living in constant crisis. We\u2019re not the only ones in this situation, but we feel so alone,\u201d said Erica Tarr, 31, a paediatric nurse. The clay-colored water appeared around the time of a drilling mud spill at a nearby construction site for the Mariner East 2 (ME2) pipeline \u2013 a beleaguered multi-billion dollar project transporting volatile natural gas liquids from the shale fields of eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania to an export facility in Delaware county, ready to ship to Europe to manufacture plastics. The ME2 horizontal directional drilling (HDD) project \u2013 which is subject to multiple criminal and regulatory investigations \u2013 has contaminated surface and groundwater sources in hundreds of mud spills, and created sinkholes in parks, roads and backyards since construction began in early 2017. HDD drilling is particularly susceptible to spills known as inadvertent returns, in which lubricating mud erupts through weak spots in the rock. But as the Tarrs\u2019 tap water became increasingly turbid and the pressure plummeted, the pipeline company Sunoco Logistics, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer LP, insisted the project was not to blame. The Tarr family, like 13 million or more American households, rely on a private well for drinking water which they \u2013 not regulators \u2013 are responsible for monitoring and keeping safe. So, in October they installed a sophisticated filter system and drilled a new well in their picturesque wooded backyard, a couple of hundred meters from the worksite. The water seemed fine for a few days. But then it started smelling strongly of nail polish and burned Erica\u2019s mouth when she brushed her teeth. Lab results detected toluene and MTBE \u2013 volatile organic compounds found in fuel. According to local records, in 1992 an old Sunoco fuel pipeline leaked tens of thousands of gallons of hazardous liquids close to the Tarr\u2019s new well. It\u2019s unclear whether the underground legacy contaminants were disturbed by the current construction work. (A geologist hired by the company found that ME2 construction activities did not affect the Tarr\u2019s well.) Then, in early January, the tap water turned murky once again. John and daughter Evie got sick, and dark grainy sediment coated the cistern. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare \u2026 living without water for so long is a nightmare,\u201d said Tarr. \u201c It\u2019s like we\u2019ve been thrown to the wolves, left to figure it out. We can\u2019t keep living like this.\u201d The Mariner East 2 project stretches 350 miles through 17 mostly densely populated counties. It runs alongside the 1930s Mariner East 1 gasoline pipeline, recently repurposed to transport butane, propane and ethane \u2013 which are odorless and highly flammable. The US fossil fuel industry has surged over the past decade as a result of unconventional techniques that combine horizontal drilling and fracking to extract oil and gas from shale and other underground rock formations. ME pipelines have the capacity to transport enough ethane to manufacture just under a billion single plastic bottles every day, according to Food and Water Watch, a not-for-profit accountability watchdog, which analysed research from the investigative blog Dragon Pipe Diary. The project has been mired in controversies from the start. In early 2018 the state department of environmental protection (DEP) shut down the project for a month and fined Sunoco $12.6m for what it called \u201cegregious\u201d violations of environmental laws during its first year of construction. Shortly after, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) ordered a temporary shut down after sinkholes opened up at a construction site in West Whiteland Township, Chester county. In January 2020, the DEP issued a $2m fine for another series of drilling fluid spills in 2017 which contaminated Raystown Lake in Huntingdon county. Some were not reported for over 500 days. Sam Rubin, from Food and Water Watch, said: \u201cThere have been questions about the quality of the permits since they were granted in 2014 \u2026 there is a pattern of malfeasance that is established and known which was overlooked when permits were granted by the DEP and Wolf administration.\u201d A spokesman for Democratic governor Tom Wolf said he believes in strong environmental protection and responsibility for permit holders. \u201cThe significant fines, penalties, oversight and accountability by the DEP under his administration are evidence of exactly that.\u201d Still, the project is also subject to criminal and civil investigations, which include: A FBI corruption investigation into Wolf\u2019s administration handling of the permit process. State and county investigations into alleged corruption, criminal misconduct and environmental crimes. At the end of 2019, security personnel working with Energy Transfer were charged with bribery and criminal conspiracy for allegedly recruiting, hiring, and hiding payments to state police officers. The company says the charges have no merit. A homeowner is suing Sunoco, claiming its drilling punctured the aquifer supplying his water well and led to E coli contamination that made him ill Residents who live close to the pipeline \u2013 known as the Safety Seven \u2013 have an ongoing case with the regulator, the PUC, to shut down the project on the grounds it poses unacceptable safety risks, and the company has failed to develop a credible evacuation plan. \u201cOnly in Pennsylvania can an operator create a documentable track record over decades of serial destruction and contamination and continue to be permitted by state agencies and aided by legislators in further rolling back environmental protections,\u201d said state congresswoman Danielle Friel from Chester county, who was elected in 2018 on an anti-pipeline ticket. Chester county commissioners have slammed the company for \u201cappalling\u201d lack of pipeline information, accusing the company of withholding safety information, putting profit over safety, and creating mistrust among residents \u2013 allegations Energy Transfer denies. Friel added: \u201cPennsylvania has a corruption problem. Through a massive lobbying, campaign finance and public relations effort, the fossil fuel industry has successfully manipulated our legislature, our local governments and regulatory agencies.\u201d Lisa Coleman from Energy Transfer said: \u201cWe are committed to adhering to the rules and regulations specified in the approved permits as we complete the construction and restoration phases of our projects ... We believe our project was properly permitted by all agencies.\u201d Despite mounting public opposition and fears about the company\u2019s safety record, emergency plans and alleged criminal wrongdoing, Wolf refuses to halt the project. Local communities dealing with contaminated water and environmental hazards have been left feeling desperate. Rosemary Fuller \u2013 one of the Safety Seven \u2013 lives a couple of miles from the Tarrs in a large gated property where the family moved in 2003, smitten by the \u201cidyllic, peaceful\u201d location. They signed a permanent easement \u2013 or right of way \u2013 over to the company in 2015 after being assured the project was safe and unobtrusive, according to Fuller, 60.

Almost five years later, noisy construction sites are dotted throughout the community, there are six sinkholes within a mile or so of Fuller\u2019s house, and in November a valve site situated within this densely populated residential township leaked gasoline. Residents called emergency services after smelling the strange odour. Dangerous bacteria including E coli were detected in the Fuller\u2019s well water last July. Since then the family has relied on bottled water delivered by Sunoco. Last week, a film of petrol blue coloured grease was visible in the cistern and sink where Fuller brushes her teeth. The project has had a huge impact on the whole family.

Significantly, in the poem it\u2019s the tree rather than the wall which favours a militaristic vocabulary (\u201cempire\u201d, \u201cconqueror\u201d, \u201cterritory\u201d etc).</p> <p>The wall is visualised in the poem\u2019s structure, having a line to itself for each of its replies. The device emphasises its isolation and immobility (\u201cI stand alone, replied the wall.\u201d) But the tree is not less assertive than the wall and the poem works subtly against potential stereotypes as it progresses. Described by the wall as \u201cthe invader\u201d, the tree retorts: \u201cI am the conqueror,\u201d and goes on to boast about the spreading roots and \u201cplatoons of seeds\u201d that are its means of conquest.</p> <p>\u201cSomething there is that doesn\u2019t love a wall,\u201d as Robert Frost\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44266/mending-wall\">Mending Wall</a> persuasively begins. Enlisting with the anti-wall brigade, I found myself tempted to change sides as the tree became more rhetorically florid: \u201cI am a survivor, said the tree to the wall; / I host the resurrection of each turning season.\u201d The tree seems to imagine itself as God or having godlike abilities. It\u2019s interesting, though, that in the same couplet it has referred to itself as \u201ca survivor\u201d. The word delivers a moment of parity between the two opponents. \u201cI remain\u201d and \u201cI endure\u201d are the proud assertions of the wall. Both speakers are proclaiming the power of endurance.</p> <p>A change of voice and tactics occurs with the tree\u2019s accusation, \u201cYou\u2019re the one they blame.\u201d This is effective in several ways. It suggests the tree is not entirely sure of its facts about the history of the wall and the reason for its presence, but perpetuating a received idea. And it gives a larger identity to the wall, suggesting that walls habitually, and possibly unfairly, get a bad press for malign separations. The tree continues its verbal attack, in a tone of mixed impatience and revolutionary fervour, castigating the wall as an \u201cinsensate barrier, stone-deaf to the rough bark of liberty\u201d.</p> <p>Now the tree\u2019s credibility has been called into question, and it seems the wall is allowed the last inscrutable word: \u201cYou cannot know.\u201d Youthful ambition is often defeated by similar assumptions. But this one has the ring of truth in the poem\u2019s narrative.</p> <p>Sycamore Gap engages with gaps in perception. It\u2019s a vividly chilling illustration of bad political negotiation. Neither character has asked the other a question, or acknowledged any common ground. As to the larger context, readers are given plenty of room to imagine what the sycamore and the wall might represent metaphorically. Perhaps the tree represents a new spirit of national self-determination. Perhaps the wall, once a heavily fortified border, now stands for strong, local community (\u201cI belong here\u201d) feeling vulnerable to a vigorous immigrant culture creating its own strong roots.</p> <p>The dialogue between the two figures was potentially a conversation. Instead, it has remained a combat or<em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agon\">agon</a>.</em> The absence of an easy resolution adds to the strength of the poem, though.</p> <p><br>  </p>",

Both speakers are proclaiming the power of endurance. A change of voice and tactics occurs with the tree\u2019s accusation, \u201cYou\u2019re the one they blame.\u201d This is effective in several ways. It suggests the tree is not entirely sure of its facts about the history of the wall and the reason for its presence, but perpetuating a received idea. And it gives a larger identity to the wall, suggesting that walls habitually, and possibly unfairly, get a bad press for malign separations. The tree continues its verbal attack, in a tone of mixed impatience and revolutionary fervour, castigating the wall as an \u201cinsensate barrier, stone-deaf to the rough bark of liberty\u201d. Now the tree\u2019s credibility has been called into question, and it seems the wall is allowed the last inscrutable word: \u201cYou cannot know.\u201d Youthful ambition is often defeated by similar assumptions. But this one has the ring of truth in the poem\u2019s narrative. Sycamore Gap engages with gaps in perception. It\u2019s a vividly chilling illustration of bad political negotiation. Neither character has asked the other a question, or acknowledged any common ground. As to the larger context, readers are given plenty of room to imagine what the sycamore and the wall might represent metaphorically. Perhaps the tree represents a new spirit of national self-determination. Perhaps the wall, once a heavily fortified border, now stands for strong, local community (\u201cI belong here\u201d) feeling vulnerable to a vigorous immigrant culture creating its own strong roots. The dialogue between the two figures was potentially a conversation. Instead, it has remained a combat or agon. The absence of an easy resolution adds to the strength of the poem, though.",

      "bodyText": "The US National Security Agency is facing questions about the security of top Trump administration officials\u2019 communications following last week\u2019s allegations that the Saudi crown prince may have had a hand in the alleged hack of Jeff Bezos. Ron Wyden, a senior Democratic lawmaker, asked the director of the NSA whether he was confident that the Saudi government had not also sought to hack senior US government officials, including the White House adviser Jared Kushner, who has reportedly had a WhatsApp relationship with the Saudi heir. Wyden pointed to the resignation in October 2019 of Dimitrios Vastakis, who headed network defence at the White House before his departure, and reportedly said that the White House was acting in a way likely to lead to its being electronically compromised. \u201cIt is no secret that foreign intelligence services target senior US government officials and seek to compromise their professional accounts and devices as well as their personal ones,\u201d Wyden said. The senator from Oregon is separately seeking to force the Trump administration to officially release the intelligence it collected on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist who was killed in a state-sponsored murder in October 2018. Wyden told reporters he believed Republicans were fed up with the Saudis on Capitol Hill, and that some could support a legislative move to force the Trump administration to release a non-classified report into Khashoggi\u2019s murder, despite resistance from the White House. Wyden\u2019s letter to the NSA director, Paul Nakasone, comes just days after the Guardian first reported allegations that Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and Amazon founder, was believed to have been the victim of a hack that was instigated after he allegedly received a WhatsApp message from the account of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The issue is now the subject of an investigation by two independent UN investigators. The Bezos allegations have been met with shock, though some information security experts have raised concerns and questions about the initial report into the alleged hack, which was conducted by former FBI experts at FTI Consulting. The White House has said it was aware of the issue and took it seriously, but has not offered any substantive answers to questions about whether Donald Trump, the US president, or Kushner, his son-in-law, were compromised. Media reports, including by CNN and the New York Times, have said that Kushner used WhatsApp, the popular messaging service, to message directly with Prince Mohammed.

It\u2019s about getting the experts in. Deaf people are really good at shouting and changing things because we have to be. We can\u2019t be passive.</p> <p>I\u2019m a writer and actor, and since 2013 I\u2019ve self-described as a deaf cyborg. After I got my cochlear implant, I felt proud and decided to own my new identity.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t train at drama college but started performing in nightclubs, pubs and galleries. I was going deaf when I made my early theatre work and I used interpreters in rehearsals, but I could not follow BSL-interpreted theatre. I preferred subtitles. I was conscious that I couldn\u2019t enjoy the same cutting-edge productions that my peers could because of the lack of subtitled performances.</p> <p>At this time \u2013 around 15 years ago \u2013 there weren\u2019t many shows that integrated subtitles into the stage design. I didn\u2019t want anyone to feel the same sense of exclusion so I modelled best practice and made sure my work was creatively captioned.</p> <p>Even with my implant, I often need captions to properly engage with the performance. In big old theatre buildings such as the Old Vic, I can\u2019t follow without captions; in mid-size theatres such as the New Wolsey in Ipswich, I can follow everything. It all depends on the acoustic.</p> <p>In Augmented, my latest show, we have a really amazing lighting and projection designer, Joshua Pharo. He has the unique skillset of being able to do both lighting and video projection - that ensured our captioning was part of the show\u2019s overall design. It\u2019s exciting that more theatre-makers are playing with access as a theatrical form, like Midnight Movie did at the Royal Court. The Court now offers more than one captioned show per run, too. It just shows that we can change things. Access can be liberating and uplifting for everyone.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/augmented\">Augmented is at the Royal Exchange, Manchester</a>, 5-7 March. <a href=\"https://weareunlimited.org.uk/commission/sophie-woolley-augmented/\">Then touring</a>.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cd8a725e2c235ed6ea324d6f658c1b16dd1c590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cd8a725e2c235ed6ea324d6f658c1b16dd1c590/209_326_2791_1674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amit Sharma, Deputy Artistic Director.

There is a social and civic responsibility here. As a director \u2013 and deputy artistic director of Birmingham Repertory theatre \u2013 I am passionate about representation, particularly those voices who have been marginalised historically.</p> <p>Things are changing \u2013 slowly. There is deaf and disabled representation on primetime TV, whether for one-off series or recurring characters. Is it enough? Absolutely not, but 10 years ago you didn\u2019t see such breadth of characters. It\u2019s the same on our stages. But we need to do more than just talk about how well we are doing. Recently, the Stage released a report on leadership of the top 50 theatres \u2013 with people of colour at 8%, which is shocking. How many of the top 50 are being led by a deaf and disabled person? Or the top 100? Or top 150? There\u2019s a phrase that disabled people often use, which is: \u201cNothing about us without us\u201d and it is paramount we now put this into practice, starting with leadership.</p> <p>The Rep is part of a consortium of six venues (including Nottingham Playhouse, Stratford East, Sheffield Theatres, New Wolsey in Ipswich and Leeds Playhouse) which, with the <a href=\"https://graeae.org/\">company Graeae</a>, have collaborated on the <a href=\"https://www.rampsonthemoon.co.uk/\">Ramps on the Moon</a> programme. This is a commitment to having one mainstage show each year which is predominantly cast with deaf and disabled performers, as part of their season. That kind of commitment makes a real impact \u2013 off and on stage. If you were to remove a Ramps production, you would see the gap in work being presented at that scale. When Ramps finishes, what then? It needs to be a catalyst for all our theatres to make a genuine commitment to deaf and disabled artists, and audiences, in our big spaces.</p> <p>The next generation of deaf and disabled artists need to feel like there are opportunities for them to act, write, direct, design and produce just like their non-disabled counterparts. There\u2019s much work to do. We can\u2019t let them down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"38d61a5bc82af1c98b18d9a2c1fb3f50b1446095\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d61a5bc82af1c98b18d9a2c1fb3f50b1446095/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Jenny Sealey.\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Embed captioning, signing and audio description into the heart and design of all productions\u2019 \u2026 Graeae artistic director Jenny Sealey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alison Baskerville</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jenny Sealey: \u2018Everyone can make shows accessible\u2019</strong></p> <p>As the artistic director of Graeae I surround myself with tales from deaf and disabled artists who bring with them diverse communication and access requirements. Together, we weave this into a theatrical narrative so it becomes an aesthetic artform.</p> <p>Graeae, along with other deaf and disabled-led companies, have been pushing the agenda for years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/oct/29/reasons-to-be-cheerful-review\">Since Reasons to be Cheerful</a> (our Ian Dury-inspired musical by Paul Sirett) hit middle-scale stages, other directors have seen the richness of our aesthetic and the skill and talent within our community. This led to the Ramps on the Moon consortium. Things are moving on. Derby theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Globe and the National Theatre and are also casting more disabled actors and starting to work with disabled writers and directors.</p> <p>It comes down to attitude and a concern that employing deaf and disabled actors, writers and directors is going to cost more. It does cost more, but that is when <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work\">Access to Work</a> comes in. This government scheme supports the cost of audio describers, access workers, creative enablers (a term coined by Graeae where the conversation between enabler and artist is a creative collaborative process) and sign-language interpreters \u2013 although there is a cap on how much is paid out, which is very limiting. I work with interpreters almost constantly, so I have to have a \u201cdry period\u201d when my allowance has run out.</p> <p>To improve accessibility and representation throughout our industry, the answer is very simple \u2013 employ deaf and disabled people across the organisation (front of house, bar, marketing, senior management, board, etc) as well as on stage and backstage. Work with all creative teams to embed captioning, signing and audio description into the heart and design of all productions so that deaf and disabled audience members can enjoy any show they like rather than just on the \u201caccess night\u201d. Graeae has been making every show accessible for more than 20 years and we are a small company. If we can do it, everyone can. Access is a human right \u2013 not a tag-on.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ramps on the Moon\u2019s Oliver Twist is at <a href=\"https://leedsplayhouse.org.uk/events/oliver-twist/\">Leeds Playhouse</a> from 28 February to 21 March. <a href=\"https://www.rampsonthemoon.co.uk/show/oliver-twist/\">Then touring until 6 June.</a></p></li> </ul>",

Progress and equality always mean confronting the status quo and that will always create conflict. I don\u2019t like it, but I have to let go of the egotistical desire to be liked by everyone in order to not be complicit in the world\u2019s injustice. Scrounger is at the Finborough, London, until 1 February Sophie Woolley: \u2018Get the experts in\u2019 Venues need to employ deaf and disabled people \u2013 that is the best way to improve access. It\u2019s about getting the experts in. Deaf people are really good at shouting and changing things because we have to be. We can\u2019t be passive. I\u2019m a writer and actor, and since 2013 I\u2019ve self-described as a deaf cyborg. After I got my cochlear implant, I felt proud and decided to own my new identity. I didn\u2019t train at drama college but started performing in nightclubs, pubs and galleries. I was going deaf when I made my early theatre work and I used interpreters in rehearsals, but I could not follow BSL-interpreted theatre. I preferred subtitles. I was conscious that I couldn\u2019t enjoy the same cutting-edge productions that my peers could because of the lack of subtitled performances. At this time \u2013 around 15 years ago \u2013 there weren\u2019t many shows that integrated subtitles into the stage design. I didn\u2019t want anyone to feel the same sense of exclusion so I modelled best practice and made sure my work was creatively captioned. Even with my implant, I often need captions to properly engage with the performance. In big old theatre buildings such as the Old Vic, I can\u2019t follow without captions; in mid-size theatres such as the New Wolsey in Ipswich, I can follow everything. It all depends on the acoustic. In Augmented, my latest show, we have a really amazing lighting and projection designer, Joshua Pharo. He has the unique skillset of being able to do both lighting and video projection - that ensured our captioning was part of the show\u2019s overall design. It\u2019s exciting that more theatre-makers are playing with access as a theatrical form, like Midnight Movie did at the Royal Court. The Court now offers more than one captioned show per run, too. It just shows that we can change things. Access can be liberating and uplifting for everyone. Augmented is at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, 5-7 March. Then touring. Amit Sharma: \u2018Theatre changes perceptions\u2019 Theatre is powerful and has a way of changing people\u2019s perceptions. There is a social and civic responsibility here. As a director \u2013 and deputy artistic director of Birmingham Repertory theatre \u2013 I am passionate about representation, particularly those voices who have been marginalised historically. Things are changing \u2013 slowly. There is deaf and disabled representation on primetime TV, whether for one-off series or recurring characters. Is it enough? Absolutely not, but 10 years ago you didn\u2019t see such breadth of characters. It\u2019s the same on our stages. But we need to do more than just talk about how well we are doing. Recently, the Stage released a report on leadership of the top 50 theatres \u2013 with people of colour at 8%, which is shocking. How many of the top 50 are being led by a deaf and disabled person? Or the top 100? Or top 150? There\u2019s a phrase that disabled people often use, which is: \u201cNothing about us without us\u201d and it is paramount we now put this into practice, starting with leadership. The Rep is part of a consortium of six venues (including Nottingham Playhouse, Stratford East, Sheffield Theatres, New Wolsey in Ipswich and Leeds Playhouse) which, with the company Graeae, have collaborated on the Ramps on the Moon programme. This is a commitment to having one mainstage show each year which is predominantly cast with deaf and disabled performers, as part of their season. That kind of commitment makes a real impact \u2013 off and on stage. If you were to remove a Ramps production, you would see the gap in work being presented at that scale. When Ramps finishes, what then? It needs to be a catalyst for all our theatres to make a genuine commitment to deaf and disabled artists, and audiences, in our big spaces. The next generation of deaf and disabled artists need to feel like there are opportunities for them to act, write, direct, design and produce just like their non-disabled counterparts. There\u2019s much work to do. We can\u2019t let them down. Jenny Sealey: \u2018Everyone can make shows accessible\u2019 As the artistic director of Graeae I surround myself with tales from deaf and disabled artists who bring with them diverse communication and access requirements. Together, we weave this into a theatrical narrative so it becomes an aesthetic artform. Graeae, along with other deaf and disabled-led companies, have been pushing the agenda for years. Since Reasons to be Cheerful (our Ian Dury-inspired musical by Paul Sirett) hit middle-scale stages, other directors have seen the richness of our aesthetic and the skill and talent within our community. This led to the Ramps on the Moon consortium. Things are moving on. Derby theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Globe and the National Theatre and are also casting more disabled actors and starting to work with disabled writers and directors. It comes down to attitude and a concern that employing deaf and disabled actors, writers and directors is going to cost more. It does cost more, but that is when Access to Work comes in. This government scheme supports the cost of audio describers, access workers, creative enablers (a term coined by Graeae where the conversation between enabler and artist is a creative collaborative process) and sign-language interpreters \u2013 although there is a cap on how much is paid out, which is very limiting. I work with interpreters almost constantly, so I have to have a \u201cdry period\u201d when my allowance has run out. To improve accessibility and representation throughout our industry, the answer is very simple \u2013 employ deaf and disabled people across the organisation (front of house, bar, marketing, senior management, board, etc) as well as on stage and backstage. Work with all creative teams to embed captioning, signing and audio description into the heart and design of all productions so that deaf and disabled audience members can enjoy any show they like rather than just on the \u201caccess night\u201d. Graeae has been making every show accessible for more than 20 years and we are a small company. If we can do it, everyone can. Access is a human right \u2013 not a tag-on. Ramps on the Moon\u2019s Oliver Twist is at Leeds Playhouse from 28 February to 21 March. Then touring until 6 June.",

      "bodyText": "A Portuguese man behind one of the biggest expos\u00e9s in the history of football has been identified as the source of a leaked cache of financial records about the business empire of Africa\u2019s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos. Lawyers for Rui Pinto, who is awaiting trial in Portugal on charges including alleged hacking and attempted extortion, said in 2018 he passed a non-profit whistleblowing organisation a hard drive containing data relating to Dos Santos\u2019s business empire, which is estimated at $2.2bn. Pinto is the founder of Football Leaks, which revealed confidential information about some of the world\u2019s leading teams, which resulted in inquiries by tax authorities into several top players. He was not previously known to be the source of the Luanda Leaks, a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Dos Santos, whose father ruled Angola for 38 years before stepping down as president in September 2017. The Guardian, the BBC and the New York Times were among 37 media outlets that earlier this month reported on the contents of the leaked documents, revealing the complex financial schemes that helped Dos Santos amass vast a fortune at the expense of the Angolan state. Dos Santos denies she became a billionaire through nepotism or corruption. The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). On Monday, PPLAAF identified the founder of Football Leaks as its source, saying in a statement: \u201cThe source of the Luanda Leaks is the whistleblower Rui Pinto.\u201d \u201cPPLAAF is pleased that once again a whistleblower is revealing to the world actions that go against international public interest,\u201d said William Bourdon, the president of PPLAAF and also a lawyer for Pinto.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government does not know how many of its citizens are caught in the vast quarantine lock-down imposed across China, as it and governments around the world scramble to try to evacuate their nationals. But it appears increasingly unlikely foreign countries will be allowed to simply extricate their citizens in the face of militarily enforced lockdowns. Indonesia has said it \u201cseems to be impossible\u201d, while Australia has said it \u201cneeds to abide by the travel restrictions \u2026 placed there for precisely the purpose of containing the coronavirus\u201d. A hotline for family members of Australian citizens has received 385 calls, but the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has said it was \u201cunwise to speculate\u201d on how many citizens this represented or how quickly they could be brought out. Payne would not confirm reports there were 100 children among the Australians trapped inside Hubei province, aged from six months to 16. Australia does not have a consulate in the city at the centre of the outbreak, Wuhan. There are only a handful of trade officials, and diplomats from outside have not been allowed in to coordinate evacuation efforts. Domestically, school children in NSW who have been in contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus \u2013 anywhere in the world \u2013 have been told not to attend school for two weeks. Globally, the outbreak of coronavirus 2019-nCoV has now claimed 80 lives, all of those in China, and the vast majority in Hubei province, the epicentre of the pandemic. There are a further 2,700 people infected across China, with 461 of those in critical condition. China\u2019s National Health Commission minister Ma Xiaowei said the virus was strengthening and the number of cases was expected to continue to rise. \u201cAccording to recent clinical information, the virus\u2019s ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger.\u201d Cases have also been reported in Germany, France, Finland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, Nepal, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore, Australia, the US and Canada. In Australia, five confirmed cases have been reported, but tests are ongoing on several more symptomatic people who have recently visited China or been in contact with a confirmed case. The first four cases in Australia were all men aged between 35 and 59. The fifth case is a 22-year-old student at the University of New South Wales who arrived from Wuhan on 22 January on China Eastern Airlines flight MU749. NSW Health has said she was asymptomatic on the flight. \u201cThe student did not attend any classes at the university and stayed on her own in campus accommodation with no close contact before she was admitted to hospital.\u201d About 36 million people are covered by travel restrictions in China, centred around Wuhan city in Hubei province. The Australian government is investigating if it is possible to evacuate Australian citizens from within the quarantine zones. Payne said it was difficult to give definitive answers on the coronavirus situation, saying the outbreak was a \u201cvery serious public health emergency\u201d and a \u201cfast-moving situation\u201d. \u201cWe are looking very closely at what is possible, including consular assistance for people in those areas, and what options there are for helping them with transport out of Wuhan and Hubei province. We\u2019re exploring all opportunities to ensure when it is possible, we can assist their departure.\u201d The US has already announced it plans to fly its diplomats and other citizens at particular risk of the virus out of Wuhan and directly to the US on Tuesday, while France has indicated it wants to extricate its citizens to another part of China for quarantine. Japan and Indonesia have also said they want to get their citizens out. But it may not be possible for other countries to simply remove their citizens. \u201cThe travel restrictions placed on the region by Chinese authorities are placed there for precisely the purpose of containing the coronavirus,\u201d Payne said. \u201cWe\u2019re very conscious of that and we need to abide by the travel restrictions.\u201d Indonesia\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Teuku Faizayah said evacuating foreign nationals now \u201cseems to be impossible\u201d. \u201cWuhan is still isolated, meaning we can\u2019t get in and out of the city,\u201d Faizasyah told Kompas. Payne said she was \u201cunwise to speculate\u201d on how many Australians may be stuck inside the locked down zones inside China, or how long it might take to get them out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a definitive number on the number of Australians in Wuhan or in Hubei province because it will include a significant number of dual nationals, some of whom may not have travelled on Australian passports, they\u2019ve travelled on Chinese passports for example.\u201d In NSW, health authorities have instructed any children in the state who\u2019d had direct contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus to stay home from school or daycare for 14 days from the last contact with the infected person. \u201c14 days represents the internationally recognised incubation period for the disease,\u201d NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said. \u201cAfter this time the child is considered to be not be at risk of infection.\u201d Students who have travelled to Wuhan and Hubei during the school holidays can return to school but should be carefully monitored for symptoms of coronavirus infection. \u201cThe most common symptom is a fever,\u201d Chant said. \u201cOther symptoms include, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath.\u201d Any person who exhibits these symptoms should be isolated immediately from other people and should seek medical attention as soon as possible, Chant said. The Australian government\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said there was \u201cno evidence there\u2019s a risk to the Australian public\u201d of a significant outbreak of coronavirus in this country. \u201cThere\u2019s no human-to-human transmission that\u2019s been identified in this country.\u201d Murphy said that despite large numbers of travellers arriving from China daily in Australia, there was no need for large-scale quarantining of all arrivals. China\u2019s National Health Commission has said carriers of the coronavirus can be contagious during the incubation period, while being asymptomatic. But Murphy said that had not been conclusively established. \u201cIt would be very unusual because this virus is similar to the Sars and Mers viruses and they were not infectious before symptoms. The evidence \u2026 that we have seen, doesn\u2019t suggest there\u2019s clear proof of that. \u201cWe\u2019re seeking urgent advice from the World Health Organisation and international experts. If that were to be the case, it would have implications for contact tracing.\u201d The government helpline for medical advice is 1800 022 222. The government hotline for people inside Hubei province or their relatives to call is 1300555135, or +61 2 6261 3305 from outside Australia.",

US pressure on Johnson has ramped up, with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who is due to visit the UK later this week, tweeting his support for a leading backbench Conservative MP who has urged the government to reject Huawei. \u201cThe UK has a momentous decision ahead on 5G,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cBritish MP Tom Tugendhat gets it right: \u2018The truth is that only nations able to protect their data will be sovereign\u2019.\u201d Tugendhat, who is seeking to reprise his role as the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has warned that using a Chinese firm could cause security or back-door surveillance issues given Beijing\u2019s approach to the rule of law and civil rights. \u201cIt\u2019s no good taking back control from Brussels only to hand it over to Beijing,\u201d Tugendhat told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not what the government would want to do. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the Americans \u2013 it\u2019s simply about us.

On Monday, the Financial Times reported that the government was looking at a market cap as a possible compromise to placate the Americans. Pompeo is due to meet Johnson and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in London on Wednesday. His tweeted warning follows a phone call between Johnson and Donald Trump on Friday, in which the leaders reportedly discussed the security of telecommunications networks. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s The Westminster Hour on Sunday evening, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said the decision would be based on \u201cour own sovereign right to choose\u201d.

Luxuriate in these: Rory O\u2019Connell\u2019s roasties, Jeremy Lee\u2019s proper chips and Simon Hopkinson\u2019s sublime saffron mash. Brilliant winter warmers for January days. A little further afield we present Meera Sodha\u2019s saag aloo, Giorgio Locatelli\u2019s gnocchi and Fuchsia Dunlop\u2019s potato slivers with chilli and Sichuan pepper.

Tortilla with chorizo by Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho A tortilla welcomes anything, so be adventurous with what you add: peppers, asparagus, leftover roast vegetables. Mallmann\u2019s squashed potatoes by Olia Hercules A simple dish with familiar ingredients, the potatoes come out with a crispy bottom and a soft top. Confit potatoes by the Quality Chop House This legendary dish is something of a labour of love \u2013 but it\u2019s worth it. Peter Gordon\u2019s minted baby potatoes, peas and creme fraiche Delicious warm, even better at room temperature. If you can find jersey royals, they are ideal. Blanche Vaughan\u2019s Lancashire hotpot An easy yet fulfilling dish to make, using just one pot. Roast potatoes by Rory O\u2019Connell Cooked to achieve a golden brown crisp skin with a fluffy, floury interior. Bliss. Simon Hopkinson\u2019s saffron mash If you are going to serve these potatoes with fish, then it is nice to cook them in fish stock. Fisherman\u2019s pie by Annie Bell Aside from its obvious gustatory charm, the real joy of a fish pie is that you can prepare it well in advance. Claudia Roden\u2019s potato latkes One of the most famous of Jewish foods, and can be marvellous if properly prepared, just before eating. Black pudding and pink fir hash with duck eggs by Jess Murphy Spuds and black pudding is the perfect Irish pairing, and out-trends avocado on toast any day. Meera Sodha\u2019s rainbow chard saag aloo This dish uses a classic Gujarati spicing of cumin, coriander, turmeric and chilli.

Baked russet potato with black truffle butter by Sam Astley-Dean and Phil Howard Push a piece of the truffle butter on top of the potato, finish with parmesan and pop under the grill to melt.

Now lawyers, housing associations and police are building networks of support to try and provide innovative solutions to the crisis.</p> <p>One firm of solicitors told the Guardian they are increasingly contacted by housing associations for help in responding to exploitation, in particular \u201ccuckooing\u201d.</p> <p>Cuckooing is a term for the takeover of a house owned by a vulnerable individual by drug gangs from outside the area to use as a base.</p> <p>Darren Burton, head of housing at Forbes Solicitors, says housing associations have unique access to vulnerable communities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/05/county-lines-drug-gangs-blackmailing-tracking-children-social-media\">'County lines' drug gangs tracking children via social media</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur clients provide social housing to the most vulnerable in society, making their tenants a target for criminals. There will often be dozens of people visiting the target address, causing antisocial behaviour, dealing and using drugs.</p> <p>\u201cHousing associations are eyes and ears on the ground. More and more housing officers are reporting the signs of county lines and cuckooing to us. We are getting more calls than ever from housing associations asking for help with this issue.\u201d</p> <p>Burton points to high-rise blocks where vulnerable people, who may have learning disabilities or mental health problems, can become isolated. \u201cThey are befriended and next thing they know the flat is taken over and someone from the gang is sleeping in the box room. A housing association can join up the dots; they have always been there on the ground.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80d07e206e8312893ed59ce4f7053f35eb4788c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80d07e206e8312893ed59ce4f7053f35eb4788c7/0_208_5541_3325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cities with good transport links, such as York, have a serious and growing problem with county lines crime.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cities with good transport links, such as York, have a serious and growing problem with county lines crime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ultimate legal sanction to stop cuckooing in a property is a premises closure, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/rise-in-house-closures-for-drug-dealing-fuels-fears-of-cuckooing\">these are on the rise</a> across the UK. With the National Housing Federation, Forbes is lobbying for housing providers to have more statutory powers to close properties where there is evidence they are used for exploitation.</p> <p>But while Burton and his colleagues do work with the police, they also try to use street-level knowledge of families to help in other ways.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, one property we are looking at, it\u2019s a hive of activity and the police know about it. So that might result in a premises closure. But we always start at the point that legal action is the last resort, particularly where there is a young person or family involved.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a case where a young person is living with his grandfather because his parents can\u2019t look after him due to drug problems of their own. He gets involved in postcode gangs and bringing knives and drugs into the property. His grandfather is worried but the local housing association know this family because they have been in the area a long time so are able to offer help.\u201d</p> <p>The firm has joined with Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Organised Crime Unit to build a network across the region looking for solutions.</p> <p>In one case where a man was dealing drugs from a property, the firm worked with police and a housing association to get a partial closure, which allowed the man\u2019s partner and children to keep using the home but barred other visitors.</p> <p>Detective Inspector Andy Farrell of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit told the Guardian that these partnerships are increasingly vital in fighting child exploitation.</p> <p>\u201cAcross the region, areas with good transport links are vulnerable to cuckooing, like Harrogate, York and then over to the coastal areas of Scarborough, high areas of social deprivation. It\u2019s really important now that we upskill housing associations and enhance their understanding of county lines. For example, we work with them on partial home closures so we don\u2019t leave potential victims homeless.\u201d</p> <p>He believes the deeper understanding now of how exploitation works is helping to tackle the crime in the longer term. \u201cNow we are actually understanding that children who may have been criminalised previously are actually being exploited. Let\u2019s look at early intervention, look at siblings of those who are being exploited and how we can divert them; we will hopefully see that impact in the future.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Fahy was Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police until 2015 and is now chair of a housing association, <a href=\"https://www.plusdane.co.uk/\">Plus Dane Housing</a>. He says housing associations have unusual access at a community level, in areas where cuts have removed many welfare checks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77d51986bf27b10b9117aea1db14de612a706003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77d51986bf27b10b9117aea1db14de612a706003/0_153_4923_2955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Other issues spotted by housing officers include pop-up brothels, where criminals take over a house through short term lets or Airbnb.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Other issues spotted by housing officers include pop-up brothels, where criminals take over a house through short term lets or Airbnb.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had always been struck as a police officer that the closest relationship was with the local housing association and their housing officers. We know that in our housing stock there are people who are incredibly vulnerable, the HAs will know who those vulnerable people are.</p> <p>\u201cFor example, housing associations go into every property at least once a year to do a gas safety check and it\u2019s incredible what they see. You have repair staff seeing child protection issues, or noting when elderly people are incredibly vulnerable. It\u2019s about helping these staff understand the signs and know what to do about it.\u201d</p> <p>It is not just cuckooing and drug dealing that housing associations are seeing up close, Fahy says.</p> <p>\u201cCuckooing is extremely worrying, but beyond that are other things like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/04/criminals-renting-holiday-lets-pop-up-brothels-police-newquay\">pop-up brothels</a>. This is an extremely crucial housing issue. Criminals take over a house for a brothel through short term lets or Airbnb. These are operated from properties with very exploited people. It\u2019s extremely hard to get them to speak, they have a fear of the exploiter reaching right back into their own home country or their family.\u201d</p> <p>Fahy acknowledges the problem is a huge and complex one. \u201cFrontline staff are very fearful of the criminal groups involved. There has always been drug dealing, [but] what is different now is children are being used and exploited and the market is chaotic and crowded.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a very high level of drug taking in our society. If you talk to youth charities they will say there is nothing we can do \u2013 kids are offered \u00a31,000 a day to carry drugs and it\u2019s hard to help them once they have got involved. There is little else for them to do in their communities.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Housing associations are playing a growing role in tackling county lines crimes, using their knowledge of local communities to spot early signs of abuse and exploitation. In the north west of England, the exploitation of young people by drug gangs \u2013 known as \u201ccounty lines\u201d crime \u2013 is a serious problem, not just in poorer areas but in York, Harrogate and places with good transport links. Now lawyers, housing associations and police are building networks of support to try and provide innovative solutions to the crisis. One firm of solicitors told the Guardian they are increasingly contacted by housing associations for help in responding to exploitation, in particular \u201ccuckooing\u201d. Cuckooing is a term for the takeover of a house owned by a vulnerable individual by drug gangs from outside the area to use as a base. Darren Burton, head of housing at Forbes Solicitors, says housing associations have unique access to vulnerable communities. \u201cOur clients provide social housing to the most vulnerable in society, making their tenants a target for criminals. There will often be dozens of people visiting the target address, causing antisocial behaviour, dealing and using drugs. \u201cHousing associations are eyes and ears on the ground. More and more housing officers are reporting the signs of county lines and cuckooing to us. We are getting more calls than ever from housing associations asking for help with this issue.\u201d Burton points to high-rise blocks where vulnerable people, who may have learning disabilities or mental health problems, can become isolated. \u201cThey are befriended and next thing they know the flat is taken over and someone from the gang is sleeping in the box room. A housing association can join up the dots; they have always been there on the ground.\u201d The ultimate legal sanction to stop cuckooing in a property is a premises closure, and these are on the rise across the UK. With the National Housing Federation, Forbes is lobbying for housing providers to have more statutory powers to close properties where there is evidence they are used for exploitation. But while Burton and his colleagues do work with the police, they also try to use street-level knowledge of families to help in other ways. \u201cFor example, one property we are looking at, it\u2019s a hive of activity and the police know about it. So that might result in a premises closure. But we always start at the point that legal action is the last resort, particularly where there is a young person or family involved. \u201cWe have a case where a young person is living with his grandfather because his parents can\u2019t look after him due to drug problems of their own. He gets involved in postcode gangs and bringing knives and drugs into the property. His grandfather is worried but the local housing association know this family because they have been in the area a long time so are able to offer help.\u201d The firm has joined with Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Organised Crime Unit to build a network across the region looking for solutions. In one case where a man was dealing drugs from a property, the firm worked with police and a housing association to get a partial closure, which allowed the man\u2019s partner and children to keep using the home but barred other visitors. Detective Inspector Andy Farrell of the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit told the Guardian that these partnerships are increasingly vital in fighting child exploitation. \u201cAcross the region, areas with good transport links are vulnerable to cuckooing, like Harrogate, York and then over to the coastal areas of Scarborough, high areas of social deprivation. It\u2019s really important now that we upskill housing associations and enhance their understanding of county lines. For example, we work with them on partial home closures so we don\u2019t leave potential victims homeless.\u201d He believes the deeper understanding now of how exploitation works is helping to tackle the crime in the longer term. \u201cNow we are actually understanding that children who may have been criminalised previously are actually being exploited. Let\u2019s look at early intervention, look at siblings of those who are being exploited and how we can divert them; we will hopefully see that impact in the future.\u201d Peter Fahy was Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police until 2015 and is now chair of a housing association, Plus Dane Housing. He says housing associations have unusual access at a community level, in areas where cuts have removed many welfare checks. \u201cI had always been struck as a police officer that the closest relationship was with the local housing association and their housing officers. We know that in our housing stock there are people who are incredibly vulnerable, the HAs will know who those vulnerable people are. \u201cFor example, housing associations go into every property at least once a year to do a gas safety check and it\u2019s incredible what they see. You have repair staff seeing child protection issues, or noting when elderly people are incredibly vulnerable. It\u2019s about helping these staff understand the signs and know what to do about it.\u201d It is not just cuckooing and drug dealing that housing associations are seeing up close, Fahy says. \u201cCuckooing is extremely worrying, but beyond that are other things like pop-up brothels. This is an extremely crucial housing issue. Criminals take over a house for a brothel through short term lets or Airbnb. These are operated from properties with very exploited people. It\u2019s extremely hard to get them to speak, they have a fear of the exploiter reaching right back into their own home country or their family.\u201d Fahy acknowledges the problem is a huge and complex one. \u201cFrontline staff are very fearful of the criminal groups involved. There has always been drug dealing, [but] what is different now is children are being used and exploited and the market is chaotic and crowded. \u201cThere is a very high level of drug taking in our society. If you talk to youth charities they will say there is nothing we can do \u2013 kids are offered \u00a31,000 a day to carry drugs and it\u2019s hard to help them once they have got involved. There is little else for them to do in their communities.\u201d",

While her manager was supportive of her pumping breastmilk, there was nowhere suitable to do it. \u201cSo I had to take my breast pump into the bathroom and hope that no one came in and saw me pumping.\u201d</p> <p>Karter is now four years old, but Rebeschini worries about the potential impact of her early absence.</p> <p>\u201c[He] has disabilities and we didn\u2019t catch that until he was over a year old \u2026 I don\u2019t know if we would have caught it sooner had I been home more.\u201d</p> <p>Today she still experiences pain in her abdomen which she attributes to returning to work so soon.</p> <p>Rebeschini has since had a third child, Brody, who is now one.

The waitress ended up ripping her incision six times and as a result can no longer feel her lower stomach.</p> <p>\u201cI would feel like I was on fire, like somebody would take a hot poker and just drag it across the bottom of my stomach,\u201d Moody said. \u201cI was on pain medication for some of the time but it generally doesn\u2019t help because you don\u2019t get to fully rest your body.\u201d</p> <p>As a single mother, Moody depended on the help of family for childcare while she worked nights.

So far, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed their own family leave bills.</p> <p>But despite all the momentum, millions of women are still having to return to work after childbirth long before they are ready.</p> <p>\u201cOn the politician front at least there\u2019s progress,\u201d said Jones-Taylor. \u201cBut any time we have a mother who is going back to work bleeding that\u2019s not good for mum, it\u2019s not good for babies, and it\u2019s really just not good for the workforce.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-leave/paid-leave-works-evidence-from-state-programs.pdf\">National Partnership for Women &amp; Families</a>, the benefits of paid family leave in states that have introduced it include improved worker morale, time for parents to bond with their children, increased breastfeeding, more children getting vaccinations on time, cuts in children\u2019s hospital admissions and reduced probabilities of having ADHD and hearing problems.</p> <p>It also reports a reduced chance of new mothers having postpartum depression and women who take paid leave are 93% more likely to be working nine to 12 months after childbirth than those who don\u2019t.</p> <p>Currently, the only national maternity provision falls under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which entitles new parents to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. But it depends on the parent being able to afford to take unpaid leave and only 60% of the US workforce is covered.</p> <p>Although some private companies are starting to catch up by offering paid family leave as a benefit, many women get around the inflexibility of the corporate world by starting their own businesses. But with no paid maternity leave, there is still pressure to go back to work.</p> <p>Jessica Mann, 35, owner of Chicago-based beauty company Ari Rose Body Care, was back at work five days after giving birth to her one-year-old daughter Lila.</p> <p>Her partner Bryant Ousley, 33, was working long hours in a new job and did not qualify for any parental leave, so Mann was also doing the majority of the care for their three children.</p> <p>\u201cBeing a small business owner I felt that there was no other way that things were going to continue going without me and so it was more of a necessity than anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then of course it impacts your income. So we have a new baby and we have three kids, to not work and not have that income would also impact our household.\u201d</p> <p>Virginia delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy was back on the campaign trail knocking doors two weeks after giving birth by C-section to her now two-year-old twin sons Alex and Xander, who were born premature and spent four months in neonatal intensive care.</p> <p>\u201cI had tremendous back pain, shoulder pain, and you have to think that you\u2019re just coming out of major surgery where you are literally being sliced open and giving life to human beings, it takes a lot out of your body. But I was in a position where there was no time to rest, I didn\u2019t have an option to relax.\u201d</p> <p>Caroll Foy, 38, who was then still working as a public defender, was on disability benefits \u2013 which in some states can be used for pregnancy<strong> \u2013</strong> so she was entitled to a portion of her income. But with she and her husband Jeffrey Foy, 38, a supervisor at a non-profit, taking cuts to their paycheque, their finances came under strain.</p> <p>It was such a wake-up call that she has introduced a paid family leave bill in Virginia. \u201cWhen you\u2019re bringing a new child into this world and you\u2019re expanding your family, your income shrinks \u2026 I want to make sure that other women and families don\u2019t have to make the same painful decisions about being with their newborn baby or paying for their bills and keeping a roof over their head.\u201d</p>",

Within two weeks, she was working 45-hour weeks as a waitress doing nightshifts. She was earning $4.35 an hour carrying heavy trays and walking several miles a day \u2013 pumping breastmilk in the restaurant toilet when she could, and living in fear of her C-section scar reopening. \u201cThe biggest thing was that I was kind of scared. When you have major surgery like that and then you\u2019re pushing your body so harshly,\u201d said the mother of three from Bondurant, Iowa, who is remarkably phlegmatic about the experience. When she got home, Rebeschini would take over childcare duties from her husband Ron, 33, an optician, so he could go to work. \u201cI remember every time I had to work I was like \u2018please don\u2019t reopen,\u2019\u201d she says of the scar on her abdomen. \u201cI mean I was essentially risking my life.\u201d Rebeschini\u2019s experience is far from rare for America\u2019s mothers. One in four women in the US return to work within two weeks of childbirth, according to the advocacy group Paid Leave US (PL+US). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends women take at least six weeks off work following childbirth. But with no federally mandated paid family leave, for many women maternity leave is an unaffordable luxury. The US is one of only three countries in the world not to offer statutory paid maternity leave, according to analysis by the International Labour Organisation, and only 17% have access to paid leave, according to US Department of Labour statistics. \u201cIf you look at paid leave rates between white families and families of colour, it\u2019s even worse,\u201d said Myra Jones-Taylor, chief policy officer at child development non-profit Zero to Three. \u201cParents just can\u2019t afford to stay home with their babies.\u201d Rebeschini, who left her previous job around a month before the birth, said financially she had no option but to work. \u201cWe had two dollars left in our bank account. I remember thinking to myself, had I not been working, my [rent] cheque would have bounced and we wouldn\u2019t have had a place to live.\u201d Working shifts of up to 12 hours, she found the separation from her newborn agonising. \u201cI would come home and the first thing I did was make sure that he was breathing \u2026 When you\u2019re not physically there you just have to trust that he\u2019s fine. You worry about the bond of being gone for so long \u2026 is he going to recognise you?\u201d She said she didn\u2019t dare tell her new employer how recently she had given birth for fear of being considered a liability. While her manager was supportive of her pumping breastmilk, there was nowhere suitable to do it. \u201cSo I had to take my breast pump into the bathroom and hope that no one came in and saw me pumping.\u201d Karter is now four years old, but Rebeschini worries about the potential impact of her early absence. \u201c[He] has disabilities and we didn\u2019t catch that until he was over a year old \u2026 I don\u2019t know if we would have caught it sooner had I been home more.\u201d Today she still experiences pain in her abdomen which she attributes to returning to work so soon. Rebeschini has since had a third child, Brody, who is now one. This time, she took two months off, but with no maternity pay it resulted in the couple falling behind on bills and having to declare bankruptcy \u2013 delaying their plan to buy a home. \u201cYou can prepare all you want to be off for a certain time and not have pay but it just doesn\u2019t work. If we had paid leave, we wouldn\u2019t have fallen so far behind that we couldn\u2019t get ourselves out of a hole. We wouldn\u2019t have that stain on our credit.\u201d Dr Rebecca Jackson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, said breastfeeding is one of the biggest challenges for women who return to work early \u2013 especially low-wage workers. \u201cIf you\u2019re driving a bus, how do you stop that bus to pump milk?\u201d After a C-section, she recommends women take eight weeks off and to avoid heavy activity to prevent complications. \u201cA lot of women still have significant pain at two weeks after,\u201d she said. Kirstin Moody, 36, a waitress from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, could only afford to take one week off after giving birth to her son Alex, now 13, by emergency C-section. The waitress ended up ripping her incision six times and as a result can no longer feel her lower stomach. \u201cI would feel like I was on fire, like somebody would take a hot poker and just drag it across the bottom of my stomach,\u201d Moody said. \u201cI was on pain medication for some of the time but it generally doesn\u2019t help because you don\u2019t get to fully rest your body.\u201d As a single mother, Moody depended on the help of family for childcare while she worked nights. Parting with her newborn son was intolerable. \u201cOh God it was horrible. I cried and cried and I would sit at work and I would cry.\u201d Paid family leave has gained broad support and looks set to become a policy point in the 2020 presidential election, though there are still disagreements in Washington on how to pay for it. In December the White House held a summit dedicated to the subject and recently passed a law to give 2.1 million federal workers 12 weeks of paid parental leave. So far, eight states and the District of Columbia have passed their own family leave bills. But despite all the momentum, millions of women are still having to return to work after childbirth long before they are ready. \u201cOn the politician front at least there\u2019s progress,\u201d said Jones-Taylor. \u201cBut any time we have a mother who is going back to work bleeding that\u2019s not good for mum, it\u2019s not good for babies, and it\u2019s really just not good for the workforce.\u201d According to National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, the benefits of paid family leave in states that have introduced it include improved worker morale, time for parents to bond with their children, increased breastfeeding, more children getting vaccinations on time, cuts in children\u2019s hospital admissions and reduced probabilities of having ADHD and hearing problems. It also reports a reduced chance of new mothers having postpartum depression and women who take paid leave are 93% more likely to be working nine to 12 months after childbirth than those who don\u2019t. Currently, the only national maternity provision falls under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which entitles new parents to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. But it depends on the parent being able to afford to take unpaid leave and only 60% of the US workforce is covered. Although some private companies are starting to catch up by offering paid family leave as a benefit, many women get around the inflexibility of the corporate world by starting their own businesses. But with no paid maternity leave, there is still pressure to go back to work. Jessica Mann, 35, owner of Chicago-based beauty company Ari Rose Body Care, was back at work five days after giving birth to her one-year-old daughter Lila. Her partner Bryant Ousley, 33, was working long hours in a new job and did not qualify for any parental leave, so Mann was also doing the majority of the care for their three children. \u201cBeing a small business owner I felt that there was no other way that things were going to continue going without me and so it was more of a necessity than anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then of course it impacts your income. So we have a new baby and we have three kids, to not work and not have that income would also impact our household.\u201d Virginia delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy was back on the campaign trail knocking doors two weeks after giving birth by C-section to her now two-year-old twin sons Alex and Xander, who were born premature and spent four months in neonatal intensive care. \u201cI had tremendous back pain, shoulder pain, and you have to think that you\u2019re just coming out of major surgery where you are literally being sliced open and giving life to human beings, it takes a lot out of your body. But I was in a position where there was no time to rest, I didn\u2019t have an option to relax.\u201d Caroll Foy, 38, who was then still working as a public defender, was on disability benefits \u2013 which in some states can be used for pregnancy \u2013 so she was entitled to a portion of her income. But with she and her husband Jeffrey Foy, 38, a supervisor at a non-profit, taking cuts to their paycheque, their finances came under strain. It was such a wake-up call that she has introduced a paid family leave bill in Virginia. \u201cWhen you\u2019re bringing a new child into this world and you\u2019re expanding your family, your income shrinks \u2026 I want to make sure that other women and families don\u2019t have to make the same painful decisions about being with their newborn baby or paying for their bills and keeping a roof over their head.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>1) Bellingham\u2019s star quality stands out</h2> <p>Jude Bellingham played within himself at the weekend, part of an under-powered Birmingham performance against Coventry in the match between landlord and tenant at St Andrew\u2019s. With not much in the way of action to talk about, however, the 16-year-old became the subject of post-match chatter, as a possible \u00a330m move to Manchester United looms. The Birmingham manager, Pep Clotet, praised the teen\u2019s character. Mark Robins, however, was even more effusive. \u201cJude Bellingham is outstanding,\u201d said Coventry\u2019s manager. \u201cThe power and pace at 16 is there for everybody to see. He\u2019s going to be a top player.\u201d The midfielder might look to previous youthful sensations who made the move to Old Trafford, such as Nick Powell or even Wilfried Zaha, and know there is no guarantee of continued progress. But at this point, and at such a tender age, it appears the stars are aligning for Bellingham. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/coventry-city-birmingham-city-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Birmingham 0-0 Coventry</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2) Kovacic renaissance a credit to Lampard</h2> <p>If the flagship successes of Frank Lampard\u2019s reign tend to be young and British, Mateo Kovacic\u2019s prowess indicates the Chelsea manager is no one-trick pony. Underwhelming under Maurizio Sarri, notable largely for predictable substitutions involving Ross Barkley, the Croat has become a high-energy, high-class playmaker for Lampard. \u201cI watched him last year and I liked him from afar,\u201d said Lampard, who played a part in the decision to buy Kovacic. \u201cIt maybe wasn\u2019t the easiest year for him.\u201d It helps that his midfield is less rigid \u2013 \u201cI never want it to be absolutely structured\u201d \u2013 but Kovacic showed the ability to unlock Hull with a penetrative pass from deep. \u201cI just saw a natural talent in the way that he can take people out of midfield and travel quickly with the ball,\u201d Lampard added. \u201cWe have got a really good relationship, he loves to talk about his game and is very intelligent. I love working with him.\u201d <strong>Richard Jolly</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/hull-city-chelsea-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Hull 1-2 Chelsea</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00907d403194f2eeb114e84c69cccfb87f45e439\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00907d403194f2eeb114e84c69cccfb87f45e439/0_91_4549_2730/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hull v Chelsea\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mateo Kovacic was a dynamic presence in midfield for Chelsea at Hull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3) Parker sees progress in Fulham\u2019s approach to City</h2> <p>Despite a 4-0 shellacking Scott Parker talked up 10-man Fulham for trying to play an expansive style. \u201cI have been in this job for a year and it was one of the proudest I have been of them,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI asked them to show personality and be brave. I saw a team which was committed, putting themselves in positions [to receive the ball] and to show what they are about. It would have been easy to come here, surrender possession, boot the ball far from goal and sit on the edge of your box. When teams play out [as we did] you notice the mistakes you make [which led to two goals]. What people don\u2019t see is when you boot it out, they [City] can get a sequence of 30-40 passes and that leads to goals too. There is a bigger long-term picture for us and that is having bravery and personality.\u201d <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/26/manchester-city-fulham-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report\">Match report: Manchester City 4-0 Fulham</a></em></p> <h2>4) Sharp still has an edge to offer Blades</h2> <p>Billy Sharp is 34 next month. He has not scored since the opening day. But he produced a performance of revved-up, state-of-the-art centre-forward play at the Den, finding interesting spaces and standing out as a luminous presence in a muted game. Sharp has been around for so long it might be assumed his game would be all about the narrow areas close to goal at this stage. Not so here. The run to make space for Mo Besic\u2019s opening goal was a piece of instinctive footballing art. At times Sharp stood on the touchline and let his midfield flood past. It isn\u2019t hard to see why United fans and indeed their manager are so fond of a player who showed here Chris Wilder\u2019s coaching and his eye for unusual movement have been eagerly received. Sharp has another year left on his contract. He looks good for it, a lesson in old dogs taking on new tricks. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/millwall-sheffield-united-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Millwall 0-2 Sheffield United</a></em></p> <h2>5) Browne\u2019s howler anguishes Robinson</h2> <p>\u201cThe last thought in my head as a I go to sleep tonight will be \u2018what if\u2019,\u201d acknowledged Oxford\u2019s manager, Karl Robinson, after Marcus Browne, his Middlesbrough loanee forward, missed a very presentable chance to book a fifth-round place. \u201cBrowny\u2019s such a talent but his finishing is useless.\u201d Such unvarnished honesty is rare among carefully PR-tutored Premier League managers but this was a day for candour with both Robinson and Steve Bruce admitting they would have much preferred extra-time and/or penalties to an energy-sapping replay. That match could be worth \u00a3500,000 to Oxford but they are chasing promotion and Robinson says his players are \u201cat breaking point\u201d. Bruce, meanwhile, was furious to see his winter break plans ruined. \u201cIt was supposed to be a week off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s the point if they shove replays in. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/newcastle-united-oxford-united-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Newcastle 0-0 Oxford</a></em></p> <h2>6) Boufal needs to build on successful return</h2> <p>When Southampton signed Sofiane Boufal for a then club-record \u00a316m almost four years ago, the attacking midfielder was seen as a coup but the Moroccan has largely flattered to deceive. Boufal spent last season on loan with Celta Vigo but stepped off the bench against Spurs to rifle in his fifth Southampton goal and a first for 721 days. That equaliser earned Saints a replay and stirred memories of his wonderful solo strikes against West Brom, in October 2017, and Sunderland, a year earlier. Brilliant as those were, it is time for Boufal to deliver on a regular basis. \u201cEven if he is not playing from the beginning, I know he can always have a good impact on the game,\u201d said Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, Southampton\u2019s manager. \u201cSofiane is an important player. If he understands what it is about, working 90 minutes against the ball, I think he would have more chances [to start].\u201d <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/southampton-tottenham-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Southampton 1-1 Tottenham</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bca4d73ff2842f14a679f6ea8ed0e8fd1a402d51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bca4d73ff2842f14a679f6ea8ed0e8fd1a402d51/0_41_2278_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sofiane Boufal fires in Southampton\u2019s equaliser against Tottenham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sofiane Boufal fires in Southampton\u2019s equaliser against Tottenham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>7) Belief trumps talent in stirring Shrewsbury fightback</h2> <p>The idea of the FA Cup as \u201ca great leveller\u201d is one of English football\u2019s hoariest cliches, yet at Shrewsbury a veteran central-defensive duo comprising a World Cup finalist and a Champions League winner were given the fright of their lives by a frontline made entirely of lower-league journeymen. Which is no slight whatsoever on Shaun Whalley, Callum Lang and Josh Laurent and Jason Cummings, a quartet who were everything their opponents weren\u2019t: purposeful, precise and supremely unflustered. But Shrewsbury\u2019s comeback demonstrated how abstract notions such as momentum and belief can still trump the hard currency of talent and pedigree. It made for a fantastic second-half spectacle as a gang of third-tier attackers ran riot against the likely Premier League champions, capped with a full-on pitch invasion by jubilant home supporters. Try telling them the FA Cup has lost its magic. <strong>Alex Hess</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/26/shrewsbury-liverpool-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Shrewsbury 2-2 Liverpool</a></em></p> <h2>8) Maguire rewards Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s faith</h2> <p>Of Manchester United\u2019s summer signings, Daniel James has lately struggled and Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a fine defender unsuited to the club\u2019s attacking traditions. Harry Maguire has also been the subject of concern, culpable amid multiple defensive pratfalls. It seems, though, that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r cannot bear to be without his captain. While those other signings were rested at Tranmere, Maguire, playing through a torn hip muscle, soldiered on and should draw confidence from his performance. Playing left of a defensive trio allowed him to stride forward in the fashion that made his name at Hull and Leicester. His goal was beautifully struck before it deflected off Peter Clarke. He even got a rest when substituted just past the hour. The formation suggested a way forward for Solskj\u00e6r and his most trusted lieutenant but tougher tests than this await, starting with Manchester City on Wednesday. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/26/tranmere-rovers-manchester-united-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: Tranmere 0-6 Manchester United</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"374846d95b72ea731bba9329eb2cd3d7e527903d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/374846d95b72ea731bba9329eb2cd3d7e527903d/0_154_4107_2464/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Maguire celebrates opening the scoring for Manchester United at Tranmere.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Maguire celebrates opening the scoring for Manchester United at Tranmere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>9) Sullivan and Moyes under pressure to shop for reinforcements</h2> <p>West Ham are in a mess. The recruitment department is in pieces and was further stripped back when Manuel Pellegrini and his director of football, Mario Husillos, were fired. Pellegrini and Husillos both used their sons as scouts \u2013 they have departed too \u2013 and the dysfunction is deeply worrying given that West Ham, who were deservedly dumped out by 10-man West Brom, need signings before the transfer window shuts on Friday. David Moyes, who has his eye on the Slavia Prague midfielder Tomas Soucek, has made little impact since replacing Pellegrini and was unable to promise there will be much activity this week. David Sullivan, the club\u2019s powerful co-owner, has resumed control of transfer negotiations and is under increasing pressure to get an unbalanced, injury-hit squad out of a hole. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <p><em>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/west-ham-west-bromwich-albion-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Match report: West Ham 0-1 West Brom</a></em></p> <h2>10) We must cherish David Silva while we can</h2> <p>In what was the most routine of wins for Manchester City, where few forced themselves out of second gear to thrash the 10 men of Fulham, David Silva reminded the country of his greatness. The Spanish magician is leaving the Premier League at the end of the season, drawing the curtains on a decade in England. Since his arrival from Valencia he has arguably been the best player in those 10 years but his powers looked to be waning this season, no surprise for someone who turned 34 this month. Sunday, however, was another masterclass of skill, passing and intelligent running. Silva also showed his aggressive side to win the ball for Gabriel Jesus\u2019s first goal, proving he still has the desire. We only have him for a few more months, so should cherish him before he departs for the final chapter of his career. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p>",

Underwhelming under Maurizio Sarri, notable largely for predictable substitutions involving Ross Barkley, the Croat has become a high-energy, high-class playmaker for Lampard. \u201cI watched him last year and I liked him from afar,\u201d said Lampard, who played a part in the decision to buy Kovacic. \u201cIt maybe wasn\u2019t the easiest year for him.\u201d It helps that his midfield is less rigid \u2013 \u201cI never want it to be absolutely structured\u201d \u2013 but Kovacic showed the ability to unlock Hull with a penetrative pass from deep. \u201cI just saw a natural talent in the way that he can take people out of midfield and travel quickly with the ball,\u201d Lampard added. \u201cWe have got a really good relationship, he loves to talk about his game and is very intelligent. I love working with him.\u201d Richard Jolly \u2022 Match report: Hull 1-2 Chelsea 3) Parker sees progress in Fulham\u2019s approach to City Despite a 4-0 shellacking Scott Parker talked up 10-man Fulham for trying to play an expansive style. \u201cI have been in this job for a year and it was one of the proudest I have been of them,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI asked them to show personality and be brave. I saw a team which was committed, putting themselves in positions [to receive the ball] and to show what they are about. It would have been easy to come here, surrender possession, boot the ball far from goal and sit on the edge of your box. When teams play out [as we did] you notice the mistakes you make [which led to two goals]. What people don\u2019t see is when you boot it out, they [City] can get a sequence of 30-40 passes and that leads to goals too. There is a bigger long-term picture for us and that is having bravery and personality.\u201d Jamie Jackson \u2022 Match report: Manchester City 4-0 Fulham 4) Sharp still has an edge to offer Blades Billy Sharp is 34 next month. He has not scored since the opening day. But he produced a performance of revved-up, state-of-the-art centre-forward play at the Den, finding interesting spaces and standing out as a luminous presence in a muted game. Sharp has been around for so long it might be assumed his game would be all about the narrow areas close to goal at this stage. Not so here. The run to make space for Mo Besic\u2019s opening goal was a piece of instinctive footballing art. At times Sharp stood on the touchline and let his midfield flood past. It isn\u2019t hard to see why United fans and indeed their manager are so fond of a player who showed here Chris Wilder\u2019s coaching and his eye for unusual movement have been eagerly received. Sharp has another year left on his contract. He looks good for it, a lesson in old dogs taking on new tricks. Barney Ronay \u2022 Match report: Millwall 0-2 Sheffield United 5) Browne\u2019s howler anguishes Robinson \u201cThe last thought in my head as a I go to sleep tonight will be \u2018what if\u2019,\u201d acknowledged Oxford\u2019s manager, Karl Robinson, after Marcus Browne, his Middlesbrough loanee forward, missed a very presentable chance to book a fifth-round place. \u201cBrowny\u2019s such a talent but his finishing is useless.\u201d Such unvarnished honesty is rare among carefully PR-tutored Premier League managers but this was a day for candour with both Robinson and Steve Bruce admitting they would have much preferred extra-time and/or penalties to an energy-sapping replay. That match could be worth \u00a3500,000 to Oxford but they are chasing promotion and Robinson says his players are \u201cat breaking point\u201d. Bruce, meanwhile, was furious to see his winter break plans ruined. \u201cIt was supposed to be a week off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s the point if they shove replays in. It\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Louise Taylor \u2022 Match report: Newcastle 0-0 Oxford 6) Boufal needs to build on successful return When Southampton signed Sofiane Boufal for a then club-record \u00a316m almost four years ago, the attacking midfielder was seen as a coup but the Moroccan has largely flattered to deceive. Boufal spent last season on loan with Celta Vigo but stepped off the bench against Spurs to rifle in his fifth Southampton goal and a first for 721 days. That equaliser earned Saints a replay and stirred memories of his wonderful solo strikes against West Brom, in October 2017, and Sunderland, a year earlier. Brilliant as those were, it is time for Boufal to deliver on a regular basis. \u201cEven if he is not playing from the beginning, I know he can always have a good impact on the game,\u201d said Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, Southampton\u2019s manager. \u201cSofiane is an important player. If he understands what it is about, working 90 minutes against the ball, I think he would have more chances [to start].\u201d Ben Fisher \u2022 Match report: Southampton 1-1 Tottenham 7) Belief trumps talent in stirring Shrewsbury fightback The idea of the FA Cup as \u201ca great leveller\u201d is one of English football\u2019s hoariest cliches, yet at Shrewsbury a veteran central-defensive duo comprising a World Cup finalist and a Champions League winner were given the fright of their lives by a frontline made entirely of lower-league journeymen. Which is no slight whatsoever on Shaun Whalley, Callum Lang and Josh Laurent and Jason Cummings, a quartet who were everything their opponents weren\u2019t: purposeful, precise and supremely unflustered. But Shrewsbury\u2019s comeback demonstrated how abstract notions such as momentum and belief can still trump the hard currency of talent and pedigree. It made for a fantastic second-half spectacle as a gang of third-tier attackers ran riot against the likely Premier League champions, capped with a full-on pitch invasion by jubilant home supporters. Try telling them the FA Cup has lost its magic. Alex Hess \u2022 Match report: Shrewsbury 2-2 Liverpool 8) Maguire rewards Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s faith Of Manchester United\u2019s summer signings, Daniel James has lately struggled and Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a fine defender unsuited to the club\u2019s attacking traditions. Harry Maguire has also been the subject of concern, culpable amid multiple defensive pratfalls. It seems, though, that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r cannot bear to be without his captain. While those other signings were rested at Tranmere, Maguire, playing through a torn hip muscle, soldiered on and should draw confidence from his performance. Playing left of a defensive trio allowed him to stride forward in the fashion that made his name at Hull and Leicester. His goal was beautifully struck before it deflected off Peter Clarke. He even got a rest when substituted just past the hour. The formation suggested a way forward for Solskj\u00e6r and his most trusted lieutenant but tougher tests than this await, starting with Manchester City on Wednesday. John Brewin \u2022 Match report: Tranmere 0-6 Manchester United 9) Sullivan and Moyes under pressure to shop for reinforcements West Ham are in a mess. The recruitment department is in pieces and was further stripped back when Manuel Pellegrini and his director of football, Mario Husillos, were fired. Pellegrini and Husillos both used their sons as scouts \u2013 they have departed too \u2013 and the dysfunction is deeply worrying given that West Ham, who were deservedly dumped out by 10-man West Brom, need signings before the transfer window shuts on Friday. David Moyes, who has his eye on the Slavia Prague midfielder Tomas Soucek, has made little impact since replacing Pellegrini and was unable to promise there will be much activity this week. David Sullivan, the club\u2019s powerful co-owner, has resumed control of transfer negotiations and is under increasing pressure to get an unbalanced, injury-hit squad out of a hole. Jacob Steinberg \u2022 Match report: West Ham 0-1 West Brom 10) We must cherish David Silva while we can In what was the most routine of wins for Manchester City, where few forced themselves out of second gear to thrash the 10 men of Fulham, David Silva reminded the country of his greatness. The Spanish magician is leaving the Premier League at the end of the season, drawing the curtains on a decade in England. Since his arrival from Valencia he has arguably been the best player in those 10 years but his powers looked to be waning this season, no surprise for someone who turned 34 this month. Sunday, however, was another masterclass of skill, passing and intelligent running. Silva also showed his aggressive side to win the ball for Gabriel Jesus\u2019s first goal, proving he still has the desire. We only have him for a few more months, so should cherish him before he departs for the final chapter of his career. Will Unwin",

      "body": "<h2>How did we get here?</h2> <p>Where to start? There\u2019s geography: Britain is an island, and has been since geologically Brexiting from the continent 8,000 years ago. And history: unlike most of western Europe, it has not spent the past few centuries as a battlefield. Its history, rather, is global and imperial.</p> <p>That, plus second world war heroics, has given it a profound sense of exceptionalism, reinforced by relative economic success and an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic popular press that adores dripping corrosive untruths about Brussels.</p> <p>All this eventually combined to create the impression that the EU was essentially an anti-British plot: something that was somehow done to us. Hardline Tory Euroscepticism emerged with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Bruges speech of 1988, hounded the party into opposition in the 1990s, and returned with a vengeance once Conservative rule was restored in 2010.</p> <p>Amid the bitter fallout of the financial crash, mounting public concern over immigration and a political threat from the right in the form of Nigel Farage\u2019s anti-EU Ukip party led David Cameron to promise an in-out Brexit referendum if he won the 2015 election.</p> <p>A largely populist, emotive and evidence-free campaign with the inspired slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d carried the day, with voters motivated by a wide range of factors opting by 52% to 48% in favour of the UK leaving the EU.</p> <p>Three years of exhausting stalemate set in, as parliament refused to muster a majority in favour of a withdrawal deal mired in uncertainty chiefly over the future status of Northern Ireland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07219a7aa5c9acfc6bf55ed3e87e1a9e00250e93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07219a7aa5c9acfc6bf55ed3e87e1a9e00250e93/0_96_2985_1791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar meets Boris Johnson in October 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar meets Boris Johnson in October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Mullen/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>So what broke the deadlock?</h2> <p>In short, a meeting in a wedding venue in the Wirral on a cold day in October 2019.</p> <p>Boris Johnson and Irish premier Leo Varadkar broke the impasse with an agreement on what to do about the tricky land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>This frontier had become a 300-mile stumbling block for Theresa May, who was unable to broker an agreement on how to take Northern Ireland out of the EU without reinstating unworkable \u2013 and unpalatable \u2013 border checks.</p> <p>Johnson and Varadkar essentially agreed to shift the border checks to between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p> <p>The deal is not popular in Northern Ireland. But it is one that commands the support of the Conservative party and its 80-strong majority. So, after it was approved by MPs in December and is ratified in the European parliament and Westminster later this week, it will bring the final curtain down on 47 years of EU membership at 11pm on 31 January.</p> <h2>So is the UK out of the EU?</h2> <p>\u201cYes, but\u201d. At the stroke of 11pm on 31 January (midnight in Brussels), the UK ceases to be a member of the EU. The divorce is sealed. The only way back is an application to rejoin.</p> <p>But many people may not notice the difference, as the UK enters an 11-month transition period to allow time to negotiate a new relationship. That means staying in the EU single market, its customs union and paying into its budget. British citizens can continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/30/brexit-10-things-uk-citizens-can-still-do-in-eu-after-31-january\">live, work, study and retire to the EU</a>, while EU27 nationals enjoy those reciprocal rights in the UK.</p> <p>A more significant moment could be 1 January 2021, the UK\u2019s first day outside EU rules. Under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/17/how-is-boris-johnson-brexit-deal-different-from-theresa-may\">Brexit withdrawal agreement,</a> that day could be delayed until 2022 or 2023, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/brexit-transition-period-not-extended-past-2020-gove\">Johnson has ruled out any extension of the transition period</a>.</p> <h2>So what actually changes on Friday?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/20/what-happens-after-brexit-bill-is-passed\">Life will carry on as normal for individuals </a>with one key change \u2013 UK citizens, from 11pm, will no longer be EU citizens.</p> <p>British passport holders will continue to be able to travel and work in the EU because the country remains in the single market for the transition period up to 31 December and the freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital over borders applies until then.</p> <p>The main change is legal and institutional. The article 50 process is over and non-reversible. Friday is the point of no return to the EU.</p> <p>The UK will continue to follow EU rules, but have no say in making them. British ministers will play no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/13/britain-voted-with-the-majority-of-the-rest-of-the-eu-in-run-up-to-referendum\">part in the EU law-making process</a>.

The EU will move on without Britain.</p> <p>Over 47 years, British governments cheered liberal economic policies (above all the single market), promoted EU enlargement, invented regional policy subsidies for poorer regions, pushed reform of fisheries and farming, watered down some environmental protection laws (and championed others), while avoiding the euro and the Schengen passport-free zone.</p> <p>The UK had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/brussels-uk-eu-civil-servants-uncertainty\">\u201cthe best possible world\u201d</a>, concluded one veteran French diplomat.

But the prime minister has to be careful about not deepening the divisions in the country by being too celebratory and has instead chosen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/17/boris-johnson-saves-face-over-failed-bid-for-big-ben-brexit-chime\">a series of toned-down events to mark the occasion.</a></p> <p>Instead of Big Ben chiming out as the UK officially leaves at 11pm on Friday, a clock counting down be projected on to No 10 Downing Street.</p> <p>And an effort to convey the Tory party\u2019s commitment to \u201clevelling up\u201d the country, a special cabinet meeting will be head in an as-yet-undisclosed location in the north of England.</p> <p>The union jack will fly from all flagpoles in Parliament Square but there will be no emblematic lowering of the EU flag.</p> <p>A commemorative Brexit 50p coin with the words \u201cpeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u201d will come into circulation.

Draft negotiating mandates are due to be produced by 1 February and EU ministers are expected to approve a mandate for the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on 25 February, allowing formal talks to begin soon after.</p> <p>These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/get-brexit-done-reality-far-more-difficult-tortuous-european-union\">talks will be unprecedented</a>, and could cover a vast sweep of policies, including trade, security, foreign affairs, data, fisheries, cultural-educational ties and much more.</p> <p>However, with just 11 months to negotiate, the chances are there will only be a \u201cbare bones\u201d deal likely covering trade, fisheries and security. If that is the case, then, at the end of 2020, there will be a lot of unfinished business. Differing aspirations for the trade talks have raised the prospect of a new no-deal scenario at the end of this year.</p> <p>Leaving the transition period without a trade deal would not lead to the major diplomatic bust-up that failure on the Brexit withdrawal agreement would have done.</p> <p>It would have huge domestic consequences, however, with representatives of the car industry, hospitals, agriculture and directors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/18/savid-javid-warns-there-will-be-no-alignment-on-eu-regulations-after-brexit\">already expressing alarm over Sajid Javid\u2019s declaration that the UK will not follow EU rules</a>, which will cause hold-ups in Dover and Calais and possibly lead to businesses quitting the country.</p> <p>In the absence of a deal, the earlier accord on citizens\u2019 rights, money and the Irish border remains intact.</p> <p>The special arrangements that apply in Northern Ireland will kick in, deal or no deal.</p> <p>Both sides would brace themselves for the economic shock of trading on World Trade Organization terms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/19/what-a-no-deal-brexit-could-mean-for-the-uk-in-five-charts\">an outcome that is more damaging for the UK</a>.

      "bodyText": "How did we get here? Where to start? There\u2019s geography: Britain is an island, and has been since geologically Brexiting from the continent 8,000 years ago. And history: unlike most of western Europe, it has not spent the past few centuries as a battlefield. Its history, rather, is global and imperial. That, plus second world war heroics, has given it a profound sense of exceptionalism, reinforced by relative economic success and an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic popular press that adores dripping corrosive untruths about Brussels. All this eventually combined to create the impression that the EU was essentially an anti-British plot: something that was somehow done to us. Hardline Tory Euroscepticism emerged with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Bruges speech of 1988, hounded the party into opposition in the 1990s, and returned with a vengeance once Conservative rule was restored in 2010. Amid the bitter fallout of the financial crash, mounting public concern over immigration and a political threat from the right in the form of Nigel Farage\u2019s anti-EU Ukip party led David Cameron to promise an in-out Brexit referendum if he won the 2015 election. A largely populist, emotive and evidence-free campaign with the inspired slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d carried the day, with voters motivated by a wide range of factors opting by 52% to 48% in favour of the UK leaving the EU. Three years of exhausting stalemate set in, as parliament refused to muster a majority in favour of a withdrawal deal mired in uncertainty chiefly over the future status of Northern Ireland. So what broke the deadlock? In short, a meeting in a wedding venue in the Wirral on a cold day in October 2019. Boris Johnson and Irish premier Leo Varadkar broke the impasse with an agreement on what to do about the tricky land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This frontier had become a 300-mile stumbling block for Theresa May, who was unable to broker an agreement on how to take Northern Ireland out of the EU without reinstating unworkable \u2013 and unpalatable \u2013 border checks. Johnson and Varadkar essentially agreed to shift the border checks to between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The deal is not popular in Northern Ireland. But it is one that commands the support of the Conservative party and its 80-strong majority. So, after it was approved by MPs in December and is ratified in the European parliament and Westminster later this week, it will bring the final curtain down on 47 years of EU membership at 11pm on 31 January. So is the UK out of the EU? \u201cYes, but\u201d. At the stroke of 11pm on 31 January (midnight in Brussels), the UK ceases to be a member of the EU. The divorce is sealed. The only way back is an application to rejoin. But many people may not notice the difference, as the UK enters an 11-month transition period to allow time to negotiate a new relationship. That means staying in the EU single market, its customs union and paying into its budget. British citizens can continue to live, work, study and retire to the EU, while EU27 nationals enjoy those reciprocal rights in the UK. A more significant moment could be 1 January 2021, the UK\u2019s first day outside EU rules. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, that day could be delayed until 2022 or 2023, but Johnson has ruled out any extension of the transition period. So what actually changes on Friday? Life will carry on as normal for individuals with one key change \u2013 UK citizens, from 11pm, will no longer be EU citizens. British passport holders will continue to be able to travel and work in the EU because the country remains in the single market for the transition period up to 31 December and the freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital over borders applies until then. The main change is legal and institutional. The article 50 process is over and non-reversible. Friday is the point of no return to the EU. The UK will continue to follow EU rules, but have no say in making them. British ministers will play no part in the EU law-making process. The prime minister will cease attending EU summits to set the bloc\u2019s priorities. The UK\u2019s 73 MEPs will be sent home, with one of the parliament\u2019s union jacks dispatched to the EU-funded House of History. The last UK commissioner, Julian King, has already said goodbye to Brussels. The EU will move on without Britain. Over 47 years, British governments cheered liberal economic policies (above all the single market), promoted EU enlargement, invented regional policy subsidies for poorer regions, pushed reform of fisheries and farming, watered down some environmental protection laws (and championed others), while avoiding the euro and the Schengen passport-free zone. The UK had \u201cthe best possible world\u201d, concluded one veteran French diplomat. Now it\u2019s gone. And how is the country planning to mark it? After almost half a century of membership, the departure from the EU is a historic event. But the prime minister has to be careful about not deepening the divisions in the country by being too celebratory and has instead chosen a series of toned-down events to mark the occasion. Instead of Big Ben chiming out as the UK officially leaves at 11pm on Friday, a clock counting down be projected on to No 10 Downing Street. And an effort to convey the Tory party\u2019s commitment to \u201clevelling up\u201d the country, a special cabinet meeting will be head in an as-yet-undisclosed location in the north of England. The union jack will fly from all flagpoles in Parliament Square but there will be no emblematic lowering of the EU flag. A commemorative Brexit 50p coin with the words \u201cpeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u201d will come into circulation. New stamps marking the occasion are also in the pipeline. Farage and the Leave Means Leave campaign are hosting a party for the countdown in Parliament Square, with Brexiters encouraged to go in fancy dress. There is no official wake for remainers but Guardian readers have shared their private plans to mark the momentous day. What will happen next? There is a set timetable for the year with negotiations expected to formally kick off after 25 February. By 1 July there must be a deal on fisheries and a UK decision on whether to ask for an extension to the transition period. Johnson has urged Brussels to fast-track trade talks, but the EU moves at its own pace. Draft negotiating mandates are due to be produced by 1 February and EU ministers are expected to approve a mandate for the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on 25 February, allowing formal talks to begin soon after. These talks will be unprecedented, and could cover a vast sweep of policies, including trade, security, foreign affairs, data, fisheries, cultural-educational ties and much more. However, with just 11 months to negotiate, the chances are there will only be a \u201cbare bones\u201d deal likely covering trade, fisheries and security. If that is the case, then, at the end of 2020, there will be a lot of unfinished business. Differing aspirations for the trade talks have raised the prospect of a new no-deal scenario at the end of this year. Leaving the transition period without a trade deal would not lead to the major diplomatic bust-up that failure on the Brexit withdrawal agreement would have done. It would have huge domestic consequences, however, with representatives of the car industry, hospitals, agriculture and directors already expressing alarm over Sajid Javid\u2019s declaration that the UK will not follow EU rules, which will cause hold-ups in Dover and Calais and possibly lead to businesses quitting the country. In the absence of a deal, the earlier accord on citizens\u2019 rights, money and the Irish border remains intact. The special arrangements that apply in Northern Ireland will kick in, deal or no deal. Both sides would brace themselves for the economic shock of trading on World Trade Organization terms, an outcome that is more damaging for the UK. But talks would roll on. What are the big issues at stake here? Top of the list is a trade deal to ensure the tariff and quota-free flow of goods between the EU and UK. But the EU will only agree to zero tariffs and zero quotas if the UK pledges zero dumping \u2013 that is, not lowering social and environmental standards to outcompete the EU. Negotiators will almost certainly clash over the EU\u2019s refusal to bring services into the trade deal, leaving the City of London reliant on a patchwork of market access agreements that can be withdrawn at any moment. Another early fight will be over fish, as the EU seeks to link goods trade to maintaining the status quo on access to British waters, a demand seen as outrageous in London. The non-trade topics sound easier, but are full of political landmines. For instance, agreeing a replacement for the European arrest warrant will require Germany to change its constitution. The UK will struggle to achieve the historic first of securing outside access to some EU crime-fighting databases. What will happen to the economy? It depends who you ask. In the short term, much of the risk seems to have been priced in, at least on currency markets, where sterling still languishes compared to where it was in June 2016. The stock market is well ahead. A slightly more certain outlook could allow business investment to recover, after years of lagging behind Britain\u2019s G7 peers. But against that must be weighed the unpredictability of the looming trade talks. What does Europe think about the big Brexit moment? The EU has always expressed regret at Britain\u2019s decision to leave, repeating as long as legally possible throughout the Brexit process that the door was still open should the UK change its mind and, more recently, that it could always reapply after leaving. But the bloc has also robustly defended its interests, in particular the integrity of the single market, insisting, with unexpected unanimity, that Britain could not \u201chave its cake and eat it\u201d by retaining the benefits of EU membership while diverging from its rules. Frustration mounted at what the EU27 saw as the UK\u2019s reluctance to accept the real-world consequences of the vote to leave, its inability to agree on what kind of Brexit it wanted, and of course the long months of parliamentary psychodrama and paralysis that ensued. Some countries (France) have taken a much tougher line than others; some (the Netherlands, Denmark) will suffer much more from a no-trade-deal Brexit. But the EU27 should maintain their unity during the future relationship talks: however much of a blow a hard Brexit may be, a weakened single market is a far more damaging prospect. What does it all mean for Britons in Europe\u2026 No one yet fully knows; much remains to be negotiated. The withdrawal agreement secures British citizens\u2019 basic rights to live and work within their EU host countries, a broadly similar post-Brexit status in each country, and EU-wide coordination on reciprocal healthcare and social security.

After it ends they will have the right \u2013 providing they register, or in some countries apply, within a given time limit \u2013 to stay and, after a time, seek permanent residence. But when the UK leaves the single market after transition, certain rights will fall away, including freedom of movement. This is a major blow for the 80% of UK citizens on the continent who are of working age or younger; they fought hard to lock free movement into the withdrawal agreement, but the EU decided this should be part of the trade talks. Some rights within the gift of the UK are not yet assured either, such as home fees for British students on the continent who wish to study in the UK, and family reunification rights for Britons returning to the UK with EU family members. ...and for Europeans in Britain?

His 02022020 magic square is also a magic square when read upside down and when read in a mirror. (When in a mirror the 2s become 5s.) Wow! I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. Thanks to John Trevelyan for today\u2019s puzzle. My latest puzzle book is So You Think You\u2019ve Got Problems?",

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, a former employee of a Russian misinformation factory reached for a literary classic in order to describe his dirty work. No prizes for guessing which one he chose. \u201cI immediately felt like a character in the book Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell \u2013 a place where you have to write that white is black and black is white,\u201d he told the Washington Post, confident that every reader would get the gist. Resurgent authoritarianism and online misinformation have conspired to make Orwell\u2019s work aggressively relevant in recent years, just in time for it to fall out of copyright on the 70th anniversary of his death. Then again, when has Nineteen Eighty-Four not been relevant? No work of literary fiction has ever become such a fruitful stockpile of impactful, flexible and easily understood metaphors for the villainies of the modern world. As Anthony Burgess quipped in 1978: \u201cAmerican college students have said, \u2018like Nineteen Eighty-Four, man\u2019 when asked not to smoke pot in the classroom or advised gently to do a little reading.\u201d This leaves Richard Bradford, an English professor at Ulster University, somewhat unsure about the case he\u2019s making. \u201cOrwell is a writer for our time because the issues he foregrounded and tackled in his work are timeless,\u201d he says. So is Orwell a writer for our time specifically or for all times? Did he, as Bradford often claims, \u201cforesee\u201d the 21st century or simply describe, brilliantly, problems that are always with us? The publisher\u2019s claim that this is the first \u201cmajor\u201d biography since Orwell\u2019s centenary in 2003 is itself rather Orwellian. Now that even Orwell\u2019s most robust contemporaries are no longer around to share their memories, every biographer must walk a well-trodden path (Eton, Burma, Paris, Wigan, Spain, London, Jura) in the footsteps of earlier scholars, but there is not an ounce of unfamiliar material here and even the less obvious quotations and anecdotes appear to have been drawn from secondary sources. Vital context is missing. Bradford\u2019s minimal interest in other writers of the period gives the false impression that Orwell was alone in, say, noticing that Stalin and Hitler had much in common, rather than one node in an informal international network of anti-totalitarian socialists. The bibliography is both thin and predictable. Bradford, whose previous subjects include Larkin, Hemingway and two Amises, seems less enthused by the past than by the present and less interested in Orwell\u2019s opinions than his own. Passages that might work in a polemical appreciation are ruinously distracting in a supposed biography. Whenever Orwell himself threatens to swim into focus, another disquisition on the stupidity of Brexit or the ghastliness of Jeremy Corbyn muddies the picture. The reader lurches from Burma to Ukip, and from Down and Out in Paris and London to Channel 4\u2019s Benefits Street, as Bradford press-gangs poor old George into his war against an army of bugbears that includes Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, Xi Jinping, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Islamism, Twitter, Eton, Jacques Derrida, EL James, George Monbiot and that notorious Orwellian demagogue Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: \u201cRiver Cottage is his oligarchy, something he has transformed and improved, and his prole-like neighbours appear suitably grateful.\u201d Well, it\u2019s certainly a fresh angle. Orwell himself was fond of waspish lists, from the savage caricature of crank socialists in The Road to Wigan Pier to the tally of Soviet sympathisers he maintained towards the end of his life, but only in the service of the immense project that dominated his writing life: explaining and opposing totalitarianism. Without an equivalent purpose, Bradford\u2019s book suffers from an acute failure of perspective. The New Statesman\u2019s misquoting of Roger Scruton last year may have been unfortunate but it didn\u2019t quite rise to the level of the Stalinist vilification of Orwell\u2019s colleagues in the Spanish civil war. Overstatement walks hand in hand with anachronism. Though Orwell championed the notion of a united states of Europe, it is self-evidently meaningless to call him \u201ca passionate Remainer long before the EU was conceived of\u201d, because there was no entity in which to remain. Claiming that the \u201cmachine-produced trash\u201d in Nineteen Eighty-Four \u201canticipates\u201d Fifty Shades of Grey implies that pulpy erotic fiction didn\u2019t exist in Orwell\u2019s time, when that was exactly what Orwell was satirising. When Bradford writes, \u201cI would not venture that Orwell anticipated #MeToo, not quite,\u201d one is thankful for small mercies. Bradford\u2019s contrarianism is sometimes enlivening. He admires Orwell\u2019s least popular novel (A Clergyman\u2019s Daughter) and most problematic essay (Inside the Whale) while casting a sceptical eye over his celebrated pamphlet The Lion and the Unicorn. For all Orwell\u2019s memorable insights into the national character, Bradford is right to say that \u201cup to his death he could never quite make up his mind about how he felt about England, except that he could not stop being part of it\u201d. In a way, Bradford\u2019s recognition of Orwell\u2019s eccentricities and paradoxes makes matters worse. How can he then presume to know what this contradictory character would think 117 years after his birth? \u201cOne has to ask: if Orwell could rejoin us in 2020 what would he make of it?\u201d I\u2019m not sure one does but Bradford asks anyway. The answer is that he would agree with Richard Bradford. This is a book undone by its own premise. The intent is to use Orwell\u2019s life and work to illuminate the present. Instead, the klieg-light glare of the present reduces Orwell\u2019s precise observations to banal truisms \u2013 politicians lie, groupthink is pernicious \u2013 and traps him in the second half of the 2010s.

A Brexit party spokesman said Tennant had simply been \u201cdrafting ideas\u201d in much the same way as Johnson did. \u201cThere are good points and bad points to both choices, he still hasn\u2019t reached a conclusion, but will do before next week\u2019s vote,\u201d the spokesman said.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThis is it? This is the game?\u201d</p> <p>I am in Italy with my partner, and just like every beach holiday since 1999, I have booted up Pok\u00e9mon. This particular version is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/18/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review-a-refreshing-reinvention-of-a-classic-formula\">Pok\u00e9mon Sun</a> for the Nintendo 3DS, but all the games are fundamentally the same: you\u2019re a child leaving home to catch and train tiny monsters so you can defeat various bosses and bad guys. My boyfriend, who has never played Pok\u00e9mon, has just watched me eviscerate a grunt trainer with my level 41 Mudsdale.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so \u2026<em> slow</em>.\u201d</p> <p>I consider, for the first time, what the Pok\u00e9mon games look like to a person who has never played them. They <em>are</em> slow. A huge portion is just you, a 10-year-old, walking around and being assaulted by bats. The \u201cbattles\u201d you enter with other trainers are fundamentally lacking in drama, and mostly consist of you smashing the same one or two moves over and over again. And the \u201cmoves\u201d? You see very little of them. Rattata uses \u201ctackle\u201d and this is signified by a rat animation inclining slightly forward.</p> <p>Why have I been playing this game for 20 years? Because there are two different but adjoining games going on in Pok\u00e9mon. There is one you play on your console, the plodding, multiple choice-based, \u201cgotta catch \u2019em all\u201d game that birthed an anime dynasty, then there is another that happens entirely in your own head.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever played Pok\u00e9mon, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. The guilt you feel when it\u2019s time to bench your Pidgeot \u2013 the one who started with you as a humble level 4 Pidgey on Route 1 \u2013 because you know he can\u2019t take you to the dizzy heights of the Indigo Plateau. The overwhelming sense of gulping-for-air urgency when you and your team emerge, limping and faint, from another endless cave of poisonous Zubats and aggressive trainers. The strange existential panic when you use a thunder stone on your dainty Pikachu, so he may evolve into a hefty daddy Raichu. </p> <p>The game encourages you to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon, bench the weak ones, and do whatever you can to succeed. The weirdly intense emotional state this summons is not a result of the slow gameplay mechanics but a cumulative effect of the writing. The games are essentially road movies. You journey through different towns, dropping in on lives already in progress, stories already in motion. And like any road movie, the visitor is only ever told as much as he needs to know. There are no Super Mario-style \u201cFind the princess!\u201d prompts. You are asked, simply, to read the room.</p> <p>One visceral example of this is Lavender Town, which you experience as a vague, unfinished ghost story. You arrive in this small village. Something is obviously wrong. Nothing is growing, there are no water features, and a shrill, repetitive 8-bit tune plays. You learn that this is the home of the only Pok\u00e9mon graveyard. It is the first time we are introduced to the concept of death. We know Pok\u00e9mon \u201cfaint\u201d if they lose a battle, but healthcare being free and medication cheap, death is not something we\u2019ve had to confront yet. But now we know: Pok\u00e9mon die and they are mourned.</p> <p>That\u2019s not all. Something terrible has happened here, and recently. One of the characters explains: \u201cGhosts appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Tower. I think they\u2019re the spirits of Pok\u00e9mon that the Rockets killed.\u201d<em> </em>So Lavender Town is haunted because of a massacre led by Team Rocket, something we hear nothing more about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"139a450af898aa1d76d8de59cb92d1886b7c0ee0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/139a450af898aa1d76d8de59cb92d1886b7c0ee0/26_0_1800_1080/1000.png\" alt=\"Team Rocket from Pokemon the Movie: The Power of Us\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mysterious massacre \u2026 Team Rocket from Pokemon the Movie: The Power of Us</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pok\u00e9mon games are full of stories like this: half-written, euphemistic, full of hints and easter eggs, and characters who allude to things that often never happen. For the first few hours of <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Game-Boy/Pokemon-Blue-Version-266054.html\">Pok\u00e9mon Blue</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Game-Boy/Pokemon-Red-Version-266109.html#\">Red</a>, you are led to believe that a big plot with a Clefairy is about to kick off, and it simply never does. It creates a sense that you are living in a vast, complex world full of lost tales and broken people. </p> <p>Take the gym leaders. These are the game\u2019s grimy local politicians, whose moods and preferences govern an entire region. The more you play, the more you read into their sad little lives. Brock\u2019s backwoods gym is so dull you can practically hear your rubber soles squeaking on the floor as you destroy his Onix. At Lt. Surge\u2019s deranged Electric-type gym you\u2019re forced to sort through trash before he\u2019ll even speak to you. Female-led gyms tend to be more elaborate \u2013 do they have to work harder to gain credibility? Is there inherent sexism in the gym leadership world? Maybe that\u2019s why Erica has more trainers than anyone else. Maybe it\u2019s a feminist thing. Maybe Erica is the AOC of Pok\u00e9mon.</p> <p>From the beginning, Pok\u00e9mon has encouraged this kind of close reading. Satoshi Tajiri, the president of Game Freak and creator of the franchise, began his career as a writer. He made a video arcade fanzine, also called Game Freak, which became hugely popular for its gamer tips and lists of easter eggs. In 1999, he gave <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040095,00.html\">an interview to Time magazine</a> about the mysterious and elusive Pok\u00e9mon named Mew, which was added to Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue at the last moment as a hidden extra. \u201cThere were 150 characters, and Mew was number 151,\u201d Tajiri explained. \u201cIt created a myth about the game, that there was an invisible character out there \u2026 It kept the interest alive.\u201d</p> <p>For decades, fan theories about how to find Mew circulated through forums. Most speculation centred on a small truck parked near a ship named SS Anne at Vermilion Harbour. The truck is only accessible with the aid of some crafty trading with another player; for years, many players believed that Mew was <a href=\"https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/02/that-time-some-players-thought-mew-was-under-a-truck-inpokmon/\">hidden behind that elusive vehicle</a>.</p> <p>The sparse storytelling has led to players filling in the gaps in other creative and fascinating ways. The world is mostly populated by children and elderly guardians, and your own father is absent. Lieutenant Surge, an Electric <a href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Gym_Leader\">gym leader</a>, alludes to combat, and is one of the few middle-aged men in the game. To many fans, the natural conclusion is that we are living a decade or so after a war so devastating that it claimed an entire generation of men. Suddenly, the lush forests, the free healthcare (didn\u2019t the NHS begin after the second world war, after all?), the societal emphasis on having strong Pok\u00e9mon who are willing to fight for you \u2013 it all makes sense.</p> <p>As a novelist, I\u2019m keenly aware that people won\u2019t commit to a story unless it engenders an ideological pact between writer and audience; it has to encourage us to fill in the gaps and overinvest emotionally. I would feel ashamed to undertake such a close reading of the Pok\u00e9mon games, if I weren\u2019t absolutely sure that these theories live in the hearts and minds of millions of fans who spent their childhoods starting adventure after adventure, each more or less identical and yet all filled with imagination. These fans are easy to find. All you need to do is whisper the magic words: \u201cI like shorts. They\u2019re comfy and easy to wear.\u201d Trust me, they\u2019ll understand.</p> <ul> <li><p>Caroline O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s second novel, Scenes of a Graphic Nature, will be published by Virago in June.</p></li> </ul> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cThis is it? This is the game?\u201d I am in Italy with my partner, and just like every beach holiday since 1999, I have booted up Pok\u00e9mon. This particular version is Pok\u00e9mon Sun for the Nintendo 3DS, but all the games are fundamentally the same: you\u2019re a child leaving home to catch and train tiny monsters so you can defeat various bosses and bad guys. My boyfriend, who has never played Pok\u00e9mon, has just watched me eviscerate a grunt trainer with my level 41 Mudsdale. \u201cIt\u2019s so \u2026 slow.\u201d I consider, for the first time, what the Pok\u00e9mon games look like to a person who has never played them. They are slow. A huge portion is just you, a 10-year-old, walking around and being assaulted by bats. The \u201cbattles\u201d you enter with other trainers are fundamentally lacking in drama, and mostly consist of you smashing the same one or two moves over and over again. And the \u201cmoves\u201d? You see very little of them. Rattata uses \u201ctackle\u201d and this is signified by a rat animation inclining slightly forward. Why have I been playing this game for 20 years? Because there are two different but adjoining games going on in Pok\u00e9mon. There is one you play on your console, the plodding, multiple choice-based, \u201cgotta catch \u2019em all\u201d game that birthed an anime dynasty, then there is another that happens entirely in your own head. If you\u2019ve ever played Pok\u00e9mon, you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. The guilt you feel when it\u2019s time to bench your Pidgeot \u2013 the one who started with you as a humble level 4 Pidgey on Route 1 \u2013 because you know he can\u2019t take you to the dizzy heights of the Indigo Plateau. The overwhelming sense of gulping-for-air urgency when you and your team emerge, limping and faint, from another endless cave of poisonous Zubats and aggressive trainers. The strange existential panic when you use a thunder stone on your dainty Pikachu, so he may evolve into a hefty daddy Raichu. The game encourages you to evolve your Pok\u00e9mon, bench the weak ones, and do whatever you can to succeed. The weirdly intense emotional state this summons is not a result of the slow gameplay mechanics but a cumulative effect of the writing. The games are essentially road movies. You journey through different towns, dropping in on lives already in progress, stories already in motion. And like any road movie, the visitor is only ever told as much as he needs to know. There are no Super Mario-style \u201cFind the princess!\u201d prompts. You are asked, simply, to read the room. One visceral example of this is Lavender Town, which you experience as a vague, unfinished ghost story. You arrive in this small village. Something is obviously wrong. Nothing is growing, there are no water features, and a shrill, repetitive 8-bit tune plays. You learn that this is the home of the only Pok\u00e9mon graveyard. It is the first time we are introduced to the concept of death. We know Pok\u00e9mon \u201cfaint\u201d if they lose a battle, but healthcare being free and medication cheap, death is not something we\u2019ve had to confront yet. But now we know: Pok\u00e9mon die and they are mourned. That\u2019s not all. Something terrible has happened here, and recently. One of the characters explains: \u201cGhosts appeared in Pok\u00e9mon Tower. I think they\u2019re the spirits of Pok\u00e9mon that the Rockets killed.\u201d So Lavender Town is haunted because of a massacre led by Team Rocket, something we hear nothing more about. The Pok\u00e9mon games are full of stories like this: half-written, euphemistic, full of hints and easter eggs, and characters who allude to things that often never happen. For the first few hours of Pok\u00e9mon Blue and Red, you are led to believe that a big plot with a Clefairy is about to kick off, and it simply never does. It creates a sense that you are living in a vast, complex world full of lost tales and broken people. Take the gym leaders. These are the game\u2019s grimy local politicians, whose moods and preferences govern an entire region. The more you play, the more you read into their sad little lives. Brock\u2019s backwoods gym is so dull you can practically hear your rubber soles squeaking on the floor as you destroy his Onix. At Lt. Surge\u2019s deranged Electric-type gym you\u2019re forced to sort through trash before he\u2019ll even speak to you. Female-led gyms tend to be more elaborate \u2013 do they have to work harder to gain credibility? Is there inherent sexism in the gym leadership world? Maybe that\u2019s why Erica has more trainers than anyone else. Maybe it\u2019s a feminist thing. Maybe Erica is the AOC of Pok\u00e9mon. From the beginning, Pok\u00e9mon has encouraged this kind of close reading. Satoshi Tajiri, the president of Game Freak and creator of the franchise, began his career as a writer. He made a video arcade fanzine, also called Game Freak, which became hugely popular for its gamer tips and lists of easter eggs. In 1999, he gave an interview to Time magazine about the mysterious and elusive Pok\u00e9mon named Mew, which was added to Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue at the last moment as a hidden extra. \u201cThere were 150 characters, and Mew was number 151,\u201d Tajiri explained. \u201cIt created a myth about the game, that there was an invisible character out there \u2026 It kept the interest alive.\u201d For decades, fan theories about how to find Mew circulated through forums. Most speculation centred on a small truck parked near a ship named SS Anne at Vermilion Harbour. The truck is only accessible with the aid of some crafty trading with another player; for years, many players believed that Mew was hidden behind that elusive vehicle. The sparse storytelling has led to players filling in the gaps in other creative and fascinating ways. The world is mostly populated by children and elderly guardians, and your own father is absent. Lieutenant Surge, an Electric gym leader, alludes to combat, and is one of the few middle-aged men in the game. To many fans, the natural conclusion is that we are living a decade or so after a war so devastating that it claimed an entire generation of men. Suddenly, the lush forests, the free healthcare (didn\u2019t the NHS begin after the second world war, after all?), the societal emphasis on having strong Pok\u00e9mon who are willing to fight for you \u2013 it all makes sense. As a novelist, I\u2019m keenly aware that people won\u2019t commit to a story unless it engenders an ideological pact between writer and audience; it has to encourage us to fill in the gaps and overinvest emotionally. I would feel ashamed to undertake such a close reading of the Pok\u00e9mon games, if I weren\u2019t absolutely sure that these theories live in the hearts and minds of millions of fans who spent their childhoods starting adventure after adventure, each more or less identical and yet all filled with imagination. These fans are easy to find. All you need to do is whisper the magic words: \u201cI like shorts. They\u2019re comfy and easy to wear.\u201d Trust me, they\u2019ll understand. Caroline O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s second novel, Scenes of a Graphic Nature, will be published by Virago in June.",

Trade unionism will have to be completely reinvented: people are not just workers, but parents, carers, volunteers and consumers.

They are not really like that at all: large swaths of Labour\u2019s lost territory are smattered with trailblazing social projects, often run by women, with future-facing and often cruel local economies built around logistics and distribution. As old narratives of class and heavy industry have faded away in these places, some people have hung on to identities based on place and nation. Yet these are much more complicated than the caricature of stupidity and racism: witness the fact that a third of ethnic minority voters backed Brexit. The same problems afflict progressive parties across Europe, and even starting to address them will be a long and complex business. Trade unionism will have to be completely reinvented: people are not just workers, but parents, carers, volunteers and consumers. Socialists will have to become determinedly localist, and Labour will have to put the people who run towns, cities, counties and boroughs at the forefront of its campaigning, learning from what they do. Contrary to the laughable top-downism seen recently in Momentum offering its members a yes/no verdict on candidates its high-ups had already picked, the left will have to open itself up to the new world of citizens\u2019 assemblies and open primaries. It also needs its own national story that runs deeper than slogans about \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d, and a cleverer means of fighting the supposed culture war than repeatedly telling half the population they are bigots. All this would begin a shift in consciousness that is at least 40 years overdue. But first, if the precious values of equality and solidarity are to endure, some people on the left will have to do something that has never come easy: stare into their own crisis, and acknowledge that their party and movement are still stuck in the 20th century while their adversaries speed into the future. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

The former government minister Sir Mike Penning agreed to smart motorways\u2019 expansion but now he and other MPs will publish a report accusing Highways England of \u201ca shocking degree of carelessness\u201d in implementing them.

The world of professional sport is in mourning after Kobe Bryant, the US basketball legend, died in a helicopter crash at the age of 41. Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, is also believed to have died \u2013 she was among the eight others on board, and no survivors were reported. The helicopter crashed at 10am on Sunday near Calabasas, 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, in foggy weather. Bryant lived in the area most of his life and often used helicopters because of LA\u2019s heavy road traffic. Bryant played his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, having gone straight from school to the NBA instead of college. In that time they won five championships and he was named an All-Star 18 times. Bryant\u2019s reputation was tarnished in 2003 when he was arrested over rape allegations that he later settled out of court. Fans have been holding vigils to pay tribute. One of Bryant\u2019s fellow Lakers greats, Magic Johnson, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players.\u201d * * * Virus death toll jumps \u2013 China\u2019s premier has visited Wuhan as the country substantially raised its coronavirus death toll to 80, up from 56 on Sunday.

The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was flying to Beijing to discuss the outbreak with authorities. As China shuts down transport networks to try to limit the spread of the virus, some countries are preparing to help their citizens leave.

About 200,000 unseen documents, from private emails to phone transcripts and commercial agreements, will be released during 18 months of hearings examining decisions taken in the months and years before the fire, its immediate aftermath and the role of the UK government. This second phase will open with statements from lawyers for the architects, Studio E, the builders, Rydon and Harley Facades, Celotex, which made the combustible insulation, and Arconic.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s arts chiefs have said they want to create a nation that has better access to culture in every \u201cvillage, town and city\u201d by 2030, where creativity in each individual is valued and \u201cgiven the chance to flourish\u201d. Arts Council England (ACE) will publish a 10-year strategy on Monday called Let\u2019s Create, produced after 18 months\u2019 work including numerous workshops, consultations and public conversations involving more than 6,000 people. The strategy, which focuses more on broad-brush aspirations rather than specific statements about levels of funding or support for different art forms, is a new version of one published in 2010, Great Art and Culture for Everyone. The key differences in the new strategy include more emphasis on supporting people individually and at every stage of their life, championing a wider range of culture, and increasing spending and support for libraries. It also aspires to give communities in every \u201cvillage, town and city\u201d more opportunity to design and develop the culture on offer there. The strategy lists four principles guiding whether ACE will invest public money: \u201cambition and quality\u201d, \u201cinclusivity and relevance\u201d, \u201cdynamism\u201d, and \u201cenvironmental responsibility\u201d. The ACE chief executive, Darren Henley, said he wanted to move away from having centres of excellence in a small number of places and instead bring \u201cworld-class art and culture to people\u2019s doorsteps\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is setting out our intentions, how we want to see arts and culture in England over a 10-year period. It is not a flick of a switch, it is a journey we are going to go on with audiences, with people who work in arts organisations, libraries, museums and individual artists.\u201d Henley said it had not been developed \u201cby a bunch of bureaucrats sitting in a room on their own\u201d but after a long period of consultation with professionals, audiences and potential audiences. In the report, the ACE chair, Sir Nicholas Serota, uses the example of a 2016 nationwide arts project by Jeremy Deller and Rufus Norris, which he says encapsulates the aims of the 10-year strategy. The project, to mark the centenary of the first world war, involved hundreds of volunteers standing in uniforms, in silence, in places across the UK, representing soldiers who died on the first day of the battle of the Somme. Serota said it embodied boldness, collective creativity, partnerships \u201cand perhaps most important of all, the dissolving of barriers between artists and the audiences with whom they interact\u201d. The report lists a number of important issues requiring action. They include: Persistent and widespread lack of diversity across the creative industries and in publicly funded cultural organisations. Difference in understanding of the terms \u201carts\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d across the country, with many seeing the \u201carts\u201d as only the high arts. Big differences in cultural engagement, geographically and socioeconomically. Unequal opportunities for children outside school across the country. The often fragile business models of publicly funded cultural organisations. A retreat from innovation, risk-taking and sustained talent development. The report does not identify which areas or arts are likely to get funding changes, although Serota told the Guardian earlier this month that the east of England was likely to benefit more. A delivery plan for the strategy is expected in April. Most people working in England\u2019s arts sector will get their first sight of the strategy on Monday, although five arts policy experts last week pre-empted the report, which they said would contain \u201cvague generalisations\u201d and \u201carcane art-speak\u201d. Instead, Shelagh Wright, John Holden, John Kieffer, John Newbigin and Robert Hewison published, on the Arts Professional website, an alternative cultural strategy for England which calls on ACE to recover key values such as justice, trust, accountability and risk, \u201crather than rely on bland outcomes that are so obvious that no one could disagree with them\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Sun-kissed walkways in the sky, platefuls of seafood ceviche, a private helicopter pickup from the beach \u2013 the Instagram account of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels has unfolded like an escapist travelogue epic in recent weeks, as his adventures in Latin America have taken their place in his dizzying globetrotting itinerary. But there is one photograph he hasn\u2019t been so keen to share with his 730,000 followers: of him standing next to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s far-right president, with the uneasy smile of a man who\u2019s just secured his latest big commission from another unsavoury despot, in this case one who has boasted of being \u201cproudly\u201d homophobic. According to a statement from Brazil\u2019s ministry of tourism, Ingels visited Brazil to tour several states and discuss strategies for developing sustainable tourism on its north-east coast, in partnership with the N\u00f4made Group, which recently built an eco-conscious luxury resort in Tulum, the ruins of a Mayan walled city in Mexico. \u201cThey\u2019ve pioneered this incredible barefoot light-impact environment,\u201d says Ingels, speaking by phone from Santiago in Chile. \u201cIt\u2019s a model of tourism development that doesn\u2019t replace the forest or the sand, but strengthens and preserves it. It\u2019s a very welcome alternative to the kind of high-rise hotels that spring up on the beach in many places.\u201d Such an eco-conscious approach doesn\u2019t seem to chime with Bolsonaro\u2019s reactionary regime. Since he came to power last January, Brazil\u2019s president has confirmed every fear that he would be a \u201cTrump of the tropics\u201d. He has appointed climate-change deniers to prominent roles, dismissed deforestation statistics as fake news, and sacked the head of the institute that undertook the research. Last year, he played down the worst fires for a decade in the Amazon, calling the global outcry the result of \u201cdeceitful\u201d media hype. He once said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one, rails against Brazil becoming a \u201cgay tourism paradise\u201d, and his recent introduction of abstinence-based sex education has been likened to \u201cgoing back 40 years\u201d. So what is Ingels, self-styled seer of a progressive liberal world, doing with such a figure? \u201cI\u2019m happy to share the ideas and ideals that I hold with any government willing to listen,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially if they hold different beliefs. If there\u2019s a responsibility that comes from the creative platform we\u2019ve created, it is to use that platform to change the world for the better.\u201d He says that the political leaders of the north-eastern Brazilian states they visited are \u201cfrom the opposite end of the political spectrum\u201d to Bolsonaro, adding that ultimately \u201cgreat ideas transcend political parties\u201d. Over the last few years, Ingels has gone from being the mischievous young designer of mountain-shaped apartment blocks on the outskirts of Copenhagen, to becoming the go-to celebrity architect for some of the world\u2019s biggest corporations. Now 45, he has recently popped up as the face of everything from Hyperloop to WeWork, and is currently designing a city-sized HQ for Google in California. Then there\u2019s his actual city for Toyota in Japan, right under Mount Fuji.But most audacious of all, he tells me, is the masterplan he is now working on for the whole of Earth \u2013 provisionally titled The Masterplanet. His status as big tech\u2019s cheeky go-to boy is perhaps what also makes him so attractive to a growing client base of autocrats.

      "body": "<p>A record number of county court judgments were issued last year against individuals who fell into debt, double the level of eight years ago.</p> <p>Official figures released by the Registry Trust, which collects information on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, will be seen as further evidence of the \u201csevere financial strain\u201d on UK households.</p> <p>The data show that the number of county court judgments (CCJs) against individuals in England and Wales who failed to repay their debts climbed by 3% \u2013 or 30,138 \u2013 to 1.15m in 2019.</p> <p>The total is more than double the number in 2012, which was the last time that the figure fell. The Registry Trust report suggested the number of CCJs is likely to rise again in 2020.</p> <p>A CCJ is a type of court order in England, Wales and Northern Ireland issued against individuals if they fail to repay money owed, often because they have fallen behind with utilities and mobile phone bills, gas, and car payments.

      "bodyText": "A record number of county court judgments were issued last year against individuals who fell into debt, double the level of eight years ago. Official figures released by the Registry Trust, which collects information on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, will be seen as further evidence of the \u201csevere financial strain\u201d on UK households. The data show that the number of county court judgments (CCJs) against individuals in England and Wales who failed to repay their debts climbed by 3% \u2013 or 30,138 \u2013 to 1.15m in 2019. The total is more than double the number in 2012, which was the last time that the figure fell. The Registry Trust report suggested the number of CCJs is likely to rise again in 2020. A CCJ is a type of court order in England, Wales and Northern Ireland issued against individuals if they fail to repay money owed, often because they have fallen behind with utilities and mobile phone bills, gas, and car payments. Once an individual has a CCJ on his or her credit record, it can lead to problems obtaining a mortgage, credit card or other personal loans in the future. Mick McAteer, the chair of the Registry Trust, said the figures showed that a growing number of vulnerable households were facing severe financial strain. The increase comes despite low interest rates, which have reduced the cost of borrowing for most consumers. \u201cLow interest rates have cushioned the impact of debt levels on the typical household, but it conceals the fact that large numbers of more financially vulnerable consumers are facing real financial strain for a number of reasons,\u201d McAteer said. Real average earnings, which are still below pre-crisis levels when adjusted for inflation, are partly to blame, he continued. \u201cAusterity measures are still impacting on many households. They have not worked their way through the system and there is more to come.\u201d McAteer is a former board member of the Financial Conduct Authority. A CCJ is usually removed from the register if the debt is paid in full within one calendar month of the judgment date; otherwise it remains there for six years. Any company can apply for a CCJ against an individual if that person fails to repay money owed. But McAteer says organisations such as local authorities, utilities and debt collectors seem more willing to seek CCJs over smaller debts. Local authorities have been widely condemned for pursuing households over failure to pay council tax, although they use something called a liability order, not a CCJ. \u201cThe concern about local authorities is that because they are more aggressively enforcing debts, it is having a knock-on effect on households \u2013 ie it is making it harder to pay other debts which means they end up receiving a CCJ,\u201d said McAteer. The average value of debts chased through judgment filings rose 5% last year to \u00a31,506 while the median increased 14% from \u00a3592 to \u00a3672. \u201cWe have noticed another uptick on the average size of judgments in 2019, but generally the trend from the financial crisis has been that the number of judgments have risen but the average size of the judgments have really fell quite dramatically,\u201d McAteer said",

Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty. It carries sanctions for any \u201cbacksliding or half measures\u201d, as Michel Barnier\u2019s adviser Stefaan de Rynck pointed out last week in London. </p> <h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2> <p>We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is five days away from entering into a highly complex and potentially extensive set of negotiations with the EU, and from entering into quite an elaborate joint institutional architecture with the EU to manage the withdrawal agreement. But we know little in detail about how either of these are going to work on the UK side, in terms of institutions and process,\u201d says Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher with the Hansard Society.</p> <p>While business has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/21/business-leaders-urge-government-to-publish-aims-for-brexit-deal\">clamouring for the government to reveal</a> its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson\u2019s specific goals.</p> <h2><strong>How will the PM lead the next phase?</strong></h2> <p>Johnson is doing everything he can to expunge the word Brexit from the British lexicon. He has already reduced parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase, and his government has given only clues as to what the goals and red lines in negotiations will be.</p> <p>Negotiating mandates setting out wishlists and red lines are usually published by both sides before they enter into trade talks. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/26/brexit-uk-trade-talks-steve-barclay-eu\">Until Sunday</a>, when the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr that they would be published, it had not been clear that Johnson would do so at all.</p> <p>The prime minister is expected to give further clues in a keynote speech in the next fortnight, but parliament\u2019s involvement in approving the negotiating mandate was removed from the Brexit bill.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, the government seems to be planning to rely on normal mechanisms for ministerial accountability to parliament. These put the government in control of what information is made public and when,\u201d says Fowler.</p> <h2><strong>What about the cabinet reshuffle and Dominic Cummings\u2019 mooted Whitehall bloodbath?</strong></h2> <p>A reshuffle is expected in early February and some departments are expected to be axed. Barclay\u2019s Brexit department will close on Friday and there could be changes to the function of the Treasury, the Department for International Trade, the Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, continues to head a special Exiting the EU operation committee, known as XO, and is expected to continue to have a key role in the next phase.</p> <p>HMRC will be one of the key cogs in the Brexit chain as work must start urgently on the complex arrangements for Northern Ireland that will affect all businesses trading on both sides of the Irish Sea. Expect an early clash between the EU and Johnson, who has repeatedly claimed there will be no checks on goods, in contradiction of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>New border systems will be needed for the rest of the UK, and the EU and HMRC will be frustrated in designing them until the shape of the deal is known, possibly not until the summer. HMRC is short of key personnel and recently advertised for a deputy director to take charge of EU exit, who \u201cwill be responsible for providing the strategic direction for the project, delivering all the operational, communications and business changes needed in readiness for the UK\u2019s exit.\u201d</p> <p>A former head of HMRC has said it could take five years to get the sort of IT system proposed for Northern Ireland up and running.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/24/revealed-complex-post-brexit-checks-for-northern-irish-traders\">Revealed: complex post-Brexit checks for Northern Irish traders</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>When will negotiations begin?</strong></h2> <p>Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.</p> <h2><strong>Who will be negotiating for the UK?</strong></h2> <p>David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada\u2019s new deal with the EU.</p> <h2><strong>What about the joint committee?</strong></h2> <p>Under the withdrawal agreement, a joint committee of EU and UK representatives to oversee implementation of the treaty can sit from 1 February.</p> <p>While the powers of the committee are known, we know very little else.

      "bodyText": "There will be little official pageantry to mark Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union at 11pm on Friday. A clock counting down the last hour will be projected on to No 10 Downing Street, and Nigel Farage will host a celebration in Parliament Square where flagpoles will fly union jacks. But there will be nothing like the torchlight procession that marked the august occasion on 1 January 1973 when the prime minister Edward Heath was joined in Brussels by his predecessors Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home and a chorus of leaders from across the political divide to witness the accession of the UK into the European Economic Community. Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration. Does 31 January change anything? Yes. Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty. It carries sanctions for any \u201cbacksliding or half measures\u201d, as Michel Barnier\u2019s adviser Stefaan de Rynck pointed out last week in London. What happens next? We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say. \u201cThe UK is five days away from entering into a highly complex and potentially extensive set of negotiations with the EU, and from entering into quite an elaborate joint institutional architecture with the EU to manage the withdrawal agreement. But we know little in detail about how either of these are going to work on the UK side, in terms of institutions and process,\u201d says Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher with the Hansard Society. While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson\u2019s specific goals. How will the PM lead the next phase? Johnson is doing everything he can to expunge the word Brexit from the British lexicon. He has already reduced parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase, and his government has given only clues as to what the goals and red lines in negotiations will be. Negotiating mandates setting out wishlists and red lines are usually published by both sides before they enter into trade talks. Until Sunday, when the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr that they would be published, it had not been clear that Johnson would do so at all. The prime minister is expected to give further clues in a keynote speech in the next fortnight, but parliament\u2019s involvement in approving the negotiating mandate was removed from the Brexit bill. \u201cEssentially, the government seems to be planning to rely on normal mechanisms for ministerial accountability to parliament. These put the government in control of what information is made public and when,\u201d says Fowler. What about the cabinet reshuffle and Dominic Cummings\u2019 mooted Whitehall bloodbath? A reshuffle is expected in early February and some departments are expected to be axed. Barclay\u2019s Brexit department will close on Friday and there could be changes to the function of the Treasury, the Department for International Trade, the Foreign Office, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Michael Gove, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, continues to head a special Exiting the EU operation committee, known as XO, and is expected to continue to have a key role in the next phase. HMRC will be one of the key cogs in the Brexit chain as work must start urgently on the complex arrangements for Northern Ireland that will affect all businesses trading on both sides of the Irish Sea. Expect an early clash between the EU and Johnson, who has repeatedly claimed there will be no checks on goods, in contradiction of the withdrawal agreement. New border systems will be needed for the rest of the UK, and the EU and HMRC will be frustrated in designing them until the shape of the deal is known, possibly not until the summer. HMRC is short of key personnel and recently advertised for a deputy director to take charge of EU exit, who \u201cwill be responsible for providing the strategic direction for the project, delivering all the operational, communications and business changes needed in readiness for the UK\u2019s exit.\u201d A former head of HMRC has said it could take five years to get the sort of IT system proposed for Northern Ireland up and running. When will negotiations begin? Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February. Who will be negotiating for the UK? David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada\u2019s new deal with the EU. What about the joint committee? Under the withdrawal agreement, a joint committee of EU and UK representatives to oversee implementation of the treaty can sit from 1 February. While the powers of the committee are known, we know very little else. The appointments process, the size of the committee and how often it will meet has yet to be disclosed. One senior source said the committee would not be as influential as speculated. What about Northern Ireland? This remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said last week that the EU and the UK would have to be \u201cvery disciplined\u201d if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December. Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson\u2019s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory. Helen McEntee, Ireland\u2019s minister for European affairs contradicted him directly on Sunday telling Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge: \u201cThere will be no checks on the island of Ireland, we\u2019ve been very clear on this.\u201d Underneath the joint committee will be a specialised committee and working advisory group to establish the Northern Ireland protocol. Northern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up the working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly.",

Next Wednesday he is invited to a ceremony led by the European parliament president to say farewell to the British MEPs. On Friday 31 January, he will return the keys to his Brussels flat and hand in his MEP badge. Sitting in the airy atrium cafe in the Strasbourg parliament, he hopes he will be back in a different role. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of despairing because there is a whole world out there and if Britain wants to commit economic hara-kiri that\u2019s up to it. But the world moves on \u2026 The interesting stuff will still happen here. And that is quite exciting. \u201cGood luck, Britain. We will see where we end up.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "\ufeffBritish hopes of maintaining a post-Brexit flow of data with the EU, judged vital for security and the economy, have been thrown into doubt after a behind-the-scenes intervention from the Netherlands over Britain\u2019s record in protecting personal information. As the UK prepares to leave the EU at 11pm on Friday, it can be revealed that the UK\u2019s closest ally in the bloc raised concerns over the robustness of British checks and controls after a series of scandals, including abuse of an EU system for monitoring the movement of people at borders. According to a minute of a board meeting of the UK\u2019s Acro criminal records office \u2013 deleted from publicly available archives after the Guardian posed questions to the Home Office \u2013 the Netherlands made its issues with the UK known last year. The UK had been seeking to share criminal convictions data outside EU structures in the event of a no-deal exit but both the Netherlands and France declined to be involved. \u201cFrance are currently not engaging for political reasons, and Holland will not engage due to concerns around the UK\u2019s data adequacy status,\u201d the minute records. The doubts held by the Dutch over the UK\u2019s record offers compelling evidence that the current flow of data with the rest of the EU could be in peril. The European commission is expected to make a so-called adequacy decision this year to potentially allow Britain\u2019s security services and industry to continue to benefit from the transfer of vast volumes of personal data across Europe after Brexit. The political declaration \u2013 a document agreed by the EU and the UK as a guide to this year\u2019s negotiations on the future relationship \u2013 states that \u201cadequate protection of personal data\u201d is an \u201cessential prerequisite\u201d for \u201cenabling the cooperation envisaged by the parties\u201d. The member states will agree on the adequacy of the UK\u2019s protections of European citizens data by qualified majority, meaning that more than half of the member states must give their approval. This month the European parliament\u2019s justice and home affairs committee was provided with evidence of \u201cdeliberate violations and abuse\u201d by the UK of the Schengen Information System (SIS), an EU database used by police and border guards across the border-free Schengen zone. The British authorities had made \u201cunlawful\u201d full or partial copies of the database that were said by an EU report to pose \u201cserious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data\u201d. The Guardian has also revealed in recent weeks that the UK failed to pass on the details of 75,000 convictions of foreign criminals to their home EU countries and concealed the scandal for fear of damaging Britain\u2019s reputation. A police national computer error went undetected for five years, during which one in three alerts on offenders \u2013 potentially including murderers and rapists \u2013 were not sent to EU member states. The Home Office opted not to inform its partners due to \u201creputational damage\u201d. A Dutch government spokesman said: \u201cGiven the broad and comprehensive ambitious relationship that the Netherlands strives for with the UK in the field of internal security, there must be absolute trust in each other\u2019s practices and systems. \u201cThe SIS case only serves to underline this. Given its ambitions the Netherlands actively supports the commission\u2019s approach to achieve an adequacy decision with the UK on data protection in the field of security cooperation.\u201d The Labour peer Lord Kennedy of Southwark, who has pressed for a government inquiry into the latest data failings by the UK government, said: \u201cThis latest revelation is deeply concerning and highlights the complete loss of confidence other partners have in the UK in respect of data handling and our data adequacy in general. \u201cThe only people this sorry situation benefits is criminals.

Passes and keys must be returned. The British can apply for a limited number of diplomatic passes to the European parliament, but are unlikely to get routine access to other institutions.</p> <p>It will be a stark change for British diplomats, after decades of co-writing laws on the single market, wielding vetoes on taxation and driving forward EU foreign policy sanctions against rogue states. The British rooms in the council of ministers, where diplomats successfully strategised about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/08/david-cameron-eu-budget-gamble\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/08/david-cameron-eu-budget-gamble\">reducing the EU budget during all-night talks fuelled by Haribo sweets and Nespresso coffee</a>, will be left empty. </p> <p>But the British are not leaving Brussels.

The European flag flying at the door will be removed, a symbol of that change.</p> <p>Since 2016, the number of Foreign Office staff has increased by 50%, while UKRep as a whole now employs 180 staff from 20 different Whitehall departments. Some extra staff were taken on to prepare for the UK\u2019s doomed 2017 EU presidency, which never happened. Instead of Cameron\u2019s planned agenda to turbocharge the single market, they found themselves preparing for life outside the world\u2019s largest trading bloc.</p> <p>For some EU diplomats, Brexit day brings relief. One likened the last few years of twilight membership to a divorced couple living in the same house, sleeping in separate bedrooms.</p> <p>\u201cThis has been awkward for both sides,\u201d the diplomat said, citing a recent dispute over a road-tolls regulation, where the UK could have inadvertently blocked the law by abstaining (in the end the law failed for other reasons).</p> <p>\u201cEveryone will miss the British input but [after 31 January] the awkwardness is over, then it\u2019s a clean slate and we don\u2019t have either UK delegation sitting there or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/30/former-british-ambassadors-to-eu-condemn-uk-empty-chair-policy\">an empty chair</a>,\u201d a reference to Boris Johnson\u2019s policy of removing the British from EU meetings.</p> <p>For some 31 January is just another part of the British unwinding, as they look to turbulent negotiations ahead.</p> <p>\u201cIt is just another step that happens, it has been a long time coming,\u201d said another diplomat. \u201cThey had already left in [so] many ways that we will not notice the difference.\u201d</p>",

Technicians are working to update hundreds of webpages to update references to the UK, from updating technical points on EU law, to the educational output aimed at teachers and children, such as online quizzes and the commission\u2019s \u201cEurope and you\u201d activity book for children under nine. At the European parliament visitors\u2019 centre, miniature models of British MEPs are to be removed from mock-ups of the parliamentary chamber. Artwork from the UK government art collection, currently on display at the European commission, such as Sonia Boyce\u2019s screen print honouring black female singers, will remain on loan for the foreseeable future. The European parliament has no plans to rename its Winston Churchill building nor the Margaret Thatcher room. When British diplomats come to work on Monday 3 February, they will no longer be able to walk into EU buildings. Passes and keys must be returned. The British can apply for a limited number of diplomatic passes to the European parliament, but are unlikely to get routine access to other institutions. It will be a stark change for British diplomats, after decades of co-writing laws on the single market, wielding vetoes on taxation and driving forward EU foreign policy sanctions against rogue states. The British rooms in the council of ministers, where diplomats successfully strategised about reducing the EU budget during all-night talks fuelled by Haribo sweets and Nespresso coffee, will be left empty. But the British are not leaving Brussels. The UK government office in Brussels, currently known as UKRep, will be rebranded, as it searches for new forms of influence outside the meeting rooms. The European flag flying at the door will be removed, a symbol of that change. Since 2016, the number of Foreign Office staff has increased by 50%, while UKRep as a whole now employs 180 staff from 20 different Whitehall departments. Some extra staff were taken on to prepare for the UK\u2019s doomed 2017 EU presidency, which never happened. Instead of Cameron\u2019s planned agenda to turbocharge the single market, they found themselves preparing for life outside the world\u2019s largest trading bloc. For some EU diplomats, Brexit day brings relief. One likened the last few years of twilight membership to a divorced couple living in the same house, sleeping in separate bedrooms. \u201cThis has been awkward for both sides,\u201d the diplomat said, citing a recent dispute over a road-tolls regulation, where the UK could have inadvertently blocked the law by abstaining (in the end the law failed for other reasons). \u201cEveryone will miss the British input but [after 31 January] the awkwardness is over, then it\u2019s a clean slate and we don\u2019t have either UK delegation sitting there or an empty chair,\u201d a reference to Boris Johnson\u2019s policy of removing the British from EU meetings. For some 31 January is just another part of the British unwinding, as they look to turbulent negotiations ahead. \u201cIt is just another step that happens, it has been a long time coming,\u201d said another diplomat. \u201cThey had already left in [so] many ways that we will not notice the difference.\u201d",

On Sunday those dreams were shattered, when the helicopter she was travelling in crashed in Calabasas, California, killing all nine onboard, including her father, Kobe Bryant. The father and daughter were on their way to Bryant\u2019s Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks to take part in a tournament for young players on Sunday, according to the New York Times. Gianna, aged 13, was due to play in the tournament and Bryant was going to coach, CNN said. Gianna, the second of Bryant\u2019s four daughters, shared her father\u2019s love of the game. She hoped one day to play for the University of Connecticut and make it to the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association.

The official newspaper of North Korea\u2019s ruling party, the Rodong Sinmun, showed Kim Kyong-hui seated next to Kim and his wife, Ri Sol-ju, at a performance to mark the lunar new year at a theatre in Pyongyang on Saturday. Her name was also mentioned in a report on the event by the KCNA state news agency. Rumours that Kim Kyong-hui had been sidelined, or possibly executed, gained traction after her influential husband, Jang Song-thaek, was executed by firing squad for treason and corruption in December 2013. Days after Jang\u2019s death, state media named his wife as a member of the funeral committee for another senior official. But she was not present at a ceremony to mark the second anniversary, days later, of the death of her brother and Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, Kim Jong-il, and her name had not been mentioned in KCNA dispatches until Sunday. Some observers believed she had become a victim of a series of purges her nephew ordered in an attempt to rid the ruling party of potential rivals. Others speculated that Kim Kyong-hui, a heavy drinker, had died due to ill health.

      "bodyText": "The federal government is withholding millions of dollars from the New South Wales government for failing to complete water resource plans for the Murray-Darling basin. In a letter to the state\u2019s water minister, Melinda Pavey, the federal water resources minister, David Littleproud, raised concerns the 20 plans had not been submitted. \u201cI am disappointed these plans were not able to be submitted by the end of last year, given the many years over which New South Wales has had to develop these plans,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is not my intention to approve commonwealth expenditure to New South Wales related to the basin plan until there is demonstrated progress on water resource plans,\u201d the letter continued. The correspondence, first reported in the Sydney Morning Herald, is the latest example of ongoing tensions between the federal and NSW state governments over the basin plan. Late last year the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro, threatened that the state would pull out of the plan unless there were major changes and concessions for NSW. Water resource plans contain the detailed rules on water extraction in each valley. So far, plans submitted by Queensland and South Australia have been accredited and all Victorian and Australian Capital Territory plans have been submitted and are close to accreditation. The plans set new rules for how water is managed and shared during times of drought. The funding withheld includes $7.9m for NSW to complete floodplain harvesting work. Littleproud is also delaying expenditure of $48m for investment in metering, fencing and fishways meant to reduce the potential for the mass fish kills seen over the past two summers. The letter gives the NSW government two weeks to respond and suggests that lodging some of the less sensitive water resource plans would give the federal government confidence in the state\u2019s commitment to the basin plan. Last year the NSW government signalled it wanted a pause in the timetable for the water resource plans because of the ongoing drought. Pavey told the Sydney Morning Herald the government had been talking to Littleproud\u2019s office and wanted to submit the plans mid-year. \u201cThe funding goes to building the infrastructure projects to recover the last part of the plan put up by the states themselves, better compliance and improved fish-health through the recovery of A-class licences in the Barwon-Darling,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cThe law clearly sets out under the act that I am now compelled to write to minister Pavey and make clear what now needs to happen and that they have failed to meet the 31 December 2019 statutory deadline. \u201cMy strong preference is NSW get on with delivering the plans.\u201d Guardian Australia sought comment from Pavey. In response her office sent a media release from December last year, in which Barilaro said the state would not deliver the water resource plans because they \u201cdid not meet the expectations of our communities\u201d. The same statement says the state\u2019s threats to walk away from the plan \u201care not empty\u201d and that it will not contribute to an additional 450GL in water recovery.",

      "body": "<p>Federal and state ministers, police and Aboriginal art industry representatives will meet in central Australia next month to discuss ways to stamp out carpetbagging \u2013 the unethical treatment and exploitation of Aboriginal artists.</p> <p>The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the meeting would look at \u201cenforceable solutions\u201d including possible changes to the law.</p> <p>\u201cI would be very keen to amend the relevant legislation because we do have to protect a unique art style,\u201d Wyatt said.</p> <p>In November reports surfaced of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/05/frail-elderly-aboriginal-artists-allegedly-held-dealer-exploited\">elderly Aboriginal artists being \u201ckidnapped\u201d</a> and forced to paint for a dealer in Alice Springs.

      "bodyText": "Federal and state ministers, police and Aboriginal art industry representatives will meet in central Australia next month to discuss ways to stamp out carpetbagging \u2013 the unethical treatment and exploitation of Aboriginal artists. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the meeting would look at \u201cenforceable solutions\u201d including possible changes to the law. \u201cI would be very keen to amend the relevant legislation because we do have to protect a unique art style,\u201d Wyatt said. In November reports surfaced of elderly Aboriginal artists being \u201ckidnapped\u201d and forced to paint for a dealer in Alice Springs. Wyatt asked his National Indigenous Australians Agency to urgently investigate. The agency\u2019s advice, obtained under freedom of information legislation, said Wyatt and the arts minister, Paul Fletcher, could \u201csend a strong message that the Government is taking this longstanding issue seriously\u201d. It noted that the Northern Territory government had already given clear support for \u201cnational efforts to protect Aboriginal artists and to strengthen the Indigenous Art Code\u201d. The voluntary code, established in 2008, is designed to protect artists by getting dealers to commit to treating them fairly and honestly. Sanctions can be imposed on dealer members who have acted unethically. But the code has no power to regulate private dealers who are not members. Wyatt said it was not working. The NIAA advised that Wyatt and Fletcher had \u201cthe opportunity to make a real difference to unethical practices in the Indigenous art industry, especially carpetbagging\u201d by responding to the recommendations of the 2018 report on the impact of inauthentic art and craft in the style of First Nations peoples. It recommended that Wyatt press Fletcher to take early action to provide additional funding to strengthen the code and to evaluate industry practices. The NIAA advised that a mandatory code should be introduced \u201cif that review reveals few improvements in industry behaviour\u201d. The agency said it would continue to identify cases of unethical practices and take appropriate action, including by referring to appropriate authorities. Wyatt told Guardian Australia his discussions with Fletcher had been about \u201ca way in which we can set in place a system that really identifies authentic artwork in the first instance\u201d. The APY Art Centre Collective, which raised reports of carpetbagging with the minister in a letter supported by dozens of Australia\u2019s most prominent artists, said it was thrilled to have \u201cleadership in regard to this issue, which long overdue for attention\u201d. \u201cThis attention is heartening,\u201d said the centre\u2019s director, Skye O\u2019Meara. \u201cWe are happy to work hard to effect change and secure solutions needed in our industry but we can\u2019t do it without the committed support of government. We look forward to continuing our work with the relevant ministers.\u201d Wyatt said he was aware of artists being taken away from home to make them paint, and said his department\u2019s investigations had uncovered other unethical practices. \u201cIt\u2019s all of those matters that that group will consider, but it is my intention and that of Minister Fletcher to make sure that we deal with this issue.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The draft of a book by former US national security adviser John Bolton reportedly describes how Donald Trump told him about his determination to delay US military aid to Ukraine until its government agreed to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The explosive manuscript details the kind of material that Bolton could be expected to reveal publicly were he to be called as a witness in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial now going on in the US Senate. The account undermines Trump\u2019s claims that the delay in aid to Ukraine last summer and the president\u2019s efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate US Democrats were unconnected, the New York Times said as part of its article on Sunday night revealing the Bolton manuscript. The manuscript reportedly contains new details about the actions of senior cabinet officials including secretary of state Mike Pompeo, attorney general William Barr and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Bolton has been circulating the draft passages from his planned book to associates and has sent the manuscript to the White House for what would be a mandatory review process for someone who was in Bolton\u2019s position in the government before exiting the post last year, the NYT reported. The White House could censor the manuscript before Bolton\u2019s planned book is published. The Room Where It Happened is slated for publication on 17 March. As the president\u2019s defence team prepares to make its main presentations to the Senate on Monday and Tuesday, in the second week of Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, the details in the new report strongly bolster Democrats\u2019 case that there should be new witnesses called at the trial \u2013 Bolton first among them. Trump ousted Bolton in September last year after a widening gulf opened up between them on policy, with the then national security adviser particularly aggrieved at the president\u2019s apparent Russian sympathies. In a series of late-night tweets, Trump denied the claims attributed to Bolton. \u201cI NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cIn fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the ... transcripts of my calls with [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelensky are all the proof that is needed, in addition to the fact that President Zelensky &amp; the Foreign Minister of Ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems.\u201d Early on Monday morning, he added: \u201cThe Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify. It is up to them, not up to the Senate!\u201d Senate minority leader and New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, who is keen to force a vote on witnesses and pressure moderate Republicans into supporting the Democrats in this effort, took to Twitter on Sunday evening, saying: \u201cJohn Bolton has the evidence.\u201d Leading House Democrats acting as prosecutors in the impeachment trial said the new information reported from Bolton goes to the heart of the case against Trump. House Democrat and impeachment manager, aka prosecutor, Zoe Lofgren earlier on Sunday said the case against Trump is \u201coverwhelming\u201d, that he abused the power of his office and then obstructed Congress in its investigation, and that Senators should be prepared to deliver impartial justice. Trump is accused of undermining US national security by soliciting the help of a foreign government in his domestic 2020 reelection campaign. During the House\u2019s initial investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, the White House blocked senior aides from agreeing to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Bolton later said he would be prepared to testify if subpoenaed to appear in the Senate and tension has been building ever since over whether witnesses will be called in the trial and perhaps offer a damning inside account of Trump\u2019s allegedly corrupt dealings with Ukraine. This includes the president conducting policy in the country allegedly to serve his own ends by deploying his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pursue a parallel agenda to the State Department\u2019s foreign officials, which included destroying the career of highly-regarded US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was fired.",

Joseph loses it big time at work, walks off the job and, with his brain almost audibly pulsing with suppressed craziness, strides through the clamorous, uncaring London streets on an odyssey of chaos and confrontation.

Almost each individual scene \u2013 and arguably the film itself \u2013 is a surge, an oppressive swelling of the meteorological pressure in Joseph\u2019s head.

It\u2019s a shrewd depiction of the banal day-to-day unhappiness that Joseph lives with. Each body search that Joseph has to do at the security gates involves an unbearable official intimacy with a total stranger, one of whom is clearly disturbed; and, for an awful moment here, Joseph\u2019s own palpable instability is such that the audience can\u2019t be sure which is mad and which is sane.</p> <p>Violence or some sort of outbreak is clearly unavoidable, yet when the violence comes it seems almost indistinguishable in dramatic terms from the tense brooding prelude. Whishaw\u2019s performance is mostly a wordless anthology of flinches, tics, grimaces, periods of unsettling blankness, together with a bit of Henry-Portrait-of-a-Serial-Killer looking in the mirror. It would not have worked with an actor any less accomplished and charismatic than Whishaw. He certainly sells it hard.</p> <p>This is an intriguing essay in mood, but I felt that the feature-film length of Surge tests the material. Perhaps it would have worked better as a short film, based around the great opening scenes at the airport, with Joseph in his heartbreakingly drab uniform with the V-neck jumper and ID on a lanyard. There are times when Surge feels directionless: in his despair and near-madness \u2013 and desperate for five quid so he can buy an HDMI cable to fix Lily\u2019s TV \u2013 Joseph turns to a life of crime, doing no fewer than three bank stick-ups without ever having to deal with a police officer.

As a member of Team USA he won gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. His 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006 is the second-highest single-game total in NBA history.

Bryant and the center Shaquille O\u2019Neal led the Lakers to the remarkable feat of winning three consecutive titles from 1999-2002 \u2013 something accomplished by just two other franchises \u2013 and won two more titles between 2008-2010 after O\u2019Neal\u2019s departure. After his retirement, Bryant secured himself as a Los Angeles legend and one of the most iconic athletes in world history.</p> \n<p>His stardom reached well beyond Los Angeles, as he led the league in jersey sales five times over the course of his career and is believed to have sold more jerseys internationally than every NBA player except Michael Jordan. The son of Joe \u201cJelly Bean\u201d Bryant, who played in the NBA for eight seasons before becoming a star in Italy, Kobe Bryant was arguably the most worldly of any NBA star in history \u2013 he could confidently conduct interviews in Spanish and Italian \u2013 and was instrumental in raising the sport\u2019s international profile.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"062c2312-57aa-4337-8f9f-37875497348a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T_8Nyovwg4U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>His international popularity may have even dwarfed his national celebrity, as he was routinely met by mobs of fans \u2013 he once had to escape a reported 15,000 adoring supporters when landing in China for an appearance in the late 2000s \u2013 wherever he travelled.</p> \n<p>Within the game Bryant will be remembered as one of basketball\u2019s most ferocious competitors, tireless workers and demanding teammates. With an intense, often ruthless insistence on attention to detail and fundamental soundness, Bryant\u2019s mastery of basketball mechanics \u2013 proper defensive positioning, sound mid-range jump shooting and unparalleled toughness \u2013 made him one of the game\u2019s most admired players in an era dominated by Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan.</p> \n<p>Much of Bryant\u2019s appeal to aspiring athletes came from what he called \u201cThe Mamba Mentality\u201d, which Bryant famously described as \u201cif you see me in a fight with a bear, pray for the bear\u201d. His singular obsession with discipline, winning and enormous personality made him one of the most polarising players of his time \u2013 he endured public fallouts with O\u2019Neal, the coach Phil Jackson and several onerous contract negotiations with Lakers management. His public legacy was chequered by a 2003 sexual assault scandal, when a 19-year-old hotel employee accused Bryant of raping her in a hotel room. Bryant admitted to committing adultery and issued an apology to the accuser but denied the assault allegations. The criminal charges were eventually dropped and the parties settled in a civil lawsuit.</p> \n<p>What was never questioned was his devotion to the game of basketball, the admiration that he inspired across the league and the love he had for his four daughters, one of whom, Gianna, died with him, aged 13. He memorialised his career in his Academy Award winning short, Dear Basketball, and became one of the game\u2019s most vocal proponents in retirement.

      "bodyText": "Kobe Bryant, who died on Sunday in a helicopter crash in California at the age of 41, was one of the most accomplished players in league history, an 18-time All-Star, a two-time NBA Finals MVP and the 2007-2008 league MVP. As a member of Team USA he won gold medals at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. His 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in 2006 is the second-highest single-game total in NBA history. In his final game in 2016 he scored 60 points against the Utah Jazz, the most of any player in his last contest. On Saturday night LeBron James passed Bryant to become the third all-time leading scorer in league history, which Bryant celebrated with a tweet congratulating his former opponent and Olympic teammate. A titanic figure who inspired a generation of basketball players nationally and internationally, Bryant made his debut in 1996 at 18 and played 20 seasons for the Lakers before retiring. Bryant and the center Shaquille O\u2019Neal led the Lakers to the remarkable feat of winning three consecutive titles from 1999-2002 \u2013 something accomplished by just two other franchises \u2013 and won two more titles between 2008-2010 after O\u2019Neal\u2019s departure. After his retirement, Bryant secured himself as a Los Angeles legend and one of the most iconic athletes in world history. His stardom reached well beyond Los Angeles, as he led the league in jersey sales five times over the course of his career and is believed to have sold more jerseys internationally than every NBA player except Michael Jordan. The son of Joe \u201cJelly Bean\u201d Bryant, who played in the NBA for eight seasons before becoming a star in Italy, Kobe Bryant was arguably the most worldly of any NBA star in history \u2013 he could confidently conduct interviews in Spanish and Italian \u2013 and was instrumental in raising the sport\u2019s international profile. His international popularity may have even dwarfed his national celebrity, as he was routinely met by mobs of fans \u2013 he once had to escape a reported 15,000 adoring supporters when landing in China for an appearance in the late 2000s \u2013 wherever he travelled. Within the game Bryant will be remembered as one of basketball\u2019s most ferocious competitors, tireless workers and demanding teammates. With an intense, often ruthless insistence on attention to detail and fundamental soundness, Bryant\u2019s mastery of basketball mechanics \u2013 proper defensive positioning, sound mid-range jump shooting and unparalleled toughness \u2013 made him one of the game\u2019s most admired players in an era dominated by Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan. Much of Bryant\u2019s appeal to aspiring athletes came from what he called \u201cThe Mamba Mentality\u201d, which Bryant famously described as \u201cif you see me in a fight with a bear, pray for the bear\u201d. His singular obsession with discipline, winning and enormous personality made him one of the most polarising players of his time \u2013 he endured public fallouts with O\u2019Neal, the coach Phil Jackson and several onerous contract negotiations with Lakers management. His public legacy was chequered by a 2003 sexual assault scandal, when a 19-year-old hotel employee accused Bryant of raping her in a hotel room. Bryant admitted to committing adultery and issued an apology to the accuser but denied the assault allegations. The criminal charges were eventually dropped and the parties settled in a civil lawsuit. What was never questioned was his devotion to the game of basketball, the admiration that he inspired across the league and the love he had for his four daughters, one of whom, Gianna, died with him, aged 13. He memorialised his career in his Academy Award winning short, Dear Basketball, and became one of the game\u2019s most vocal proponents in retirement. He became central in the development of his daughter Gianna\u2019s career, serving as a coach and mentor to her teams and emerged as a major influence in women\u2019s basketball.Gianna is the second of his four daughters, between Natalia, 17, three-year-old Bianka and seven-month-old Capri. Bryant routinely visited the WNBA\u2019s Los Angeles Sparks as an informal advisor and worked with other women at all levels of basketball. One of the last viral photos of Bryant was him offering pointers to Gianna, herself a promising teenage prospect, during a game last month. \u201cPeople need to follow Kobe\u2019s lead and I\u2019m not just talking about NBA players,\u201d Sparks star Chiney Ogwumike told the Los Angeles Times in May. \u201cA lot of men tend to speak on [women\u2019s basketball] without knowing it and a lot of men tend to be ignorant about women\u2019s basketball players. But \u2026 I bet you would want your daughter to play in the WNBA if she\u2019s good at basketball.

Grand slam champions in 2019, with 45 tries scored and a points difference of 233, Simon Middleton\u2019s team also had the best individual players. The fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean scored the most points and the wing Jessica Breach the most tries (there was no female player of the tournament; that accolade will be introduced for the first time this year). Since then England have enjoyed a dominant autumn and can also boast they have the world\u2019s best player in their ranks: Emily Scarratt, who received that accolade in November.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s hardline approach to justice will not cut crime and will only pile pressure on overstretched prisons, expert campaigners have said, as research reveals life sentences have already risen sharply. The Prison Reform Trust issued the stark warning just days after the government unveiled proposals to lock up some serious violent and sexual offenders for longer by scrapping automatic release halfway through a jail sentence. Offenders serving standard determinate sentences of seven years or more, where the maximum sentence is life, will be released at the two-thirds point, rather than halfway, under the changes unveiled last week. Introducing a new report, the Prison Reform Trust director, Peter Dawson, said the government was looking in the wrong places to restore confidence in the justice system. He said: \u201cLonger sentences haven\u2019t improved public confidence or safety before, and they won\u2019t now. But they have helped produce a prison system that fails to deliver either safety or rehabilitation. \u201cGood soundbites don\u2019t always make good policy \u2013 a coherent plan for reform is long overdue.\u201d Researchers suggest England and Wales are already tougher on punishing serious crime than other countries. Prof Ben Crewe and Dr Susie Hulley, from the University of Cambridge, and Dr Serena Wright, from Royal Holloway, University of London, found a dramatic increase in the number of people serving life sentences. According to the findings, fewer than 100 people a year were handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years in England and Wales between 2000 and 2003. By 2008, this had risen to 249 adults and as of September 2019, 1,872 life sentence prisoners had tariffs of more than 20 years. Last year, there were also 880 serving a minimum of 25 years and 291 with a tariff of more than 30, excluding those serving the whole-life tariff who are unlikely to ever be released. The findings of the report indicate there was no clear evidence that the latest rise in lengths of tariffs is linked to changes in the nature or severity of offending. The research claims growing numbers of people serving long sentences will mean prisons are likely to remain overcrowded for the foreseeable future. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cUnder this government, serious violent and sexual offenders will spend more time where they belong \u2013 behind bars. We are spending \u00a32.75bn on transforming and modernising the estate, including creating 10,000 additional prison places.\u201d",
