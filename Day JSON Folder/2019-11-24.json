And it means consuming fewer chips, lollies and soft drinks. Tools such as the <a href=\"https://my.totalwellbeingdiet.com/healthy-diet-score\" rel=\"nofollow\">CSIRO Healthy Diet Score</a> can show you how you measure up.</p> <p><strong>3.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese government used technology to expand its campaign against Uighurs and other Muslim minorities far beyond the country\u2019s own borders, a rare leak from the heart of the country\u2019s bureaucracy reveals. Beijing\u2019s obsession with foreign influence and connections in its western Xinjiang region, where at least a million people are held in internment camps, is laid out in the China Cables, a cache of files that includes classified orders to track and detain thousands of people who have dual nationality, have spent time abroad or have personal ties outside the country. Among the documents are four \u201cbulletins\u201d that provide rare confirmation from inside the state apparatus of the scope and aims of the hi-tech surveillance system. The documents date from 2017 and were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which shared them with the Guardian, the BBC and 15 other media partners. Experts who have reviewed them believe them to be authentic. They highlight the power and reach of China\u2019s surveillance dragnet, which combines data scooped up from automated online monitoring, with information collected in more old-fashioned ways, by officials who use an app to input it by hand. The Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), combines all this information in a detailed database of everything from an individual\u2019s exact height and electricity use, to the colour of their car, whether they socialise with neighbours and even if they prefer to use the front or back door to their house. The Xinjiang Bureau of Public Security began posting procurement notices mentioning IJOP in 2016, although its use as a predictive policing tool was made public only in early 2018, in a report from Human Rights Watch.

That rate of detentions, if matched across the region and continued over time, would explain how hundreds of thousands of people have been swept into camps already. There is massive capacity to monitor online activity; another bulletin says that authorities identified 1.8 million users of a file-sharing app known as Zapya (or Kuai Ya in China), and then worked on the user-base information to identify thousands who were considered suspicious and flagged up for further checks. Online data comes in part from the monitoring software everyone in the region is obliged to install on their phones \u2013 with police checkpoints regularly scanning for the obligatory app. \u201cThe Chinese have bought into a model of policing where they believe that through the collection of large-scale data, run through artificial intelligence \u2026 they can in fact predict ahead of time where possible incidents might take place,\u201d said James Mulvenon, an expert in the verification of Chinese government documents who serves as the director of intelligence integration at SOS International. \u201cThen they are pre-emptively going after those people using that data, before they\u2019ve even had a chance to actually commit the crime.\u201d The documents also give an insight into how China considers any foreign connection a cause for suspicion, and is pushing its campaign across national borders. Uighurs with dual nationality living in China, including British and Australian citizens, have been identified and counted. Orders state they are to be deported or rounded up. Officials are asked to \u201canalyse\u201d and track more than 1,500 dual nationals and over 4,000 people who had applied for official documents at Chinese embassies and consulates around the world. Muslims in Xinjiang with contacts outside China, whether through marriage, work or education, have already reported being targets of Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown. Uighurs living abroad have described attempts to lure them home, often through requests from relatives, or to pressure them into spying on neighbours. Those who return to China frequently disappear into the camps. Dual nationals have been rounded up and detained, despite protests from foreign relatives, or diplomats representing their second nationality. Those in Xinjiang are questioned about relatives in other countries, and communication with loved ones abroad has ground to a virtual halt. The bulletins to security officials across the region, headed \u201ccommand for cracking down and assaulting on the front lines\u201d, order them to investigate anyone originally from Xinjiang who has got a second passport, or picked up any kind of identity documents \u2013 which could cover birth and marriage certificates, passport renewal or passports for children \u2013 from Chinese embassies. By June 2017, China had identified 1,535 Xinjiang natives with second passports, and 4,341 people who had \u201cobtained identity documents\u201d in Chinese embassies, according to one bulletin entitled \u201cBackflow prevention\u201d. Of these, 75 are dual nationals thought to be active inside China. They include 23 Australians, two UK citizens, 26 Turkish nationals, and a handful from other countries including Sweden, the US and Canada. The bulletin suggests targeting of these people took place without any requirement to notify diplomats from their second country, matching the accounts of former inmates. China considers anyone who has not explicitly renounced their Chinese nationality to still be a citizen. The 75 individuals are to be subjected to identity verification \u201cone by one\u201d. Those with a second passport, who have renounced Chinese citizenship, are to be deported. \u201cFor those who haven\u2019t cancelled their [Chinese] citizenship yet, and for whom suspected terrorism cannot be ruled out, they should first be placed into concentrated education and training and examined,\u201d the bulletin says. Those who contact embassies while abroad, it states, should be flagged for border checks on their return. The use of diplomatic missions as weapons of surveillance and as part of the campaign has echoes of Saudi Arabia\u2019s campaign of persecution against dissidents, including the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered when he tried to pick up a document he needed for his marriage. Another bulletin notes how Xinjiang has been cut off from the wider world. \u201cWe have effectively curbed the momentum of domestic and foreign communication, daily domestic and foreign communication has dropped to less than 10 people,\u201d the bulletin said. It seems impossible that in a region of more than 22 million people \u2013 which has actively courted foreign investment including a Volkswagen factory and an NBA training camp \u2013 there are only 10 connections a day with the outside world. But even if the data is falsified or has unstated parameters, the bulletin gives a glimpse of the authorities\u2019 determination to sever communications, as well as a sense of the pressure Uighur communities abroad may be facing from Chinese authorities. The disclosures are likely to raise questions about Chinese embassies being used as bases of influence, and bolster the cases of Uighurs seeking asylum abroad. Germany last year announced it would halt all deportations of Uighurs to China after accidentally sending back a man who has since disappeared. But other countries including Pakistan and Turkey are still sending people back. China\u2019s embassy in London said in a statement \u201cthe so called leaked documents are pure fabrication and fake news\u201d and added: \u201cThere are no such documents or orders for the so-called \u2018detention camps\u2019. Vocational education and training centres have been established for the prevention of terrorism.\u201d It also said that \u201ctrainees could go home regularly\u201d, including to care for children, and that \u201creligious freedom is fully respected in Xinjiang\u201d.

The Guardian\u2019s Michael Billington called her return a \u201ctriumph\u201d and said she played the role \u201cwith just the right verbal hesitancy and moral evasiveness\u201d.

McKellen was presented with the editor\u2019s award for his tour of his autobiographical show to more than 80 theatres in the year of his 80th birthday, with all the proceeds going to theatres in need.

      "bodyText": "A Labour government would compel property developers to meet the costs of building at least 50,000 discounted homes, as part of a package of measures to help renters and first-time buyers, the party will announce today. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, has drawn up proposals to allow local authorities to use the planning process to force developers to build a certain number of properties to be earmarked for local first-time buyers. These would be sold at a discount of up to 50% to the local market rate, with the size of the reduction dependent on the gap between earnings and house prices in the local area - and the local authority could choose to target them at key workers such as nurses or teachers. Healey said in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency of Uxbridge, in London, where the average house price is \u00a3350,000, the price of new homes built in this way could be just \u00a3190,000. The properties would be earmarked as first-time buyer homes in perpetuity, and would have to be sold on at a discount to market rates. \u201cLabour\u2019s new discount homes will give hope to aspiring first time buyers on ordinary incomes who have been failed by the Tories over the past decade,\u201d Healey said. \u201cHousing should be for the many, not the few, so a Labour government will cut the price of a first home for working people and lock in the discount to help future first time buyers too.\u201d Labour made housing a key theme in its manifesto, published last week - and has already promised to build 100,000 council homes, and 50,000 social homes each year by the end of the next parliament. As well as increasing the opportunities for first time buyers, Jeremy Corbyn is promising to take on exploitative landlords: and he will announce on Monday that Labour would introduce a charter of renters\u2019 rights and a national \u201cproperty MOT\u201d to tackle squalid private housing. The Labour leader said he would introduce a legal requirement for landlords to complete an independent annual inspection to ensure homes were up to minimum standards. If landlords let out substandard properties or flouted the rules, they would face fines of up to \u00a3100,000 and be forced to repay rent to tenants, he said. Corbyn\u2019s close aides have been trying to broaden the general election debate beyond Brexit, where Boris Johnson has driven home his promise to leave the EU by the end of January in an effort to win over disgruntled leave voters. Labour said its research had found that tenants collectively pay more than \u00a310bn a year in rent to landlords letting out substandard homes. The party said that nationally one in four private rented homes were classed as \u201cnon-decent\u201d, meaning they are damp, cold, in disrepair or unsafe to live in. Labour\u2019s private renters\u2019 charter will be based on three key rights, including the right to an affordable rented home with increases capped at inflation and powers for further controls for certain high rent areas; the right to a secure rented home, with new open-ended tenancies, protecting tenants from unfair eviction; and thirdly, the right to a decent rented home, with new minimum standards, backed by a new annual property MOT and fresh local enforcement powers. A Labour government would introduce legislation covering the private rented sector in the first Queen\u2019s speech, the party said, and pass legislation within a year to enshrine the new charter of renters\u2019 rights. These would be enforced by primary and secondary legislation, new local enforcement powers for councils and government funding for renters\u2019 unions to allow tenants to organise and defend their rights, the party claimed. Corbyn said: \u201cLabour will be on the side of tenants and take on dodgy landlords who have been given free rein for too long. Real change means taking on those who exploit the housing crisis to charge eye-watering rents for substandard accommodation.\u201d Healey said: \u201cThe power imbalance in the private rental market is at the heart of our housing crisis, with rents eating up too much of people\u2019s pay, tenants afraid of eviction if they report problems, and families with children forced to uproot their lives at short notice. \u201cMany landlords provide decent homes that tenants are happy with, but the Conservatives have gifted rogue landlords the freedom to flourish. Labour will put bad landlords out of business.\u201d The Conservative party\u2019s record on housing has been seized upon by Labour as a potential weakness during the campaign. Two weeks ago, the National Audit Office disclosed that successive Tory governments have failed to deliver a single new \u201cstarter home\u201d despite promising to build 200,000 by 2020. Corbyn has promised a record-breaking affordable house building programme including 100,000 new council houses a year by 2024. Boris Johnson has announced measures to help first-time buyers and boost private house building, promising a 1m homes over the next five years.

The Conservatives claim their policy will cost the NHS \u00a3879m in 2023/24. </p> \n  <p>On <strong>increasing the number of police officers, </strong>Full Fact finds that the pledge would return the number of officers to almost, but not quite, the total there was in 2010. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of police officers in England and Wales fell by 20,752 - a 14% drop. But because the country\u2019s population has grown since 2010, the number of police officers per person has fallen by 19%. Recruiting another 20,000 police officers would therefore leave the number of police officers per person at least 6% lower than it was in 2010.</p> \n  <p>The phrase <strong>\u201cGet Brexit done\u201d</strong> appears in the Conservative manifesto 22 times, but Brexit is a process, not an event. The UK will stop being a member of the EU if Johnson\u2019s deal goes through, but negotiations with the EU on a future trade deal will take place across a transition period, during which time the UK will still follow EU rules and pay into the EU budget. Based on past deals, this may take years to negotiate. </p> \n  <p>On <strong>increased spending, </strong>the manifesto pledges \u00a33bn of extra day-to-day spending by the final years of the next parliament - a figure that looks considerably smaller than pledges from other parties. But these figures aren\u2019t necessarily comparable - the Conservatives did not include costings for every pledge in the manifesto; only for new spending announcements made since the election was called. So while the Conservatives plan to increase annual current spending by \u00a33bn compared to what\u2019s already been announced, the overall annual extra spend will be much higher than that. For example, the manifesto spending list omits its headline pledges on <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/education/14bn-spent-education/\">school funding</a>, <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/84bn-spent-NHS/\">the NHS</a>, and police officers.</p> \n  <p>Will Moy, Chief Executive of Full Fact, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In less than three weeks\u2019 time, voters will make a decision that will affect their lives and communities. We all deserve information that is accurate and honest, which is why we and others must fully scrutinise the promises made by our politicians.</p> \n   <p>Candidates and parties are asking voters for their trust for the next five years, and like the other main parties, the Conservatives can do more to meet the standards we expect. Over the next few days we\u2019ll be working with experts to scrutinise today\u2019s claims in depth.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T20:00:24.093Z\">at 8.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddac9268f080fd59fb168d7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T18:25:57.725Z\">6.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tax and pay analysis: Plans to raise minimum wage and end benefits freeze not new</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A glaring omission is an increase in the higher-rate income tax threshold, which could anger Tory voters. The prime minister appears to have concluded that this tax cut for the rich would prove an electoral mistake. </p> \n  <p>The triple tax lock is similar to Labour\u2019s promise not to raise income taxes, VAT and national insurance, although Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party will target the top 5% of earners. <br></p> \n  <p>Such constraints could be unwise if the government finds it needs to raise more money to fund public services.

The government has confirmed that six existing hospitals in England are being given \u00a32.7bn by 2025 as part of the programme - an upgrade rather than a fresh build.

According to the Sunday Times, defence chiefs are discussing plans to slash the size of the British Army amid fears they will face further cuts. But asked by reporters if troops would be cut, Johnson replied with a firm no.</p> \n  <p>It is correct, however, that the manifesto does not include a firm pledge to \u201cmaintain the overall size of the armed forces\u201d, as it did under Theresa May in 2017. The 2015 Tory manifesto pledged to keep the Army\u2019s strength at minimum of 82,000 but that commitment was dropped - with the Army hovering around 73,000.</p> \n  <p>The manifesto maintains the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid but does little to assuage fears that Johnson plans to alter the way in which the aid budget is spent. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T18:00:56.081Z\">at 6.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddabe108f080fd59fb1686b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/georgina-hayes\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T17:39:32.192Z\">5.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">IFS on Conservative manifesto: Lack of significant policy action 'remarkable'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> (IFS) has accused the Conservatives of pushing a \u201cfundamentally damaging narrative\u201d in promising more money for health, pensions and schools without raising the money in tax, NIC or VAT to pay for them. </p> \n  <p><strong>Commenting on the Conservative Party manifesto, Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. If a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable.</p> \n   <p>In part that is because the chancellor announced some big spending rises back In September. Other than for health and schools, though, that was a one-off increase. Taken at face value today\u2019s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that\u2019s it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in.</p> \n   <p>One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as prime minister Boris Johnson promised to \u201cfix the crisis in social care once and for all\u201d. After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward.</p> \n   <p>On the tax side the rise in the National Insurance threshold was well trailed. The ambition for it to get to \u00a312,500 may remain, but only the initial rise to \u00a39,500 has been costed and firmly promised. Most in paid work would benefit, but by less than \u00a32 a week. Another \u00a36 billion would need to be found to get to \u00a312,500 by the end of the parliament. Given the pressures on the spending side that is not surprising.</p> \n   <p>Perhaps the biggest, and least welcome, announcement is the \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d: no increases in rates of income tax, NICs or VAT. That\u2019s a constraint the chancellor may come to regret. It is also part of a fundamentally damaging narrative \u2013 that we can have the public services we want, with more money for health and pensions and schools \u2013 without paying for them. We can\u2019t.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddabcd08f087b800b6204da\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richard-partington\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T17:26:10.955Z\">5.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Business analysis: Company bosses likely to welcome this manifesto</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Johnson has not always had the smoothest relationship with business, given his infamous remarks about their Brexit concerns, though company bosses are likely to broadly welcome this manifesto. </p> \n  <p>The CBI said firms would be \u201cheartened by a pro-enterprise vision\u201d and praised the \u00a33bn national skills fund for training workers. But there are questions about the impact of Brexit for firms that are yet to be answered. <br></p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s decision to scrap the planned corporation tax cut has gone down badly with some Tory supporters. <br></p> \n  <p>Ever since the 1980s the Tories have argued business tax cuts boost the economy and swell the public purse. The headline rate of corporation tax has been slashed since 2010 from 28% to 19% and receipts have increased, but economists believe economic recovery and crackdowns on tax avoidance are the real reasons. <br></p> \n  <p>Britain also now has among the lowest corporate tax rates in the developed world. The prime minister has been told further cuts would have little impact beyond damaging the public finances, including from George Osborne\u2019s former special adviser, Rupert Harrison. Labour also has a sharply contrasting plan, promising to raise the headline rate to 26%, in a clear election dividing line. <br></p> \n  <p>A review of business rates could be a double-edged sword. Companies could save millions of pounds from reforms to a system widely regarded to be broken. Retailers in particular have lobbied hard for cuts, saying the tax is among reasons for shop closures and job losses on the high street. But councils have grown more reliant on business rates revenue amid cuts to central government funding. Further cuts present additional challenges.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddab86f8f080fd59fb16830\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T17:07:35.662Z\">5.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Conservative pledges: Australian-style immigration proposal is light on detail</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Along with \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, \u201cnorth London metropolitan elite\u201d and \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d has become well established in the lexicon of Brexiter bingo.

The prime minister will argue Britain and the EU are in close alignment, so precedents for lengthy trade talks do not apply.

Theresa May had originally envisaged two years of talks. Experts say that on average, it takes 48 months to negotiate any trade deal, while a deal between Canada and the EU took seven years. <br></p> \n  <p>The manifesto is further complicated by an aim to negotiate free trade deals with countries accounting for 80% of UK trade within three years. Talks with the USA, Australia and Japan are planned first, \u201cnegotiated in parallel with our EU deal\u201d.

When it comes to day-to-day spending, the Tory plan would increase the amount spent by just \u00a32.9bn per year by 2023-24, compared to \u00a382.9bn for Labour and \u00a362.9bn for the Lib Dems. </p> \n  <p>On these grounds, Labour would spend almost \u00a328 more than present for every pound the Conservatives promise, in the clearest attempt by the Tories to put clear blue water between Johnson and Corbyn. The differences are stark. </p> \n  <p>According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the plan would lift government spending as a share of national income a handful of places on the international league table for wealthy nations. Labour plan a German-sized state with spending around 45% of GDP, while the Conservatives aim to match the Netherlands at roughly 41%. Though modest in comparison to Labour, it would still mean the biggest increase in the size of the state under a Tory government since Harold Macmillan.</p> \n  <p>Johnson will hope the public believe Labour lack credibility with the public finances, with a boom-and-bust spending package to match. But it could backfire. The Tories could be charged with failing to credibly turn the page on a decade of austerity, while committing insufficient funds to tackle the climate emergency. The Tory manifesto therefore offers relative status-quo, versus fundamental reform. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ddaa96f8f083aa6d578a428\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T16:03:29.769Z\">4.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s Corbyn\u2019s full response to the Conservative manifesto:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson has launched a manifesto for billionaires.

      "bodyText": "The live blog will now be closing for the night. For a summary of the day\u2019s events, read my colleague\u2019s analysis: Artists, actors and musicians joined Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday night at the Labour campaign\u2019s arts launch in east London, to throw their support behind the party\u2019s manifesto. Emeli Sand\u00e9, MIA, Lily Allen, as well as the filmmaker Ken Loach were among the stars who attended the Arts for All policy charter launch at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Labour committed to put support for the arts \u201cat the heart of government\u201d, promising \u00a31bn of new investment in upgrading and building new libraries, museums, galleries and other arts venues. The party also promised to invest \u00a3175m a year in an arts pupil premium for primary school children, to launch a new \u201cTown of Culture\u201d competition, invest \u00a31bn in youth services, maintain free access to national museums and galleries, and introduce greater transparency in lottery funding. Research by the House of Commons library has shown that libraries, museums and art galleries across England have had their funding slashed by at least \u00a3640m since 2010. At the launch, MIA described Corbyn as \u201cthe last stand that England has got\u201d, adding that it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d to find another candidate who was \u201cnot corrupted\u201d to replace him as leader of the opposition should he fail to become prime minister. Loach, who directed the Bafta-winning film I, Daniel Blake, said Labour faced \u201cthe fight of our lives\u201d against the \u201cpublic school bluster\u201d of the Tories. Addressing the crowd, Corbyn said: \u201cI love the arts, I love theatre, I love art, music, I love the inspiration that it brings to all our lives. \u201cArts, music and culture are not separate from science, engineering and ideas. You need that inspiration in whatever you do. \u201cOur arts policy is to create a \u00a31bn arts fund, and that will ensure that the libraries, theatres, and the local arts facilities are improved and remain available for all.\u201d Referring to Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to reveal his Conservative manifesto pledges in Telford, near to where Mr Corbyn grew up, he joked: \u201cAre they trying to insult me or something?\u201d Read the Guardian\u2019s parliamentary sketch writer John Crace\u2019s take on the Conservative manifesto launch: Following Jo Swinson confirming last week that she would be prepared to use a nuclear weapon, Nicola Sturgeon writes for the Guardian on why she\u2019d never press the nuclear button. She writes: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that a willingness to kill millions is now seen as a virility test for leadership, and I want no part.\u201d Read it here: The independent charity Full Fact has scrutinised today\u2019s Conservative manifesto launch. On the cost of new nurses, of which the manifesto promises 50,000, Full Fact calculates that 50,000 extra nurses at pay band 5 (\u00a324,000 per annum) would cost the NHS \u00a32.8bn a year, when factoring in the costs of national insurance, pensions and training. The Conservatives claim their policy will cost the NHS \u00a3879m in 2023/24. On increasing the number of police officers, Full Fact finds that the pledge would return the number of officers to almost, but not quite, the total there was in 2010. Between 2010 and 2019, the number of police officers in England and Wales fell by 20,752 - a 14% drop. But because the country\u2019s population has grown since 2010, the number of police officers per person has fallen by 19%. Recruiting another 20,000 police officers would therefore leave the number of police officers per person at least 6% lower than it was in 2010. The phrase \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d appears in the Conservative manifesto 22 times, but Brexit is a process, not an event. The UK will stop being a member of the EU if Johnson\u2019s deal goes through, but negotiations with the EU on a future trade deal will take place across a transition period, during which time the UK will still follow EU rules and pay into the EU budget. Based on past deals, this may take years to negotiate. On increased spending, the manifesto pledges \u00a33bn of extra day-to-day spending by the final years of the next parliament - a figure that looks considerably smaller than pledges from other parties. But these figures aren\u2019t necessarily comparable - the Conservatives did not include costings for every pledge in the manifesto; only for new spending announcements made since the election was called. So while the Conservatives plan to increase annual current spending by \u00a33bn compared to what\u2019s already been announced, the overall annual extra spend will be much higher than that. For example, the manifesto spending list omits its headline pledges on school funding, the NHS, and police officers. Will Moy, Chief Executive of Full Fact, said: In less than three weeks\u2019 time, voters will make a decision that will affect their lives and communities. We all deserve information that is accurate and honest, which is why we and others must fully scrutinise the promises made by our politicians. Candidates and parties are asking voters for their trust for the next five years, and like the other main parties, the Conservatives can do more to meet the standards we expect. Over the next few days we\u2019ll be working with experts to scrutinise today\u2019s claims in depth. A glaring omission is an increase in the higher-rate income tax threshold, which could anger Tory voters. The prime minister appears to have concluded that this tax cut for the rich would prove an electoral mistake. The triple tax lock is similar to Labour\u2019s promise not to raise income taxes, VAT and national insurance, although Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s party will target the top 5% of earners. Such constraints could be unwise if the government finds it needs to raise more money to fund public services. Any chancellor could also be hamstrung in an economic downturn. The big promise to cut national insurance comes with a \u00a32.5bn price tag, according to the manifesto costing document. However, Johnson has been warned that an ambition to take the threshold all the way up to \u00a312,500 would come with an even heftier price tag of around \u00a36bn more - a figure missing from the five-year plan at present. Plans to raise the minimum wage are nothing new, nor is a promise to end the benefits freeze. It was always set to lift in 2020 after four years, though has caused significant damage, costing seven million families an average of \u00a3560 each per year. Guardian specialists break down the detail of the Conservative manifesto. Read our analysis on pledges from \u00a334bn extra for the NHS to the \u201cget Brexit done\u201d vow The manifesto promises a \u201ctransport revolution\u201d but not much of it is new and it was pot holes which made the headlines before the launch, with \u00a32bn pledged to filling them over the next four years. This is considerably more than the \u00a3500m allocated to a \u201creversing Beeching fund\u201d for railways, but to meet that promise experts say they will need more funds. It also dwarfs the money being pledged for infrastructure to support electric vehicles - \u00a3600m over six years \u2013 and an investment of \u00a3350m in cycling. The \u00a329bn investment in strategic roads sounds very like money pledged back in 2018 by the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, rather than new money, and does not appear in the costings document. The manifesto pledge on broadband confirms that the Conservatives have rowed back on a previous promise made by Boris Johnson to install full-fibre broadband to every home and business by 2025. That\u2019s been replaced by the promise of \u201cfull-fibre and gigabit-capable\u201d broadband, which is still ambitious but will be easier to achieve than the original plan and still provide faster speeds for consumers. The NHS has undoubtedly been the main domestic issue of the campaign so far, with attempts at spending one-upmanship between the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems and claims that a post-Brexit US trade deal would allow the NHS to be put \u201cup for sale\u201d dominating coverage outside of Brexit. But some of Johnson\u2019s key NHS pledges have proven to be problematic. The prime minister\u2019s claim that the government will build 40 new hospitals rapidly fell apart in late September, although the PM continues to push the misleading assertion. The government has confirmed that six existing hospitals in England are being given \u00a32.7bn by 2025 as part of the programme - an upgrade rather than a fresh build. Another 21 hospital trusts are being given \u00a3100m in seed funding to prepare a business case for their hospitals - but no money for any actual building work. The work would then start between 2025 and 2030. And on manifesto launch day, the pledge to recruit 50,000 nurses was immediately thrown into doubt when it emerged 19,000 of them would be \u201cretained\u201d staff and 12,000 would be from overseas. As he presented the manifesto, Boris Johnson moved fast to put to bed reports that troop numbers could be cut under a Conservative government. According to the Sunday Times, defence chiefs are discussing plans to slash the size of the British Army amid fears they will face further cuts. But asked by reporters if troops would be cut, Johnson replied with a firm no. It is correct, however, that the manifesto does not include a firm pledge to \u201cmaintain the overall size of the armed forces\u201d, as it did under Theresa May in 2017. The 2015 Tory manifesto pledged to keep the Army\u2019s strength at minimum of 82,000 but that commitment was dropped - with the Army hovering around 73,000. The manifesto maintains the commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid but does little to assuage fears that Johnson plans to alter the way in which the aid budget is spent. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has accused the Conservatives of pushing a \u201cfundamentally damaging narrative\u201d in promising more money for health, pensions and schools without raising the money in tax, NIC or VAT to pay for them. Commenting on the Conservative Party manifesto, Paul Johnson, IFS Director, said: If the Labour and Liberal Democrat manifestos were notable for the scale of their ambitions the Conservative one is not. If a single Budget had contained all these tax and spending proposals we would have been calling it modest. As a blueprint for five years in government the lack of significant policy action is remarkable. In part that is because the chancellor announced some big spending rises back In September. Other than for health and schools, though, that was a one-off increase. Taken at face value today\u2019s manifesto suggests that for most services, in terms of day-to-day spending, that\u2019s it. Health and school spending will continue to rise. Give or take pennies, other public services, and working age benefits, will see the cuts to their day-to-day budgets of the last decade baked in. One notable omission is any plan for social care. In his first speech as prime minister Boris Johnson promised to \u201cfix the crisis in social care once and for all\u201d. After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward. On the tax side the rise in the National Insurance threshold was well trailed. The ambition for it to get to \u00a312,500 may remain, but only the initial rise to \u00a39,500 has been costed and firmly promised. Most in paid work would benefit, but by less than \u00a32 a week. Another \u00a36 billion would need to be found to get to \u00a312,500 by the end of the parliament. Given the pressures on the spending side that is not surprising. Perhaps the biggest, and least welcome, announcement is the \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d: no increases in rates of income tax, NICs or VAT. That\u2019s a constraint the chancellor may come to regret. It is also part of a fundamentally damaging narrative \u2013 that we can have the public services we want, with more money for health and pensions and schools \u2013 without paying for them. We can\u2019t. Johnson has not always had the smoothest relationship with business, given his infamous remarks about their Brexit concerns, though company bosses are likely to broadly welcome this manifesto. The CBI said firms would be \u201cheartened by a pro-enterprise vision\u201d and praised the \u00a33bn national skills fund for training workers. But there are questions about the impact of Brexit for firms that are yet to be answered. Johnson\u2019s decision to scrap the planned corporation tax cut has gone down badly with some Tory supporters. Ever since the 1980s the Tories have argued business tax cuts boost the economy and swell the public purse. The headline rate of corporation tax has been slashed since 2010 from 28% to 19% and receipts have increased, but economists believe economic recovery and crackdowns on tax avoidance are the real reasons. Britain also now has among the lowest corporate tax rates in the developed world. The prime minister has been told further cuts would have little impact beyond damaging the public finances, including from George Osborne\u2019s former special adviser, Rupert Harrison. Labour also has a sharply contrasting plan, promising to raise the headline rate to 26%, in a clear election dividing line. A review of business rates could be a double-edged sword. Companies could save millions of pounds from reforms to a system widely regarded to be broken. Retailers in particular have lobbied hard for cuts, saying the tax is among reasons for shop closures and job losses on the high street. But councils have grown more reliant on business rates revenue amid cuts to central government funding. Further cuts present additional challenges. Along with \u201cthe will of the people\u201d, \u201cnorth London metropolitan elite\u201d and \u201ctake back control\u201d, \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d has become well established in the lexicon of Brexiter bingo. Nigel Farage has been banging on about the fabled approach for many years. Now the offer has reached the mainstream political offer, with the Tories\u2019 pledging to adopt the framework in the UK. It is unusual that the party has included this pledge before hearing back from the Migration Advisory Committee (Mac), which has been asked by the home secretary, Priti Patel, to review the feasibility of introducing an Australian-style points-based system in the UK. Beyond this, the detail remains light. The manifesto states that \u201cmost people coming into the country will need a clear job offer\u201d. This already deviates from the Australian system in that one of the key features of that approach is that a job offer is not required. What will points be issued for? The manifesto mentions English language and \u201cgood education\u201d - the Australian system is far more complex. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has criticised the Conservative manifesto pledge on 50,000 extra nurses. Of the 50,000, 12,000 would come from abroad, 14,000 would be new undergraduate students, 5,000 would do degree apprenticeships and 19,000 are nurses who would otherwise have left the profession, but who the Conservatives hope to \u201cretain\u201d. \u201cThe Conservatives\u2019 claim on nurses is frankly deceitful \u2013 the sums simply don\u2019t add up. First we had Johnson\u2019s fake 40 new hospitals, now we have his fake 50,000 extra nurses\u2019,\u201d said Ashworth. Matt Hancock and Tory ministers forced through the abolition of the bursary partly causing the nursing crisis afflicting our NHS today. The new damaging Tory nurses\u2019 tax on European nurses will make it impossible to deliver the nurses our NHS needs. Labour will deliver over 50,000 new nurses through bringing back the bursary and allowing ethical international recruitment. As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and we\u2019ll post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Tomorrow, the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, will answer your questions about the Tory manifesto, campaign and policies, just how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you. You can ask your question via our form here. The central mantra of \u201cget Brexit done\u201d runs through the Tory manifesto like a stick of rock, but there are major questions about how oven-ready Johnson\u2019s plan really is. The document commits to negotiating a trade deal with the EU next year, and not to extend the implementation period beyond December 2020 - effectively leaving the prospect of a disruptive no-deal Brexit firmly on the table. Johnson could argue this strengthens his hand with Brussels, but leading trade experts warn that international agreements are fiendishly complex and can take several years to conclude. The prime minister will argue Britain and the EU are in close alignment, so precedents for lengthy trade talks do not apply. But there are risks to his approach. Talks cannot legally begin until the UK leaves the EU, currently scheduled for 31 January - leaving only 11 months to strike a deal to avoid no-deal Brexit. Theresa May had originally envisaged two years of talks. Experts say that on average, it takes 48 months to negotiate any trade deal, while a deal between Canada and the EU took seven years. The manifesto is further complicated by an aim to negotiate free trade deals with countries accounting for 80% of UK trade within three years. Talks with the USA, Australia and Japan are planned first, \u201cnegotiated in parallel with our EU deal\u201d. But experts say priorities will need to be made, as a deal with one trade partner could affect what can be negotiated with another. The recipe for Johnson\u2019s oven-ready Brexit plan extends far beyond this election, to the end of 2020 and beyond. And this from our media editor, Jim Waterson. This from the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason. The Tories\u2019 toughened stance on law and order is by now well-known, with Boris Johnson making his pledge to recruit 20,000 police officers one of the first he made as prime minister. Increased use of stop-and-search, longer sentences for some violent and sex offenders, and creating 10,000 new prison places are all in there. However, much of what they\u2019ve proposed goes against the evidence of what works when attempting to reduce crime and reoffending. Experts warn stop and search entrenches knife crime. The government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy states that violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d, low educational attainment, poor health, unemployment and more. Short prison sentences, which were close to being scrapped before Johnson took office, are proven to be ineffective. The Tories are getting tough on crime without being so tough on \u2013 or interested in \u2013 its causes. Some more criticism of the failure of the Tory manifesto to address the crisis in social care. And on what appears to be a lack of money for their Northern Powerhouse rail pledge, from the political editor of the Manchester Evening News. The Conservatives are offering a fraction of what the other leading opposition parties are proposing. When it comes to day-to-day spending, the Tory plan would increase the amount spent by just \u00a32.9bn per year by 2023-24, compared to \u00a382.9bn for Labour and \u00a362.9bn for the Lib Dems. On these grounds, Labour would spend almost \u00a328 more than present for every pound the Conservatives promise, in the clearest attempt by the Tories to put clear blue water between Johnson and Corbyn. The differences are stark. According to the Resolution Foundation thinktank, the plan would lift government spending as a share of national income a handful of places on the international league table for wealthy nations. Labour plan a German-sized state with spending around 45% of GDP, while the Conservatives aim to match the Netherlands at roughly 41%. Though modest in comparison to Labour, it would still mean the biggest increase in the size of the state under a Tory government since Harold Macmillan. Johnson will hope the public believe Labour lack credibility with the public finances, with a boom-and-bust spending package to match. But it could backfire. The Tories could be charged with failing to credibly turn the page on a decade of austerity, while committing insufficient funds to tackle the climate emergency. The Tory manifesto therefore offers relative status-quo, versus fundamental reform. Here\u2019s Corbyn\u2019s full response to the Conservative manifesto: Boris Johnson has launched a manifesto for billionaires. They bought it and you\u2019ll pay for it. After a decade of the Conservatives cutting our NHS, police and schools, all Boris Johnson is offering is more of the same: more cuts, more failure, and years more of Brexit uncertainty. Boris Johnson can\u2019t be trusted. Older people face a triple whammy as he has failed to protect free TV licences for over 75s, refused to grant justice to women unfairly affected by the increase in the state pension age, and not offered a plan or extra money to fix the social care crisis. In contrast, Labour\u2019s manifesto is full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation. The pledge for more money for schools was first made in the summer but no cash was forthcoming straight away. The schools budget was already set to rise by \u00a31bn a year by 2023 due to an increase in the number of students, and it\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s included in the \u00a314bn. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that because student numbers are set to rise, and once inflation is taken into account. The extra money for schools adds up to a 7.4% real terms increase in spending per pupil between 2019-20 and 2022-23. This is less than the 8% it has worked out would be needed to reverse cuts in funding since 2009-10. The Conservative offer on childcare is less generous than Labour\u2019s \u2013 it does not explicitly promise free childcare for younger children, and it is unclear how money from the \u00a31bn fund would be allocated. Unions have responded to the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto and are, predictably, unimpressed. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said: Tinkering around the edges offers nothing for those in our deindustrialised heartlands, or for those who voted Leave and are thinking of voting Tory or for their Brexit Party bedfellows. There\u2019s nothing in it for young people, for pensioners, for nurses, for teachers, for car workers, for public sector workers. The Tories will do nothing to rebuild our manufacturing industries or stop the abuses of migrant workers by greedy bosses who use them to undercut pay and conditions. Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said: This wafer thin offering from the Tories stands in stark contrast to Labour\u2019s comprehensive and fully costed manifesto to reboot Britain. No serious party would come to the table with so little to say, and on Brexit, Johnson just sounds like a scratched record. He may not be aware but the Tories have been promising to get Brexit done for over three years. Saying it time and time again won\u2019t make it happen and simply makes him look like even more of an Eton-educated buffoon. Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: No-one should be fooled by the promises for the NHS and public sector. For the past nine years the Tories have slashed funding and let services slide. Now they are trumpeting a reversal of their own bungled policy of scrapping the nursing bursary - a problem of their own making. Social care needs a massive investment and the amounts they propose would barely make a dent. The call for higher wages will ring hollow to the millions of people who have seen their wages frozen under the Conservatives. Jeremy Corbyn has responded to the launch of the Conservative party manifesto, pointing out that they chose Shropshire \u2013 his home county \u2013 to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s a manifesto paid for by billionaires, written for billionaires, and will be delivered for billionaires but the problem is the rest of us will have to pay for it,\u201d he said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been speaking to the BBC about the manifesto. One of the new announcements of the day was a commitment to deliver 50,000 new nurses and the return of the nurse bursary. He was asked about whether his party was wrong to cut nurse bursaries. \u201cOne of the things about coming in as a relatively new health secretary with a new prime minister is that you can review things and work out what is the best way to go forward,\u201d he said. Asked about why there isn\u2019t a full policy proposal on social care, he says their plan comes in three parts: to put more money into the system as it is now, to find a cross party consensus (\u201cyou can only solve a long-term problem like this with a cross-party consensus), and guaranteeing that people won\u2019t have to sell their home to pay for their care. Hancock is asked if he is open to the idea of making social care free at the point of use and funded by tax-payers. That idea fits with our commitment that people wouldn\u2019t have to sell their home to pay for their care ... but I don\u2019t want to say anything more than that because I don\u2019t want to put down further red lines, if you like, other than those we\u2019ve set out in this document, because we are absolutely determined \u2013 if we are returned with a majority \u2013 immediately after the election to get on and get stuck into building that consensus for a solution that the whole country can get behind. BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham has a link to a pdf of the Tory manifesto. You can have a read here. The Conservative party doesn\u2019t seem to have published the manifesto online yet. This is from Huffington Post\u2019s Paul Waugh, who is at the launch and has a hard copy. Paul Johnson from the Institute for Fiscal Studies has been talking to the BBC. He said that the claim that the Conservatives were promising the biggest ever \u201ccash boost to the NHS\u201d was \u201cbroadly true\u201d in cash terms, but not in real terms, so was \u201cmisleading\u201d. \u201cOnce you take into account the fact that spending is a lot higher than it was in the past, it\u2019s not such a big increase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a substantial increase. It\u2019s bigger than we\u2019ve seen over the past 10 years, but it\u2019s not in line, actually, with what the NHS got in the past 40 or 50 years.\u201d He said that the big increases in spending in the manifesto were already announced in the last spending round. \u201cWhat this seems to imply is that outside of schools and hospitals there\u2019s not going to be much to go around in the remaining four years of parliament,\u201d he said. A lot of the cuts we\u2019ve seen in justice and local government \u201care pretty much baked in if you take this manifesto at face value\u201d. Here are some more points from the manifesto: A Conservative government would get rid of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. They would aim to have 80% of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years. The party would increase the defence budget by at least 0.5%. They would ensure workers have the right to request a more more predictable contract. Mortgage lending rules that came in after the crash are designed to stop people taking on loans they could struggle to repay in future, but the Conservatives appear to be saying they would make changes to free-up lending. Fixing interest rates offsets some of the risk, but if prices fall there will be more people at risk of negative equity. Previous attempts by lenders to offer long-term fixed-rate mortgages have failed, so this would need a big change in the market and homebuyers\u2019 attitudes. A big problem with cutting deposits for first-time buyers is it is likely to fuel demand for homes without tackling the supply-side problems. Renters will be pleased with the pledges on no-fault evictions, and lifetime deposits, but social housing will be lost with the maintenance of right-to-buy. The Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, asks about the Conservative party\u2019s decision to change one of its Twitter pages to resemble a fact-checking site during the first leaders\u2019 debate \u201cI haven\u2019t followed this Twitter stuff with the attention you would like, Rowena,\u201d he says. \u201cI will apprise myself of the detail of this\u201d. He then changes the subject to attacking Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to remain neutral on any second EU referendum. Asked why a pledge to lift the higher rate income tax threshold \u2013 which he promised in his leadership campaign \u2013 is not in the manifesto, Johnson says: \u201cI haven\u2019t lost my tax-cutting zeal.\u201d He says it\u2019s \u201cimportant to focus tax cuts where people need them most\u201d. The Daily Mail\u2019s political editor asks him why there is no big plan to deal with the pressures on social care in the manifesto. Johnson repeats the line \u2013 used by cabinet ministers over the last few days - that they will be reaching out to other parties to find a way to address the problem. He promises that nobody will have to sell their home to fund their care. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn asks about maintaining troop numbers. Johnson interrupts him to say they would not cut the armed services. He says there is a \u201csharp distinction\u201d between his position and that of the leader of the opposition. He responds to a question about fiscal discipline and he says \u201cwe are doing this sensibly\u201d and that a Conservative government would be bringing debt down. A journalist from the Shropshire Star asks about the A&amp;E department in Telford. \u201cWe will certainly make sure the A&amp;E in Telford is kept open,\u201d says Johnson. He says that he is sure the health secretary, Matt Hancock, would be happy to talk to the reporter about it afterwards. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby asks him about trust. Voters laughed at you in TV debates when you said that truth in politics is important, she says. Johnson says he was determined to leave the EU by 31 October and parliament prevented this from happening. \u201cThat is why we do need to fix this broken parliament, get a working majority and get that deal over the line.\u201d The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, asks whether Johnson acknowledges that people would be making a big leap of faith in voting for him after he broke his promise on taking the UK out of Europe by the end of October. Johnson says that parliament blocked him from doing so. He says that for three and half years people have seen politicians engaged in endless \u201cdither and delay\u201d and that they want to see Brexit done. ITV\u2019s Robert Peston says that the Conservatives are pledging \u00a33bn a year of extra public service spending compared to Labour\u2019s \u00a383bn a year, and \u00a38bn of increased investment compared to \u00a380bn a year from Jeremy Corbyn. Why wouldn\u2019t people who want to see improvements in public services vote for Labour? Johnson says he couldn\u2019t disagree more. By 2033, we will we see a 29% increase in funding in the NHS, he says. Tory plans would include the biggest ever cash boost to the NHS. \u201cIt is true that we are doing it in a sensible way,\u201d he says. Johnson says they are making big commitments and they can only do that because \u201cwe have a dynamic and growing economy\u201d. He says all Labour governments end with an economic crisis. \u201cThe only difference with Corbyn and McDonnell is they propose to start with an economic crisis\u201d. This line gets the biggest cheer yet: Let\u2019s go carbon neutral by 2050 and Corbyn neutral by Christmas. That\u2019s it from Johnson\u2019s speech. Now some questions from the media. The manifesto says a Conservative government would build \u201cNorthern Powerhouse Rail\u201d between Leeds and Manchester, and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle. They would make a \u00a328.8bn investment in strategic and local roads. More from the manifesto. Johnson says the party is proud to have confirmed \u00a334bn per year by the end of the parliament in additional funding for the NHS. Within the first three months of our new term, we will enshrine in law our fully-funded, long-term NHS plan. Johnson mocks Corbyn\u2019s neutral position on Brexit, saying that if the Labour leader doesn\u2019t believe in the deal he will try and agree with the EU \u201cthen who does believe in it?\u201d \u201cIt would be farcical and comical if the consequences of that approach weren\u2019t so disastrous,\u201d he says. Johnson repeats the claim that \u201cCorbynomics\u201d would mean \u00a32,400 extra in taxes for every person. (We fact checked this claim here.) PA Media has been pulling announcements from the manifesto. It pledges to provide \u00a31bn of additional funding for social care in every year of the next parliament, but stops short of providing a plan to solve the social care funding shortage, other than stating that the money raised cannot come from forcing elderly care recipients to sell their homes. We will build a cross-party consensus to bring forward an answer that solves the problem, commands the widest support, and stands the test of time. That consensus will consider a range of options but one condition we do make is that nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it. Johnson says the Tories will invest millions more every week in science, education and infrastructure. He says his government set a net zero carbon emissions target of 2050. And the party will do all of those things without raising VAT, national insurance contributions or income tax, he says. He repeats his line that the deal is \u201coven ready\u201d to go and would allow them to restore confidence and certainty to businesses. \u201cGet Brexit done and we can focus our hearts and our minds on the priorities of the British people.\u201d He says the manifesto commits them to providing 50,000 more nurses. Johnson is taking to the stage to some pretty dramatic music and chants of \u201cBoris\u201d. He says the other parties want to frustrate the will of the people. Corbyn \u201cused to be indecisive,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cNow he\u2019s not so sure\u201d. Here are some lines from the manifesto, as reported by Reuters. The Conservatives will create up to 10 free ports around the UK. They will not extend the Brexit deadline implementation period beyond December 2020. They will no longer allow people to claim child benefit for children living overseas after Brexit. They will deliver 50,000 more nurses. Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 who has not been seen in public since his disastrous remarks on Grenfell \u2013 is not at the launch. You can watch the live feed of the Conservative party manifesto launch at the top of this blog or here. The party\u2019s chairman, James Cleverly, is on the stage repeating the slogan \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. He says the kind of change Corbyn is offering is not the kind of change the UK needs. All of their policies are rooted in the past. Ours look to the future. Theirs empower the state. Ours support real people. Boris Johnson is about to take to the stage in Telford to launch his party\u2019s manifesto. The cabinet have arrived. The BBC has defended the broadcast of an edited clip of Boris Johnson\u2019s Question Time performance that sparked a row on Twitter, reports Aaron Walawalkar. Audience members could be heard laughing after Johnson was asked whether it was important for someone in his position \u201cto always tell the truth\u201d during the live broadcast of the Leaders Special on Friday night. Twitter user Nick Flaks noticed this laughter was seemingly missing from the clip broadcast during BBC News\u2019 lunchtime bulletin on Saturday. Veteran columnist Peter Oborne likened the video edit to something that would normally be seen \u201con state TV in Soviet Russia\u201d, demanding the BBC explain itself. The BBC presenter Huw Edwards hit back, dismissing Oborne as sounding \u201ccrackers\u201d. A BBC News spokesperson said: \u201cThis clip, which was played in full on the 10 O\u2019clock News last night, was shortened for timing reasons in today\u2019s lunchtime bulletin. We\u2019ve fully covered Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance on the BBC QT special, and the reaction to it, across our outlets.\u201d Speaking ahead of the Conservative manifesto launch in Telford at 2pm, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said the party\u2019s manifesto would be published along with \u201cthe most detailed most transparent costings that have ever been published in British electoral history by any party\u201d. He said the only way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to deliver a Conservative majority at the next election, which would allow the UK to leave the EU by the end of January. Labour has announced it would spend \u00a358bn on compensating women who have been financially hit by the decision to raise the pension age from 60 to 66 (see full story here). The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that the government has \u201cfailed the women who were born in the 1950s\u201d. The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, criticised the announcement \u2013 which doesn\u2019t appear in Labour\u2019s manifesto \u2013 as being another item on a wishlist. \u201cWhere\u2019s the money coming from is the question that was not answered.\u201d she asked. Swinson told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show that the Conservatives were on course to get a majority and that her party was the only one that could stop them. \u201cWho is going to stop Boris Johnson from getting a majority?\u201d she said. \u201cIf we look at things as they stand, it is not the Labour party. Even in seats like Grimsby, Labour are not even managing to hold their own.\u201d Latest polling suggests Labour is set to lose all but one of its seats in Scotland. A Panelbase study for the Sunday Times suggested that only Ian Murray, a frequent critic of the party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would be returned to the House of Commons. The poll, which surveyed 1,009 people in Scotland, found that support for Labour in Scotland could dip from 27% to 20%. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has given an interview to PA Media in which she has indicated her party could potentially do business with Labour in a hung parliament if Jeremy Corbyn was not leader. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, responding to Sajid Javid\u2019s comments from this morning: Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, has also been speaking to broadcasters this morning. He told the BBC\u2019s deputy political editor, John Pienaar, that he wouldn\u2019t apologise for likening Wales\u2019s relationship with England to that of a colonial power. \u201c[An] extractive economy with political power outside of its own nation. I mean, what word would you use to describe that?\u201d said Price. I think that Wales, like any western country itself, benefited from colonialism. And we as a nation have a moral debt to those countries as well. But that\u2019s not to exclude the fact that Wales suffered too in different ways and in a different context. But, you know, I can take you, John, round communities in Wales where you have intergenerational poverty. You know, it\u2019s there in the physical fabric of those communities. It\u2019s there on the faces of the people. And I\u2019m not going to apologise about feeling angry about that. Today\u2019s Observer has an interview with the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, which is worth a read. Here are some key quotes. On Labour\u2019s election chances: I do believe in miracles, but we don\u2019t need a miracle. Last time, at this stage of the campaign, I was getting lots of phone calls from colleagues saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to be wiped out and [we\u2019re] really worried\u2019. We\u2019re at that stage now. I\u2019m getting the phone calls which are saying: \u2018I think, at best, [Labour will be the] largest party [in parliament]\u2019. Then people saying: \u2018Actually, on the doorstep, it doesn\u2019t feel like the polls\u2019. On the scale of the party\u2019s spending commitments: The problems we face, the issues that we face, are big. They\u2019re huge. So it does require a huge response. We\u2019ve got these weeks to get that message across. But you\u2019re right. We talk about billions. People just switch off. So the issue for us is translating that into what does it mean in your local area \u2026 so people don\u2019t think the big numbers are just unreal. Asked if they would accept a continuation of freedom of movement with the EU in a future deal: It will be a negotiating issue \u2026 Of course, we welcome the principles of free movement, but we also recognise that there are issues that have to be addressed. Here is a summary of the highlights from this morning\u2019s political broadcast interviews: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would not remain neutral in any second EU referendum. He told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that members of the shadow cabinet would be able to campaign on the basis of their judgment. He said: \u201cI\u2019ll wait until I see the details of the deal that we negotiate. I\u2019ve said up until now \u2013 I was in the negotiations with the Conservatives for six weeks and I couldn\u2019t see a deal even emerging then that could beat remain, but let\u2019s see what we can negotiate.\u201d Chancellor Sajid Javid told the same programme that the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto would be published along with \u201cthe most detailed most transparent costings that have ever been published in British electoral history by any party\u201d. He said the only way to avoid a no-deal Brexit was to deliver a Conservative majority at the next election, which would allow the UK to leave the EU by the end of January. On the Labour party\u2019s announcement that it would spend \u00a358bn on women caught in a pension trap (see full story here), the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that the government has \u201cfailed the women who were born in the 1950s\u201d, adding: \u201cThey stole their pension, that contract, that agreement that they thought they had, and then accelerated it so those women didn\u2019t have the chance to prepare for that.\u201d The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, told Marr that the Conservatives were on course to get a majority and that her party was the only one that could stop them. \u201cWho is going to stop Boris Johnson from getting a majority?\u201d she said. \u201cIf we look at things as they stand, it is not the Labour party. Even in seats like Grimsby, Labour are not even managing to hold their own.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, set out her red lines for supporting a minority Labour government. She said she would want to see Trident nuclear weapons scrapped, more powers handed to Holyrood, as well as the granting of a second independence vote. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has given an interview to PA Media in which she has indicated her party could potentially do business with Labour in a hung parliament if Jeremy Corbyn was not leader. She said she could see no circumstance in which the DUP would support a minority Labour administration with Corbyn as prime minister, but acknowledged there were others in his party with whom she could consider working. Jeremy Corbyn, of course, is an anathema to anyone who believes in the United Kingdom. I mean, he would destroy the economy. We\u2019ve seen that through his manifesto launch. I mean, some of it is complete fantastical stuff. How he\u2019s going to fund that no one knows, he would wreck the economy. He would wreck the defence of our nation as well. And more than that it would lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom. So therefore, we cannot see any circumstances, I see no circumstance where we would support a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party. Of course, there are others in the Labour party who take a different view to Jeremy Corbyn. And, if it comes to be the case that someone else is leading the Labour party, then we will judge it against not only our 12-point plan but whether it\u2019s good for Northern Ireland to be in communication with whoever\u2019s leading the Labour party at that time. Foster rejected the suggestion that Corbyn\u2019s position on Brexit, with his opposition to the erection of economic barriers down the Irish Sea, was more unionist than either Theresa May or Boris Johnson. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably a tactical attack for him on the Conservative party as opposed to anything he really genuinely believes in terms of the United Kingdom,\u201d she said. Asked whether unionism would be in trouble if Johnson secured a large majority, thus enabling him to ratify his deal in parliament, Foster said: Well, I don\u2019t think they will come back with a large majority. But we will still continue to use our influence there if they do come back with a large majority and to make sure that Northern Ireland\u2019s voice is heard with our strong team of DUP MPs. Some more polling, this time from Opinium for the Observer, has the Conservatives with a 19-point lead over Labour. That statement by Swinson that the Conservatives are on course to win a majority is yet more evidence that the party is shifting its position from \u201cSwinson could be prime minister\u201d to \u201cwe can help deny Johnson a majority\u201d. The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, wrote this a couple of days ago, noting the shift. There\u2019s some polling here on Westminster voting intentions in Scotland that shows the Conservatives up seven points. Michael Gove has just been speaking to Marr. He was asked about social care and he said \u201cwe want to forge a consensus\u201d on the issue. \u201cHow are you going to do a consensual deal with people you revile so much?\u201d asked Marr. Gove said there are people in the Labour party \u2013 though not in the leadership \u2013 who they could work with. Gove says the political challenge is one for all parties. \u201cThe approach that we in the Conservative party take towards these big issues is actually to be generous, open and inclusive and to say let\u2019s work together in order to make sure we have a solution that spans the generation.\u201d Asked about maintaining the overall size of the armed forces, he says: \u201cWe have absolutely no plans to reduce the size of the armed forces at all.\u201d (I\u2019ve previously written about the army\u2019s recruitment crisis, with frontline combat units operating as much as 40% below strength. You can read below.) Asked if there would be any possibility of asking for another EU extension beyond one year in the next phase, Gove said: \u201cNo \u2026 we\u2019ll be out of the EU by January.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon was on Sky earlier. She said her party would only ever enter into a \u201cless formal arrangement\u201d to support a minority Labour government. In terms of supporting a minority Labour government, I have been clear we wouldn\u2019t have a formal coalition, it would be a less formal arrangement, and yes of course I would expect [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party to respect Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future. Swinson\u2019s party could end up with a lot of sway in a future hung parliament, says Marr. He asks what their priority would be. \u201cOf course, the Liberal Democrats want to stop Brexit and we will be campaigning to stop Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cAs things stand, Boris Johnson is on course to get a majority,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at the polls right now, that is what they say.\u201d The Liberal Democrats are the party in the best position to take many seats from the Conservatives. Swinson says the Lib Dems would vote in favour of having a second EU referendum with Boris Johnson\u2019s deal as one option and remaining as the other option. Marr says that the Question Time show on Friday night showed that there is still a lot of anger towards the Lib Dems from \u201clefty-leaning, remain-voters\u201d. Swinson says that in coalition there were constant battles that weren\u2019t always seen by the public because of the principle of collective responsibility. She\u2019s asked what was going through her mind when she voted for 17% cut in social care budgets and cuts to the police. They were making difficult decisions in the context of the a smaller economy after the financial crash, she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t win more battles in that coalition.\u201d The Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. \u201cIt\u2019s not gone terribly well has it?\u201d starts Marr (ouch). \u201cWell, I\u2019m enjoying the campaign. Clearly there has been a squeeze,\u201d says Swinson. She says \u201cthe stitch-up\u201d between Nigel Farage and the Conservatives has had an effect. \u201cWho\u2019s going to stop Boris Johnson getting a majority? Well, it\u2019s not the Labour party,\u201d she says. Swinson argues that even in seats such as Grimsby the Labour party are not contenders. Rayner says what Labour is suggesting corporation tax is raised to wouldn\u2019t even bring it up to 2010 levels and it would be less than it was under Thatcher. Asked about Labour\u2019s approach to the gender recognition act, over which there has been some confusion. \u201cWe will protect spaces under the qualities act \u2026 but we will also protect transgender women as well,\u201d she says. My colleague Michael Savage has some background on this: \u201cWe need to get past Brexit,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people listening to this show will have had enough.\u201d She is asked about the party\u2019s pledge to women caught in a pension trap (see McDonnell\u2019s interview earlier). She said the situation \u201cfundamentally undermines the contract between a government and its people,\u201d. Marr says Labour is not being honest when it says its tax plans would affect only the richest 5%. Two million people on marriage tax allowance (which Labour will scrap) would each lose \u00a3250 a year. Rayner says the party\u2019s measures would present a net benefit to families. \u201cEverybody bar the top 5% would be better off under Labour,\u201d she says. Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, is on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. She is asked if a future Labour government \u2013 as opposed to just Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister \u2013 would take a position on the deal it had negotiated with Brussels in a future EU referendum. \u201cThat\u2019s a hypothetical,\u201d she says. McDonnell was asked if he was happy to see billionaires in the UK. \u201cI\u2019d like to see a more equal society,\u201d he said. \u201cI meet with very rich people in the City and elsewhere and they don\u2019t want to be stepping over homeless people as they come out of their offices \u2026 they don\u2019t want to live in gated communities.\u201d He was asked about the Labour line that it would not consider another Scottish independence referendum in \u201cthe early years of a Labour government\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything in the first two or three years, at least,\u201d he said. Speaking to Ridge earlier, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said members of the shadow cabinet would be allowed to campaign how they wanted in a future second referendum, while Corbyn would remain a neutral \u201chonest broker\u201d. McDonnell avoids saying how he would campaign, but says he will not remain neutral and that he has not seen a deal so far that is as good as remain. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a leader who will divide the country \u2013 it\u2019s divided already,\u201d he says. He\u2019s asked about Labour\u2019s announcement today that it would create a \u00a358bn compensation scheme for 3 million women who believe they have been left thousands of pounds out of pocket after steep increases to the state pension age. Here\u2019s the story: Ridge asks McDonnell why the measure is not in the party\u2019s manifesto costings. \u201cWith these decisions \u2026 it\u2019s outside of the score card. It\u2019s a very special arrangement,\u201d he says. She asks if the measure is something the party has cooked up since Johnson was asked about it on Friday night\u2019s BBC Question Time. McDonnell says they\u2019ve been working on it for the past 18 months. The chancellor is asked about rumours of rifts between him and Johnson. \u201cWere you relieved when he said he\u2019d keep you on as chancellor?\u201d he is asked. Javid says: \u201cIt was a great answer.\u201d Javid is asked about no-deal planning. \u201cThe only risk of no deal is if there isn\u2019t a Conservative majority,\u201d he says. He repeats the line that there is a deal \u201cready to go\u201d and that a Conservative government could get it done by the end of January. Javid says the Tory manifesto will be \u201cthe most green manifesto that any party has ever published\u201d. He\u2019s asked about a cut to inheritance tax. \u201cJust wait and see what\u2019s in the manifesto,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will cut taxes whenever we can afford it an whenever it is prudent for the country.\u201d Sajid Javid is on Sky now. He says that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans mean a tax increase of \u00a32,400 per person. \u201cWhere\u2019s that [figure] from?\u201d says Ridge. He dodges the question. Ridge asks him about the Tory plans to borrow billions more. Javid says we have had a decade of recovery and that it is important to balance the books, but also to get the economy going. \u201cToday we have strong economic fundamentals, more people employed than ever before,\u201d he says. He says they will balance day-to-day spending and have an \u201cinfrastructure revolution\u201d. He says he is clear that debt will be lower at the end of the next parliament than it is today. Ridge asks about Moody\u2019s decision to lower the UK\u2019s credit outlook to negative. People will be thinking \u201cwhat was the point of austerity?\u201d she says. Javid says that that decision was because of the paralysis in our parliament. Good morning everyone, I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I will be liveblogging for you today as we gear up to the launch of the Conservative party\u2019s manifesto later today. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge at the moment, so I\u2019ll bring you highlights from that shortly. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and the Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, are due on after that. The Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, are due to appear on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, which starts at 9am. Boris Johnson will launch his party\u2019s manifesto in the West Midlands this afternoon, committing a Tory government to not raise income tax, VAT or national insurance for five years. He will also pledge to protect the value of state pensions, boost spending by \u00a31bn on childcare during school terms and holidays, and cut energy bills by up to \u00a3750 a year for those in social housing.

It will still appear as a beautifully thin crescent. The chart shows the view looking south-west at 17:00GMT on 29 November.

      "bodyText": "The bright planets of Venus and Jupiter remain fairly close in the evening sky this week. They are situated in the constellation of Sagittarius, the archer. In the gathering twilight of the late afternoon of 28 November, they will be joined by a very young, two-day-old moon. All three are very low, close to the south-western horizon, so will need a clear viewing location. Even then, the tiny crescent of the moon will be a challenge to spot. A day later, however, things become noticeably easier. The young crescent moon will have 10% of its surface illuminated and will be higher in the sky. It will still appear as a beautifully thin crescent. The chart shows the view looking south-west at 17:00GMT on 29 November. On this night, the slender moon will be approaching the planet Saturn, which will appear as a yellowish point of light of medium brightness. Both objects will be located towards the rear of Sagittarius, and will set soon after the sun.",

Nobody, including the man himself, expected him to be competing at this level after so long considering how physical his brand of tennis is. It\u2019s a reflection of his perseverance but also of how efficient he has become over the years. He is no longer the blindingly fast claycourter playing from 10 feet behind the baseline. He drove Spain to the title by serving exceptionally, being consistently aggressive, moving forward to the net whenever he could and showing that he is also a phenomenal doubles player.</p> <p>All credit to Roberto Bautista Agut who lost his father three days ago, left the team to be with his family and then returned to help his team win.

The Spaniard is well known for his intensity but it\u2019s hard to remember him as intense and pumped up from the first point onwards, as he has been throughout the week. This tournament has been another reminder that although the 33 year old is one of the greatest individual athletes in history, he is also a great team player.

His forehand is one of the best around and he backs it up with great movement and return. However, the Spaniard\u2019s Davis Cup record isn\u2019t the best. His Davis Cup record is just 7-6 and he has lost a few significant matches over the years, including earlier in the week against Andrey Rublev.</p> <p>This has been an incredible breakout year for Auger-Aliassime, who reached the top 20 earlier this year and reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final in March. The tennis season is so gruelling and he seemed to run out of gas in the final weeks. The Canadian will have to serve extremely well and control the match with his forehand, or else the Spaniard will break him down.</p> <p>This match comes with many more intangibles than a regular event. Auger-Aliassime has never competed under this amount of pressure before and he comes in undercooked. He hasn\u2019t played since early October after injuring his ankle and this is just his third Davis Cup match (his record is 1-1). </p> <p>For Bautista, this has clearly been a devastating week after his father passed away. He will be seeking solace at home on the tennis court.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ddaa6148f080fd59fb16776\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T15:48:11.636Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Roberto Bautista-Agut before the final:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be amazing to play the final with our crowd.

After all the arguments and discussion about the new era of this historic competition, this has been some week. There have been organisational issues, matches finishing past 4am, half-empty stadiums and plenty of valid criticisms of this abbreviated format, but the biggest takeaway is that tennis is tennis regardless of where it is played. As long as the core scoring system remains intact and the players care enough to produce their best, this sport is always going to be exciting and desperately tense.</p> <p>Few days of tennis this year have been as tense as yesterday\u2019s semi-finals, where Canada recovered from 0-1 down to vanquish Russia. First Denis Shapovalov edged out a three set win over Karen Khachanov, then Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil defeated Khachanov and Andrey Rublev in an excruciating third set tiebreak.</p> <p>Last night\u2019s tie between Great Britain and Spain produced three straight sets matches but somehow the stakes felt even higher, even more desperate, with Nadal almost single-handedly dragging Spain into the final. After Kyle Edmund\u2019s solid win over Feliciano Lopez, Nadal blitzed Dan Evans and then carried a struggling Lopez into the final with an incredible win over Neal Skupski and Jamie Murray 7-6(3) 7-6(8). In a year that Nadal won two Grand slams and finished as the oldest ever ATP year end number one, few moments have impressed as much as the way he saved Great Britain\u2019s set points in the second set tiebreak.</p> <p>So, here we are. The Spanish team was decimated yesterday after Lopez was forced to step in following the tragic death of Roberto Bautista Agut\u2019s father and injuries ruled out Pablo Carreno Busta and Marcel Granollers. We still await the official nominations but there are rumours that No 9 Bautista Agut, who returned to support his teammates yesterday from the bench, could return to the court today. The clear priority is his mental health, but if he does feel okay to play, it will clearly tip the scales heavily in Spain\u2019s favour. </p> <p>Across the net, Canada have played with only two players this week, Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil, and they have been spectacular. They will almost certainly rely on their two heroes again as they contest their first ever Davis Cup final. What a breakthrough year this has been for Canadian tennis, from their first ever Grand Slam champion in Bianca Andreescu to their rising stars on the ATP. A victory would be the perfect way to end it.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T14:37:23.026Z\">at 2.37pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today at the end of another tennis season. Thanks for following all the tennis coverage throughout the year. After an exhausting, endless eleven month season, it all begins again in five weeks. Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s final report after a very eventful first Davis Cup Finals in Madrid. It was dramatic and entertaining, among many other things. There is plenty to think about going into 2020. Spanish Davis Cup captain Sergi Bruguera: Can you imagine? Yesterday, Roberto was in the funeral of his father and now he\u2019s giving everything... I have no idea how to describe this with words.. He also noted that the Spanish team didn\u2019t go to sleep before 3am. What an exhausting week. Rafael Nadal after Spain\u2019s sixth Davis Cup title: Have been an amazing week. A lot of things we went through: [the] father of Roberto passed away. Marcel [Granollers] stayed stiff with the lower back and he couldn\u2019t move. Pablo got injured in the singles. We went through a lot. I could not be happier. Have been unforgettable moments in this amazing stadium. The crowd was just a joke. We can\u2019t thank them enough. Our team spirit prevailed, we fighted hard. Nadal ends the 2019 season as the oldest ever ATP year end number one at 33 and with titles at Roland Garros, the US Open, Rome, Montreal and the Davis Cup. He has had many incredible seasons, but given his age, this one easily ranks as one of the best. Nobody, including the man himself, expected him to be competing at this level after so long considering how physical his brand of tennis is. It\u2019s a reflection of his perseverance but also of how efficient he has become over the years. He is no longer the blindingly fast claycourter playing from 10 feet behind the baseline. He drove Spain to the title by serving exceptionally, being consistently aggressive, moving forward to the net whenever he could and showing that he is also a phenomenal doubles player. All credit to Roberto Bautista Agut who lost his father three days ago, left the team to be with his family and then returned to help his team win. No doubt he found solace in the most familiar place in the world for him - the tennis court. All credit to Denis Shapovalov for playing about as well as he can throughout that second set and then finding an incredible second wind with the championship on the line. However, Nadal has been incredible throughout this week in both singles and doubles and you just knew that he would find a way to win the important points and secure the win. The Spaniard is well known for his intensity but it\u2019s hard to remember him as intense and pumped up from the first point onwards, as he has been throughout the week. This tournament has been another reminder that although the 33 year old is one of the greatest individual athletes in history, he is also a great team player. Just impressive. Rafael Nadal defeats Denis Shapovalov 6-3 7-6(7). Another clutch performance to end an astonishing week from the best player in the world. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 6-6 (*7-8) Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP).

But at 30-30, he dumped a weak backhand into the net. Nadal slammed down an overhead on game point to take us into a tiebreak. Can the Canadian keep up this level in the tiebreak? Denis Shapovalov 3-6 6-5* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Shapovalov has guaranteed himself at least a tiebreak and it has been a sublime effort. He has played incredibly well in this set and Nadal has struggled with his increased first serve percentage. After a limp missed forehand return from Nadal, the Canadian holds to 30. He now has a free swing at Nadal\u2019s serve. Let\u2019s see what he can do. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 *5-5 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Holding serve is a challenge for both players right now but Nadal digs out a great hold with the set on the line. From 15-30 down, Nadal found a great unreturned serve. At 30-30 he produced some astonishingly soft hands after serve and volleying, delicately stroking a half-volley drop shot winner. After a wide Shapovalov backhand error, the Spaniard holds. A tiebreak seems to be on the horizon. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 5-4* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Shapovalov holds, but not before weathering another storm as the 11,000 people around him cheer for his demise. This time, he had to save break point after the Spaniard produced an astonishing down the line forehand passing shot. But Shapovalov is here to play. He saved break point with with a huge forehand winner, then he found an ace at deuce. He dismounted with a booming forehand down the line winner. This has been an excellent set of tennis. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 *4-4 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). A much simpler service game from Nadal who breezes through a hold to 15 with a big unreturned serve. Big serving and big forehands from the Spaniard. The pressure returns to the Canadian\u2019s shoulders. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 4-3* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). After the early struggles, Shapovalov is beginning to grow in confidence. After being pegged back from 30-0 to 30-30, the Canadian came up with two beautiful volleys in successive points to hold. He continues to attack and move forward whenever he can and these fast conditions are helping him. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 *3-3 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Nadal faces his first break point of the day and saves it to keep himself level. That was an immense effort from Shapovalov, who is now playing his best tennis of the match. He is taking the ball early, throwing everything he can at Nadal and making far fewer errors. With Nadal at 40-30, Shapovalov responded with an incredible angled crosscourt backhand at full sprint. At deuce, Shapovalov demolished the ball and moved forward to the net, but Nadal found a brilliant backhand crosscourt return winner to bring up a game point. Shapovalov produced a huge forehand on game point and then a missed forehand from Nadal brought up break point How did Nadal respond to the break point? The Spaniard landed a huge service winner on break point and then dispatched two huge forehands to hold. Cold blooded. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 3-2* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). This is just extremely difficult. As Nadal moves through most of his holds with ease, Shapovalov has to fight for everything. This time, he dug out a great hold from 0-30 down. Particularly impressive work from Shapovalov at 30-30: he crushed a couple of crosscourt forehands before moving into the net and finishing the point with a delicate dropshot. He held with a big unreturned serve out wide. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 *2-2 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). After the struggles in his opening service game of the second set, Nadal holds to love with a wicked forehand winner. More great serving from the Spaniard and another serve and volley thrown in. Easy. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 2-1* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Shapovalov keeps himself ahead in the second set, but it required more saved break points and more fight after a wayward forehand from the Canadian at 30-30 brought up break point. He saved the break point with a brilliant wide serve, but Nadal immediately responded with a brilliant forehand passing shot. The Canadian did not reach this stage without courage. Despite being passed in the previous point, he came forward again down break point and forced Nadal to make another passing shot. This time, he dumped his forehand into the net. Shapovalov found two big serves to seal the hold. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 *1-1 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Nadal holds, but that was tough. Shapovalov was finally able to get into a Nadal service game as the Spaniard\u2019s level dipped. From 40-30, a missed forehand dragged Nadal to his first deuce. He responded with a brilliant serve and volley to bring up a second game point. Shapovalov pulled him back to deuce with a couple of brilliant point-ending forehands, but Nadal found an ace and then an unreturned serve out wide. The Canadian did absolutely nothing wrong there. Nadal was just too clutch. Second set: Denis Shapovalov 3-6 1-0* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). This isn\u2019t getting any easier for Shapovalov, but he edges out a hold to open the second set. The Canadian immediately faced a tense 30-30 point on serve. Nadal attempted to throw in a few slices and the Canadian came up with his most delightful shot of the day in response - a sweet dropshot from far behind the baseline. He held with a nice, sliding unreturned second serve. The youngster is pumped. Denis Shapovalov 3-6 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Nadal takes the first set with a huge unreturned serve. He is serving about as well as he ever has and putting pressure on the Canadian in nearly every return game. The youngster just has to serve better and hope that the Spaniard\u2019s level falls a little. We\u2019ll see if it does. A good question from Ian that I have no answer to: Why do the players always take the head gear off immediately the match ends? It\u2019s like a ritual before they can shake hands at the net. The opposite happens at the end of a cycle race when the top gets zipped up so the sponsorship can be clearly seen. Denis Shapovalov 3-5* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Shapovalov finally gets his first quick game of the day, sealed to love with a big 211kmh ace at 30-0 and then another big unreturned serve at 40-0. Nadal will serve for the set after just 32 minutes. Denis Shapovalov *2-5 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Nadal consolidates his break with another quick hold, this time to love. He finished with a touch of variety, throwing in a serve and volley and clinching the game with a great backhand volley. Nadal has played this set with incredible intensity and he is one game away from taking it. Denis Shapovalov 2-4* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Shapovalov\u2019s first serve percentage dropped just a little and Nadal immediately pounced. At 30-30, the Canadian buried an awesome backhand down the line, which the Spaniard easily tracked down and immediately flipped defence to attack with an incredible crosscourt forehand. Finally, Shapovalov sent a forehand wide to relinquish the break. Nadal celebrated the break by screaming at the top of his lungs once again. I can\u2019t remember seeing him so pumped up just 6 games into a match. Denis Shapovalov *2-3 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). As Shapovalov produces incredible shots just to hold serve, Nadal continues to roll through his own service games. He is serving huge and dismissing any short balls with his forehand. Another big unreturned serve to hold. Denis Shapovalov 2-2* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Once again, Shapovalov faces break point under immense pressure from a Nadal who is already finding great length and crushing any short forehand. How did he respond? Shapovalov found with a huge ace down the T at 30-40, then he hit a glorious drop volley. He held by demolishing a forehand down the line for a clear winner. He is already having to come up with incredible shots just to win points, but he is so far doing so. Denis Shapovalov *1-2 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Both players are absolutely obliterating the ball early on and also making so much noise after each victorious point. Shapovalov opened the game with a nuclear forehand down the line at full sprint, Nadal responded by picking off a volley at the net before screaming \u201cvamos\u201d. After a big crosscourt forehand winner at 30-15 and a huge unreturned serve at 40-15, Nadal holds again with ease. Denis Shapovalov 1-1* Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Nadal is already putting on the pressure on Shapovalov by returning well and keeping immaculate depth on his groundstrokes in the early exchanges. He quickly brings up break point at 30-40, but Shapovalov saved the break point with an excellent swinging wide serve then a booming backhand, picking off the short ball at the net. After a big serve at deuce, he held with a huge forehand after a big serve. That is an extremely good hold. Denis Shapovalov *0-1 Rafael Nadal (CAN 0-1 ESP). Nadal slams down an unreturned serve to depart from his first service game with an easy love hold. Nadal still hasn\u2019t lost his serve all week in singles or doubles. Shapovalov got his first glimpse of how tough that will be. The players are out on court. Shapovalov will almost certainly enter the stadium believing that he can win. After all, the Canadian\u2019s big breakthrough match was his 3-6 6-4 7-6(4) win over Nadal to reach the semi-finals at home in Montreal two years ago. He is probably in the best, most consistent form of his career so far after winning his first title in Stockholm and then reaching the Paris Masters final last month. Shapovalov has arguably the biggest game of all the youngsters and it seems clear that he is simply going to have to play at his very highest level just to have a chance against a Nadal competing at such a high level. He will need to serve extremely well, limit his double faults, keep points short, take his huge forehand to Nadal and use these fast conditions to his favour. It is all easier said than done. Emotional scenes inside the stadium as Bautista Agut addressed the crowd in Spanish. Needless to say, that win for Bautista Agut was likely a huge tipping point in the tie. For much of this week, Nadal has had to dig Spain out from 0-1 deficits before dragging his team over the line in doubles and he has played some incredible tennis throughout. In order to keep Canada in the tie, 20 year old Shapovalov has to defeat the best player in the world at his very best. It doesn\u2019t get much tougher than that. Roberto Bautista Agut after the match: It was very special, very special feeling on the court today. I could just go out on the court and give my best. I\u2019m very happy that I could win the first point for Spain. The only stat that matters: 18 unforced errors for Roberto Bautista Agut, 45 unforced errors for Felix Auger Aliassime. Roberto Bautista Agut seals off one of the biggest wins of his career with a love hold. What a moment and what fortitude from the Spaniard after such a testing week. Chants of \u201cRoberto!\u201d rang across the crowd as he jumped into the arms of his teammates. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 3-5* Roberto Bautista Agut. Auger Aliassine finds a hold and forces the Spaniard to serve it all out, but even that was so tough. The Canadian sped to a 40-15 lead and looked well en route to a confident hold, but then he double faulted badly and sprayed backhand down the line well wide. Bautista offered him another bite at a hold with a rare forehand error of his own at deuce, but the Canadian shanked another forehand on game point well wide. For all his struggles today, Auger Aliassime has battled for every single point. At deuce, he swept into the net behind an inside out forehand and he found a good serve to hold. Let\u2019s see if Bautista Agut can hold his nerve at the end. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *2-5 Roberto Bautista Agut. Auger Aliassime continues to fight and he dragged Bautista Agut to 30-30 on his serve with a great combination of forehands in a long return game. But the Spaniard responded to the pressure with a big unreturned serve. The Canadian swung for the fences again at game point, but his forehand flew well long. The Spaniard is now one game away and he is roaring \u201cvamos\u201d after every last victorious point. He is so close to a crucial win and he knows it. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 2-4* Roberto Bautista Agut. Bautista breaks again! That did not last very long. Bautista Agut restored the break with his best return game of the match. In particular, a brilliant crosscourt forehand passing shot from the Spaniard moved him up 0-30 and excellent returning throughout. The Canadian blasted a forehand well long on the first break point to relinquish the break. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *2-3 Roberto Bautista Agut. Auger Aliassime breaks back! The Spaniard may have been up a break but he never really played like a player on the front foot and he gifted too many uncharacteristic errors to the Canadian. A forehand error and a double fault from the Spaniard brought up break point. He saved the first with a neat forehand dropshot, but on the second point the Canadian blasted a forehand down the line winner. The linesperson called the ball out, but hawkeye overruled. We\u2019re back on serve. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 1-3* Roberto Bautista Agut. The Canadian secures a crucial hold, but he is living so dangerously right now. From 30-15, he sprayed another forehand well long before double faulting under pressure at 30-30. But he responded really well, saving the break point with a big first serve and then striking a violent inside out forehand winner at deuce. He held with a big unreturned serve and a booming \u2018c\u2019mon\u2019. His second serve may be edgy and his forehand may be leaking but there\u2019s no doubt that this 19 year old is going to fight. Great hold. Since the tiebreak, things have been quite ugly on that forehand wing. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *0-3 Roberto Bautista Agut. Just as it looked like Bautista Agut was beginning to separate himself from Auger Aliassime at 40-15, he suddenly found himself facing a break point. From double game point up, the Spaniard framed a forehand out and then watched as Auger Aliassime crushed a forehand down the line after a fortunate net cord. At deuce then Bautista Agut sent a bad drive volley flying out. A huge, unexpected opportunity for the youngster to get back on track and it seems like the pressure just got to him. From break point up, Auger Aliassime hit three quite horrendous forehand errors in succession. The opportunity disappeared in the blink of an eye. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 0-2* Roberto Bautista Agut. Bautista Agut breaks! Sadly for the Canadian, his game is beginning to come apart at the seams. After being dragged to deuce, he double faulted on two consecutive deuce points to offer up break points. He saved the first break point with a big overhead and the second by forcing an error with a wicked crosscourt forehand, but the nerves were written across his face. On the third break point Canadian sent a short forehand well long. He will continue to fight but it\u2019s a long road back from here. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *0-1 Roberto Bautista Agut: Bautista Agut continues to apply the pressure, holding to 15 with ease. Quite an astonishing point at 30-15, with the Spaniard retrieving an overhead from Auger Aliassime and throwing up a defensive lob. The Canadian seemed to think the lob was floating out and he could only respond to the lob with a limp forehand before eventually shanking the ball out. He finished the game with a small shake of his head. Across the net, Bautista Agut looks ready for anything. Roberto Bautista Agut hit only two groundstroke winners in that entire set in fast conditions, but that\u2019s just what he does. He ground the youngster down and he was rock solid when it really mattered in the tiebreak. The crowd finished the set chanting \u201cole, ole, ole\u201d for the world to hear. Let\u2019s see if Auger Aliassime can respond in this set. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) Roberto Bautista Agut! Bautista Agut takes the first set! After the break, he just tore away from the Canadian. He took the first mini-break with a huge crosscourt backhand return, forcing a backhand error from the youngster. Auger Aliassime responded with a wild inside out forehand wide. The Canadian panicked on his final forehand, sending it wide to relinquish the set. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-6 (3-3*) Roberto Bautista Agut: There is absolutely nothing separating the two at the break. A gorgeous forehand dropshot from Bautista Agut to lead 2-1, to which Auger Aliassime responded with a pair of vicious forehands, moving the Spaniard from side to side until he forced a backhand error. Auger Aliassime moved up 3-2 with a curling wide ace. The Spaniard levelled the tiebreak with huge inside-out forehand behind a big serve. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-6 Roberto Bautista Agut: Aside from the one tight game on Bautista Agut\u2019s serve at 4-4, this set has been a server\u2019s dream. Just ten points lost between them on serve. As Auger Aliassime dumps a backhand into the net, we are off to a tiebreak. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-5* Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger Aliassime has served really well and executed his first forehand behind the serve so well, burying most short balls with conviction. He strings together another love hold, closing it off with a big unreturned serve out wide. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *5-5 Roberto Bautista Agut: A much-needed quick hold for Bautista Agut after wrestling with break point in his previous service game. Some great serving from the Spaniard and he finished with a big crosscourt forehand behind a big serve. We\u2019re not too far from a tiebreak now. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 5-4* Roberto Bautista Agut: The youngster has really found his way on serve. He slammed down his third ace to reach triple game point and eventually held to 15 by forcing a Bautista Agut backhand error after a frantic rally. The youngster continues to win plenty of these long exchanges against one of the most consistent players around and he should take a lot of heart from that. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *4-4 Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger Aliassime hadn\u2019t won a single return point after three return games, but in the fourth game he did so with aplomb, picking off a great overhead for a 15-30 lead. The Spaniard responded with an unreturned serve, but at 30-30 Auger-Aliassime came up with a brilliant forehand down the line passing shot to bring up break point. How did Bautista Agut respond? He slammed down a big unreturned serve to save the break point. It took Bautista Agut a couple of game points, but on the third deuce he connected with an incredible crosscourt forehand off a low slice. He finally scuppered the danger on his third game point by grinding Auger Aliassime down with some brutal, flat hitting, until the Canadian dumped a backhand into the net. The crowd roared, Feliciano Lopez thumped his chest. A brilliant hold. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 4-3* Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger Aliassime has found a nice rhythm on his serve and he puts together a second consecutive love hold, sealed with a big unreturned serve down the T. Conditions are so fast at Madrid\u2019s altitude which means that dominant serving is to be expected. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *3-3 Roberto Bautista Agut: For all his great work in his service games, Auger Aliassime is spraying a few too many errors on return. Bautista Agut picks up a third love hold to level the match after a series of forehand errors from Auger Aliassime. The Spaniard still hasn\u2019t dropped a point on his serve and the pressure returns to the youngster. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 3-2* Roberto Bautista Agut: The most impressive aspect of Auger Aliassime\u2019s breakthrough year has been his performances on clay and slower surfaces this year. He is putting those lessons into action against the defence of Bautista Agut in these long rallies today. He won another long rally at 15-0, ending the point with a wicked crosscourt forehand. From 30-0, he finished with a great backhand down the line winner followed by a big ace down the T. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *2-2 Roberto Bautista Agut: The Spaniard levels the set with another great love hold, sealed with a big unreturned serve. Before that, Auger Aliassime offered up three consecutive backhand errors to bring up 40-0. Too many gifts from the youngster. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 2-1* Roberto Bautista Agut: A pumped up Auger Aliassime digs out a brilliant hold from 0-30 down, his confidence building. The Spaniard opened with a brilliant crosscourt forehand return, forcing an error from the Canadian. A missed forehand from Auger-Aliassime brought up 0-30 and a loud \u201cvamos!\u201d The youngster responded well, winning a long physical rally with an inside out forehand winner to level the game at 30-30. Then at 30-30, Auger-Aliassime came up with the rally of the match, grinding out a forehand error after the longest point of all. He held with a big unreturned serve. These rallies are already long and they should suit the Spaniard. He will not be happy about that missed opportunity. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *1-1 Roberto Bautista Agut: The Spaniard responds with a solid hold of his own. The rallies are already longer on Bautista\u2019s serve and he is already showing his consistency, grinding a few forehand errors out of the Canadian. At 40-0, he slammed down an ace out wide to hold to love. Both players are off to a good start. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 1-0* Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger-Aliassime opened with a huge forehand down the line winner, then a he swept into the net and picked off a sweeet volley. After reaching 40-0, he double faulted and then shanked a forehand well long. But at 40-0, he slammed down an ace down the T. Plenty of conviction from the Canadian, but also some nerves. A good start. So, who will win this first rubber? Auger-Aliassime and Bautista Agut have never faced each other. The Spaniard is enjoying the best season of his career and he currently sits at his best ranking of 9. Bautista is such a unique player with extremely flat groundstrokes that almost never miss. His forehand is one of the best around and he backs it up with great movement and return. However, the Spaniard\u2019s Davis Cup record isn\u2019t the best. His Davis Cup record is just 7-6 and he has lost a few significant matches over the years, including earlier in the week against Andrey Rublev. This has been an incredible breakout year for Auger-Aliassime, who reached the top 20 earlier this year and reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final in March. The tennis season is so gruelling and he seemed to run out of gas in the final weeks. The Canadian will have to serve extremely well and control the match with his forehand, or else the Spaniard will break him down. This match comes with many more intangibles than a regular event. Auger-Aliassime has never competed under this amount of pressure before and he comes in undercooked. He hasn\u2019t played since early October after injuring his ankle and this is just his third Davis Cup match (his record is 1-1). For Bautista, this has clearly been a devastating week after his father passed away. He will be seeking solace at home on the tennis court. Roberto Bautista-Agut before the final: \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be amazing to play the final with our crowd. Happy with the situation of the team, happy about the effort of my teammates and hope to enjoy the final. If we can, we will take the win.\u201d The players are coming out. Felix Auger-Aliassime in his pre-match interview: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s historic for my part. My ankle has been great for the past week. I\u2019ve been on the sideline and ready to go all week.\u201d The new edition of the Davis Cup is partly run by Gerard Pique, so it should come as no surprise that Shakira is currently performing in the closing ceremony before the final. Play will begin shortly. Great Britain\u2019s Davis Cup captain speaks. The nominations are and we have a big shock. 19 year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime has been drafted in for his very first match of the week, replacing Vasek Pospisil. Pospisil has been incredible for Canada this week, winning his first three singles matches and leading the doubles team, but he did look quite exhausted in his 6-4 6-4 loss to Andrey Rublev yesterday. He also hurt his shin after colliding with the net post in doubles. Auger-Aliassime will face Roberto Bautista Agut who, as expected, will compete for the first time since his father passed away this week. If needed, Pospisil will likely to return to the court for the doubles. Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the title match of the Davis Cup Finals in Madrid. After all the arguments and discussion about the new era of this historic competition, this has been some week. There have been organisational issues, matches finishing past 4am, half-empty stadiums and plenty of valid criticisms of this abbreviated format, but the biggest takeaway is that tennis is tennis regardless of where it is played. As long as the core scoring system remains intact and the players care enough to produce their best, this sport is always going to be exciting and desperately tense. Few days of tennis this year have been as tense as yesterday\u2019s semi-finals, where Canada recovered from 0-1 down to vanquish Russia. First Denis Shapovalov edged out a three set win over Karen Khachanov, then Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil defeated Khachanov and Andrey Rublev in an excruciating third set tiebreak. Last night\u2019s tie between Great Britain and Spain produced three straight sets matches but somehow the stakes felt even higher, even more desperate, with Nadal almost single-handedly dragging Spain into the final. After Kyle Edmund\u2019s solid win over Feliciano Lopez, Nadal blitzed Dan Evans and then carried a struggling Lopez into the final with an incredible win over Neal Skupski and Jamie Murray 7-6(3) 7-6(8). In a year that Nadal won two Grand slams and finished as the oldest ever ATP year end number one, few moments have impressed as much as the way he saved Great Britain\u2019s set points in the second set tiebreak. So, here we are. The Spanish team was decimated yesterday after Lopez was forced to step in following the tragic death of Roberto Bautista Agut\u2019s father and injuries ruled out Pablo Carreno Busta and Marcel Granollers. We still await the official nominations but there are rumours that No 9 Bautista Agut, who returned to support his teammates yesterday from the bench, could return to the court today. The clear priority is his mental health, but if he does feel okay to play, it will clearly tip the scales heavily in Spain\u2019s favour. Across the net, Canada have played with only two players this week, Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil, and they have been spectacular. They will almost certainly rely on their two heroes again as they contest their first ever Davis Cup final. What a breakthrough year this has been for Canadian tennis, from their first ever Grand Slam champion in Bianca Andreescu to their rising stars on the ATP. A victory would be the perfect way to end it.",

      "bodyText": "Two cherished Spaniards, Rafael Nadal and Roberto Bautista Agut, beat Canada 2-0 to win the 2019 Davis Cup in front of a capacity home crowd on a night of soaring emotions in the aptly named Caja M\u00e1gica. Bautista Agut, whose tennis has uncannily intermingled with his personal life over the past 18 months, returned on Sunday evening after the death of his father on Thursday to win the first rubber, grinding down the outstanding teenager F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime 7-6 (3), 6-3 in an hour and 49 minutes and setting up Nadal to finish the job. The world No 1 ensured the doubles would not be needed when he overcame the spirited challenge of the promising Denis Shapovalov 6-3, 7-6 (7). In a tense finish Shapovalov saved two match points before Nadal forced a final tired forehand from him at the end of an exhausting week. It was Canada\u2019s first final after more than a century of trying, Spain\u2019s sixth Davis Cup triumph, Nadal\u2019s eighth win from eight matches here and his 31st win in a row in the competition. King Felipe was among the thousands present who acclaimed him but the decorated Mallorcan could lay claim to being the real King of Spain. His hair is thinning but his crown is secure. After going directly to his opponents\u2019 bench to shake hands, Nadal, who has lost one match in 15 years of Davis Cup competition, went centre court to drink the applause of the Spanish fans. Bautista Agut earlier struggled to contain his emotions as he was embraced by his teammates and cheered by those in the audience familiar with his difficult circumstances. \u201cIt was very special on the court today,\u201d he said of the reception. \u201cI just go out on the court and give my best. I am very happy that I could win.\u201d He rarely gives anything less than his best but sometimes that has been difficult for the immensely likeable man from Castell\u00f3n de la Plana. When he lost to Novak Djokovic in four sets in the third round of the French Open last year, a week after his mother died, Bautista Agut said: \u201cMy life is tennis. I\u2019m used to going inside the court and forgetting about my real life and try to do my work.\u201d Last summer at Wimbledon he reached the semi-finals against even his own expectations, again losing in four sets to Djokovic. Bautista Agut was so sure he could not go deep on the grass of the All England Club he had booked a bachelor party in Ibiza that week with friends while his fianc\u00e9e, Ana Bodi Tortosa \u2013 who was courtside on Sunday night \u2013 was being fitted for her wedding dress. They will marry this week. For Spain, victory put a seal of approval on the new format devised and executed by the Barcelona footballer Gerard Piqu\u00e9, who, like his friend Nadal, mixed tennis and football as a boy before devoting his talent to his chosen sport. Piqu\u00e9\u2019s idea of an 18-team finals week, mimicking the football World Cup, drained a lot of players of mental and physical energy, not to mention those hardcore fans who stayed to watch the many matches that finished after midnight. For Nadal, Bautista Agut and Spain, the wait for Sunday night was worth it. Feliciano Lopez said later of Nadal: \u201cRafa is a super hero. Last night and today again he does things the rest of us just don\u2019t do.\u201d",

There is a desperate need to help businesses invest, so confidence-boosting measures around training, science funding and local, but very important, issues like potholes will be welcomed.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen it comes to Brexit, business will only feel it is \u2018done\u2019 when they know the terms of new relationship with the EU, not before.

      "bodyText": "Business leaders gave the Tory manifesto a muted welcome, saying that its limited focus on skills, infrastructure and research were positive steps but cautioning that the wrong Brexit deal could hinder growth for a generation. The Conservatives\u2019 modest spending plans, amounting to \u00a32.9bn a year against \u00a382.9bn for Labour and \u00a362.9bn for the Lib Dems, were viewed as \u201ca pro-enterprise vision\u201d by business representatives. But in other sectors such as the NHS proposals drew a more muted response. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said that while the manifesto \u201cstruck some of the right notes\u201d businesses will be looking to see \u201cmore substantial measures to boost growth, enterprise and investment\u201d. Josh Hardie, deputy director-general at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), warned that the outlook for the economy was clouded by concerns over the UK crashing out of the EU following Brexit negotiations next year. \u201cBusinesses will be heartened by a pro-enterprise vision, while looking for even more ambition on areas such as access to skills, infrastructure and reaching net zero,\u201d said Hardie, who represents 190,000 mainly large and medium-sized businesses. \u201cBut the inconvenient truth remains: sustainable economic growth will be risked if there is a needless rush for a bare bones Brexit deal that would slow down our domestic progress for a generation.\u201d Like most business groups, the CBI has warned that a failure to complete a trade deal by next December will lead to Britain leaving without a deal unless ministers agree to an extension, which so far Johnson has ruled out. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said it was also concerned that trade negotiations with the EU would delay efforts to boost investment. Edwin Morgan, the IoD\u2019s director of policy, said: \u201cOn domestic policy, there is much for business to like, with a focus on skills, infrastructure and research. There is a desperate need to help businesses invest, so confidence-boosting measures around training, science funding and local, but very important, issues like potholes will be welcomed. \u201cWhen it comes to Brexit, business will only feel it is \u2018done\u2019 when they know the terms of new relationship with the EU, not before. There is still a long way to go, and the next government must put the needs of the economy first when negotiating on matters relating to trade and market access.\u201d The lobby group for the pharmaceutical industry, the ABPI, said pledges to increase public research spending to meet a target of 2.4% of GDP alongside plans to set up an \u201cinnovative medicines fund\u201d, and make the UK the leading global hub for life sciences would boost the industry. There was also praise from the road lobby for increased funding for repairs. Edmund King, president at the Automobile Association (AA), who has previously called the UK\u2019s potholed roads a national disgrace, said: \u201cMany local authorities are still struggling to keep up with damaged roads ravaged by the \u2018beast from the east\u2019 a couple of years ago. All road users will welcome a \u00a32bn four-year pledge to fill the potholes.\u201d Nurses\u2019 representatives were less complimentary, saying it was unclear where new recruits to the profession would come from. The government has also signalled that 19,000 of the 50,000 will be accounted for by the retention of nurses who it projected would otherwise have quit their posts. Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said there are currently 43,000 unfilled nursing posts, leaving a gaping hole in provision of nursing care. \u201cToday\u2019s commitment to recruit and retain 50,000 more nursing staff above and beyond the existing students completing degrees is the right level of aspiration. However, we need more detail of how and from where these future professionals are going to be found,\u201d she said. \u201cForcing would-be nurses to pay tuition fees has demonstrably failed in the last two years. With this announcement, Boris Johnson has not brought back the bursary \u2013 he is pledging to return one element of the package and keep the costly tuition fees in place.\u201d Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health trusts across the sector, said that with 100,000 vacancies across the NHS in England, the government will need to go further, as the Labour party and Liberal Democrats have done. \u201cAn additional 6,000 GPs and 6,000 primary care professionals would be a real boon, but they must come from somewhere, either through years of training or from overseas,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson gave a rambling answer about the hunting of the snark, Fermat\u2019s last theorem and croutons when he was asked to justify why the Conservative party masqueraded as an independent fact-checking service on Twitter. The prime minister struggled to answer when pressed by the Guardian on whether the stunt by the Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ) Twitter feed undermined trust in politics. At first, Johnson claimed the \u201cTwittersphere is not my province\u201d, despite his personal account tweeting many times a day to his 1.2m followers. He then claimed wrongly that \u201cLabour have some sort of operation which is very similar to this\u201d before saying he \u201chadn\u2019t really followed this Twitter stuff as much as others would like\u201d and would \u201capprise himself\u201d of the facts. Johnson then launched into a circuitous aside about how on the issue of trust there was one fact that should be found \u201clike the hunting of the snark\u201d or the \u201cquest for the answer of Fermat\u2019s last theorem\u201d, which was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s position on leaving the EU. He continued with his metaphors saying it was like the \u201criddle of the Sphinx or the Bermuda Triangle\u201d and ended with a comparison of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy to croutons in a minestrone soup. Corbyn has committed to negotiating a Brexit deal and then putting it to a second referendum in which he would remain neutral. The prime minister said finding Labour\u2019s Brexit policy was the \u201creal issue\u201d and asked the media to \u201credouble their efforts and send out search parties\u201d to find the truth. His answer avoided the issue of whether the Conservatives were wrong to rebrand the official Twitter account as factcheckUK during last week\u2019s televised debate. Following the move, Full Fact, an independent factchecking service, said it was \u201cinappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account factcheckUK during this debate.\u201d Twitter also issued a statement condemning CCHQ\u2019s behaviour and warning that any further attempts to \u201cmislead people\u201d during the election campaign would result in action.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 25 November. Top stories A cache of classified Chinese government papers has revealed the largest post-second world war mass incarceration of an ethno-religious minority, with more than a million of the nation\u2019s Muslim minorities believed to be interned in a vast chain of prison camps. Obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with the Guardian, the documents provide apparent confirmation that the Chinese state runs secret, involuntary camps for ideological \u201ceducation transformation\u201d, involving \u201ca strict system of total physical and mental control\u201d. Former camp inmates have detailed torture, rape and abuse claims, as well as reports of forced labour in Xinjiang province. Chinese authorities deny the existence of detention centres, claiming the camps are part of a focused crackdown on extremism and terrorism. As bushfires ravaged vast areas of Queensland a year ago, almost nobody noticed that world heritage-listed tropical rainforest was going up in flames. The conventional wisdom is that such vegetation is too wet for bushfires, but a new climate adaptation plan suggests that climate change has irreversibly changed this paradigm. \u201cWhen you have a 900,000-hectare world heritage area you assume there\u2019s an inbuilt resilience,\u201d says the chair of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, Leslie Shirreffs. \u201cBut that\u2019s without anticipating some of the extremes that are now happening.\u201d Hong Kong residents are turning out in unprecedented numbers for local elections that many are regarding as a proxy referendum on the political turmoil presently engulfing the city. More than 1.5 million people had already cast votes by early Sunday afternoon despite hour-long queues and the local councils being considered largely irrelevant bodies historically controlled by pro-Beijing groups. \u201cIf you are willing to march or protest in the streets, which requires blood and sweat and tears, it\u2019s much easier to walk downstairs and vote,\u201d said one man who requested anonymity. Nearly 400,000 new voters, many of them young, were added to the rolls during a last-minute surge in registrations. Australia The federal government will enter the final sitting fortnight of 2019 with two big-ticket items on its agenda \u2013 the repeal of medevac and increased scrutiny of unions. Either Pauline Hanson or Jacquie Lambie could prove crucial in supporting the passage of the two bills. ALP federal president Wayne Swan has branded comparisons between the Queensland Palaszczuk government and that of Bjelke-Petersen\u2019s \u201cridiculous and damaging\u201d, following criticism of the premier\u2019s measures against climate protesters. Westpac has released its response plan to Austrac\u2019s finding of systemic noncompliance with its legal requirements, with chairman Lindsay Maxsted reiterating the bank\u2019s \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d for the failings identified by the financial regulator. The world The chairman of the Trump impeachment inquiry has criticised former national security adviser John Bolton, claiming his failure to appear was because he \u201cwanted to wait [to release his] book instead of telling the American people what he knew\u201d. At least 23 people are believed dead following a plane crash in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It\u2019s the latest in a series of crashes involving Antonov planes in the conflict-wracked nation. One of Egypt\u2019s last remaining independent media outlets, Mada Masr, has been raided by security forces. Egypt is ranked 163/180 in the world for press freedom following extensive clampdowns since Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power in 2013. It has only taken 150 years, but the Vienna State Opera is set to stage an opera written by a woman \u2013 Olga Neuwirth\u2019s operatic version of Virginia Woolf\u2019s novel Orlando: A Biography. Recommended reads A major UN report has forecast that by 2030 Australia will be the sixth-largest producer of fossil fuels. And yet in a week in which it was announced that Sydney\u2019s dam had received 10% of its usual water inflows, prime minister Scott Morrison was out furiously peddling a great big climate lie, writes Booker-prize winning novelist, Richard Flanagan. \u201cMany political commentators tend to view Morrison as some political genius, the winner of the unwinnable election. But history may judge him differently: a Brezhnevian figure; the last of the dinosaurs, presiding over an era of stagnation at the head of a dying political class\u201d. There are few things as exposing as publishing a novel. \u201cFirst there is the conspicuous absence of reviews, publicity spots and invitations to literary festivals. Then there is the all-too-swift removal of your title from the glamorous New Release section,\u201d writes Ilka Tampke. But it\u2019s not the desire for recognition that drives writers: \u201cMost of us are motivated by the power of an idea, an image, a character, a world, a moral conundrum.\u201d So if a book fails to reach a wide audience it\u2019s not the wound to the ego that stings, it\u2019s the ending of a potentially fascinating conversation. Listen Angus Taylor and the series of incredible coincidences \u2013 it\u2019s like a Harry Potter novel, but about Australian politics. Earlier this year, the federal energy minister narrowly avoided an official inquiry into his dealings with a company currently under investigation for illegal land clearing. On this episode of Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates is joined by environment reporter Lisa Cox to discuss these links, and whether Taylor\u2019s explanations stack up. Sport An injury-time goal to Oliver McBurnie has denied Manchester United a dramatic comeback win away to Sheffield United, after Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side came from 2-0 down courtesy of teenagers Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood. They\u2019re the twin b\u00eate noires of world football \u2013 the VAR and IFAB\u2019s new handball rule. But in a corner of the world with little ability to change the global rules, is complaining about bad decisions actually just a smokescreen? Media roundup Asio is investigating stunning claims that a Chinese espionage ring attempted to win a seat in Australian federal parliament, reports the Sydney Morning Herald, a task made difficult by the death of the alleged Melbourne-based spy earlier this year. The abduction and murder of two Hunter Valley teenagers 40 years ago, believed to have been linked to Ivan Milat, have now been connected with a businessman on the Gold Coast, writes the Daily Telegraph.

I have never heard a word from Mr Abramovich: \u2018Let\u2019s get this ready for a sale,\u2019 or something. \u201cBecause of the political situation, there are people who think they might want to buy Chelsea football club at a bargain. We do get inquiries and we really have nothing to say to these people.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players\u2019 contracts, do we buy this player, do we sell this player, [Abramovich] was always intimately involved in that from day one and is just as intimately involved now.</p> <p>\u201cHe talks to Marina [Granovskaia] \u2013 the board member who supervises the football operation \u2013 several times a day, every day. Marina has been doing that for seven or eight years; that hasn\u2019t let up or changed at all.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the suggestion that the club appears to be on hold given Abramovich\u2019s absence and the mothballed stadium plans, Buck said: \u201cI understand what you are saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens in the next transfer window.\u2019 The point I am making \u2013 it\u2019s a glib one \u2013 if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it\u2019s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/13/chelsea-fc-to-partner-raf-museum-to-tell-jewish-veterans-stories\">Chelsea FC to partner RAF Museum to tell Jewish veterans' stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Buck acknowledged that the first-team opportunities Frank Lampard has given to the talented group of English graduates from Chelsea\u2019s academy is partly due to the two-window ban, imposed for multiple breaches of the registration rules for under-18 players from overseas. Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham all featured for England during this month\u2019s internationals against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p> <p>\u201cThe transfer ban has led to more opportunities for the young players,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that if there wasn\u2019t a transfer ban we might have splurged out on one or two or three players. So, yes, it was some of that; it was Frank Lampard, the players that were ready, a whole collection of things that resulted in where we are now. It makes Mr Abramovich very happy, because he is very interested in the academy. I would guess he\u2019s one of the very few owners that have been to lots of academy matches.\u201d</p> <p>The club are unable to make signings until February 2020 after they were found guilty by Fifa of breaking transfer regulations relating to minors. Chelsea have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport to have it lifted in time for the January transfer window.</p> <p>Buck declined to discuss Chelsea\u2019s appeal of the ban: \u201cThis is a subject difficult to comment on, it\u2019s in litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club feels Fifa was wrong, and that we did abide by the regulations.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Roman Abramovich has rejected bidders who think they can buy Chelsea at a \u201cbargain\u201d price and remains just as involved in the club as he has ever been, the chairman Bruce Buck says. In an interview with the Guardian about the Premier League club\u2019s current status and plans, Buck said the Chelsea owner had no plans to sell despite having apparently not been to a home match since the spring of 2018 when the British government delayed renewing his visa. Abramovich withdrew his UK visa application after the delay, which was widely understood to be part of the retaliation against Vladimir Putin, whom the British government directly blamed for the Novichok poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Abramovich took Israeli citizenship in May 2018, and cancelled the new 60,000-seat, \u00a31bn stadium development long planned for Stamford Bridge. But of suggestions that Abramovich may be planning to sell, Buck said: \u201cSo far as I know, absolutely not; to the contrary. I have never heard a word from Mr Abramovich: \u2018Let\u2019s get this ready for a sale,\u2019 or something. \u201cBecause of the political situation, there are people who think they might want to buy Chelsea football club at a bargain. We do get inquiries and we really have nothing to say to these people. \u201cIn terms of being involved, in looking at new players, talking about whether to extend players\u2019 contracts, do we buy this player, do we sell this player, [Abramovich] was always intimately involved in that from day one and is just as intimately involved now. \u201cHe talks to Marina [Granovskaia] \u2013 the board member who supervises the football operation \u2013 several times a day, every day. Marina has been doing that for seven or eight years; that hasn\u2019t let up or changed at all.\u201d Responding to the suggestion that the club appears to be on hold given Abramovich\u2019s absence and the mothballed stadium plans, Buck said: \u201cI understand what you are saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens in the next transfer window.\u2019 The point I am making \u2013 it\u2019s a glib one \u2013 if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it\u2019s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.\u201d Buck acknowledged that the first-team opportunities Frank Lampard has given to the talented group of English graduates from Chelsea\u2019s academy is partly due to the two-window ban, imposed for multiple breaches of the registration rules for under-18 players from overseas. Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham all featured for England during this month\u2019s internationals against Montenegro and Kosovo. \u201cThe transfer ban has led to more opportunities for the young players,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that if there wasn\u2019t a transfer ban we might have splurged out on one or two or three players. So, yes, it was some of that; it was Frank Lampard, the players that were ready, a whole collection of things that resulted in where we are now. It makes Mr Abramovich very happy, because he is very interested in the academy. I would guess he\u2019s one of the very few owners that have been to lots of academy matches.\u201d The club are unable to make signings until February 2020 after they were found guilty by Fifa of breaking transfer regulations relating to minors. Chelsea have appealed to the court of arbitration for sport to have it lifted in time for the January transfer window. Buck declined to discuss Chelsea\u2019s appeal of the ban: \u201cThis is a subject difficult to comment on, it\u2019s in litigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club feels Fifa was wrong, and that we did abide by the regulations.\u201d",

I\u2019m back from my jaunt to Strictly; Ella and I had a lovely time. Huge thanks to Alex for being an excellent stand-in, I\u2019m now back on the liveblog sofa until the glitterball is lifted on 14<sup>th</sup> December. </p> <p>So, here are my top five bits of last night\u2019s trip to Elstree: </p> <ul> <li>Bruno\u2019s opening song, which I had to listen to 2.5 times. During the second recording Johannes fell over (GASP) so they had to start again. However it was a camptastic two fingers up to The 189, so more pink feathers please</li> <li>It was also a time filler because the traditional Week 10 dance-a-thon is DEAD. No more Pasodoble-thon, Lindyhop-athon, or any other Guff-athon. All things considered, I\u2019ll take Bruno. </li> <li>Dick &amp; Dom played BOGIES in the Strictly studio during the interval, and it was excellent</li> <li>Didn\u2019t see a single step of Kelvin and Oti\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice, as I was sat behind the kitchen. Lovely joinery on the plywood backing. Clapped along like a seal nonetheless, then watched it on iPlayer this morning. </li> <li>And finally, my absolute fave bit of last night was the recording of tonight\u2019s musical interlude. I beg you not to miss it. </li> </ul> <p>Obviously I already know the outcome of tonight\u2019s dance-off, but I will keep proceedings spoiler-free. Kick off is at 7.15, see you then!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd9925c8f083aa6d5789e6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-23T20:12:25.990Z\">8.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Michael McIntyre\u2019s now on the TV which probably means it\u2019s time to go to the pub.

So that\u2019s it for another week on Strictly! Thanks for joining in, and thanks again to Alex for facilitating my Elstree jaunt yesterday \u2013 he\u2019s @alexneedham74 on Twitter, and I\u2019m @heidistephens. Next week is MUSICALS WEEK, which is basically Movie Week with considerably fewer dances. Curtain up is at 7.10pm, so I\u2019ll see you then! Have a great week, Hx We get a highlight of Saffron and AJ\u2019s best bits - it\u2019s very clear that Strictly has been a huge deal for Saffron, and she should be hugely proud of how far she\u2019s come. I do worry that she might struggle with re-entry to her old life, which mostly seems to involve making vlogs with titles like \u2018I ate only with chopsticks for 24 hours\u2019 and \u2018I went to the worst rated nail salon in my city\u2019. I hope she has good people looking out for her (and her nails). All the judges save Karim and Amy, which means SAFFRON AND AJ are leaving the Strictly dancefloor. Craig manages to take his trademark honesty to the next level with \u2018tonight was kind of easy for me\u2019, which I\u2019m not sure was required. Incidentally, this the third year in a row that AJ has been booted out after dancing a Samba. We should consider the possibility that AJ is either a) doing the Samba wrong or b) using it as a secret signal to the judges that he\u2019s had enough. Time for Karim and Amy\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice again. It\u2019s a bit frenetic for my tastes, and like a lot of contemporary dance features rather too much running about. That said, Karim\u2019s dance talent is undeniable and he absolutely doesn\u2019t deserve to be the bottom two. Dance-off time! I watched this Samba again this morning, and the best thing by far is the fraggle dress. No less stompy this time round, although Saffron is putting a brave face on it. Tess manages to stand in the vicinity of 26-year-old Karim without squidging his cheeks and commenting on this \u2018liddle face\u2019, which is very restrained of her. So who is joining Saffron and AJ in this week\u2019s dance off? Chris and Karen are safe, along with (SHOCKED FACES ALL ROUND) Alex and Neil! Which means KARIM AND AMY are in the dance off, which is unexpected and caused plenty of gasps in the studio last night. I\u2019m assuming a lot of people used their votes last night to save an undermarked Alex and Neil. Dance debrief time! By this point I\u2019d been in a very warm studio for over five hours, with the dance-off still to go and the prospect of a two-hour drive home. I needed a wee and a sandwich and was very much not interested in the finer details of Saffron\u2019s Samba. Time for a dance interlude, featuring The Greatest Dancer winner Ellie, who was coached by Strictly\u2019s own Oti Mabuse. Part of her prize was to perform on Strictly \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if this is dance or rhythmic gymnastics, but she is only 15 and undeniably bendy. Kelvin convincing his dad that he was going to part of his dance this week is both evil and brilliant. But mostly evil. Saffron gets a bit tearful once again, having realised that her millions of YouTube followers are entirely unreliable when it comes to a 15-minute live voting window. So who is through to next week\u2019s musicals special? Emma and Anton are safe, which prompts Anton to give Emma the Heimlich manoeuvre. Kelvin and Oti are also safe. First couple in the bottom two \u2013 SAFFRON AND AJ. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised, that Samba looked like she was treading grapes. LAST NIGHT ON STRICTLY: Saffron and AJ Walking Through Treacle, Alex being too tight downstairs (wait until you\u2019ve had two kids, love), Kelvin and Oti making tea to Northern Soul, Emma and Captain Von Anton doing a gaptastic Quickstep (also bonus points for Shady Shirley\u2019s \u2018I didn\u2019t recognise you, you look absolutely stunning\u2019), and Chris and Karen\u2019s Anger Management Paso (which I actually really liked). Feel like Motsi\u2019s hair needs a special shout-out this week. It\u2019s very Chaka Khan, and I am here for the hotpants. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a section of broken copper piping, Claudia in a metallic sack. Scrap value: \u00a30. And we\u2019re off! We open with a musical interlude \u2013 this week it\u2019s Andrea Bocelli, accompanied by the London Community Gospel Choir and a bonus string section. I was lucky enough to see this performed twice last night, and it was stunning both times. As an added bonus, five pro couples are giving us bedsheet contempo-waft. For those of you asking what Dick &amp; Dom\u2019s Bogies is, I give you this from Wikipedia: The most infamous part of Dick and Dom in da Bungalow was a pre-recorded game called Bogies. In this game, Dick and Dom situated themselves in a quiet public place such as a museum or restaurant and took turns to shout \u201cbogies\u201d at gradually increasing volumes, until one of them did not shout as loud as the other (judged by the Bogeyometer, or Snotometer, which appears on screen to rank the bogey), or quit due to embarrassment. Caught the Countryfile Casual Weather earlier \u2013 a sterling effort from Alina Jenkins in a denim shirt, but there was evidence of ironing and her hair has clearly never had a roll in a hayloft. 5/10. Evening all! I\u2019m back from my jaunt to Strictly; Ella and I had a lovely time. Huge thanks to Alex for being an excellent stand-in, I\u2019m now back on the liveblog sofa until the glitterball is lifted on 14th December. So, here are my top five bits of last night\u2019s trip to Elstree: Bruno\u2019s opening song, which I had to listen to 2.5 times. During the second recording Johannes fell over (GASP) so they had to start again. However it was a camptastic two fingers up to The 189, so more pink feathers please It was also a time filler because the traditional Week 10 dance-a-thon is DEAD. No more Pasodoble-thon, Lindyhop-athon, or any other Guff-athon. All things considered, I\u2019ll take Bruno. Dick &amp; Dom played BOGIES in the Strictly studio during the interval, and it was excellent Didn\u2019t see a single step of Kelvin and Oti\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice, as I was sat behind the kitchen. Lovely joinery on the plywood backing. Clapped along like a seal nonetheless, then watched it on iPlayer this morning. And finally, my absolute fave bit of last night was the recording of tonight\u2019s musical interlude. I beg you not to miss it. Obviously I already know the outcome of tonight\u2019s dance-off, but I will keep proceedings spoiler-free. Kick off is at 7.15, see you then! Michael McIntyre\u2019s now on the TV which probably means it\u2019s time to go to the pub. Thanks very much for keeping me company. Heidi will be back for the results show, hopefully with some gossip from the Strictly studio, which is where she is right now. Keep dancing! So the votes are open! My prediction for the dance-off is probably Alex v Emma but the dance gods move in mysterious ways. Kelvin and Karim both look like nailed-on certs for the final. But who can say? The scores: 8-8-8-7. Chris is pretty thrilled with that. Meanwhile, the audience erupts in boos. Bruno says Chris went for the kill but the lines were lacking and he wasn\u2019t always on the beat. Craig thought it was \u201cfull of menace, darling\u201d. Motsi says it gave her goosebumps \u2013 she adored it. Shirley applauds the sophistication and says he \u201cdid well in places\u201d though there were missteps. But she loved it. Chris is in a sheer shirt and it all has plenty of attack and impressively crisp fast footwork. He\u2019s also doing a decent job of being menacing. The band are really giving it loads, is there a whole orchestra back there? It\u2019s the last couple \u2013 Chris and Karen with the paso doble in which he has to be \u201cevil Chris\u201d. Emma says it was way better in rehearsal - oh dear. The scores: 6-8-7-8 I feel that Motsi should probably avoid upstairs/downstairs metaphors. Shirley says Emma looks stunning, but there were some timing and footwork issues. Bruno says she went wrong and it nearly gave him a heart attack but next time (in the dance-off?) it will be spotless. Craig says it went pear-shaped but \u201cwell done anyway\u201d. Motsi says her frame was great (\u201cupstairs was brilliant\u201d) but the feet were ... less so. You can\u2019t go wrong with Diamonds Are a Girl\u2019s Best Friend. Or can you? Emma\u2019s in shocking pink and they\u2019re doing it in the Moulin Rouge arrangement. It looks pretty light and slick to me. Well done Emma and Anton! It\u2019s Emma and Anton who are doing the quickstep. She got a 10 last week so hopes she\u2019s peaking at the right moment. The scores: 8-10-10-10. Go Kelvin! Motsi says that loved it and that it felt so real. Shirley says he\u2019s made everyone proud. Bruno says it was clever and charming. Craig says he loves a bit of northern soul but he didn\u2019t like the part set in the kitchen. But overall a thumbs up. And he\u2019s doing the dance in Oxford bags! There\u2019s no chalk on the floor but it\u2019s got plenty of Northern Soul flair and is absolutely joyous to watch. Some splendid spins and kicks too. It\u2019s Kelvin and Oti who are also doing a couple\u2019s choice \u2013 to the Northern Soul classic Do I Love You (Indeed I Do) by Frank Wilson which reveals Kelvin as a man of taste. It\u2019s dedicated to his lovely missus Liz. It turns out that their microphones got entangled on the dancefloor which explains a few things. The scores: 4-7-7-8 which is pretty harsh. Craig says it was heavy and flat-footed (which shows how much I know about this dance). It even looked as though she was churning butter, Craig adds to boos, and that she was too tense. Motsi says \u201cYou need to be tight downstairs\u201d, a double entendre which delights the audience. Shirley says the emotional connection was outstanding but that there were mistakes. Bruno says it was scorching hot and she got into the role, that she\u2019s different every week. So a bit of a mixed bag really. Alex and Neil are doing a very foxy Argentine tango to INXS\u2019s Never Tear Us Apart with some mega lifts and super-crisp footwork. The kicks and flicks are off the charts and, apart from one bit at the end where they lost their grip of each other, it was pretty amazing. Alex has gone to get pepped up at Arsenal on the VT. Alex and Neil are doing the Argentine tango. Obviously most of you have passed out by now after draining your house of booze in response to Bruno\u2019s rendition of Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You. Poor Karim, he nearly had another \u201cViennese waltz moment\u201d ie blubbed. Scores: 9-9-10-10. Woop! Bruno roars that it was brilliant, mixing the sharp and angular into flowing movement. He even invokes the great choreographer Mark Morris which is praise indeed. Craig says it had great leaps and turns but that it was too coldly technical and lacked emotional content, which means that he doesn\u2019t give him 10s. The audience gasps and Karim said \u201cI\u2019m trying so hard\u201d \u2013 oh dear. Motsi says Karim\u2019s technique is unbelievable but perhaps slightly implies that she agrees with Craig. Shirley says the feel was more about internal sensitivity and she loved it. Hurrah! Having said all that, this is quite a strange performance \u2013 a bit of a ballet/interpretive dance number masquerading as a rumba. There were some very impressive leaps from Karim but I didn\u2019t love that. It was a bit like the odd Stranger Things-inspired tango from Halloween night rather than his best stuff. It\u2019s Karim and Amy. Have to say that he\u2019s my favourite - he\u2019s a brilliant dancer and adorbs to boot. In the pre-performance VT he\u2019s talking about his family while some very cute childhood pictures flash up. Unless he drops a clanger in the manner of the week before last when all his footwork went wrong, I think he\u2019ll go the distance. Tameka Empson from EastEnders and 3 Non Blondes is reading out the T&amp;Cs. This is usually the point at which I go to the loo or something tbh. The scores are 5-7-7-7 which isn\u2019t great. Is Saffron toast? Shirley said it was nice and bright but there were some issues. Bruno said it had a lot of gusto but the rolls weren\u2019t fluid enough and the accents were on the down rather than the up (whatever that means). Craig though the footwork was sloppy and that it looked heavy. Motsi, whose outfit tonight is simply extraordinary, said that there was something amiss with Saffron\u2019s bounce. And we\u2019re introducing the band. Dave March\u2019s combo can play anything you can throw at them \u2013 hats off. So Saffron is in a maibou feathered creation and samba-ing to Walking On Sunshine. It looks a little laboured to my eyes although there are some nice arm movements and the chemistry between her and AJ is always a delight. So it\u2019s Saffron and AJ up first with a samba. They were in the dance-off last week \u2013 can they work the magic tonight? She\u2019s rehearsing in front of her social media followers for a boost ... not sure that\u2019s the effect it would have on me. Tess and Claudia dress watch \u2013 BOTH in sparkles and off-the-shoulder numbers. Claudia in black, Tess in a yet more pink. And why the heck not? Lolololol This is brilliantly awful. And not in Bruno\u2019s key at all, bless him. It\u2019s making the Boytown Gang\u2019s famously camp version sound like Bruce Springsteen. OMG it\u2019s Bruno doing Andy Williams\u2019s Can\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You surrounded by dancers in pink. For a singer, he makes a great judge. OK, we\u2019ve got a slow-motion montage from Blackpool. Six couples left! And don\u2019t they look lovely ... I think we also need a drink if there\u2019s any kind of awkward allusion to the Curse of Strictly (so far dormant this year) in the way Motsi managed when she said to Neil and Alex, inspired by her quick dance with Kevin while Neil was injured, \u201cIt\u2019s as if you had an affair!\u201d I\u2019m getting a strong sense from some of the comments that I should be organising some kind of Strictly bingo/drinking game. So how about: Motsi offers her false nails to one of the contestants in lieu of superlatives \u2013 drink! Claudia\u2019s eye-makeup is declared the blackest substance on earth by Anish Kapoor \u2013 drink! Someone makes it extremely obvious that they have the hots for Kelvin (declared \u201cextremely fit\u201d this morning by Emma my hairdresser) \u2013 drink! Bruno Tonioli performs a song \u2013 drink the entire cocktail cabinet dry (warning: this is actually happening) Good evening sparkle gang \u2013 Heidi\u2019s watching Strictly from Elstree studios tonight, the lucky thing, so I\u2019m stepping in as a substitute. Please be gentle with me. Last week saw Michelle Visage knocked out after a couple\u2019s choice dance which was un hommage to Madonna\u2019s performance of Vogue at the MTV awards in 1990, in which Madge vogued dressed as Marie Antoinette. While on paper this should have been camp heaven, in practice it was a bit of a dud and saw Michelle out on her ear, crying into her candyfloss with only the Blackpool illuminations to console her (maybe). She was up against Saffron and AJ in the dance-off, which makes you wonder whether the social media star\u2019s days are numbered. I\u2019m also quite mystified by the persistence of Chris \u2013 he\u2019s not all that great a hoofer and, let\u2019s be honest, a bit annoying. Perhaps it goes without saying that I\u2019d never bloody heard of either of them before this show. (Chris and his wife Rosie have a podcast incidentally.) Speaking of AJ, I very much enjoyed his appearance on the final episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK with his brother Curtis (the latter of Love Island notoriety), in which he tried to choreograph the three remaining queens. His somewhat exacting teaching style did not go down well with hard-bitten glam Scouser The Vivienne, who observed: \u201cAJ\u2019s a feisty little thing, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019ll kick him into the fuckin\u2019 lighting rig if he doesn\u2019t cut it out.\u201d Not the kind of lip, you assume, he gets from Saffron. Strictly has been in the news this week \u2013 it turned out that 189 people had complained about a routine in which two men \u2013 Johannes Radebe and Graziano di Prima \u2013 danced together. Presumably they were concerned that this might compromise the rugged heterosexuality of the rest of the show.

For 15 years he was welcomed into London and Premier League football, garlanded as his money bought Chelsea stars and trophies, and few questions were asked about him or the source of his billions. Then last year the British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/21/roman-abramovich-thought-to-be-caught-up-in-uk-visa-crackdown\" title=\"\">delayed renewing Abramovich\u2019s Tier 1 investor visa</a>, as part of its suddenly keen concentration on Russian presence and money in the UK.

At the same time he abruptly cancelled the 60,000-seat new stadium which had been long in expensive development and for now Stamford Bridge is remaining in its somewhat tired state, significantly smaller than the gleaming, expanded homes of Chelsea\u2019s top-six rivals. In the 18 months since Abramovich is thought not to have been to a Chelsea match in the UK.</p> <p>The club\u2019s chairman. Bruce Buck, talking to the Guardian in one of the east stand hospitality boxes, said that despite the impression Abramovich deeply resents his public snub and the club seeming to be on hold, the owner is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d considering selling Chelsea. Abramovich is still intensely involved in daily detail, Buck says, particularly the football itself, players\u2019 contracts and the academy, and has said nothing about selling.</p> <p>\u201cSo far as I know, absolutely not; to the contrary,\u201d Buck said. \u201cI have never heard a word from Mr Abramovich: \u2018Let\u2019s get this ready for a sale,\u2019 or something. Roman is \u2013 I\u2019m not lying to you \u2013 as involved as I said he is and is I believe as in love with the club as he was on 1 July 2003 [when he bought Chelsea]. And that\u2019s really all I know about selling the club.\u201d</p> <p>The deepest contradiction about this apparent standoff is the idea, prompted by the government\u2019s frostiness, that there was suddenly something mysterious about Abramovich\u2019s wealth or his good relationship with Putin. There has never been any mystery about the source of Abramovich\u2019s billions, the means by which he made it in the lawless Russia of the 1990s, or his good relations with Putin. It was then extraordinarily well documented in a British high court judgment which set it all out in 2012.</p> <p>The detail has been there all along. But with London opening its arms to Russian money, and Abramovich portrayed as an enigmatic benefactor in his box at Chelsea, few in Britain have been inclined to look at it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac6abe0335049e53edec7fac74e1f98ab5f317f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac6abe0335049e53edec7fac74e1f98ab5f317f0/0_0_3394_2203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abramovich on a previous visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem old city in February 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abramovich on a visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem old city in February 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orel Cohen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How to make billions</strong></h2> <p>When read in full, <a href=\"http://cisarbitration.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Decision-Abramovich-vs.-Berezovsky.pdf\">the 500-page court judgment by Mrs Justice Gloster</a> is remarkable on three levels. First, that it so straightforwardly chronicles the political and physical protection, rigged auctions and good relations with Putin which enabled Abramovich to access an oligarch\u2019s fortune in Russia and maintain it. Second, that Abramovich openly presented his <em>krysha</em> arrangements (\u201croof\u201d in Russian, meaning political influence to secure business advancement)<strong> </strong>\u2013 with another Russian oligarch of the time, Boris Berezovsky \u2013 positively, as his actual case in court, because it was how \u201cbusiness was done\u201d. Third, that the British high court documented it all with a kind of approval, including arrangements to \u201clegalise\u201d Abramovich\u2019s huge payments for protection to Berezovsky and to his partner, a Georgian \u201ctough guy\u201d Badri Patarkatsishvili, which otherwise risked being considered money-laundering.</p> <p>Gloster found in favour of Abramovich in his defence to the $5bn lawsuit brought against him in London by Berezovsky, who had fallen perilously out of favour with Putin. Berezovksy claimed Abramovich had intimidated him into accepting only $1.3bn for his half share of the vast oil company Sibneft, which they had formed in 1995 through their association and Berezovsky\u2019s closeness to Boris Yeltsin. Abramovich argued they never had a formal agreement to share ownership 50-50, that Berezovsky had supplied him with political influence, and Patarkatsishvili with physical protection, and so the $1.3bn had been Berezovsky\u2019s final payoff. The Judge found against Berezovsky\u2019s claim that Abramovich had intimidated him.</p> <p>The judgment sets out clearly the context for Abramovich\u2019s rise and that of the other oligarchs: the tragedy of Russia after communism\u2019s final collapse in 1992, when there was no orderly transition to western-style democracy and a corporate economy.</p> <p>Instead, Gloster observed, \u201cRussia became Europe\u2019s \u2018Wild East,\u2019\u201d with \u201cimmense social upheaval, the partial collapse of old structures of authority, the enfeeblement and the impoverishment of the state and the disappearance of the rule of law.\u201d</p> <p>Abramovich started working life as a mechanic, then completed courses in engineering and law, and he was 28, a \u201cmoderately successful businessman,\u201d mostly in petrol trading, when in December 1994 he first met Berezovsky on a yacht cruise in the Caribbean.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mr Abramovich enjoyed very good relations with President Putin and the Kremlin</p> <footer> <cite>Mrs Justice Gloster</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Berezovsky was a former scientist and celebrated mathematician who had become wealthy through car dealerships and banking as Russia\u2019s old structures disintegrated. In the violent, administrative chaos he had worked his way into Yeltsin\u2019s inner circle and attained political significance.</p> <p>Abramovich characterised his relationship with Berezovsky in his evidence to the court as \u201c<em>krysha</em>\u201d \u2013 \u201croof\u201d in Russian. It meant political influence to secure his business advancement, and Abramovich said that his <em>krysha</em> relationship with Berezovsky also included necessary physical protection provided by Patarkatsishvili.</p> <p>Gloster found for Abramovich, that his relationship with Berezovsky \u201cwas founded principally on political <em>krysha</em> or protection,\u201d not a 50-50 partnership.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52c2aa0a9ba20c58ca7a30e325272c5bcc0960a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52c2aa0a9ba20c58ca7a30e325272c5bcc0960a5/168_172_1767_1765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich in the State Duma in Moscow, June 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich in the State Duma in Moscow, June 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SVF2/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The judgment makes it clear that Sibneft, the oil giant which made Abramovich a billionaire, was created by Yeltsin because Berezovsky promised he would use some of the proceeds to support the president with TV propaganda in Russia\u2019s 1996 election. </p> <p>By decree Yeltsin in August 1995 merged the oil producer and refinery, creating the huge Sibneft, immediately one of Russia\u2019s largest companies, to be 51% owned by the state, 49% sold by auction.</p> <p>The way Abramovich obtained control is set out in the judgment; initially his route was through one of the notorious \u201cloans-for-shares\u201d schemes, for the right to manage the government\u2019s 51% of Sibneft. In the loans-for-shares auction Abramovich and Berezovsky made a joint bid of $100.3m, a very large amount of money to raise in Russia at a time when western banks and investors were avoiding involvement in the country.</p> <p>The judgment says of this price, however, that Abramovich, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili \u201ceffectively \u2026 had persuaded other potential bidders, by various means, either not to bid at all, or to put in bids of lesser amount.\u201d </p> <p>Abramovich next bought that 51% in another auction process in May 1997, after Yeltsin\u2019s government defaulted on repaying the $100.3m loan. Abramovich and Berezovsky\u2019s company NFK, which had been managing the stake, held the auction and sold it to a newly formed Abramovich company, FNK, for $110m plus a number of additional commitments which added to the overall cost.</p> <p>Abramovich bought the overwhelming majority of the remaining 49% in Sibneft via three auctions in 1995 and 1996, in which, the judgement says, he \u201cexploited that opportunity\u201d by using Sibneft\u2019s own money to secure financing, although he also used a small sum from his own company, Runicom. No suggestion was made that this was unlawful as a matter of Russian law or otherwise commercially inappropriate.<strong> </strong>Sibneft was a vast oil company, integrated from producing crude to refining it, although Abramovich and his management did have to significantly improve its operations and \u201ctransformed Sibneft from a loss-making Soviet-style bundle of assets into a competitive, profitable, modern corporation.\u201d</p> <p>Within just three years Sibneft was making a $315m profit; in 2000 the profit was $675m. Berezovsky wanted money immediately to fund the ORT TV station and support Yeltsin politically, and Abramovich was able to pay him huge sums: approximately $760m between 1995 and 2000.</p> <h2><strong>Oligarchs and the president</strong></h2> <p>The judgment gives a flavour of Putin\u2019s ruthlessness as he rose through heading Russia\u2019s security service to senior political positions, then in May 2000 became president. At a meeting he held with oligarchs in July 2000, shortly after he was inaugurated, Putin was reported to have told them he would not review or try to undo the privatisations and auctions which enriched them and outraged many in Russia\u2019s population if they did not oppose him in politics.</p> <p>Berezovsky fatefully did criticise and oppose Putin; in August 2000 ORT broadcast criticism of Putin\u2019s handling of the Kursk submarine disaster, in which 118 men were killed.</p> <p>Two months later Putin said in an interview in Le Figaro, referring to the oligarchs: \u201cThe state is holding a big club in its hands, which it will use only once. To deliver a crushing blow on the head.\u201d</p> <p>Just four days after that criminal charges were announced against Berezovsky in relation to alleged fraud at the Aeroflot airline. He fled to France and was ultimately given asylum in Britain.</p> <p>Abramovich has never criticised Putin and from early on was involved in activities which pleased him, such as becoming the governor of the remote and impoverished Chukotka region in 2000, which he modernised, spending large sums of money on public projects. Abramovich even bought Berezovsky\u2019s stake in ORT in 2000 to neutralise the criticism of Putin. He explained \u201cI would suffer personally and most importantly Sibneft as a company would not be stable\u201d if Berezovsky did not stop using the TV station to criticise Putin\u2019s government.</p> <p>Gloster noted of Abramovich\u2019s relationship with Putin that he was not in the \u201cinner circle\u201d, nor was he in a position to manipulate or otherwise influence Putin, but that: \u201cIt was clear from the evidence that \u2026 Mr Abramovich enjoyed very good relations with President Putin and others in power at the Kremlin \u2026 It was also clear that Mr Abramovich had privileged access to President Putin.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ce40ba7d0f2515d5c15fb858c122e2a0fa86d47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ce40ba7d0f2515d5c15fb858c122e2a0fa86d47/0_0_2450_1590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin meets with Abramovich at the Kremlin in May 2005.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin meets with Abramovich at the Kremlin in May 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Itar-Tass/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abramovich agreed to pay Berezovsky the $1.3bn in January 2001; Berezovsky had fled Russia by then and, following a meeting with Patarkatsishvili at a luxury hotel at Courchevel, in the French Alps, Abramovich met with Berezovsky at Meg\u00e8ve heliport.</p> <p>Abramovich, denying Berezovsky\u2019s claim of a 50-50 agreement for the ownership of Sibneft, explained the payment as \u201cbuying myself my freedom\u201d from the <em>krysha</em> relationship. It was, he said, \u201can opportunity to close this particular chapter in my life.\u201d</p> <p>In 2003 Abramovich paid Patarkatsishvili $585m, which he said was for <em>krysha</em> protection in aluminium ventures. The court judgment includes a long analysis of how these payments were presented to satisfy western banks\u2019 anti-money laundering regulations. </p> <p>In 2005, just eight years after he bought Sibneft, Abramovich sold his stake to Gazprom, a company majority owned by Putin\u2019s government, for \u00a37.4bn, exponentially more than he paid for it.</p> <h2><strong>The Premier League</strong></h2> <p>Buck\u2019s law firm acted for Abramovich in the acquisition of Chelsea in 2003 and in the successful case against Berezovsky; he declined to comment on the case, the way Abramovich made his money, or his current visa issues, due to client confidentiality.</p> <p>About the Chelsea purchase Buck repeated the frequently told story that Abramovich had \u201crecently acquired\u201d a love for football after he went to a match, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/04/manchester-united-real-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">2003 Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford</a>, when Manchester United beat Real Madrid 4-3 but lost 6-5 on aggregate.</p> <p>After he decided to buy a club they hired Citibank as advisers; they held a review and suggested Abramovich should consider United, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur, or Chelsea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Recap: Sign up for our weekly roundup of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Recap: Sign up for our weekly roundup of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI can\u2019t quite remember the reason for [him choosing] Chelsea,\u201d Buck said, \u201cbut I assume that is where they saw the best opportunity balanced against the best price. Like when you\u2019re looking to buy anything.\u201d</p> <p>The Premier League at the time had no \u201cfit and proper person\u201d test for owners or directors of England\u2019s historic clubs. But if they had, Abramovich\u2019s record, with no convictions for any criminal offence, would not have prevented him taking over, injecting his multi-millions and changing the English game. Richard Scudamore, then the chief executive of the Premier League, valued the investment coming into clubs.</p> <p>If any questions were asked about Abramovich the league would \u2013 justifiably \u2013 point to the general welcome being afforded him in London, the property he was buying and ask on what basis football should make a different judgment.</p> <p>Buck says Abramovich told him and the other executives that he had three priorities when he bought Chelsea. The first was: \u201c\u2018Have success very promptly.\u2019 And that meant a lot of money in the early days invested in players.\u201d</p> <p>It is a stretch now to remember how alien it was to England\u2019s traditional football culture when Chelsea began to splurge on mostly overseas stars, funded by an owner with no previous connection to the club, to capture the game\u2019s highest prizes. In his second season, after hiring Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and signing for him Didier Drogba, Arjen Robben, Petr Cech \u2013 and Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira and Tiago Mendes, three Portuguese players represented by Jorge Mendes \u2013 plus several more stars and the wages to attract them, Chelsea were on their way to acquiring titles and recorded a financial loss of \u00a3141m.</p> <p>That was by far a record in football history until Manchester City lost \u00a3197m in 2010-11 . The second priority, Buck says, was to invest in the academy to foster success long-term. For years barely a single Chelsea youth player made it regularly into the first team until now, with the talents given their chance by Lampard, sparked by the transfer ban.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25b28ce99d278e0da9bde79bb0f7da3350aa1c49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b28ce99d278e0da9bde79bb0f7da3350aa1c49/0_0_4700_2283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still welcome at Stamford Bridge: A flag in the stands at the Europa League semi-final against Frankfurt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"486\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Still welcome at Stamford Bridge: A flag in the stands at the Europa League semi-final against Frankfurt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The third was \u201cto do something for the community in the broader sense\u201d, which Buck says informed the work of the Chelsea Foundation, in which the club spends 3% of its revenues, around \u00a312m-\u00a315m, on social projects, including initiatives to counter racism and antisemitism. These are continuing despite Abramovich\u2019s absence from the club and his representatives say that in Israel he is also involved in social projects and technology start-up companies.</p> <p>Abramovich\u2019s Israeli passport does entitle him to come to Britain and, although not to work directly for money, he can go to Chelsea and have meetings and watch matches if he wants to. Asked whether he put the stadium on hold in indignation at his treatment by the government, Buck says: \u201cHe put it on hold a few months after the incident in Salisbury; we can all draw our own conclusions as to whether that\u2019s related.\u201d</p> <p>He declined to say how Abramovich feels about being made unwelcome, after the UK accepted him and his money for so long. But the impression of Abramovich feeling unjustly targeted and rarely visiting, and the stadium project postponed, creates a perception that Chelsea is on hold and the young players are being given opportunities in that stasis.</p> <p>Buck says no and is emphatic that Abramovich is still committed to Chelsea: \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: let\u2019s see what happens in the next transfer window. The point I am making \u2013 it\u2019s a glib one \u2013 if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it\u2019s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 27 November 2019 to correct and clarify some factual matters.</p></li> <li><p>This article was amended following a legal complaint made on behalf of Roman Abramovich.</p></li> </ul>",

At the west London club which first imprinted an oligarch\u2019s stamp on English football, Chelsea\u2019s sparkling, homegrown version this season \u2013 a club legend appointed as manager promoting young players \u2013 is the unexpected result of fundamental contradictions running through the club. The most obvious is that Chelsea have effectively been forced to give these opportunities to teenagers who just months ago were pining for moves or loans to get some playing time. In February Fifa banned the club from making any new signings for two transfer windows after Chelsea were found to have serially breached the registration rules in the ferociously competitive trawl for under-18 players from overseas. The most striking is that Chelsea\u2019s owner, Roman Abramovich, the Russian multi-billionaire who has spent \u00a31.125bn in loans on the club since his transformational takeover in 2003, is never at Stamford Bridge these days to see his sparkling team. For 15 years he was welcomed into London and Premier League football, garlanded as his money bought Chelsea stars and trophies, and few questions were asked about him or the source of his billions. Then last year the British government delayed renewing Abramovich\u2019s Tier 1 investor visa, as part of its suddenly keen concentration on Russian presence and money in the UK. He appeared to have been caught up in Britain\u2019s retaliatory action aimed at the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, following the March 2018 outrage, the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Abramovich abandoned his UK application after that delay and two months later, in May last year, he took Israeli citizenship for which, being Jewish, he qualifies automatically. At the same time he abruptly cancelled the 60,000-seat new stadium which had been long in expensive development and for now Stamford Bridge is remaining in its somewhat tired state, significantly smaller than the gleaming, expanded homes of Chelsea\u2019s top-six rivals. In the 18 months since Abramovich is thought not to have been to a Chelsea match in the UK. The club\u2019s chairman. Bruce Buck, talking to the Guardian in one of the east stand hospitality boxes, said that despite the impression Abramovich deeply resents his public snub and the club seeming to be on hold, the owner is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d considering selling Chelsea. Abramovich is still intensely involved in daily detail, Buck says, particularly the football itself, players\u2019 contracts and the academy, and has said nothing about selling. \u201cSo far as I know, absolutely not; to the contrary,\u201d Buck said. \u201cI have never heard a word from Mr Abramovich: \u2018Let\u2019s get this ready for a sale,\u2019 or something. Roman is \u2013 I\u2019m not lying to you \u2013 as involved as I said he is and is I believe as in love with the club as he was on 1 July 2003 [when he bought Chelsea]. And that\u2019s really all I know about selling the club.\u201d The deepest contradiction about this apparent standoff is the idea, prompted by the government\u2019s frostiness, that there was suddenly something mysterious about Abramovich\u2019s wealth or his good relationship with Putin. There has never been any mystery about the source of Abramovich\u2019s billions, the means by which he made it in the lawless Russia of the 1990s, or his good relations with Putin. It was then extraordinarily well documented in a British high court judgment which set it all out in 2012. The detail has been there all along. But with London opening its arms to Russian money, and Abramovich portrayed as an enigmatic benefactor in his box at Chelsea, few in Britain have been inclined to look at it. How to make billions When read in full, the 500-page court judgment by Mrs Justice Gloster is remarkable on three levels. First, that it so straightforwardly chronicles the political and physical protection, rigged auctions and good relations with Putin which enabled Abramovich to access an oligarch\u2019s fortune in Russia and maintain it. Second, that Abramovich openly presented his krysha arrangements (\u201croof\u201d in Russian, meaning political influence to secure business advancement) \u2013 with another Russian oligarch of the time, Boris Berezovsky \u2013 positively, as his actual case in court, because it was how \u201cbusiness was done\u201d. Third, that the British high court documented it all with a kind of approval, including arrangements to \u201clegalise\u201d Abramovich\u2019s huge payments for protection to Berezovsky and to his partner, a Georgian \u201ctough guy\u201d Badri Patarkatsishvili, which otherwise risked being considered money-laundering. Gloster found in favour of Abramovich in his defence to the $5bn lawsuit brought against him in London by Berezovsky, who had fallen perilously out of favour with Putin. Berezovksy claimed Abramovich had intimidated him into accepting only $1.3bn for his half share of the vast oil company Sibneft, which they had formed in 1995 through their association and Berezovsky\u2019s closeness to Boris Yeltsin. Abramovich argued they never had a formal agreement to share ownership 50-50, that Berezovsky had supplied him with political influence, and Patarkatsishvili with physical protection, and so the $1.3bn had been Berezovsky\u2019s final payoff. The Judge found against Berezovsky\u2019s claim that Abramovich had intimidated him. The judgment sets out clearly the context for Abramovich\u2019s rise and that of the other oligarchs: the tragedy of Russia after communism\u2019s final collapse in 1992, when there was no orderly transition to western-style democracy and a corporate economy. Instead, Gloster observed, \u201cRussia became Europe\u2019s \u2018Wild East,\u2019\u201d with \u201cimmense social upheaval, the partial collapse of old structures of authority, the enfeeblement and the impoverishment of the state and the disappearance of the rule of law.\u201d Abramovich started working life as a mechanic, then completed courses in engineering and law, and he was 28, a \u201cmoderately successful businessman,\u201d mostly in petrol trading, when in December 1994 he first met Berezovsky on a yacht cruise in the Caribbean. Berezovsky was a former scientist and celebrated mathematician who had become wealthy through car dealerships and banking as Russia\u2019s old structures disintegrated. In the violent, administrative chaos he had worked his way into Yeltsin\u2019s inner circle and attained political significance. Abramovich characterised his relationship with Berezovsky in his evidence to the court as \u201ckrysha\u201d \u2013 \u201croof\u201d in Russian. It meant political influence to secure his business advancement, and Abramovich said that his krysha relationship with Berezovsky also included necessary physical protection provided by Patarkatsishvili. Gloster found for Abramovich, that his relationship with Berezovsky \u201cwas founded principally on political krysha or protection,\u201d not a 50-50 partnership. The judgment makes it clear that Sibneft, the oil giant which made Abramovich a billionaire, was created by Yeltsin because Berezovsky promised he would use some of the proceeds to support the president with TV propaganda in Russia\u2019s 1996 election. By decree Yeltsin in August 1995 merged the oil producer and refinery, creating the huge Sibneft, immediately one of Russia\u2019s largest companies, to be 51% owned by the state, 49% sold by auction. The way Abramovich obtained control is set out in the judgment; initially his route was through one of the notorious \u201cloans-for-shares\u201d schemes, for the right to manage the government\u2019s 51% of Sibneft. In the loans-for-shares auction Abramovich and Berezovsky made a joint bid of $100.3m, a very large amount of money to raise in Russia at a time when western banks and investors were avoiding involvement in the country. The judgment says of this price, however, that Abramovich, Berezovsky and Patarkatsishvili \u201ceffectively \u2026 had persuaded other potential bidders, by various means, either not to bid at all, or to put in bids of lesser amount.\u201d Abramovich next bought that 51% in another auction process in May 1997, after Yeltsin\u2019s government defaulted on repaying the $100.3m loan. Abramovich and Berezovsky\u2019s company NFK, which had been managing the stake, held the auction and sold it to a newly formed Abramovich company, FNK, for $110m plus a number of additional commitments which added to the overall cost. Abramovich bought the overwhelming majority of the remaining 49% in Sibneft via three auctions in 1995 and 1996, in which, the judgement says, he \u201cexploited that opportunity\u201d by using Sibneft\u2019s own money to secure financing, although he also used a small sum from his own company, Runicom. No suggestion was made that this was unlawful as a matter of Russian law or otherwise commercially inappropriate. Sibneft was a vast oil company, integrated from producing crude to refining it, although Abramovich and his management did have to significantly improve its operations and \u201ctransformed Sibneft from a loss-making Soviet-style bundle of assets into a competitive, profitable, modern corporation.\u201d Within just three years Sibneft was making a $315m profit; in 2000 the profit was $675m. Berezovsky wanted money immediately to fund the ORT TV station and support Yeltsin politically, and Abramovich was able to pay him huge sums: approximately $760m between 1995 and 2000. Oligarchs and the president The judgment gives a flavour of Putin\u2019s ruthlessness as he rose through heading Russia\u2019s security service to senior political positions, then in May 2000 became president. At a meeting he held with oligarchs in July 2000, shortly after he was inaugurated, Putin was reported to have told them he would not review or try to undo the privatisations and auctions which enriched them and outraged many in Russia\u2019s population if they did not oppose him in politics. Berezovsky fatefully did criticise and oppose Putin; in August 2000 ORT broadcast criticism of Putin\u2019s handling of the Kursk submarine disaster, in which 118 men were killed. Two months later Putin said in an interview in Le Figaro, referring to the oligarchs: \u201cThe state is holding a big club in its hands, which it will use only once. To deliver a crushing blow on the head.\u201d Just four days after that criminal charges were announced against Berezovsky in relation to alleged fraud at the Aeroflot airline. He fled to France and was ultimately given asylum in Britain. Abramovich has never criticised Putin and from early on was involved in activities which pleased him, such as becoming the governor of the remote and impoverished Chukotka region in 2000, which he modernised, spending large sums of money on public projects. Abramovich even bought Berezovsky\u2019s stake in ORT in 2000 to neutralise the criticism of Putin. He explained \u201cI would suffer personally and most importantly Sibneft as a company would not be stable\u201d if Berezovsky did not stop using the TV station to criticise Putin\u2019s government. Gloster noted of Abramovich\u2019s relationship with Putin that he was not in the \u201cinner circle\u201d, nor was he in a position to manipulate or otherwise influence Putin, but that: \u201cIt was clear from the evidence that \u2026 Mr Abramovich enjoyed very good relations with President Putin and others in power at the Kremlin \u2026 It was also clear that Mr Abramovich had privileged access to President Putin.\u201d Abramovich agreed to pay Berezovsky the $1.3bn in January 2001; Berezovsky had fled Russia by then and, following a meeting with Patarkatsishvili at a luxury hotel at Courchevel, in the French Alps, Abramovich met with Berezovsky at Meg\u00e8ve heliport. Abramovich, denying Berezovsky\u2019s claim of a 50-50 agreement for the ownership of Sibneft, explained the payment as \u201cbuying myself my freedom\u201d from the krysha relationship. It was, he said, \u201can opportunity to close this particular chapter in my life.\u201d In 2003 Abramovich paid Patarkatsishvili $585m, which he said was for krysha protection in aluminium ventures. The court judgment includes a long analysis of how these payments were presented to satisfy western banks\u2019 anti-money laundering regulations. In 2005, just eight years after he bought Sibneft, Abramovich sold his stake to Gazprom, a company majority owned by Putin\u2019s government, for \u00a37.4bn, exponentially more than he paid for it. The Premier League Buck\u2019s law firm acted for Abramovich in the acquisition of Chelsea in 2003 and in the successful case against Berezovsky; he declined to comment on the case, the way Abramovich made his money, or his current visa issues, due to client confidentiality. About the Chelsea purchase Buck repeated the frequently told story that Abramovich had \u201crecently acquired\u201d a love for football after he went to a match, the 2003 Champions League quarter-final at Old Trafford, when Manchester United beat Real Madrid 4-3 but lost 6-5 on aggregate. After he decided to buy a club they hired Citibank as advisers; they held a review and suggested Abramovich should consider United, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur, or Chelsea. \u201cI can\u2019t quite remember the reason for [him choosing] Chelsea,\u201d Buck said, \u201cbut I assume that is where they saw the best opportunity balanced against the best price. Like when you\u2019re looking to buy anything.\u201d The Premier League at the time had no \u201cfit and proper person\u201d test for owners or directors of England\u2019s historic clubs. But if they had, Abramovich\u2019s record, with no convictions for any criminal offence, would not have prevented him taking over, injecting his multi-millions and changing the English game. Richard Scudamore, then the chief executive of the Premier League, valued the investment coming into clubs. If any questions were asked about Abramovich the league would \u2013 justifiably \u2013 point to the general welcome being afforded him in London, the property he was buying and ask on what basis football should make a different judgment. Buck says Abramovich told him and the other executives that he had three priorities when he bought Chelsea. The first was: \u201c\u2018Have success very promptly.\u2019 And that meant a lot of money in the early days invested in players.\u201d It is a stretch now to remember how alien it was to England\u2019s traditional football culture when Chelsea began to splurge on mostly overseas stars, funded by an owner with no previous connection to the club, to capture the game\u2019s highest prizes. In his second season, after hiring Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and signing for him Didier Drogba, Arjen Robben, Petr Cech \u2013 and Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira and Tiago Mendes, three Portuguese players represented by Jorge Mendes \u2013 plus several more stars and the wages to attract them, Chelsea were on their way to acquiring titles and recorded a financial loss of \u00a3141m. That was by far a record in football history until Manchester City lost \u00a3197m in 2010-11 . The second priority, Buck says, was to invest in the academy to foster success long-term. For years barely a single Chelsea youth player made it regularly into the first team until now, with the talents given their chance by Lampard, sparked by the transfer ban. The third was \u201cto do something for the community in the broader sense\u201d, which Buck says informed the work of the Chelsea Foundation, in which the club spends 3% of its revenues, around \u00a312m-\u00a315m, on social projects, including initiatives to counter racism and antisemitism. These are continuing despite Abramovich\u2019s absence from the club and his representatives say that in Israel he is also involved in social projects and technology start-up companies. Abramovich\u2019s Israeli passport does entitle him to come to Britain and, although not to work directly for money, he can go to Chelsea and have meetings and watch matches if he wants to. Asked whether he put the stadium on hold in indignation at his treatment by the government, Buck says: \u201cHe put it on hold a few months after the incident in Salisbury; we can all draw our own conclusions as to whether that\u2019s related.\u201d He declined to say how Abramovich feels about being made unwelcome, after the UK accepted him and his money for so long. But the impression of Abramovich feeling unjustly targeted and rarely visiting, and the stadium project postponed, creates a perception that Chelsea is on hold and the young players are being given opportunities in that stasis. Buck says no and is emphatic that Abramovich is still committed to Chelsea: \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying and it is hard to disprove it, except to say: let\u2019s see what happens in the next transfer window. The point I am making \u2013 it\u2019s a glib one \u2013 if we go out in the next window and spend a zillion, it\u2019s pretty hard to argue that things are on hold.\u201d This article was amended on 27 November 2019 to correct and clarify some factual matters. This article was amended following a legal complaint made on behalf of Roman Abramovich.",

Hill told CNN she wanted to remain in the public sphere, saying: \u201cI think what the rightwing media and those who attacked me wanted was for me to be silenced. \u201cAnd I think something that we see on attacks against women, not just high-profile women but women across the board, is that these kinds of attacks are meant to silence you, demean you and show that you do not have power. \u201cSo, for me, it was really important to show that that\u2019s not going to work. And I have to own up to my responsibility in this, but I think coming forward and saying I\u2019m going to continue to be a voice for people who believed in me and what this whole fight is about is something that I believe in.\u201d Of Trump, she added: \u201cRight now, we have a criminal in the White House. We have Republicans on Capitol Hill who are doing everything that they can to defend him \u2026even when it means that they\u2019re sacrificing their own integrity and are lying to the American people non-stop.",

      "bodyText": "The supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was discharged from hospital on Sunday, after being treated for a possible infection. A court spokeswoman said Ginsburg was \u201cdoing well\u201d. The 86-year-old spent two nights at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, where she was taken on Friday after experiencing chills and fever. The court said Ginsburg received intravenous antibiotics and fluids and that her symptoms abated. Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg is the senior liberal on a court split 5-4 in favour of conservative justices, after two appointments under Donald Trump. Only Clarence Thomas, 71 and appointed by George HW Bush in 1991, has served longer among current members of the court. Ginsburg\u2019s health is closely watched by Democrats and Republicans alike. She has had four occurrences of cancer, including two in the past year. She had lung cancer surgery in December and received radiation treatment for a tumour on her pancreas in August. In mid-November, Ginsburg had a rare absence from a public session because of what the court said was a stomach bug. Her latest hospital stay began after the justices met in private to discuss pending cases. Ginsburg was evaluated at Sibley Memorial hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins for further evaluation and treatment. Supreme court appointments are for life, although justices can retire. Trump\u2019s first pick, Neil Gorsuch, replaced Antonin Scalia, another arch-conservative who died in February 2016. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, held Scalia\u2019s seat open, refusing to consider Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of a moderate, Merrick Garland, and citing alleged precedent that president\u2019s should not fill a supreme court seat in their final year in the White House. McConnell has said he would fill any vacancy arising in the final year of Trump\u2019s first term in office \u2013 provoking fury among progressives. Trump\u2019s second pick, Brett Kavanaugh, was appointed after Anthony Kennedy retired. A forthcoming book by the Washington Post editor Ruth Marcus contains the revelation that Kennedy asked Trump to include Kavanaugh on his shortlist. Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate, tilting the court to the right, after a bitter confirmation process marked by allegations of sexual assault which Kavanaugh furiously denied.",

It appears they have learnt nothing from last year\u2019s action where this sort of behaviour solidified strikers\u2019 resolve and angered students.\u201d</p> <p>Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) was accused of asking students to fill in a form entitled Industrial Action: record of teaching activities not taking place, giving details of the course, module, date and time of lecture affected.</p> <p>\u201cThis will help us monitor and record the teaching activities that are affected by staff taking industrial action for the purposes of planning for any alternative arrangements,\u201d it advises. The form was shared on Twitter, prompting a number of fake responses, including: \u201cWe are not your surveillance tools.\u201d SHU could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>There was also anger at the University of Liverpool after managers sent an email to undergraduates on Friday warning them it was unlawful to join pickets. In the same email, international students were informed that anyone who chose not to cross picket lines to attend teaching sessions risked jeopardising their visa.</p> <p>Ch\u00e9 Spencer Pote, the women\u2019s officer for Liverpool University Labour Students said it was \u201cextremely worrying\u201d that the university had decided to continue monitoring attendance during the eight-day strike. \u201cIf a student doesn\u2019t cross the picket line they risk their attendance falling below the expected threshold, which can lead to being kicked off courses for subjects like nursing.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the University of Liverpool responded: \u201cWe undertake regular monitoring of all undergraduate student attendance. This is not only to ensure we fulfil our duties on international student visas to UK Visas and Immigration, but is also vital as attendance is an important indicator of student wellbeing.</p> <p>\u201cWe respect our students\u2019 rights to support the industrial action, should they wish to do so. However it is important that they have the necessary information to do so lawfully.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sheffield Hallam said later: \u201cTo help us ensure that students do not miss anything essential, we are monitoring what activities are impacted. Staff aren\u2019t obliged to tell the university of their decision to take industrial action until after the end of the strike period. The form available helps us capture sessions that have not taken place as soon as possible so we can proactively plan alternative learning opportunities and minimise disruption for students.\u201d</p> <p><br>It is the second time in less than two years that universities have seen widespread industrial action. In February last year, 64 universities were affected by 14 days of strike action over changes to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/22/the-solution-to-university-pensions-better-fund-managers\">universities </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/22/the-solution-to-university-pensions-better-fund-managers\">superannuation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/22/the-solution-to-university-pensions-better-fund-managers\">scheme</a>.</p> <p>Last year the union succeeded in forcing employers to drop plans to change it from a defined benefit scheme to the far less favourable defined contribution scheme. It is now challenging the size of staff contributions, calling for it to be capped at 8% of a lecturer\u2019s salary, rather than the 9.6% approved by employers.<br><br>The UCU is also taking action over pay which it says has fallen 20% over the past decade, as well as casualisation and increased workload. It is also calling for action on the pay gap for women, ethnic minorities and the disabled.</p> <p>Sol Gamsu, a sociology lecturer at the University of Durham and UCU branch committee member, will be among those on the picket lines and taking part in teach-outs during the strike. He said the latest industrial action was not just about pensions and pay.</p> <p>Gamsu added: \u201cIt\u2019s also about a deeper crisis and a deeper lack of faith among staff that things are really going to get better. The way the system is being managed is unsustainable in terms of work loads, casual contracts and lack of security in the sector. None of the problems we are facing are really being dealt with in a serious way. That has to change.\u201d</p> <p>Chris Sayers, the chair of the Committee of University Chairs, said: \u201cAgainst a backdrop of unprecedented uncertainty and financial pressure, the role of university boards and councils has to be to ensure the long-term sustainability of their institutions, and therefore they have to balance the investment they want to make in people against all the other calls on their resources.\u201d</p>",

More than 40,000 lecturers, technicians, librarians and other academic staff will walk out on strike for eight days from Monday over pension, pay and conditions, in a wave of industrial action which will impact on the studies of more than a million students. Picket lines will be mounted across campuses, with many of the staff members involved offering alternative teach-outs for their students. Action short of a strike will continue until further notice, meaning further disruption with staff working to contract. There has been outrage on social media over attempts by universities to warn students off joining picket lines and encourage them to report any of their lecturers who strike. According to the University and College Union (UCU), staff at some universities have been warned that action short of a strike could result in heavy reductions to pay , on top of strike deductions, while other institutions have been hunting for cover staff to minimise disruption for students. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cUniversities should have been putting their efforts into trying to resolve the disputes, not scouting for scab labour, threatening staff with over the top pay deductions and other strong-arm tactics. \u201cWe have heard of department heads walking around campus demanding to know who is in the union and asking others to cover their classes. It appears they have learnt nothing from last year\u2019s action where this sort of behaviour solidified strikers\u2019 resolve and angered students.\u201d Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) was accused of asking students to fill in a form entitled Industrial Action: record of teaching activities not taking place, giving details of the course, module, date and time of lecture affected. \u201cThis will help us monitor and record the teaching activities that are affected by staff taking industrial action for the purposes of planning for any alternative arrangements,\u201d it advises. The form was shared on Twitter, prompting a number of fake responses, including: \u201cWe are not your surveillance tools.\u201d SHU could not be reached for comment. There was also anger at the University of Liverpool after managers sent an email to undergraduates on Friday warning them it was unlawful to join pickets. In the same email, international students were informed that anyone who chose not to cross picket lines to attend teaching sessions risked jeopardising their visa. Ch\u00e9 Spencer Pote, the women\u2019s officer for Liverpool University Labour Students said it was \u201cextremely worrying\u201d that the university had decided to continue monitoring attendance during the eight-day strike. \u201cIf a student doesn\u2019t cross the picket line they risk their attendance falling below the expected threshold, which can lead to being kicked off courses for subjects like nursing.\u201d A spokeswoman for the University of Liverpool responded: \u201cWe undertake regular monitoring of all undergraduate student attendance. This is not only to ensure we fulfil our duties on international student visas to UK Visas and Immigration, but is also vital as attendance is an important indicator of student wellbeing. \u201cWe respect our students\u2019 rights to support the industrial action, should they wish to do so. However it is important that they have the necessary information to do so lawfully.\u201d A spokesperson for Sheffield Hallam said later: \u201cTo help us ensure that students do not miss anything essential, we are monitoring what activities are impacted. Staff aren\u2019t obliged to tell the university of their decision to take industrial action until after the end of the strike period. The form available helps us capture sessions that have not taken place as soon as possible so we can proactively plan alternative learning opportunities and minimise disruption for students.\u201d It is the second time in less than two years that universities have seen widespread industrial action. In February last year, 64 universities were affected by 14 days of strike action over changes to the universities superannuation scheme. Last year the union succeeded in forcing employers to drop plans to change it from a defined benefit scheme to the far less favourable defined contribution scheme. It is now challenging the size of staff contributions, calling for it to be capped at 8% of a lecturer\u2019s salary, rather than the 9.6% approved by employers. The UCU is also taking action over pay which it says has fallen 20% over the past decade, as well as casualisation and increased workload. It is also calling for action on the pay gap for women, ethnic minorities and the disabled. Sol Gamsu, a sociology lecturer at the University of Durham and UCU branch committee member, will be among those on the picket lines and taking part in teach-outs during the strike. He said the latest industrial action was not just about pensions and pay. Gamsu added: \u201cIt\u2019s also about a deeper crisis and a deeper lack of faith among staff that things are really going to get better. The way the system is being managed is unsustainable in terms of work loads, casual contracts and lack of security in the sector. None of the problems we are facing are really being dealt with in a serious way. That has to change.\u201d Chris Sayers, the chair of the Committee of University Chairs, said: \u201cAgainst a backdrop of unprecedented uncertainty and financial pressure, the role of university boards and councils has to be to ensure the long-term sustainability of their institutions, and therefore they have to balance the investment they want to make in people against all the other calls on their resources.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Right, what a game. Thanks for your company. Bye! Solskj\u00e6r speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s football, sometimes it\u2019s beyond tactics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe energy of their team to ours, it was such a big difference [in the first half]. The difference between this team and last year\u2019s team is huge. At 2-0 down my mind\u2019s going back to Everton. Last year we would have been three, four or five down. There is no doubt about the drive, the attitude, the energy of these boys.\u201d Asked why United were so poor for 70-odd minutes, he candidly responds: \u201cThey looked like they wanted it more than us and believed more than us. We had one shot on target in the first half and that\u2019s unacceptable \u2013 not good enough. It\u2019s mixed emotions because we have not performed in the majority of the game. But these boys showed what we are capable of \u2013 if we\u2019re right.\u201d Read our match report from Bramall Lane: Chris Wilder tries to put it into words. \u201cWon it, lost it and got a result out of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI just said to the players, \u2018We are not in League One now. When you have the likes of them four [Martial, Rashford, James, Greenwood] at the top of the pitch, if you lose a little bit of energy and they turn the ball over, they are going to punish you and they did.\u2019 Full credit to Manchester United to get themselves back into the lead but full credit to Sheffield United as well, for getting something out a game I think we deserved something from. We weren\u2019t bad, we weren\u2019t bad ...\u201d Some post-match reaction. \u201cI said \u2018never in doubt,\u201d a smiling Oli McBurnie says, when asked what he said to Andre Marriner at full-time. \u201cThe boys were getting me scared saying it touched my hand when I knew it hadn\u2019t. We\u2019ve had a couple of VAR [calls] go against us so it would have been just our luck. The boys grafted unbelievably \u2013 the boys were different class in the first half. When we are at our best, we are good enough to compete against anyone.\u201d John Fleck, who opened the scoring a long, long time ago, adds: \u201cWe know we haven\u2019t got the same qualities as some of the bigger teams in the league so we have to fight for everything.\u201d Who needs a lie down? It would have been a travesty if Sheffield United, who move up to sixth, came away from an epic encounter empty-handed. The usual suspects were immense for the hosts \u2013 Lundstram, Baldock, Norwood \u2013 but back came Manchester United, with Daniel James, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford turning it on to help the visitors take an unlikely lead. But then Robinson picked out McBurnie, who kept his balance \u2013 desperately trying to keep his long arms out of the equation \u2013 to stab home an equaliser. A good ole fashioned six-goal thriller it is. What. A. Game! Oli McBurnie strikes to deny Manchester United a fairytale comeback victory at Bramall Lane. Chris Wilder\u2019s side were cruising and two goals to the good before Brandon Williams\u2019s first goal for the club \u2013 a wicked half volley \u2013 kickstarted a United comeback. Mason Greenwood swept home before Marcus Rashford thought he had found the winner. But back came Sheffield United, with Robinson teeing up McBurnie to finish inside the box and claim a thoroughly deserved point. 90+2 min: The goal stands! Bramall Lane erupts! A wonderful delayed celebration for McBurnie, who did magnificently to prop the ball up on his right knee before hammering in on the volley. Callum Robinson, the substitute, did magnificently to keep the ball alive and dink it into the path of McBurnie, who powered it in, cueing delirium in the stands. VAR is checking it ... Oliver McBurnie strikes!! 89 min: O\u2019Connell cannot divert Norwood\u2019s corner goalwards. Manchester United can calm things down from a De Gea goal-kick. 88 min: Sheffield United win a corner ... 86 min: Sheffield United are probing but then Billy Sharp is flagged offside. They must be livid with themselves. 85 min: Martial trudges off in slow motion. Tuanzebe\u2019s on. 84 min: Was this the plan all along? Manchester United are beginning to torment a weary-looking Sheffield United. Greenwood, James, Rashford and Martial are combining to deadly effect. 83 min: Callum Robinson is on for Sheffield United. He replaces Chris Basham. Meanwhile, Solskj\u00e6r is readying Tuanzebe. 82 min: For 70 minutes, Manchester United were nothing short of abysmal, with Sheffield United cruising against one of the game\u2019s heavyweights. But suddenly things kicked, with Brandon Williams\u2019s first goal for the club prompting an unlikely turnaround. Well, well, well! Rashford clinically rounds off an incisive break by Manchester United, with Daniel James playing a cute give-and-go with Anthony Martial. James whizzes into the box and pulls the ball back for Rashford, who does the rest. Another moment of quality from a United team that looked dead and buried. On the touchline, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r and co embrace. Up in the gods, Sir Alex Ferguson is all smiles. 78 min: Billy Sharp replaces McGoldrick. Mason Greenwood fires in an equaliser! Rashford dinks in a delicious cross from the right and Greenwood gets in between Jagielka and Basham to poke in, sweeping home inside the box. Another goal for the teenager \u2013 his first in the Premier League. That\u2019s a wonderful leveller. 75 min: Can Manchester United fashion an equaliser? Sheffield United are yet to concede in the final 15 minutes in the Premier League this season. 74 min: Mason Greenwood replaces Pereira. The teenager fires in his first goal for the club \u2013 and it\u2019s a truly exquisite finish. Dan James sped down the right and his hanging cross evaded everyone in the box. Lurking at the back post was Williams, the 19-year-old who smacked the ball into the far corner of Simon Moore\u2019s goal on the half volley. A belting finish by Brandon Williams. And here comes another teenager ... 70 min: McGoldrick\u2019s daisy-cutter is gathered by De Gea. 69 min: Sheffield United supporters are enjoying themselves. An a cappella version of Greasy Chip Butty fills the air. Chris Wilder\u2019s side are in such great control of this game it\u2019s unreal. They have been so untroubled. 68 min: McBurnie replaces Mousset. 66 min: Mousset has pulled a hamstring. Chris Wilder had been plotting to bring the striker off. As a limping Mousset chased a lost cause, he pulls up in discomfort. Oli McBurnie will replace the Frenchman, who proved a real nuisance for a shambolic defence. 64 min: Martial has a pop from 30 yards, but it cannons wide of Moore\u2019s right post! Plenty of power \u2013 but ultimately off target. Manchester United poked the ball around in midfield before Martial, presumably fed up, just thought: why not? They have been ambling around. 61 min: Lundstram does put a foot wrong, and United pile forward down the right. Daniel James beats his man for pace but his cross is gobbled up by Moore. Easy pickings for the stand-in Sheffield United stopper. 59 min: John Lundstram has been brilliant \u2013 again. The midfielder shakes off a couple of half-hearted United challenges to retain possession before spreading play to George Baldock, who has had a stormer at full-back. The one staggering thing from a Manchester United perspective is that Simon Moore, on his Premier League debut in goal, has barely had a save to make. 57 min: \u201cChrissy Wilder, he\u2019s one of our own,\u201d is the chant that echoes around Bramall Lane. \u201cChrissy Wilder and Alan Knill ... \u201d 55 min: Manchester United had shown the smallest of green shoots but Mousset has left Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side with a mountain to climb. To make matters worse, Sheffield United have not a lost a league game they have taken the lead in since January 2014 \u2013 that\u2019s 89 games. Manchester United have serious work to do. Lys Mousset with at thumping finish from distance! It\u2019s role reversal from the opener, with Fleck sliding a wonderful pass in for Mousset, who drifts away from Maguire before sending a beautifully-weighted strike arrowing into the bottom corner of David de Gea\u2019s goal. Pereira surrendered possession for the visitors and how Sheffield United punished them. 51 min: Lundstram\u2019s cynical challenge on Lingard earns him a booking. United were beginning to break at speed after Fred stole in. 50 min: Brandon Williams is booked for chopping down George Baldock, who has had a very good game. Sheffield United earn a free-kick on the right flank. Fleck plays it short \u2013 it\u2019s a training-ground move into Lundstram \u2013 but the visitors are alert to it. 48 min: Williams lays the ball off for Rashford, who twists and turns 25 yards out before letting fly. It was always rising. 47 min: Rashford surges down the left flank and Sheffield United appear in a spot of bother. But they don\u2019t panic and they usher the forward out before Jagielka shows a touch of class, waiting to intervene. Rather than thumping it out for a corner, he concedes a throw-in. At least one Phil has had a peerless return to action. 46 min: The visitors get the second half under way. Lingard replaces Phil Jones, who had an absolutely diabolical return to the starting lineup. Lingard can\u2019t do any worse for Manchester United. Jesse Lingard is coming on at half-time. It is unclear who for just yet \u2013 but Ole and Manchester United had to do something. Chris Wilder\u2019s selfless side deservedly lead at the break. A tub-thumping performance by the Blades. John Fleck got a little fortuitous as the ball cannoned off his shins and beyond De Gea but it was a slice of luck they thoroughly deserved. Manchester United, meanwhile, have been nothing short of dire. Phil Jones has had an absolute shocker on his return to the starting lineup. Hopefully Mauricio Pochettino is not watching. 45 min: There will be one minute added time. 43 min: Things have calmed, so couple of stats. Manchester United have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 12 top-flight away games, their worst streak since a run of 15 in the 1985-86 campaign. And, also via Opta, John Fleck has scored in consecutive league games at Bramall Lane, having scored just one goal in his previous 50 appearances there. 41 min: Jagielka fouls Martial but Manchester United\u2019s free-kick is weak. Chris Basham heads it clear and the hosts try to free Mousset. Chris Wilder\u2019s side pour forward with so much vim. 40 min: Manchester United are making David McGoldrick look like Lionel Messi. He has had their back five on toast. 39 min: Harry Maguire\u2019s going ballistic. He\u2019s had not had a happy return to Bramall Lane \u2013 far from it. Fred overcooks a pass towards the back stick and Maguire tries and fails to keep it in before smacking the ball down in disgust. Manchester United have been feeble in defence and nothing short of disastrous going forward. Only De Gea can come out of this first half with any kind of credit in the bank. Dreadful showing \u2013 so far. 37 min: Daniel James has had nine touches. Meanwhile Sheffield United\u2019s supporters are belting out John Egan\u2019s infectious ditty: 36 min: Lundstram\u2019s shot is blocked and, for a moment, it seems Manchester United can counter at speed. Dan James has the ball but tries to play the perfect pass for Rashford, who ends up fouling Jack O\u2019Connell in pursuit of possession. That all petered out rather quickly. 35 min: It came to nothing but Sheffield United earn another in quick succession. The goalscorer Fleck will whip it in ... 34 min: Ol\u00e9s from the Bramall Lane crowd, as Sheffield United earn another corner. They are toying with Manchester United, knocking it around for fun. George Baldock has been relentless down the right. As for David McGoldrick, maybe Manchester United will make a move for him ... 32 min: Fred tries to thread Rashford through \u2013 but the Manchester United forward is flagged offside. It looked very tight. 31 min: McGoldrick upends Fred inside the Manchester United half. A clumsy foul to give away. United try and build from the back but Pereira \u2013 again \u2013 squanders possession. Basham and Baldock do brilliantly to keep the ball alive down the right with Williams for company but eventually the move peters out. Sheffield United sense blood. 30 min: De Gea gathers a hanging Fleck corner. 29 min: Moore saves from Martial! Williams rolls a pass into Martial, who buys himself a yard, shifting the ball on to his left foot before angling a strike at goal. He attempts to steer it into the far corner but Moore is equal to it. It lacked a little conviction. And back come Sheffield United ... 27 min: Harry Maguire\u2019s lambasting Dan James for cheaply gifting possession straight back to the hosts. It has been truly abysmal start by Manchester United at Bramall Lane. They have been way off the pace. 26 min: Lundstram and Norwood are knocking it around. Sheffield United have played some lovely stuff. Manchester United? Not so much. 24 min: Sheffield United are swarming all over Man Utd, with McGoldrick the latest to test De Gea. McGoldrick fires a rasping strike straight at the United goalkeeper from 25 yards after Pereira surrendered possession. 22 min: Palpitations in the Manchester United defence as Fleck\u2019s zinging left-foot delivery flies past the back post. Fred helps it out for a corner but the visitors fail to clear their lines. Manchester United are well and truly under the cosh. 21 min: Phil Jones fouls Lundstram; he\u2019s having a mare. Sheffield United will whip in a free-kick from the right flank, where Mousset bamboozled Jones a minute or two ago ... Mousset bullies Jones and Fleck helps it home! Jones makes a mess of a routine ball into the right channel \u2013 it is pumped forward by Chris Basham \u2013 and Mousset wrings Jones inside-out before keepi his cool to get to the byline and pull the ball back for John Lundstram. De Gea saves from Lundstram but Fleck is in close company and the midfielder sweeps home inside the box. The visitors cannot say it hadn\u2019t been coming. The Blades lead. 15 min: Andre Marriner calmly waves away Sheffield United penalty appeals. Mousset charges into the box, surrounded by black shirts and Phil Jones, rather clumsily, ends up crowding out the striker. Jones ends up doing a touch of front crawl as he hits the deck. Mousset is inevitably tripped but does not really appeal for it and Marriner waves play on. He\u2019s having none of it. 13 min: Phil Jones goes flying into a challenge v Oliver Norwood \u2013 not one for the faint-hearted \u2013 and Fred is brought down in the aftermath. Some pedestrian Manchester United buildup play follows. 11 min: What. A. Double. Save! David de Gea makes a marvellous save low to his right to prevent John Lundstram\u2019s first-time volley from squeezing into the corner of goal before Sheffield United recycle the ball on the edge of the 18-yard box, dinking a cross in for McGoldrick, who heads at goal. But De Gea \u2013 somehow \u2013 claws the striker\u2019s header away from danger. Lundstram connected beautifully with a lofted Fleck cross and McGoldrick should perhaps do better \u2013 his header lacked a little conviction \u2013 but take nothing away from the Manchester United goalkeeper. 8 min: Basham and Norwood team up to prevent Rashford from advancing towards the 18-yard box. Rashford surged forward after picking up a Maguire pass, with Basham going to ground before Norwood stopped the England forward having a second bite of the cherry. McGoldrick was dispossessed by Phil Jones in the buildup. 7 min: Fred tries and fails to find Martial, who is lurking just outside of the box. A poor pass. Sheffield United look comfortable. 5 min: Wan-Bissaka does well to bomb forward down the right before handing over the baton to Anthony Martial. Martial tries to flick the ball into the path of Daniel James but it\u2019s wayward and Sheffield United hoover things up. No problem. 4 min: Jack O\u2019Connell has a word with Mousset and the Frenchman is helped back to his feet. Mousset joins the cavalry in the box as Oliver Norwood whips in a corner. But he overcooks it and it bobbles out for a goal-kick. 3 min: Fred gives Lundstram a shove but Andre Marriner is having none of it. The Brazilian then catches Mousset on the achilles and the Sheffield United forward is down in a heap. 1 min: Phil Jones is playing to the left of Harry Maguire, with Manchester United matching up Sheffield United by playing with a three-man defence. An early touch for Brandon Williams, who nips in ahead of George Baldock to head the ball upfield. And we\u2019re under way. The teams trudge out on to the pitch ... We are less than 15 minutes away from a belting Bramall Lane rendition of Greasy Chip Butty. Before then, more from Solskj\u00e6r on trying to improve Manchester United\u2019s away form. \u201cWhen I came in we went on a fantastic run away from home but now for one reason or another we haven\u2019t got the results but with the form we got going into the international break, we\u2019re hopeful we can change that.\u201d Harry Maguire adds: \u201cLiverpool came here and found it difficult. We have a lot of ability and we need to perform like we did against Brighton and the result will look after itself.\u201d Some pre-match reading on Wilder: Chris Wilder talks. \u201cEvery game is an occasion in the Premier League,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s still Man Utd, regardless of anything else, with top players and top manager and we\u2019re going to have to be at our best to get anything. Phil Jones is an England international and they still have the top three players at the top of the pitch that have to be wrapped up but we are still confident that we can cause them some problems going the other way.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r speaks. \u201cPhil [Jones] has been training well,\u201d he begins. \u201cHe\u2019s got experience of playing both central midfield and at the back. When you show the attitude he\u2019s shown in training, it\u2019s time for him to get a chance. Marcos [Rojo] is injured, Axel [Tuanzebe] isn\u2019t really ready to come in so it was an easy option. Brandon [Williams] has played really well in every game he\u2019s played. I didn\u2019t find any reason to leave him out. It\u2019s a testing stadium for him to play at so it\u2019s a good opportunity to show his mentality because his temperament is one of his strengths.\u201d Let\u2019s party like it\u2019s 2015, when Phil Jones and Phil Jagielka lined up together for England in Italy. Roy Hodgson was in charge and Andros Townsend scored in a 1-1 draw in a friendly in Turin. Jagielka partnered Chris Smalling, ostracised by Gareth Southgate, in defence while Jones floundered in a midfield role and neither have played an awful lot of minutes since. On the bench that day was Rob Green, Ryan Mason and Michael Carrick, these days one of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s sidekicks at Manchester United. On the VIP list at Bramall Lane? Fergie, and Kyle Walker: Team news news: Phil Jones starts, presumably as part of a back three, while the 19-year-old Brandon Williams gets the nod ahead of Ashley Young. Manchester United\u2019s midfield looks rather lightweight, with Andreas Pereira teaming up with Fred. Jones replaces the injured Scott McTominay and Axel Tuanzebe is back on the bench. As for the hosts, Phil Jagielka makes his first league start since rejoining the club, his first league start in a Sheffield United shirt since May 2007. Meanwhile Simon Moore is in for Dean Henderson, who is ineligible to face his parent club. Sheffield United (3-5-2): Moore; Basham, Jagielka, O\u2019Connell; Baldock, Fleck, Norwood, Lundstram, Stevens; Mousset, McGoldrick Subs: Verrips, Osborn, Besic, Freeman, McBurnie, Sharp, Robinson Manchester United (3-4-3): De Gea; Jones, Maguire, Lindel\u00f6f; Wan-Bissaka, Pereira, Fred, Williams; James, Rashford, Martial Subs: Grant, Tuanzebe, Young, Garner, Greenwood, Lingard, Mata Referee: Andre Marriner Welcome to the Harry Maguire Show . The England defender, who came through the youth ranks at Sheffield United, will lineup against his former club but beyond Slabhead there are all manner of potent threats for Chris Wilder and co to be aware of, and the straight-talking Wilder knows as much. \u201cIt\u2019s Manchester United and one of our former players will be playing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want it to be \u2018the Harry Maguire Show\u2019. I want it to be the Sheffield United Show. I want us to show how good we are.\u201d The Blades are in pretty good nick, too, having not tasted defeat since September. They will be without goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who is ineligible to face his parent club so Simon Moore will make his first league start for 18 months, a 3-2 win at Bristol City in the Championship. That day Enda Stevens, Jack O\u2019Connell, Chris Basham, George Baldock, John Lundstram and Billy Sharp all featured. Nothing new there, then. As for United, five wins from their past six matches have stirred a gentle excitement and another positive result would do Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r the power of good now that Mauricio Pochettino is handing out his CV, hunting high and low for a new employer. Kick-off: 4.30pm (GMT)",

Granted, the denouement could have been worse and his tactical switch did ultimately help turn a 2-0 deficit into a 3-3 draw, but this game only strengthened Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s candidature for potentially succeeding the Norwegian at Old Trafford. Even by Manchester United\u2019s standards the three goals scored by Brandon Williams, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford in seven late second-half minutes to briefly put them 3-2 up were extraordinary but for much of a dank, dark, thrilling afternoon the home fans delighted in taunting Solskj\u00e6r with chants of \u201csacked in the morning\u201d and \u201care you Wednesday in disguise\u201d? When Oli McBurnie\u2019s volley finally secured his side the draw that leaves them sixth, a point ahead of their ninth-placed guests, the overwhelming sense was that justice had been done. Sir Alex Ferguson was here to monitor not just the progress of his former team but also that of Chris Wilder, a coach he once mentored as the Yorkshireman climbed his way up through the divisions. If Sheffield United\u2019s manager will always be grateful he was evidently determined to make Ferguson\u2019s viewing uncomfortable and, sure enough, David de Gea was swiftly called to arms, the Spain goalkeeper making a superb double save. First De Gea repelled John Lundstram\u2019s high-velocity, first-time volley and then from the fallout kept David McGoldrick\u2019s header out.

It rendered Simon Moore almost embarrassingly under-employed in the home goal. With Dean Henderson unable to play because of the terms of his loan from Old Trafford, Moore made his first league start for 18 months but Manchester United did their very best to soothe any nerves he might have been harbouring. It took them half an hour to muster a shot on target, Anthony Martial dispatching the softest of scuffed efforts in Moore\u2019s direction but at that stage a lack of attacking threat probably represented the least of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s problems. His players were struggling to string two passes together and, even worse, the Blades\u2019 intelligent use of their ample possession made it an unhappy return for Harry Maguire.

Then James and Martial exchanged passes, with the latter cueing up Rashford to fire in an apparent winner from eight yards. McBurnie, though, had a very different ending in mind and delighted in lifting the gloom that had suddenly enveloped Bramall Lane in a fog of despair.

He is totally unaware both that no one did more to make sure that Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal did not get through the Commons than him or that his deal is one that he himself rejected 18 months previously.

The Conservatives changed the screen name to 'factcheckUK', and also changed the logo and biography of the account to read 'fact checking Labour from CCHQ'.</p>\n    <p>No explicit mention of the Conservative party name in full was made, so users would have to know that CCHQ is an acronym for 'Conservative campaign headquarters' in order to understand who was providing the fake fact-checking service.</p>\n    <p>Because the @CCHQPress account on Twitter is 'verified', it means when it appears it has a blue check mark next to the name, to show that Twitter has 'verified' that the account is who it says it is. This was retained while the account was tweeting under the false name 'factcheckUK'.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Martin Belam</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What followed was mostly just filler. He would be building the 40 hospitals that would never be built. There would be 50,000 new nurses, providing the 20,000 nurses he wouldn\u2019t deport were included in the headline figure. There would be \u00a32bn for potholes and \u00a31bn for childcare. Because one child was worth half as much as one pothole. He\u2019d do something about social care though the details temporarily escaped him. And he could promise all this was true because it had been ruthlessly audited by a bunch of twenty-somethings in CCHQ <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/twitter-accuses-tories-of-misleading-public-in-factcheck-row\">who were running FactCheckUK</a>.</p> \n<p>The closest he came to telling the truth was admitting that equality of opportunity was not distributed evenly. Because if it was, then someone like Boris would never have become prime minister. Without his privilege and overbearing sense of entitlement, Johnson would be just another low rent grifter, hawking fake brand goods out of a suitcase on Oxford Street. He ended with a lame Franglais ramble about the shadow cabinet that ended with a dig at \u201cMadame Abbott\u201d. That got the biggest cheer of the day. Tory activists love a bit of dog-whistle racism. No one can say that Boris doesn\u2019t understand his audience.</p> \n<p>Once the applause had died down, Johnson nervously took a few questions. His bumper hamper of non-existent giveaways would be funded by a Brexit dividend that would make the country significantly poorer. \u201cCan people trust you?\u201d was met with an answer that contained at least three lies. Sadly he can be trusted. To almost never tell the truth. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/24/boris-johnson-dodges-question-on-factcheckuk-at-tory-manifesto-launch-video\">Nor could he explain the fake news campaign at CCHQ</a>. A complete mystery. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand the Twittersphere,\u201d he said sadly, lapsing into total incoherence. I guess that must have been one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/07/jennifer-arcuri-five-unanswered-questions-tv-interview-boris-johnson\">Jennifer Arcuri</a>\u2019s IT lessons he failed to learn.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s all folks,\u201d Johnson burbled, while everyone was still trying to take in the fact that he hadn\u2019t really said much. All was well. The manifesto had been launched. Now it need never be mentioned again.

And he could promise all this was true because it had been ruthlessly audited by a bunch of twenty-somethings in CCHQ who were running FactCheckUK. The closest he came to telling the truth was admitting that equality of opportunity was not distributed evenly. Because if it was, then someone like Boris would never have become prime minister. Without his privilege and overbearing sense of entitlement, Johnson would be just another low rent grifter, hawking fake brand goods out of a suitcase on Oxford Street. He ended with a lame Franglais ramble about the shadow cabinet that ended with a dig at \u201cMadame Abbott\u201d. That got the biggest cheer of the day. Tory activists love a bit of dog-whistle racism. No one can say that Boris doesn\u2019t understand his audience. Once the applause had died down, Johnson nervously took a few questions. His bumper hamper of non-existent giveaways would be funded by a Brexit dividend that would make the country significantly poorer. \u201cCan people trust you?\u201d was met with an answer that contained at least three lies. Sadly he can be trusted. To almost never tell the truth. Nor could he explain the fake news campaign at CCHQ. A complete mystery. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand the Twittersphere,\u201d he said sadly, lapsing into total incoherence. I guess that must have been one of Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s IT lessons he failed to learn. \u201cThat\u2019s all folks,\u201d Johnson burbled, while everyone was still trying to take in the fact that he hadn\u2019t really said much. All was well. The manifesto had been launched. Now it need never be mentioned again. Onwards and sideways to victory.

A spokeswoman for G4C pushed back against the criticism, saying that reporting of the original campaign in 2017 had elided major-label artists\u2019 independent expressions of support for Corbyn with the Labour-supported community-based campaign. \u201cActually the Grime4Corbyn event we had last time was very similar,\u201d she said, pointing out that it was always intended more as a grassroots-focused movement. Many of those taking part originally and this time around were older artists who had been instrumental in forming the underground grime scene. Sharky Major, Durrty Goodz, Manga Saint Hilare, Lioness, Saskilla, Jamakabi, Nasty Jack, Bruza, Scrufizzer, Ten Dixon, Drifter, Lady Shocker and Taliifah have already been announced, with more special guests expected on the night, she said. Wiley, regarded by many as the godfather of grime, has also separately announced his support for Corbyn. Saskilla, a former member of Roll Deep who was among the headliners of G4C two years ago, said: \u201cI headlined and supported Grime4Corbyn the first time around because he is what the country needs \u2013 honesty and someone to take accountability for the country\u2019s mistakes past or present. \u201cJeremy is the man for the job unless you want to live in false democracy run by the country\u2019s elite.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In late 2016, a 47-year-old Uighur employed on a road-building crew in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region started hectoring his co-workers about their behaviour. He warned them against watching porn or swearing, badgered them not to eat food cooked by non-Muslims, smokers or people who drink alcohol, and made offensive slurs against the country\u2019s majority Han ethnic group. In most countries, his remarks would have simply marked him out as a bigot and religious bore. But in China, the state viewed them \u2013 and him \u2013 far more harshly. Two years later, the comments would land him in court, and earn him a 10-year sentence for \u201cincitement of ethnic hatred and ethnic discrimination\u201d, according to a leaked summary of his trial. The case was not exceptional but for the fact that its details have been made public. The individual was not a public figure, and there are no reported consequences of the crime of which he was convicted. The Uighur-language transcript was not classified, but official secrecy across Xinjiang means court documents are rarely publicly available. So the details of his mundane offence and sentence provide a rare insight into the nature and extent of a sweeping government crackdown on Uighurs and other ethnic minority groups, which is under way in the region. China says it is fighting extremism; critics say it is effectively trying to erase Uighurs\u2019 ethnic and religious identity. The most high-profile features of the government campaign have been internment camps that house at least a million people, held indefinitely for \u201cre-education\u201d. The inmates of these camps, who make up a majority of Xinjiang\u2019s detained, are people the authorities consider tainted by the \u201cthree forces\u201d: terrorism, extremism and separatism. The courts and formal jail are used only in a minority of cases the state considers more serious. Yet the trial and sentencing of this single prisoner, whose name the Guardian knows but is not publishing because he could not be reached for comment, is an indication of how low the bar is for criminal offences. The trial details were leaked as part of the China Cables, a cache of six official documents shared with, and authenticated through, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). \u201cHe incited extremist religious thoughts in his colleagues \u2026 [saying things] such as: \u2018Do not use dirty words, do not watch porn or you will become a kafir [offensive word for a non-believer],\u201d the charges against him read. \u201c[He told them]: \u2018If you do not pray, you will be in hell and God will not forgive you \u2026 You cannot eat food prepared by women who do not pray, you cannot eat food prepared by people who smoke and drink alcohol.\u201d There is no record that his words led to any form of violence or other criminal offence, or even if others were spurred on to greater religiosity by his chastisements. The 10-year sentence appears to have been simply for his proselytising \u2013 and came after his lawyer sought leniency for the first-time offender. \u201cDue to the defendant\u2019s low legal awareness and education level, he was easily susceptible to being misguided and committing crimes. He\u2019s guilty. This is his first criminal record and I ask the court to deal with him leniently,\u201d his counsel said. Hundreds of thousands of people are held in camps, presumably for less severe violations, as part of an opaque state-sponsored drive apparently designed to crush all ethnic and religious identity, and weaken family ties. In Xinjiang, behaviour that can mark out a person for further investigation \u2013 and possible internment \u2013 includes simply owning a Qur\u2019an. Mosques have been destroyed, graveyards razed. Children have been separated from their families and held in state-run institutions. At least one area has banned the use of the Uighur language in schools. The long arm of the state has reached into homes. Han Chinese have been sent to live with Uighur families, calling themselves \u201crelatives\u201d while monitoring every aspect of their hosts\u2019 lives, attending family events such as weddings and funerals, and recording even minor displays of religious sentiment such as refusing to eat pork. In some cases, the women have reportedly been obliged to share beds with male Han \u201crelatives\u201d assigned to live in their home. Often these are homes where the men have been detained.

It lays out how camps should be built and managed. The full document is at the bottom. </p> \n<p>The order was part of a cache \u2013 the China Cables \u2013 obtained by the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.icij.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1574512136845000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbb4jp3CLWA-iVvSVkbaQsdmlm2g\">International Consortium of Investigative Journalists</a> and shared with the Guardian and 16 other media partners. The documents have been independently assessed by experts who have concluded they are authentic. China said they had been \u201cfabricated\u201d.</p> \n<p><br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>In the \u201ccombination boxing\u201d and \u201cthree battles and one war\u201d struggle to fight against terrorism and maintain stability, it is a strategic, critical and long-term measure to focus on free vocational skills education and training for key personnel.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>China insists that its campaign is not against Islam, Uighurs or other minorities. Instead it has insisted, since the camps became known, that it is fighting terrorism and extremism.</p> \n<p>Officials appear to have known from the start how controversial the campaign would be and have always publicly insisted that the re-education internment camps are \u201cvocational training camps\u201d. That Orwellian language is used even in internal documents like this, which talk about education, classrooms, dormitories and \u201cstudents\u201d.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It is strictly forbidden for police to enter the student zone with guns, and they must never allow escapes, never allow trouble, never allow attacks on staff, never allow abnormal deaths, never allow food safety incidents and major epidemics, and they must ensure that the training centre is absolutely safe and free of risk.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The real nature of the training centres is exposed a couple of paragraphs into the order. First managers are warned that they must \u201cnever allow escapes\u201d, underlining that people are being held against their will.</p> \n<p>The prohibition \u201cnever allow abnormal deaths\u201d suggests authorities fear extreme mistreatment in the camp could cost detainees their lives. Former inmates have reported deaths among fellow detainees after torture, abuse or withholding of medical treatment. It also underlines the presence of armed police in camps, although barred from the \u201cstudent zone\u201d.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Strictly manage door locks and keys \u2013 dormitory doors, corridor doors and floor doors must be double-locked, and must be locked immediately after being opened and closed. Strictly manage and control student activities to prevent escapes during class, eating periods, toilet breaks, bath time, medical treatment, family visits etc. Strictly manage students requesting time off, if they really need to leave the training centre due to illness or other special circumstances, they must have someone specially accompany, monitor and control them.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There are multiple layers of security in the camps, with \u201cdormitories\u201d \u2013 which former inmates have described as cells \u2013 corridors and floors all locked separately. On the rare occasions inmates are allowed out because of illness or other \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d, they do so under constant guard.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Students are not allowed to participate in labour outside class, and may not contact the outside world apart from during prescribed activities. It is strictly forbidden for the students to have their own cellphones or for staff to hand over cellphones to students, so as to prevent the staff from interacting with students and collusion between inside and outside.</p> \n <p>There must be full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots, ensuring that guards on duty can monitor in real time, record things in detail, and report suspicious circumstances immediately.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>People inside the camps are totally cut off, by design, from the outside world. People who have come out of the camps and relatives of those interned say contact is infrequent and sporadic. Inside the camp, detainees have no privacy at all, with every moment of their day captured on CCTV. Former detainees have mentioned constant surveillance, even covering toilets in shared cells.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>For training centres with more than one thousand people, special personnel must be stationed to do food safety testing, sanitation and epidemic prevention work.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>A section on food safety provides incidental confirmation that the government is planning detentions on a massive scale; it lays out separate requirements for camps with more than 1,000 inmates, suggesting such large facilities are common or at the very least not unusual.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Adhere to the daily concentrated study of the national language (Mandarin), law, and skills, make remedial Mandarin studies the top priority, and ensure time, content, and quality.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Mandarin-language skills are at the heart of the training. Despite being called vocational schools, there is no evidence of job training or planning for it in this order \u2013 no workshop or other practical construction. Also many of those detained are professionals already, including teachers, lawyers and doctors who have no need of job training, former inmates have said.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Efforts should be made to solve the problem of an insufficient number of classrooms, speed up the construction and renovation of classrooms, and ensure that students attend class every day.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The current large-scale internment campaign began in 2017, although there were camps open before that. This order to speed up \u201cclassroom\u201d construction because of shortages highlights how fast people were being rounded up and sent to camps.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Actively organise and concentrate on activities such as presentations, form a healthy and inspirational atmosphere, promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past behaviour.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Many former inmates said they did not know why they had been rounded up. \u201cCrimes\u201d are thought to include behaviour that would be completely innocuous in most countries, such as owning a Quran. The crackdown has been so harsh that around the time this order came out, a Uighur man who badgered colleagues at work to pray more and not watch porn was tried for inciting ethnic hatred and jailed for 10 years. The \u201coffences\u201d of those in the camps will not even have been judged serious enough to go through the judicial system.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Through letter-writing, phonecalls, video chats, visits, meetings, meals, etc, establish a mechanism for students and relatives to interact with each other, to ensure that the students will have a phone conversation with their relatives at least once a week, and meet via video at least once a month, to make their family feel at ease and the students feel safe.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>One of the most worrying aspects of the camps for Uighurs is the way inmates and their family are almost totally cut off, with no visiting rights. Children of couples who have both been detained have reportedly been taken by the state to institutions. The schedule laid out in this order is generous compared with the amount of contact many former detainees and relatives of inmates say they were allowed.<br></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Behaviour management.

      "bodyText": "The internal workings of a vast system of Chinese internment camps used to detain at least a million people from the nation\u2019s Muslim minorities are laid out in leaked Communist party documents published on Sunday. A classified order from a top Chinese security official makes clear the re-education camps in the country\u2019s north-west \u2013 which it describes as vocational training centres \u2013 are involuntary, secret and used for ideological \u201ceducation transformation\u201d. Annotated excerpts from one document, a 2017 \u201ctelegram\u201d signed in the name of Zhu Hailun, a top security official and deputy communist party chief for Xinjiang region, are below. It lays out how camps should be built and managed. The full document is at the bottom. The order was part of a cache \u2013 the China Cables \u2013 obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with the Guardian and 16 other media partners. The documents have been independently assessed by experts who have concluded they are authentic. China said they had been \u201cfabricated\u201d. In the \u201ccombination boxing\u201d and \u201cthree battles and one war\u201d struggle to fight against terrorism and maintain stability, it is a strategic, critical and long-term measure to focus on free vocational skills education and training for key personnel. China insists that its campaign is not against Islam, Uighurs or other minorities. Instead it has insisted, since the camps became known, that it is fighting terrorism and extremism. Officials appear to have known from the start how controversial the campaign would be and have always publicly insisted that the re-education internment camps are \u201cvocational training camps\u201d. That Orwellian language is used even in internal documents like this, which talk about education, classrooms, dormitories and \u201cstudents\u201d. It is strictly forbidden for police to enter the student zone with guns, and they must never allow escapes, never allow trouble, never allow attacks on staff, never allow abnormal deaths, never allow food safety incidents and major epidemics, and they must ensure that the training centre is absolutely safe and free of risk. The real nature of the training centres is exposed a couple of paragraphs into the order. First managers are warned that they must \u201cnever allow escapes\u201d, underlining that people are being held against their will. The prohibition \u201cnever allow abnormal deaths\u201d suggests authorities fear extreme mistreatment in the camp could cost detainees their lives. Former inmates have reported deaths among fellow detainees after torture, abuse or withholding of medical treatment. It also underlines the presence of armed police in camps, although barred from the \u201cstudent zone\u201d. Strictly manage door locks and keys \u2013 dormitory doors, corridor doors and floor doors must be double-locked, and must be locked immediately after being opened and closed. Strictly manage and control student activities to prevent escapes during class, eating periods, toilet breaks, bath time, medical treatment, family visits etc. Strictly manage students requesting time off, if they really need to leave the training centre due to illness or other special circumstances, they must have someone specially accompany, monitor and control them. There are multiple layers of security in the camps, with \u201cdormitories\u201d \u2013 which former inmates have described as cells \u2013 corridors and floors all locked separately. On the rare occasions inmates are allowed out because of illness or other \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d, they do so under constant guard. Students are not allowed to participate in labour outside class, and may not contact the outside world apart from during prescribed activities. It is strictly forbidden for the students to have their own cellphones or for staff to hand over cellphones to students, so as to prevent the staff from interacting with students and collusion between inside and outside. There must be full video surveillance coverage of dormitories and classrooms free of blind spots, ensuring that guards on duty can monitor in real time, record things in detail, and report suspicious circumstances immediately. People inside the camps are totally cut off, by design, from the outside world. People who have come out of the camps and relatives of those interned say contact is infrequent and sporadic. Inside the camp, detainees have no privacy at all, with every moment of their day captured on CCTV. Former detainees have mentioned constant surveillance, even covering toilets in shared cells. For training centres with more than one thousand people, special personnel must be stationed to do food safety testing, sanitation and epidemic prevention work. A section on food safety provides incidental confirmation that the government is planning detentions on a massive scale; it lays out separate requirements for camps with more than 1,000 inmates, suggesting such large facilities are common or at the very least not unusual. Adhere to the daily concentrated study of the national language (Mandarin), law, and skills, make remedial Mandarin studies the top priority, and ensure time, content, and quality. Mandarin-language skills are at the heart of the training. Despite being called vocational schools, there is no evidence of job training or planning for it in this order \u2013 no workshop or other practical construction. Also many of those detained are professionals already, including teachers, lawyers and doctors who have no need of job training, former inmates have said. Efforts should be made to solve the problem of an insufficient number of classrooms, speed up the construction and renovation of classrooms, and ensure that students attend class every day. The current large-scale internment campaign began in 2017, although there were camps open before that. This order to speed up \u201cclassroom\u201d construction because of shortages highlights how fast people were being rounded up and sent to camps. Actively organise and concentrate on activities such as presentations, form a healthy and inspirational atmosphere, promote the repentance and confession of the students for them to understand deeply the illegal, criminal and dangerous nature of their past behaviour. Many former inmates said they did not know why they had been rounded up. \u201cCrimes\u201d are thought to include behaviour that would be completely innocuous in most countries, such as owning a Quran. The crackdown has been so harsh that around the time this order came out, a Uighur man who badgered colleagues at work to pray more and not watch porn was tried for inciting ethnic hatred and jailed for 10 years. The \u201coffences\u201d of those in the camps will not even have been judged serious enough to go through the judicial system. Through letter-writing, phonecalls, video chats, visits, meetings, meals, etc, establish a mechanism for students and relatives to interact with each other, to ensure that the students will have a phone conversation with their relatives at least once a week, and meet via video at least once a month, to make their family feel at ease and the students feel safe. One of the most worrying aspects of the camps for Uighurs is the way inmates and their family are almost totally cut off, with no visiting rights. Children of couples who have both been detained have reportedly been taken by the state to institutions. The schedule laid out in this order is generous compared with the amount of contact many former detainees and relatives of inmates say they were allowed. Behaviour management. The trainee\u2019s study, life, and activity management system should be formulated in detail, and the students should have a fixed bed position, fixed queue position, fixed classroom seat, and fixed station during skills work, and it is strictly forbidden for this to be changed. Strengthen the student\u2019s daily life behaviour norms, and implement behavioural norms and discipline requirements for getting up, rollcall, washing, going to the toilet, organising and housekeeping, eating, studying, sleeping, closing the door and so forth. Every aspect of an inmate\u2019s life is minutely controlled; they have no choice even over their position in the lunch queue. The order also infantilises inmates, treating them like children in need of training in basic hygiene and socialising. Establish assessment evaluation and point management systems, and break down scores and manage and assess individually the students\u2019 ideological transformation, study and training, and compliance with discipline. Maintain monthly assessments, and calculate monthly and annual total scores, and record it in the student\u2019s school files. Take the student\u2019s score as the basic basis for measuring the effectiveness of education and training, and link it directly to rewards, punishments, and family visits. Implement level management and differentiate treatment according to the score, and encourage students to obey management, earnestly study, and truly transform. The order lays out a scoring system that rates students for their \u201cideological transformation\u201d, learning (probably of Mandarin) and their ability to follow the centre\u2019s strict rules. It is very clear that this opaque points structure determines most aspects of inmates life in the camp, from their ability to contact family to possible punishments. Overall, they are expected to show Orwellian levels of compliance: \u201cto obey management, earnestly study, and truly transform\u201d. Conditions for completion. Define uniform standards based on the students\u2019 education and training points, strictly and seriously strengthen the management of students\u2019 completion. Completion needs to meet the following conditions: (1) Their problem is lighter than when they were first received for education. (2) They were educated and trained in the training centre for at least one year. (3) Students classified in the general management area. (4) The total score for education and training and scores for ideological transformation, academic achievement, compliance and discipline, etc all meet the prescribed standards. These requirements to \u201ccomplete\u201d courses show how detention is both arbitrary and indefinite. They mandate a minimum stay of a year in the camps, but no upper limits. It does not lay out standardised levels of Mandarin, or other requirements that if reached, would allow inmates \u2013 or \u201cstudents\u201d \u2013 to leave. If a check on the public security \u201cintegrated\u201d (IJOP) platform system does not find new problems, their case should be reported up level by level to the county (city, district) vocational skills education and training service bureau, then reevaluated by the county (city, district) vocational skills education and training leading group, and finally reported to the prefecture (state, city) vocational skills education and training service bureau for final evaluation, and according to the examination and approval of the comrades of the local committee, it will be determined whether the trainees will enter the skills improvement class before completion to receive intensive training. Release of each of the hundreds of thousands of detainees should go through checks by multiple layers of the Chinese bureaucracy. Even if they are approved, they must go on to other camps. Skills improvement. All students who have completed training will be sent to vocational skills improvement class for intensive skills training for a school term of three to six months.

The two levels of the prefectures and counties should formulate employment assistance resettlement plans in accordance with the requirements of \u201ccompletion of one batch, employment of one batch\u201d, and every effort should be made to fix employment work for completed graduates to ensure the smooth employment of students with employment aspirations. There have been multiple reports of forced labour at re-education camps in Xinjiang. It is unclear where the \u201cstudents\u201d are expected to work after finishing their re-education, particularly if the focus of their training has been Mandarin-language rather than technical skills. Several former inmates told researchers they were sent to work on factory production lines after leaving re-education camps. Strict secrecy.

      "bodyText": "The internal workings of a vast chain of Chinese internment camps used to detain at least a million people from the nation\u2019s Muslim minorities are laid out in leaked Communist Party documents published on Sunday. The China Cables, a cache of classified government papers, appear to provide the first official glimpse into the structure, daily life and ideological framework behind centres in north-western Xinjiang region that have provoked international condemnation. Obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and shared with the Guardian, the BBC and 15 other media partners, the documents have been independently assessed by experts who have concluded they are authentic. China said they had been \u201cfabricated\u201d. However, the documents are consistent with mounting evidence that the country runs detention camps that are secret, involuntary and used for ideological \u201ceducation transformation\u201d. When reports surfaced of mass internments without trial, authorities in Beijing initially denied the existence of the detention centres, whose inmates are mostly Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. After satellite photos and a flood of testimony from former detainees and relatives became impossible to ignore, the party insisted they were for voluntary \u201cvocational training\u201d. The cables provide apparent confirmation from within China\u2019s bureaucracy that the camps were envisaged from the start as brainwashing detention centres, to be constructed on a massive scale, with inmates confined by multiple layers of security. The cache includes a 2017 order, or \u201ctelegram\u201d, detailing how the camps in Xinjiang should be built and run. Signed in the name of Zhu Hailun, the top security official and deputy Communist party chief in Xinjiang, it sets out how the centres were designed to expose detainees to a period of enforced indoctrination. The document states: \u2022 Camps must adhere to a strict system of total physical and mental control, with multiple layers of locks on dormitories, corridors, floors and buildings. Fences should be put around each building, and walls around the compound. A dedicated police station must be at the front gate, all monitored by security guards in watchtowers. \u2022 Inmates could be held indefinitely \u2013 but must serve at least a year in the camps before they can even be considered for \u201ccompletion\u201d, or release. \u2022 The camps are to be run on a points system. Inmates earn credits for \u201cideological transformation\u201d, \u201ccompliance with discipline\u201d and \u201cstudy and training\u201d. \u2022 Even after completing their \u201ceducation transformation\u201d inmates are not allowed to go free. They move into another tier of camps, where they face a further three- to six-months\u2019 internment for \u201clabour skills training\u201d. \u2022 Weekly phone calls and a monthly video call with relatives are their only contact with the outside world, and they can be suspended as punishment. \u2022 \u201cPreventing escape\u201d is a top priority. The order demands round-the-clock video surveillance \u201cwith no blind spots\u201d to monitor every moment of an inmates\u2019 day. Control of every aspect of their lives is so comprehensive that they have to be assigned a specific place not only in dormitories and classrooms, but even in the lunchtime queue. There have been multiple accounts by people who passed through camps of torture, rape and abuse. In an apparent sign of concern about the consequences of mistreatment, Zhu\u2019s order instructs staff to \u201cnever allow abnormal deaths\u201d. Many details match accounts given by former camp inmates. They also provide striking new insights \u2013 among them the minimum 12-month term of confinement, and the fact that there are two tiers of camps. The first seems focused on ideology and Mandarin-language skills; those approved to leave face another three to six months of \u201clabour skills training\u201d in a second detention centre. There have been multiple credible reports of forced labour in Xinjiang, as part of the government camp system. Some of those who \u201ccomplete\u201d the re-education systems might be forced to work in these second tier of camps. The order also suggests former detainees remain under surveillance even after release, with local security and judicial officials told that \u201cstudents should not leave the line of sight for one year\u201d. Chinese authorities deny they run detention centres and say the \u201cvocational education and training centres\u201d are part of a focused crackdown on extremism and terrorism. In 2009, nearly 200 people, most of them Han Chinese, died during riots in the regional capital, Urumqi. Dozens more were then killed and hundreds injured in a series of terror attacks in cities across Xinjiang and beyond. Uighurs have also fought with extremist militant groups abroad, including joining Isis in Iraq. The document makes clear that as the internment camps went up, authorities were already worried about the scale of their incarceration programme becoming known, even inside Chinese official hierarchies. The document demands \u201cstrict secrecy\u201d, and in addition to a predictable ban on videos and cameras, staff are also ordered not to aggregate important data, preventing even those inside the system from understanding its full extent. \u201cThe work policy of the vocational skills education and training centres are strong and highly sensitive,\u201d the order says. \u201cIt is necessary to strengthen the staff\u2019s awareness of staying secret, serious political discipline and secrecy discipline.\u201d In addition to the order about the camps, the cache includes four \u201cbulletins\u201d that offer a rare insight into the scale of the crackdown and the digital dragnet that powers it. The bulletins were sent out to update officials and guide their use of the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), the heart of the surveillance system. They say that in one single week in June 2017, the system flagged up more than 24,000 \u201csuspicious persons\u201d in the four southern districts of Xinjiang alone. Two-thirds of them were detained, with more than 15,600 sent into the re-education camps and 706 sent to jail. A further 2,096 people were put under surveillance and 5,508 were \u201ctemporarily unable to be detained\u201d \u2013 suggesting they were destined for camps in future. One of the bulletins discusses screening 1.9 million Xinjiang users of a file-sharing app. More than 40,000 of the people who used it were considered suspicious or had been labelled potentially \u201charmful\u201d. A separate document is a Uighur-language transcript of a trial, not classified but extremely unusual in a region where secrecy means court documents are rarely publicly available. Together they provide insights into the construction and operation of a comprehensive government campaign that has led to the largest mass internment of an ethnic-religious minority since the second world war, targeting the Uighur minority, along with other mostly Muslim ethnic groups. Chinese authorities have split up families, targeted the Uighur language and culture for suppression, razed cultural and historic sites and criticised even mild expression of Muslim identity, micromanaging everything from beard length to babies\u2019 names. Critics say the campaign apparently aims to obliterate Uighur heritage, society and cultural and religious identity. \u201cThe purpose [of the camp network] was to try to indoctrinate and change an entire population by channeling them through this dedicated system,\u201d said Adrian Zenz, a leading researcher into the Xinjiang internment camps, who is senior fellow in China studies at the victims of communism foundation.

The order about the camps, and the security bulletins, are classified \u201csecret\u201d, the middle of China\u2019s three levels of classification.

      "body": "<p>There is much to be welcomed in the Labour party\u2019s manifesto, particularly the idea of the Sovereign Land Trust to buy land and lease it back to communities, the commitment to zero-carbon new homes and an end to right-to-buy (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/jeremy-corbyn-urges-public-to-vote-for-his-manifesto-of-hope-labour-tax-spend-plans\" title=\"\">Corbyn unveils Labour\u2019s most radical manifesto for decades</a>, 22 November).</p> <p>But \u2013 as an architect who was active in London in the 1960s and 70s, at the height of the postwar expansion of council house building \u2013 I have some misgivings about the commitment to build at a rate of 150,000 units a year. The maximum achieved during the 1950s and 60s was an average of about 200,000, following a build-up of about three years. When there was a major push to increase throughput by industrialised building and package-dealing with little or no design input from planners and architects, standards fell, social and environmental consequences were dire and many of the products of those years have been demolished.</p> <p>Labour should learn from this that the careful construction of humane communities, which sustain lives and are loved, requires generous lead-in time. We start from a low base with most local authorities bled dry of professional expertise. Also, overheating in the construction industry runs into storages of mortals and skilled labour, producing inflation.</p> <p>Furthermore, there is no mention of existing housing and the need to revive incentives to upgrade this. At present, the 20% VAT levied on maintenance and retrofit (with a few minor exemptions such as insulants) provides an inbuilt financial incentive for site clearance and new build, which is VAT exempt. Only with the equalisation of this tax across retrofit and new build can an objective cost-benefit analysis be made of alternative approaches to the existing stock.</p> <p>The brownfield first requirement should be revived. In the absence of these moderations, Labour\u2019s housing policies are in danger of continuing the present dominance of big developers, demanding huge sites with immeasurable damage to social cohesion, plus continuing pressure on the green belt.<br><strong>Kate Macintosh</strong><br><em>Winchester, </em><em>Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 You report on Labour\u2019s promise to tackle the housing crisis as an unchallenged good (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/labour-to-unveil-75bn-social-housing-plan-to-build-for-the-many\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s \u00a375bn pledge to tackle UK housing crisis</a>, 21 November). However, if it is not accompanied by parallel investment in infrastructure and roads, it can be a disaster for individual localities.</p> <p>In my area, thousands of houses have been built without any additional doctors\u2019 surgeries or schools, and in an area with just two main roads leading through the increasingly gridlocked town of Aylesbury. A ring road is promised, but only after all the houses are in place, so before that happens we face years of traffic misery and lack of facilities. The houses are not even serving local people as they are designed and priced to attract escapees from London and are unaffordable to young people who want to stay local.</p> <p>Finally, those of us who chose to live in smaller villages find the town steadily moving towards us, damaging our environment and polluting our air. Unrestrained building, unless matched by appropriate infrastructure and respect for the environment, can be a blight on an area.<br><strong>Jill Wallis</strong><br><em>Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Labour\u2019s plans to spend \u00a375bn on new build is expensive and comes with enormous social and environmental implications. The party\u2019s plans are ambitious but, as history teaches us, unlikely to succeed. We can increase the supply of secure, affordable housing for tenants immediately by encouraging house owners to create separate, independent areas for living at market, social rents. These rents should include the cost of household charges: energy and water charges, to drive down the cost of living for tenants. House owners can benefit from a new source of income. We simply must use our existing stock to solve the housing crisis.<br><strong>Peter Ellis</strong><br><em>Founder, homeswithinhomes.org</em></p> <p>\u2022 As soon as the election is over all parties must agree emergency measures for homeless families and individuals. Thousands of families have been in temporary accommodation for up to and over 10 years. There are 84,740 such families in England, up 77% since 2010, <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02110\" title=\"\">according to the House of Commons Library</a>. They cannot wait another 10 years while enough truly affordable housing is built. There are no plans in national or local government to urgently meet their needs for a permanent home.</p> <p>We have a social housing, affordable rents and elimination of homelessness bill ready to be launched on 16 December. It enables urgent and immediate action by national and local government. There have already been too many Christmases when rents are so high and incomes so low that debt, hunger, homelessness, mental and physical ill health are inevitable. Homeless people dying on the streets is preventable.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your article on the proposed development in north London (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/23/the-billionaire-and-the-219-tiny-flats-a-new-low-for-rabbit-hutch-britain\" title=\"\">The billionaire and the 219 flats: a new low for rabbit hutch Britain?</a>, Money, 23 November) demonstrates the weakness of our planning laws and the \u201cpreventative approach\u201d \u2013 the effect of deregulation.</p> <p>However, should the development proceed, the council has another route to address the problem. Many of these proposed flats will have a serious hazard of \u201ccrowding and space\u201d under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) and the local housing authority has the power to prohibit their use as a dwelling under the Housing Act 2004.

      "bodyText": "There is much to be welcomed in the Labour party\u2019s manifesto, particularly the idea of the Sovereign Land Trust to buy land and lease it back to communities, the commitment to zero-carbon new homes and an end to right-to-buy (Corbyn unveils Labour\u2019s most radical manifesto for decades, 22 November). But \u2013 as an architect who was active in London in the 1960s and 70s, at the height of the postwar expansion of council house building \u2013 I have some misgivings about the commitment to build at a rate of 150,000 units a year. The maximum achieved during the 1950s and 60s was an average of about 200,000, following a build-up of about three years. When there was a major push to increase throughput by industrialised building and package-dealing with little or no design input from planners and architects, standards fell, social and environmental consequences were dire and many of the products of those years have been demolished. Labour should learn from this that the careful construction of humane communities, which sustain lives and are loved, requires generous lead-in time. We start from a low base with most local authorities bled dry of professional expertise. Also, overheating in the construction industry runs into storages of mortals and skilled labour, producing inflation. Furthermore, there is no mention of existing housing and the need to revive incentives to upgrade this. At present, the 20% VAT levied on maintenance and retrofit (with a few minor exemptions such as insulants) provides an inbuilt financial incentive for site clearance and new build, which is VAT exempt. Only with the equalisation of this tax across retrofit and new build can an objective cost-benefit analysis be made of alternative approaches to the existing stock. The brownfield first requirement should be revived. In the absence of these moderations, Labour\u2019s housing policies are in danger of continuing the present dominance of big developers, demanding huge sites with immeasurable damage to social cohesion, plus continuing pressure on the green belt. Kate Macintosh Winchester, Hampshire \u2022 You report on Labour\u2019s promise to tackle the housing crisis as an unchallenged good (Labour\u2019s \u00a375bn pledge to tackle UK housing crisis, 21 November). However, if it is not accompanied by parallel investment in infrastructure and roads, it can be a disaster for individual localities. In my area, thousands of houses have been built without any additional doctors\u2019 surgeries or schools, and in an area with just two main roads leading through the increasingly gridlocked town of Aylesbury. A ring road is promised, but only after all the houses are in place, so before that happens we face years of traffic misery and lack of facilities. The houses are not even serving local people as they are designed and priced to attract escapees from London and are unaffordable to young people who want to stay local. Finally, those of us who chose to live in smaller villages find the town steadily moving towards us, damaging our environment and polluting our air. Unrestrained building, unless matched by appropriate infrastructure and respect for the environment, can be a blight on an area. Jill Wallis Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire \u2022 Labour\u2019s plans to spend \u00a375bn on new build is expensive and comes with enormous social and environmental implications. The party\u2019s plans are ambitious but, as history teaches us, unlikely to succeed. We can increase the supply of secure, affordable housing for tenants immediately by encouraging house owners to create separate, independent areas for living at market, social rents. These rents should include the cost of household charges: energy and water charges, to drive down the cost of living for tenants. House owners can benefit from a new source of income. We simply must use our existing stock to solve the housing crisis. Peter Ellis Founder, homeswithinhomes.org \u2022 As soon as the election is over all parties must agree emergency measures for homeless families and individuals. Thousands of families have been in temporary accommodation for up to and over 10 years. There are 84,740 such families in England, up 77% since 2010, according to the House of Commons Library. They cannot wait another 10 years while enough truly affordable housing is built. There are no plans in national or local government to urgently meet their needs for a permanent home. We have a social housing, affordable rents and elimination of homelessness bill ready to be launched on 16 December. It enables urgent and immediate action by national and local government. There have already been too many Christmases when rents are so high and incomes so low that debt, hunger, homelessness, mental and physical ill health are inevitable. Homeless people dying on the streets is preventable. Rev Paul Nicolson Taxpayers Against Poverty \u2022 Your article on the proposed development in north London (The billionaire and the 219 flats: a new low for rabbit hutch Britain?, Money, 23 November) demonstrates the weakness of our planning laws and the \u201cpreventative approach\u201d \u2013 the effect of deregulation. However, should the development proceed, the council has another route to address the problem. Many of these proposed flats will have a serious hazard of \u201ccrowding and space\u201d under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS) and the local housing authority has the power to prohibit their use as a dwelling under the Housing Act 2004. This act links housing and health and defines health as including mental health, and such flats will certainly be a risk to occupiers\u2019 mental health. The act does not distinguish between tenures, so anyone thinking of buying such a flat should beware. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 as amended by the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018 also means that properties have to be fit when let and throughout the tenancy. The standard of fitness there also includes the HHSRS hazards and so would be actionable by any future tenants who move into these unfit flats.

      "bodyText": "A year ago, a black scar appeared on the far north Queensland landscape. Satellite images and photographs show the aftermath of a bushfire that burned in world heritage tropical rainforest for 10 days. Almost no one noticed when the Japoon national park caught fire \u2013 mature rainforest trees destroyed across about 250 hectares. A single story in a local newspaper, focusing on how the fire started, appears to be the only time it has been reported. Experts and rainforest authorities say the remarkable extent of the damage, across an environment supposed to naturally suppress fires, is among the clearest evidence that climate change has shifted the paradigm in the tropics. \u201cWhen the rainforest was burning, the first thing we learned was that it can burn,\u201d says Leslie Shirreffs, the chair of the Wet Tropics Management Authority. \u201cThe fire came outside from adjacent land, but ordinarily when it came to rainforest it would stop.\u201d Last week the authority released a climate adaptation plan that acknowledged the impacts of climate change on 900,000 hectares of north Queensland tropical rainforest and its ecosystems. The authority has previously said climate change damage to the forest is as bad as coral bleaching on the reef. Shirreffs says the plan takes into account observations made by Indigenous traditional owners, including things such as changing seasonal indicators and rainfall patterns, and changing bird behaviour. The adaptation plan focuses on strategies to help build resilience, such as land restoration to strengthen wildlife corridors, pest control and protective habitat elements that might provide species shelter during climate extremes. Climate threats to the rainforest come in many forms. There is a threat from tropical cyclones, which experts say will increase in intensity and impact due to climate change. Recent extreme heat events are also worrying. Centuries-old heat records were broken in north Queensland last year, including at forest mountain peaks which recorded a six-day run of temperatures above 36C. Some creatures, like the rare lemuroid ringtail possum, are unable to survive when temperatures rise above 29C. \u201cThe data now shows that lemuroid ringtail possums and potentially other mountaintop species could become locally extinct, at what was previously their most abundant site, within the coming decade,\u201d Shirreffs says. \u201cWhen you have a 900,000-hectare world heritage area you assume there\u2019s an inbuilt resilience. But that\u2019s without anticipating some of the extremes that are now happening.\u201d The fire broke out after the forest canopy had already been damaged by two other natural disasters. During the past 15 years the area had been hit by two severe tropical cyclones \u2013 Larry and Yasi. Vines that had grown into the cyclone-damaged canopy would carry the fire from the forest floor and into the tops of the trees. The dry season had been unusually long and temperatures were at extreme highs for almost a week. At the same time Queensland experienced its first ever \u201ccatastrophic\u201d fire conditions, sparking threats to lives and property that diverted most of the attention elsewhere, while the Japoon national park burned. Shirreffs said it was unclear how the rainforest would respond to the fire damage but there were already some worrying signs, including Siam weed, an invasive plant that has begun growing in the burnt area. \u201cWe do see [responding to climate change] as a test and it can be sobering what happens around the place, but the wet tropics is a remarkable place, it\u2019s one of the best managed world heritage areas in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to look at the practices we know make forests stronger and we need to step things up.

After finishing the last sitting year with a historic defeat, when the medevac bill was passed against its will, the Morrison government is looking to go full circle and close out 2019 with its repeal. But first, Christian Porter is looking to tick off a legacy Coalition policy to have trade unions placed under increased scrutiny. The attorney general ended last week increasingly confident he had the numbers to have the government\u2019s \u201censuring integrity\u201d bill passed in the Senate, after agreeing to a number of amendments from the crossbench party Centre Alliance. The bill has been criticised by the opposition and trade union supporters as an ideological push by the Coalition as part of its \u201cunion busting\u201d agenda, with Tony Burke accusing the government of having one standard for corporate Australia and another for trade unions. \u201cWhat I can say is with this government there is no doubt at all they are putting forward one rule for corporate Australia and a completely different rule for the organisations that represent workers,\u201d Burke told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cAnd we have to think about the sort, the types of offences that I just referred to.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Another piece of legislation absent from the notice paper earlier this month was the medevac repeal bill, which has now been listed for debate on Wednesday. Lambie remains the decision maker, and has refused to say which way she will cast her vote, with Peter Dutton leading the charge on those negotiations. Information about medevac cases the government has been dealing with has been released to the media in the lead up to the debate, with Kristina Keneally fronting Labor\u2019s defence of the legislation. Advocates continue to rally outside parliament for the bill to remain in place, but the outcome remains uncertain. But the government will start the week welcoming back an old face, with Jim Molan to be sworn back into the Senate as the replacement for Arthur Sinodinos, who is heading to Washington to replace Joe Hockey as ambassador. Molan lost a preselection battle for the New South Wales Senate ticket, landing at the unwinnable fourth spot, at the last election. He embarked on a controversial counter-campaign in a bid to nudge out the Nationals senator who held the third spot and retain his seat in the Senate, but despite receiving a record 112,000 below the line first preference votes, the former army major general fell well short of the necessary quota. Molan won the replacement bid after promising to vacate the seat at the next election. His return boosts the number of right-aligned Liberal MPs in the party room, with Molan a popular Sky News guest and declared champion of conservative values. In the lower house, the government has put forward bills aiming to expand the cashless debit card trial, which has been rejected by Labor and Greens senators, as well as to increase the national broadcaster\u2019s responsibility to regional and rural areas. The government is also expected to release its exposure draft for a national integrity commission, despite misgivings within its own party room it will not go far enough.

      "bodyText": "As the field of geology tells us, even spontaneous eruptions have long, often ancient, antecedents. Friction builds up inexorably. Pressure increases. It all happens seemingly unnoticed, until one day: kaboom. That within the same weekend not one, but two, A-League coaches would spew molten magma during post-match press conferences is however entirely predictable, when the respective triggers are the mindboggling inconsistency of VAR and the mindboggling inconsistency of the International Football Association Board\u2019s new handball rule. On the available replays, it\u2019s hard to see sufficient grounds for awarding a penalty for Pirmin Schwegler\u2019s shirt-tug on Denis Genreau \u2013 the event that prompted an F-bomb laden tirade from Western Sydney Wanderers coach Marcus Babbel post-game. But thanks to the elegant opacity of the term \u201cclear and obvious error\u201d \u2013 a phrase so anchored in subjectivity Greek philosophers are still sitting under trees debating the precise limits of its outlines \u2013 we have no idea by what objective basis the VAR elected not to overrule Chris Beath\u2019s initial decision. It\u2019s the great conundrum of the VAR era \u2013 it can claim rigid exactitude in ruling offsides to within a millimetre, yet simultaneously remain content to lurk amid the mists of ambiguity when it comes to cross-examining human decisions. For Mark Rudan, having watched his Western United side denied not one, but two, arguably cast-iron penalties late on during their 1-0 loss to the Mariners it was the equally incomprehensible IFAB new handball rules in his sights. \u201cThe advisory panels had a detailed and constructive discussion on how the handball law could be improved to clarify what constitutes handball and consequently, to ensure a more consistent application of the law,\u201d crowed the brilliantly headlined \u201cIFAB advisory panels make progress with handball\u201d from 2018. Like VAR, again weasel-words are at play, this time with the concept of a hand being in a \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cunnatural\u201d position at the centre of conjecture. \u201cWhat\u2019s natural, what\u2019s unnatural \u2013 I have no idea anymore. I just don\u2019t get it,\u201d fumed Rudan, like a modern day Diogenes, sans barrel. The player at the centre of the first incident, Central Coast\u2019s Ziggy Gordon was similarly perplexed. \u201cThing is, you don\u2019t know what the rules are these days, I just done my best to try and block a shot and keep my hands down.\u201d As Rudan rightly points out, amid such hair-tearing uncertainty, it\u2019s hard for coaches to even know how to train defenders to defend. An unnatural hand to prevent a smack in the face last week? Fine. An unnatural hand trailing behind the body this week? Fine. But a deflection onto an unnatural hand during the opening week? Penalty. In Hawaiian culture the goddess of volcanoes is called Pele. A name synonymous with flair and joy in football, there\u2019s little wonder VAR and IFAB\u2019s new handball rules are prompting coaches to erupt. But while both these issues have their roots far beyond the humble realms of the A-League these coaches are sufficiently experienced and media-savvy enough to know precisely what they\u2019re doing by \u201cgoing large\u201d on these topics. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here to deflect \u2013 I\u2019ve got nothing to deflect \u2013 we played extremely well,\u201d deflected Rudan. While hugely improved from where they were last season, the Mariners remain a team very much there for the taking. Melbourne City demonstrated this two weeks ago; Adelaide last week. How Western United failed to break down a side on a 36-game streak without a clean sheet and with a reshuffled back four to boot is worthy of forensic investigation. A team that has been built to be defensively solid first and foremost and then to attack in transition runs into trouble against sides that fail to proactively force the play. It\u2019s a fair question for Rudan, especially coming off consecutive losses to the Jets and the Mariners. Similarly, after the early season promise following their return to the custom-built Parramatta Stadium, questions are warranted of Western Sydney Wanderers\u2019 performances during back-to-back losses. Having taken a second-minute lead following an excellent counter-attack, Fox Sports matchday commentator Andy Harper cut an increasingly frustrated figure at the lack of attacking impetus from the home side. \u201cFor me it\u2019s been brewing for the Wanderers, [they\u2019re] just courting trouble, not being able to hold onto the ball,\u201d he opined shortly after the contentious penalty, before warming to the theme in the 75th minute. \u201cThey\u2019ve showed no appetite, and less ability to dominate the possession at home against Melbourne City, and really, they\u2019ve been sitting ducks.\u201d But rather than punditry lauding the attacking verve of Erick Mombaert\u2019s City in contrast with Babbel\u2019s Wanderers, the headlines surround issues plaguing the entire footballing world. Just as the pressures that geologists examine are systemic, so too are all coaches affected by the present incongruities of world football\u2019s twin b\u00eate noires \u2013 VAR\u2019s \u201cclear and obvious error\u201d and IFAB\u2019s new handball ruling. The bad penalty decision or the non-penalty award becomes the excuse, but also the smokescreen. As media-savvy coaches like Babbel and Rudan well know.",

      "body": "<p>As this weirdest of general elections grinds on through the increasing dark and cold, you can pick up a striking sound: partisans and activists loyal to either Labour or the remain cause becoming exasperated with the public. Over the weekend, their annoyance and bafflement was triggered by opinion polls that suggested a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/23/tories-renewed-poll-boost-brexit-party-candidates-pull-out-opinium-observer\" title=\"\">widening Tory lead</a>: \u201cWhy am I so out of sync with voters? What is wrong with people?\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ottocrat/status/1198331192535343104\" title=\"\">asked</a> one tweeter. But over the past three weeks there has also been a sense of another gap: between people feeling wound up and passionate, and an electorate that still seems cynical and detached.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The ocean of cynicism maintained by social media means that big political figures tend to be figures of fun</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cApathy\u201d would be the wrong word, because there\u2019s no lack of political engagement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\" title=\"\">On the road</a> over the past three weeks, I have met people who will be voting Labour and hoping that doing so might help to fix the dire state of our public services, and a homelessness crisis that seems to get worse by the week. Former Tory voters have told me they are so incensed by Brexit that they have resolved to support the Liberal Democrats; lots of people have bought into the idea that we must \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and therefore decided to back the Conservatives. But just about everyone has expressed their opinions with an ingrained scepticism.</p> \n<p>To some extent, these things are always true of people\u2019s attitudes to politics and politicians. But at this rate, even if there are huge contrasts between the parties and their plans, we are hardly heading for another 1945, 1979 or 1997. Events and public sentiment are out of sync: the election\u2019s paradox consists of a tangle of factors \u2013 Brexit, austerity, Labour\u2019s thoroughgoing socialism and the fate of the two main party leaders and their respective projects \u2013 meshing together to form a hugely significant moment, but with most of the public still refusing to buy into any real sense of drama.</p> \n<p>The wintry conditions do not help.

      "bodyText": "As this weirdest of general elections grinds on through the increasing dark and cold, you can pick up a striking sound: partisans and activists loyal to either Labour or the remain cause becoming exasperated with the public. Over the weekend, their annoyance and bafflement was triggered by opinion polls that suggested a widening Tory lead: \u201cWhy am I so out of sync with voters? What is wrong with people?\u201d asked one tweeter. But over the past three weeks there has also been a sense of another gap: between people feeling wound up and passionate, and an electorate that still seems cynical and detached. \u201cApathy\u201d would be the wrong word, because there\u2019s no lack of political engagement. On the road over the past three weeks, I have met people who will be voting Labour and hoping that doing so might help to fix the dire state of our public services, and a homelessness crisis that seems to get worse by the week. Former Tory voters have told me they are so incensed by Brexit that they have resolved to support the Liberal Democrats; lots of people have bought into the idea that we must \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and therefore decided to back the Conservatives. But just about everyone has expressed their opinions with an ingrained scepticism. To some extent, these things are always true of people\u2019s attitudes to politics and politicians. But at this rate, even if there are huge contrasts between the parties and their plans, we are hardly heading for another 1945, 1979 or 1997. Events and public sentiment are out of sync: the election\u2019s paradox consists of a tangle of factors \u2013 Brexit, austerity, Labour\u2019s thoroughgoing socialism and the fate of the two main party leaders and their respective projects \u2013 meshing together to form a hugely significant moment, but with most of the public still refusing to buy into any real sense of drama. The wintry conditions do not help. Neither does the fact that this is the UK\u2019s third general election in four years, taking place in the midst of post-referendum tortures that have gone round in circles for the last three (if you are in Scotland, you will have had two referendums in five years and, as in Wales, an additional contest for your national parliament).

Even if Boris Johnson is now as likely to win a Commons majority as some people suggest, it is worth bearing in mind the verdict of the psephological guru John Curtice, that he is \u201cthe most unpopular new prime minister in polling history\u201d.

However, I identified the same idol in the Medici archive \u2026 [and] all the objects were withdrawn before the auction \u2026 Three years later, the object was confiscated from the same collector based on evidence I had given.\u201d Tsirogiannis dismissed claims by auction houses of a lack of access to the seized archives: \u201cThey do have access to them. They just choose not to have by not sending photos of the objects to the authorities before they put together the catalogue.\u201d He described the Eros statue as \u201can extremely important and beautiful object\u201d, adding: \u201cA potential buyer\u2019s investment and reputation will be at stake if, in due course, any proof of its illicit origin appears.\u201d A Christie\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cFollowing extensive research, we have found no grounds under which title to sell can be questioned. Christie\u2019s would never sell anything having reason to believe has been stolen or inauthentic. We devote considerable time and money to investigating the objects in our care. We consult academic, police, civil, national and international lists of stolen works and when we publish our catalogues we welcome scrutiny to help us ensure our information is correct.\u201d She added: \u201cWe deliberately publish our catalogues well in advance to allow any additional information to come to light in our efforts to ensure only objects with proper title are sold. \u201cWe also send our catalogues to all embassies and those who hold archives as an additional safeguard.\u201d But Tsirogiannis said he did not receive a catalogue from Christie\u2019s. \u201cEvery argument \u2026 in their official statement \u2026 is blown up by their own phrase: \u2018said to be\u2019.\u201d",

A 24-year-old man died in hospital at about midday on Sunday, six hours after police and paramedics found him suffering from stab injuries in Ilford Lane, east London. Police believe he sustained his injuries after a brawl broke out at a party hosted at a disused commercial premises in nearby Seven Kings. DI Michael Dougall said that a \u201clarge number of people\u201d are believed to have been present at the party and is appealing for witnesses to come forward.

      "bodyText": "Egyptian security officials have raided the offices of the country\u2019s last major independent news outlet, which has been described as the last bastion of press freedom in Egypt. \u201cPlainclothes security forces have raided Mada Masr\u2019s office in Cairo,\u201d the website tweete. \u201cStaff are currently being held inside, and their phones have been switched off.\u201d Security forces left three and a half hours later after detaining at least three staff members including the editor-in-chief, Lina Attalah. One American and one British staff member were taken to get their passports, amid concerns they may be deported. All were later released. The raid on Mada Masr\u2019s offices followed the arrest of one of their editors at his home a day earlier. Shady Zalat, an employee since 2014, was released from detention on a road on the outskirts of Cairo an hour after the raid ended. Rabab El-Mahdi, a politics professor in Cairo, said: \u201cLina Attalah knew yesterday that Shady\u2019s arrest was a litmus test to see if [the authorities] could get away with this.\u201d Mahdi had joined others gathered outside Mada Masr\u2019s offices while police held the staff inside and prevented the publication\u2019s lawyers from entering. Mada Masr is the lone surviving outlet of a prolonged crackdown on independent and critical media in Egypt, and has won multiple awards. It continued to publish critical and even investigative journalism in an environment where media independent of the state have been progressively extinguished. At one point it was forced to distribute articles via Facebook after its website was blocked in Egypt two years ago. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want propaganda, Mada is the only place,\u201d said Mahdi. \u201cAs an Egyptian citizen, this is the last kind of this service we have in this country.\u201d Since coming to power in a military coup in 2013, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has overseen a sweeping and punitive clampdown on free expression, detaining journalists and putting them on trial as the country\u2019s military and security forces tightened their grip on the country\u2019s media. At least 25 journalists were detained in 2018, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Reporters Without Borders refers to the country as \u201cone of the world\u2019s biggest prisons for journalists\u201d, ranking it 163rd out of 180 countries worldwide in terms of press freedom. The country has multiple laws criminalising \u201cfake news,\u201d and its parliament is debating a law that would imprison those convicted of \u201cspreading rumours\u201d. Mada Masr\u2019s importance only grew as the media environment around it deteriorated. News outlets forced reliance on pre-written text sent to them by government officials has become so widespread in Egypt that it became the subject of a grim viral moment earlier this year when a news anchor read out the words \u201csent from a Samsung device\u201d at the end of an item on the death of the country\u2019s former president, Mohamed Morsi. A spate of anti-government protests in September triggered a fresh crackdown in Egypt. At least 4,427 people were arrested, according to the Cairo-based organisation the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, while Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor said 1,000 were arrested. The wave of arrests included the journalist Esraa Abdel Fattah, who was tortured in detention and accused of charges including spreading false news and abuse of social media.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s match report from Meadow Park: That will do from me! Thanks for all your company this afternoon. Not a fluent showing from Arsenal but they\u2019ve taken the points; for Liverpool, maybe some encouragement that all is far from lost this season. Until next time, cheerio! In men\u2019s football, Sheffield United play Manchester United soon. Ben Fisher has that one for you: Chelsea are now four up at Birmingham so you\u2019d have to say that, even though Arsenal won, today hasn\u2019t done their title defence that much good given the thumping victory margins of their rivals. Liverpool try to build some late pressure but that\u2019s it: Miedema\u2019s goal makes the difference. Not one for the end of season highlights compilers to dwell on, but a decent showing from the bottom-placed side and if that early chance for Bradley-Auckland had gone in it could have been so, so different. 90+1 min: We are into three added minutes ... 89 min: Miedema just can\u2019t turn in a Roord cross and Liverpool, just a shade more enterprising in the last few minutes, ride again ... 88 min: And there\u2019s a flutter as Zinsberger then drops a Lawley cross ... and is generously awarded a free-kick. 87 min: Mead can\u2019t control a nice Miedema switch. It just hasn\u2019t come off very often for Arsenal\u2019s key players today. Chelsea lead 3-0 at Birmingham, we\u2019re told, and in such a tight title race I\u2019m sure Arsenal would have liked to score a couple more. Lawley has a rare shot for Liverpool but it\u2019s not close. 85 min: It would be fairly amazing if Liverpool got something out of this, given their complete lack of threat since half-time, but Arsenal would only have themselves to blame. 83 min: Yet another Arsenal corner. Can they add some garnish? It\u2019s played cleverly to Miedema and she\u2019s not far off, her effort deflecting into the side netting off Bradley-Auckland. 81 min: Meanwhile, Arsenal bring on Walti for Nobbs. The pace of this game is glacial at the moment. 80 min: This is, you could say, the kind of game that wins you titles \u2013 off colour but still doing the job. But on the other hand it\u2019s a stark contrast with what Man City, for example, achieved at Bristol today. 77 min: Evans slips while trying to cross in a good position and it sums up the majority of Arsenal\u2019s performance, really. Liverpool make their second change, Murray \u2013 another ex-Arsenal player \u2013 replacing Linnett. 75 min: Arsenal continue to have all the play but they really aren\u2019t looking very penetrative. It\u2019s been sluggish fare from them except for, perhaps, the 15 minutes before half-time. 73 min: Another Arsenal corner, this time from the left side. It\u2019s defended well, for far from the first time, by ex-Arsenal player Fahey. 71 min: We\u2019ve seen nothing of Liverpool as an attacking force in this half, really, although they do have a long shot blocked as I write. Only one chance needed to score though ... 67 min: Arsenal win their latest corner; there\u2019ve been a few this half without much reward. Mead\u2019s delivery is met solidly by Beattie and then, in front of goal, pings off the head of Van de Donk and high. 65 min: A Liverpool change, now, as Hodson replaces the hardworking Babajide. 64 min: Miedema and Van de Donk almost combine but Preuss just gets to the former\u2019s cross before the latter. 63 min: Arsenal win a corner on the right but can\u2019t make much of it. Liverpool must surely be growing in confidence from the way they have made this a game. 60 min: Mead strikes one off target but Arsenal are yet to put much together in this half, Williamson\u2019s blast aside. 58 min: The away side almost cause a scare as Zinsberger has to be out very sharply to clear a long ball towards Sweetman-Kirk, who had got away for a moment. 57 min: Liverpool aren\u2019t allowing many clear chances at this point in the half though. They just need to find something in opposition territory, because they do need a goal. Arsenal haven\u2019t shipped one for nearly 600 minutes ... 54 min: They\u2019re nearly seen off there, though, by Williamson \u2013 who wanders upfield from the back and launches a fine, dipping long-range effort off the top of Preuss\u2019s bar! 53 min: Babagide halts an Arsenal attack but there is a touch of anywhere-will-do about her clearance. If Liverpool stay composed they still have a real chance here. 51 min: Embarrassment for Evans as she takes so much time over a throw-in that it\u2019s awarded to Liverpool instead. They really have been weirdly sluggish at times. 49 min: That apart, little to report in the second half yet. Arsenal are asking the early questions though. 47 min: Arsenal made a half-time change, Maier in for McCabe at left-back. Arsenal get us going. The second half will be underway very shortly. Any changes you\u2019d like to see? Arsenal will want a marked change in tempo, although they did get better after going ahead. Here\u2019s another read from Suzanne Wrack for your half-time coffee, on the dwindling relevance of the salary cap: Van de Donk cannot quite reach a cross from the right and that\u2019s the half. Far from Arsenal\u2019s best, and they were a post\u2019s width from going a shock goal down. But they have a lethal striker in Miedema, who got them off and running with a typically precise finish, and might have scored one or two more. In the event, Liverpool are not out of it yet and have put a couple of capable moves together themselves. Come back in 15 minutes! 43 min: Mead should score the crucial second! Miedema is sprung clear in the inside-left, picks out her colleague \u2013 who has made a fine diagonal run to the near post \u2013 and probably expects to see the net bulge. But Mead, perhaps under pressure from a defender, sidefoots wide from close in! 42 min: Another Arsenal goal now would probably see them off, however, and Preuss has to backpedal to turn a Mead cross out for a corner. The hosts work it short but can\u2019t make a lot from it. 41 min: An encouraging spell for Liverpool ends with Linnett shooting straight at Zinsberger from 20 yards. She had teammates well placed and it wasn\u2019t the best option to choose. A sign that they aren\u2019t out of this though. 38 min: Chance for Van de Donk! Evans sashays into absolutely acres of space down that right flank, gets her head up and picks out her teammate ... but Van de Donk\u2019s first-time effort is inches wide. Might have done a fair bit better. 36 min: Miedema does brilliantly to get to the left byline but Nobbs, running in at speed and at an angle to the back post, would have to produce something extraordinary to convert a right-footed volley. She doesn\u2019t; it\u2019s slashed miles off target. 35 min: Arsenal play keepball for a while, although their passing has generally been a lot more purposeful in the last 10 or 15 minutes. 32 min: Evans is sent away to the right byline by some snappy interplay but her cutback is smartly defended by Liverpool. 31 min: For Liverpool, now, it\u2019s probably a case of staying in the game for as long as possible, not conceding a second and then hoping something drops their way \u2013 as it so nearly did from that free-kick in the opening minutes. Give her a chance and she\u2019ll put it away. Not much had come off for Miedema or Arsenal until this but it doesn\u2019t really matter now. A surging run into the right side of the box and a fierce, cracked effort across the diving Preuss open the scoring and it\u2019s a big ask for Liverpool from here. 27 min: Roberts has a pop from long range for Liverpool, and why not? She catches it quite well but Zinsberger catches it too, in the goalkeeperly with-her-hands sense. 26 min: Man City lead 5-0 at Bristol City, so it\u2019s fair to say Arsenal won\u2019t be leapfrogging them today. 24 min: Terrible decision there as the Evans-Mead combination, Arsenal\u2019s most fruitful so far, clearly wins a corner off a defender but a goal-kick is awarded. That really was as clear as day. 23 min: Just a few signs that Arsenal are starting to get into their stride, albeit without creating a great deal. Liverpool are finding it tough to get out. 20 min: The quiet Van de Donk finally pulls a few strings and a good Arsenal move ends up with Mead\u2019s latest delivery being smuggled away. Liverpool remain dogged though, that one mishap apart. 18 min: The lively Babajide peels down the left for Liverpool but her low cross can\u2019t find her fellow forward Sweetman-Kirk. 16 min: But that\u2019s a big let-off for Liverpool there \u2013 they try to play the ball out from the resulting set-piece and concede possession, with Miedema eventually having a free shot at goal that Preuss blocks superbly. One big chance apiece! 15 min: Mead is bundled over after a slick, fast set of passes releases her down the right. Arsenal have a very dangerous free-kick position on the right ... but Mead\u2019s delivery is well defended and, in the event, a home players makes a foul. 12 min: Roord lofts high and wide after an Evans cross towards Miedema is half-cleared; it\u2019s Arsenal\u2019s first broadly threatening moment really. 10 min: Will that wake Arsenal up? They attack instantly after that let-off but Mead crosses waywardly behind the goal. 9 min: And Liverpool nearly do even better than that! It\u2019s a brilliant save from the Arsenal goalkeeper Zinsberger as Bradley-Auckland connects with a free-kick \u2013 the ball is turned acrobatically onto the inside of the post before it rolls along the line and away! 8 min: Better from Arsenal as Miedema and Nobbs attempt and give-and-go, but we\u2019re yet to see a shot fired in anger and Liverpool \u2013 who I pointed out earlier do not really get thrashed \u2013 have bedded in well enough. 5 min: Evans is the next player to lose possession for Arsenal, who have not quite got going yet even if one suspects that early Liverpool spell was very much the exception to the norm. 3 min: It\u2019s actually a decent start from Liverpool, who go on to enjoy some decent passing around the Arsenal box without managing to carve any chances out. They\u2019ll be mildly encouraged. 2 min: Lots and lots of early Arsenal possession, as you\u2019d expect, before Miedema breaks the spell with a sloppy touch and lets Liverpool get an early feel of the ball. Team huddles all round; Liverpool then kick us off and go right to left! The teams are on the pitch now at Meadow Park! Kick-off is not far away at all ... Other WSL scores so far today: Man United 4-0 Brighton (full-time) Bristol City 0-1 Man City (64 min) Everton 3-1 Spurs (68 min) A reminder that we\u2019ll see the nascent season\u2019s joint second-top scorers in action today: Arsenal\u2019s dynamic Dutch duo, Vivianne Miedema and Danielle van de Donk, have three goals apiece. There\u2019s just time before kick-off for you to read this excellent interview with Emma Hayes by Suzanne Wrack: And Liverpool are below. The experienced Niamh Fahey spent many years at Arsenal. Here\u2019s your Arsenal team: This looks like a home banker. Bear with us, because appearances can be very deceptive. But on the face of things Arsenal, in third place and a point off the top, should more or less pulverise a Liverpool side that has a single point \u2013 and a single goal \u2013 to its name so far this season. The latter stat doesn\u2019t really do much for the visitors\u2019 chances because Arsenal have only conceded thrice in their six games. They\u2019ll be coming into this on a high after winning away at Spurs in front of a raucous, bumper crowd \u2013 and perhaps Liverpool\u2019s best hope is to catch them napping in rather more prosaic surroundings at Meadow Park. But it takes a lot to faze Joe Montemurro\u2019s side and, for them, surely nothing short of a good win will do \u2013 particularly as the teams above them, Manchester City, both play away today. Liverpool had their own heady derby experience last weekend, facing Everton at Anfield, but lost 1-0 despite raining the shots in throughout. They don\u2019t actually take too many hidings at all, and scored a confidence-boosting six against Blackburn in the cup during the week. But it would be some surprise if they translated that into a positive result today. Let\u2019s see! Kick-off is not far away.

      "bodyText": "ScottishPower has begun plans for a major expansion of onshore windfarm projects across Scotland in anticipation of a government U-turn on support for wind power projects. The renewable energy arm of the big six power supplier has already considered almost 100 sites for a new generation of windfarm, using a smaller number of more powerful wind turbines to generate clean electricity. Most of the sites are in Scotland, but the company is also considering plots in Ireland. Scottish Power expects the Conservative party\u2019s block on onshore generation to be cast aside in the next parliament due to the growing need for cheap, clean energy to power the UK towards its climate goals. Lindsay McQuade, the chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, said she expects to see the next government match the ambition of the UK\u2019s legislated climate targets with support for renewable energy development. The government\u2019s official climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), has said the UK will need to build at least 1,000MW of onshore wind every year for the next three decades if it hopes to meet its target to create a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. This steady rollout is necessary, in addition to building offshore windfarms at four times the present rate. McQuade said this meant renewable energy developers must start planning now to have a hope of meeting the target. She said Scottish Power had \u201ca pipeline of energy developments across the UK, particularly in Scotland, where there\u2019s excellent natural resource\u201d. \u201cScottish Power is developing an ambitious pipeline of onshore renewables that could deliver investment, create jobs and power our lives in the most economic way possible \u2013 if the commitment of net zero is to be a reality, I expect to see support from government to match it,\u201d she said. The Tory party is under pressure to reverse its block on government support for new onshore windfarms, which was put in place by former prime minister David Cameron in 2015. The clampdown blocks onshore wind developers from competing for support contracts, and caused the rollout of new onshore wind capacity to fall by nearly 80% last year, to the lowest level since 2011. The CCC has warned that the UK is unlikely to be able to develop enough renewable energy projects without government-backed contracts. Even \u201csubsidy-free\u201d projects would need a government deal to help negate the investment risk and reduce costs, the committee said. McQuade said there was \u201cbroad political consensus to decarbonise our economy as rapidly as possible so that we live and work in a clean, green and sustainable manner. We expect cross-party commitment to deliver a viable route to market for onshore wind, the cheapest form of new electricity generation.\u201d The Labour party, Liberal Democrats, Green party and SNP have all voiced support for reinstating support for onshore wind, and evidence has emerged that Tory supporters overwhelmingly back it too. A survey over the summer for the Conservative Environment Network showed that 74% of people who voted Conservative in the last election support onshore windfarms. The survey revealed that only a third of Tory voters support fracking, and within months the government called for an immediate halt to fracking across England. Zac Goldsmith, then the MP for Richmond Park, said at the time: \u201cOur constituents want to see us do more to tackle climate change. The next election will be fought on several key issues where we clearly diverge from other parties. But we shouldn\u2019t be ceding ground on those that are straightforward, like bringing back onshore windfarms.\u201d",

The allegations of corruption have emerged as part of a separate investigation by US prosecutors into another firm, Unaoil. Petrofac, which is a FTSE 250 company, said no charges had been brought against any of its companies or current employees since the SFO started its investigation three years ago.

Only two of these firms are named in the legal document as they have admitted paying bribes with Unaoil. The others are given cyphers. However, Petrofac has been identified as being one of the firms by the Guardian from separate sources. Petrofac has previously disclosed that it hired Unaoil for \u201cthe provision of local consultancy services primarily in Kazakhstan between 2002 and 2009\u201d. According to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Cyrus Ahsani conspired with employees of the firm that has been identified by the Guardian as being Petrofac to pay bribes to obtain contracts in Kazakhstan between 2003 and 2010. The US prosecutors said the Ahsani brothers took steps to conceal the alleged bribes and coordinated with an executive of the firm that has been identified as Petrofac to maintain a double set of books and records to disguise the payments as legitimate transactions. The Petrofac executive left the firm some years ago. The Serious Fraud Office opened an investigation into alleged bribery and money-laundering involving Unaoil in 2016 after the leak of thousands of its emails to journalists at Australia\u2019s Fairfax media. Following the leak, Petrofac commissioned a law firm to examine allegations that it had conspired with Unaoil to pay bribes to land contracts in Kazakhstan. In 2016, Petrofac said this investigation \u201cdid not find evidence confirming the payment of bribes\u201d, adding that its board confirmed \u201cthat no evidence was found that any director of the company was aware of the alleged misconduct that is the subject of the allegations\u201d.

The DoJ declined to comment. Petrofac designs and constructs facilities for the oil and gas industry, employing more than 11,000 people in 24 offices around the world and received revenues of more than \u00a35bn last year. Petrofac\u2019s co-founder, chief executive and largest shareholder is Ayman Asfari. He and his wife have donated almost \u00a3800,000 to the Conservative party since 2009. The donations were made in a personal capacity. Last month, the Guardian revealed that two former Conservative prime ministers, Theresa May and David Cameron, lobbied a Middle Eastern royal family to award a $5bn (\u00a33.9bn) fossil fuels contract to Petrofac. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 25 November 2019 to include the word \u201cexecutive\u201d after \u201cPetrofac\u201d.",

After the Fairtrade organic chocolate brand Green &amp; Black\u2019s was taken over by food giant Kraft, for example, it started to produce confectionary that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/green-blacks-new-uk-chocolate-bar-not-organic-fairtrade\">was neither organic nor </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/03/green-blacks-new-uk-chocolate-bar-not-organic-fairtrade\">Fairtrade-certified</a>.</p> \n<p>Corporations are aware of a growing clamour, from consumers, employees, regulators, and even some investors, for business to demonstrate a social purpose beyond profitmaking. <br><br>But can leopards change their spots? Most of the frontrunners in the \u201cpurpose economy\u201d were set up to solve a specific social or environmental problem. Only then did they go about putting together a business to deliver it \u2013 not vice versa. In that sense, it\u2019s a question few of them have had to ask.<br><br>Take <a href=\"https://www.fairphone.com/en/\">Fair</a><a href=\"https://www.fairphone.com/en/\">phone</a>. Located in Amsterdam, this hyper-ethical phone manufacturer insists on only using metals and other materials that are sustainably sourced and can be traced back to their origin. It\u2019s a commitment that grew out of the firm\u2019s origins as a campaign group against abuses in the telecoms supply chain. <br><br>\u201cBack then, we decided that we were not really creating any alternatives, so instead we should become part of the industry ourselves,\u201d explains Eva Gouwens, the chief executive of the maverick phone brand. <br><br>Yet retrofitting a traditional profit-maximising company is a different story altogether. The Belgian materials firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/umicore-smelting-company-clean-tech\">Umicore</a> offers a very rare example of success.

      "bodyText": "In a volatile world jolted by protest, revolt and environmental alarm, capitalism is showing signs of twitchiness. For decades, business has been all about maximising profits and keeping owners happy. Now, thousands of companies and organisations are experimenting with broader values \u2013 purpose over profit, staff and communities ahead of shareholders \u2013 in order to meet the mood of the times. Driving this shift in consciousness is a phalanx of upstart, sustainable businesses. They cluster under different groupings \u2013 Conscious Capitalism, B Corp, The B Team, Just Capital \u2013 but all share the same central objective: to reshape capitalism for an environmentally endangered age. The best of these boast laudable motivations. In the past, if you wanted to change the world, you went into politics or joined a campaign group. Given the shift of power and resources to the private sector over recent decades, the smart money is increasingly on business to deliver solutions. Not business as usual, that is. Plastering products with eco labels or providing perks to employees will make not a jot of difference if, behind the scenes, companies are still happily burning fossil fuels and browbeating suppliers. \u201cIf businesses really want to be part of this movement for change, then great. But that change has to be radical and transformational. If not, it\u2019s empty words and spin,\u201d says Katie Hill, a spokesperson for the ethical certification body B Corp, which now counts over 3,100 registered members in over 70 countries. For a flavour of the changemaking businesses, she points to B Corps\u2019 latest Best for the World list. The selection includes a US bank that specialises in financing community-based enterprises, a locally owned windfarm in Australia and a zero-waste Argentinian restaurant chain. (Guardian Media Group, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, recently announced that it too had been certified as a B corp). To date, founder-led businesses, cooperatives and employee-owned firms have tended to dominate such listings. Most are small, which makes sense. The larger the organisation, the harder it is to keep its mission clear and its values consistent. Small may be beautiful in ethical terms, but it\u2019s not ideal for effecting large-scale change. If endemic poverty is ever to be reversed or global heating resolved, then big business also needs to embrace this more inclusive approach to business. There are signs of that happening. Natura, the huge Brazilian cosmetic brand, and its subsidiary The Body Shop, for example, now feature among a growing roster of multinational B Corps. The purpose-led business agenda received a shot in the arm this summer when the Business Roundtable, a grouping of some 200 top US companies like Amazon, Apple and GM, committed to \u201clead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders\u201d. Even the financial markets are beginning to prick up their ears. Take the rapid rise of the sustainable debt market, which has now passed the $1tn mark. Only last month, beverage giant PepsiCo issued a $1bn \u201cgreen\u201d bond to fund environmental programmes \u2013 a move unthinkable just a few year ago. \u201cIf the old economy makes a change, then that\u2019s how you change the world,\u201d said Dutch sustainable business expert Roeland Dikker Hupkes. Of course, the buy-in of big business comes with risks. Greenwashing is perhaps the most obvious, but some practices are more subtle. After the Fairtrade organic chocolate brand Green &amp; Black\u2019s was taken over by food giant Kraft, for example, it started to produce confectionary that was neither organic nor Fairtrade-certified. Corporations are aware of a growing clamour, from consumers, employees, regulators, and even some investors, for business to demonstrate a social purpose beyond profitmaking. But can leopards change their spots? Most of the frontrunners in the \u201cpurpose economy\u201d were set up to solve a specific social or environmental problem. Only then did they go about putting together a business to deliver it \u2013 not vice versa. In that sense, it\u2019s a question few of them have had to ask. Take Fairphone. Located in Amsterdam, this hyper-ethical phone manufacturer insists on only using metals and other materials that are sustainably sourced and can be traced back to their origin. It\u2019s a commitment that grew out of the firm\u2019s origins as a campaign group against abuses in the telecoms supply chain. \u201cBack then, we decided that we were not really creating any alternatives, so instead we should become part of the industry ourselves,\u201d explains Eva Gouwens, the chief executive of the maverick phone brand. Yet retrofitting a traditional profit-maximising company is a different story altogether. The Belgian materials firm Umicore offers a very rare example of success. Once a dirty, old-school smelting firm, it has reinvented itself over the last decade or so into a pioneering recycler of waste metals. With ever lower margins in the smelting business, Umicore\u2019s motivation was as much economic as it was environmental. The same cold logic enjoys growing traction in other old-school industries, from energy firms facing peak oil to carmakers confronting ever stricter eco standards. Also pushing companies to transform is a growing awareness among individual business leaders about the destructive route down which shareholder capitalism has pushed the planet. As Douglas Lamont, head of the UK beverage brand Innocent Drinks (now part of Coca-Cola), recently told a roomful of fellow executives at B Corps\u2019 annual European summit: \u201cWe are the first generation of leaders who cannot say we didn\u2019t know [about the climate emergency] \u2026 and we are also the last generation who can do anything about it.\u201d The growing demand for a fairer, more caring form of capitalism has also given rise to a related phenomenon: the emergence of the purpose-driven consultant. Over recent years, a cottage industry of advisory firms has sprung up, all promising to help companies on this \u201cjourney\u201d (a favourite phrase) towards a more purposeful, less profit-centric model of business. In the spirit of business-as-unusual, their approach is refreshingly unorthodox. \u201cBold\u201d, \u201cheartfelt\u201d and \u201cemotionally involved\u201d are among the defining characteristics that sustainability expert Ed Gillespie associates with this new breed of consultant. To get the ball rolling, for example, conventional companies may well need a dose of shock therapy, according to Gillespie, who styles himself as an \u201cinsultant\u201d: \u201cSometimes this will involve making clients feel very uncomfortable and might even lead to losing pitches, which most consultants are too chicken to do.\u201d Another hallmark of these challenger consultants is their focus on the motivations and mindsets of individual decision makers.

      "body": "<p>Sir Stephen Cleobury, who has died of cancer aged 70, was director of music at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, in charge of one of the world\u2019s best known choirs, from 1982 until his retirement earlier this year. He continued the 500-year tradition of choral music at King\u2019s, following on from his immediate predecessors AH Mann, Boris Ord, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/david-willcocks\" title=\"\">Sir David Willcocks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/20/sir-philip-ledger\" title=\"\">Sir Philip Ledger</a>.</p> <p>In an institution associated with gradual evolution rather than revolutionary upheaval, Cleobury\u2019s major contribution to progress was his incorporation of contemporary music into the choir\u2019s repertoire, especially his commissioning of a new carol each year for the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, broadcast live on BBC radio on Christmas Eve. Leading composers who have written new work for the service include Thomas Ad\u00e8s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener\" title=\"\">John Tavener</a>, Mark-Anthony Turnage and Harrison Birtwistle.</p> <p>Indeed, it was following the inclusion of Birtwistle\u2019s The Gleam, calling for stamping feet and shouts from the choristers, in 2003 that Cleobury received a missive that read: \u201cWhoever commissioned that carol should be locked in a darkened room and never let out.\u201d The offender was not only unrepentant but proud that he was responsible for contemporary music being broadcast round the globe. He conducted his last Christmas Eve service in 2018, the 100th anniversary of the event, with a new carol by Judith Weir, master of the Queen\u2019s music.</p> <p>In his parallel career as chief conductor of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/singers\" title=\"\">BBC Singers</a>, from 1995 to 2007, Cleobury also had plentiful opportunities to perform music by such composers as James MacMillan, Giles Swayne, <a href=\"http://edwardcowie.com/\" title=\"\">Ed Cowie</a> and Francis Grier. At Cambridge he initiated two successful ventures: Easter at King\u2019s and Concerts at King\u2019s, the latter a year-round series attracting top performers such as <a href=\"http://www.geraldfinley.com/\" title=\"\">Gerald Finley</a> (a former King\u2019s choral scholar), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bryn-terfel\" title=\"\">Bryn Terfel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/alison-balsom\" title=\"\">Alison Balsom</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/19/andreas-scholl-portrait-of-artist\" title=\"\">Andreas Scholl</a>, as well as leading ensembles including the Academy of Ancient Music, Monteverdi Choir and Vienna Boys\u2019 Choir.</p> <p>While the commissioning of new music may have been the most obvious innovation at King\u2019s, Cleobury made subtle adjustments also to the choir\u2019s declamation.

At the same time he continued to emphasise the importance of consonants, aware that they did not enjoy an ideal prominence in the speech of the average modern chorister. He instituted singing lessons for the boys early on and the extra heft with which the choral sound was imbued allowed him to explore repertory beyond the traditional range, including Kod\u00e1ly, Jan\u00e1cek, G\u00f3recki, P\u00e4rt, Tavener and Rachmaninov.

In addition to his conducting he maintained a rapport with the organ loft, giving recitals in such venues as Leeds and Birmingham town halls, the Performing Arts Centre in Hong Kong, as well as Houston, Dallas, Salt Lake City and Cape Town. Recordings on the instrument included albums of music by Bach, Howells, Elgar, Liszt, Reubke and Mendelssohn.</p> <p>He firmly believed that services at King\u2019s, while nominally Anglican, should be able to cater also for visitors who might be Buddhist, agnostic or atheist.

Highlights of his tenure of CUMS included the 800th anniversary celebrations of Cambridge University in 2009 with the premiere of The Sorcerer\u2019s Mirror by Peter Maxwell Davies, but also a Mahler Eighth Symphony in the Royal Albert Hall, in 1999, and the Britten War Requiem in Coventry cathedral, in 2000, on the 60th anniversary of its bombing. He became the society\u2019s first conductor laureate in 2016. He was also honorary president and a regular conductor of the East Anglia Chamber Orchestra, founded in 2010 to provide opportunities for non-professional musicians to play together. In addition to his conducting he maintained a rapport with the organ loft, giving recitals in such venues as Leeds and Birmingham town halls, the Performing Arts Centre in Hong Kong, as well as Houston, Dallas, Salt Lake City and Cape Town. Recordings on the instrument included albums of music by Bach, Howells, Elgar, Liszt, Reubke and Mendelssohn. He firmly believed that services at King\u2019s, while nominally Anglican, should be able to cater also for visitors who might be Buddhist, agnostic or atheist. To external appearances he seemed reserved and introverted, but in the words of an anonymous 12-year-old chorister, \u201cyou have to be in partnership with him to see an entirely different world of emotions revealed\u201d. Cleobury was a man of extraordinary energy, both conscientious and considerate: at services he would stand in front of the organ screen to meet and greet, afterwards going back into the chapel to hear out his organ scholar\u2019s voluntary. He was appointed CBE in 2009 and knighted this year for services to choral music. He is survived by his wife, Emma (nee Disley), whom he married in 2004, and their two daughters, and by two daughters from his first marriage, to Penny (nee Holloway), which ended in divorce. \u2022 Stephen John Cleobury, organist and choirmaster, born 31 December 1948; died 22 November 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 25 November 2019. The tribute paid to Stephen Cleobury by choristers and former choral and organ scholars was at one of his last evensongs in June, not at his final evensong in July, as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "Two of the UK\u2019s largest power companies have quietly transferred the ownership of their British operations to offshore companies to protect themselves against Labour\u2019s plan for renationalisation. National Grid and SSE, which together own Britain\u2019s gas and electricity transmission networks, confirmed on Sunday they had created overseas holding companies following Labour\u2019s pledge to restore them to state ownership. SSE has put its UK business into a new Swiss holding company while National Grid has shifted its gas and electricity businesses into subsidiaries in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. The decisions, which follows a similar move by two water companies, are designed to protect their shareholders against any move to buy back the firms without paying what they would consider to be the full market value. Last week, Jeremy Corbyn unveiled Labour\u2019s most radical manifesto in decades, including the pledge to reverse several of the privatisations of the 1980s and 90s. The party aims to renationalise the rail, water and electricity industries, as well as BT\u2019s broadband infrastructure division, Openreach, if it is wins the election. SSE, which has a market value of almost \u00a314bn, confirmed it had moved its electricity distribution business, which supplies 3.7m homes, plus its high-voltage electricity transmission network to a Swiss holding company. It said: \u201cSSE has incorporated in Switzerland a direct and wholly owned subsidiary company to acquire, oversee and hold investments or other financial assets. \u201cThe company has become the holding company for SSE\u2019s electricity transmission and distribution networks through a share-for-share exchange. This is intended to support long-term investment in low-carbon infrastructure in SSE\u2019s core businesses.\u201d SSE said there were no profit or tax advantages of such a move and it was fully consistent with SSE\u2019s commitment to fair taxation. National Grid, which is worth more than \u00a330bn, connects England and Wales\u2019s regional power companies with large power stations via almost 6,000 miles of power cables. It also owns the main gas transmission pipelines. \u201cLabour\u2019s proposals for state ownership of National Grid would be highly detrimental to millions of ordinary people who either hold shares in the company or through their pension funds \u2013 which include several local authority pension funds,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cTo protect their holdings, and in line with our legal fiduciary duty to our shareholders, we have established holding companies in Luxembourg and Hong Kong. This has no financial benefit to the company and does not affect its day-to-day operations. It is solely to protect our shareholders\u2019 interests.\u201d While the offshoring of ownership would not prevent renationalisation, the utilities hope it would force a Labour government to pay more to take back the assets. The fear is that a Labour cabinet would issue a compulsory purchase order on the companies\u2019 shares at a price below market value and double the pain by offering shareholders low-returning government bonds as compensation. Switzerland, Luxembourg and Hong Kong have bilateral investment treaties with the UK that ensure investors are paid the market rate in the event of any state asset buy-back. It is believed the move could also protect the firms\u2019 directors from litigation by disgruntled shareholders. Analysts have already said Labour\u2019s plan would have a negative impact on private shareholders who own shares in the utility firms. Pension funds would also take a big hit if the move failed to restore the full market value of firms taken back into public ownership. Both SSE and National Grid have been prized in recent years for their dependable returns to shareholders. The Energy Networks Association trade body has claimed the renationalisation plan would lead to delays to decarbonisation of the UK. \u201cIt would lead to reduced public accountability, disruption to innovation and higher costs to bill payers. Time to reach net zero is running out \u2013 let\u2019s not waste it by needlessly scrapping a system that works,\u201d it said. Anglian Water is among the utilities to have already created overseas holding companies, and it is understood that Severn Trent is contemplating a similar move. The Labour party said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s energy networks are vital strategic infrastructure on which we all rely. You cannot boil a kettle, heat your home or run a business without the grid. The idea that private owners, who have been ripping off the public, would move offshore in an attempt to prolong the rip-off illustrates just why we need the grid back in public hands.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 November 2019. An earlier version stated that Yorkshire Water was among the utilities to have created an overseas holding company. This was wrong and has been removed.",

Some people are sent hundreds of miles from home to receive substandard care in wards that are often unsuitable or even unsafe. Our experiences invariably intersect with other marginalised groups, too \u2013 girls, young women and black people are more likely to be restrained or subdued by staff on wards than other groups, for example. The violent realities of mental health units often go unnoticed, with sexual, emotional and physical abuse rife but rarely discussed. Being able to have a say on these services \u2013 which too often brutalise and traumatise users \u2013 is vital. So far, our message has been distributed across the UK to hospitals, community centres and supported accommodation, and through activist groups in the hope of reaching as many people as possible. It\u2019s clearly written to ensure that there are no barriers to voter registration. However we also need staff to be proactive \u2013 while some trusts and organisations do have clear programmes on voter rights, and strive to ensure all patients are enfranchised, others do not. Nurses, psychiatrists, support workers and administrative staff all have a part to play in making this happen; family, friends and carers could also help by educating themselves and informing their loved ones so they\u2019re ready to vote if they wish. Mentally ill and other disabled people have a disproportionate exposure to the workings of the (often violent) state \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important our voices are heard. \u2022 Emily Reynolds is a journalist and the author of A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Losing Your Mind",

The body of the 28-year-old, a former member of the girl group Kara, was found early on Sunday evening, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency reported. Police said they were trying to establish the cause of death. Goo\u2019s death comes six months after her manager found her unconscious at her home, in what local media described as an apparent suicide attempt. The singer and actor later apologised to fans and recently relaunched her solo career with a tour of Japan and the release of a new single. Last year, Goo took her former boyfriend to court after he threatened to release footage of them having sex that was filmed without her knowledge or consent. Molka \u2013 in which women are covertly filmed and the footage uploaded to websites \u2013 has reached epidemic levels in South Korea, prompting calls for the government to take tougher action against offenders, who are almost always men. In 2017, a reported 6,400 cases of illegal filming were reported to police, up from 2,400 in 2012. Early last month, South Korean media reported that a woman had killed herself after she discovered that she had been secretly filmed in a hospital changing room. Goo\u2019s death comes weeks after the death of her close friend and fellow K-pop star Sulli turned the spotlight on the darkest corners of the K-pop industry and the online abuse directed at celebrities by \u201ctoxic\u201d fans. Sulli, a former member of the group f(x), had spoken publicly about her mental health problems and shock at her death sparked calls for greater support for performers. A number of South Korean celebrities have killed themselves in the last decade. They include Jang Ja-yeon, a popular soap star who died in 2009, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse by powerful men. The K-pop star Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself in December 2017. Other artists have called for a change in the anonymous commenting culture on the internet, including Kwon Ji-an, a singer and painter better known by her stage name Solbi, who was subjected to cyber-insults in 2009 while she was a member of K-pop group Typhoon.

It was a discovery that would end the careers of most political figures. But among calls for Miller\u2019s resignation, a common theme emerged: a lack of surprise that the architect of Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda endorsed white supremacist views. \u201cStephen Miller has stoked bigotry, hate and division with his extreme political rhetoric and policies throughout his career,\u201d a coalition of 55 civil rights groups wrote to the president this week. \u201cThe recent exposure of his deep-seated racism provides further proof that he is unfit to serve and should immediately leave his post.\u201d A columnist at the conservative newspaper the Washington Examiner, Tiana Lowe, wrote that while the public doesn\u2019t know for a fact how Miller feels inside, he has historically shown an unwillingness to bend his hardline stance on immigration, thereby threatening more mainstream Republican policies. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time for Trump to dump Miller,\u201d Lowe wrote. In a turbulent White House, the 34-year-old has been the driving force behind controversial policies such as family separation, the travel ban on Muslim-majority countries and a rule that would penalize legal immigrants for using public benefits. Courts have ended, amended or put the policies on hold but they are standout examples in a portfolio of changes to legal and humanitarian immigration frameworks happening at such a rapid pace it is difficult for most Americans to comprehend. What the American public does understand is Miller\u2019s laser focus on blocking immigration to the US. Before the emails were released, Miller was called a fascist at a Mexican restaurant in Washington DC. He also reportedly threw away $80 of takeout sushi, after a bartender followed him into the street. Miller\u2019s uncle, who has admitted he has not had many conversations with his nephew in the past 10 years, wrote an opinion piece charging that Miller was an \u201cimmigration hypocrite\u201d, because his ancestors included Jews who came to the US to escape pogroms in Russia. In an interview with the Washington Post published in August, Miller dismissed charges of racism. \u201cIt is a scurrilous and scandalous lie,\u201d he said, \u201cborn of a complete and total lack of understanding of the harms done by uncontrolled migration to people of all backgrounds, and born of a contempt for this nation, for our law enforcement officers and for the citizens who live here \u2013 and oftentimes, I might add, born of a personal grudge against this administration.\u201d He told the Post he had no plans or ambitions beyond his job, because of his focus on the president. \u201cYou cannot understand me, you cannot understand anything that I say, do or think if you do not understand that my sole motivation is to serve this president and this country, and there is no other,\u201d Miller said. Such religious attachment to Trump might have seemed unlikely for a Californian from a predominantly liberal, beachside community like Santa Monica. But Miller started early as a conservative provocateur. \u201cAm I the only one who is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us?\u201d he asked while running for class president in high school. Before graduating, he had appeared on a nationally syndicated conservative radio talkshow more than 70 times. In the Trump administration, as one of few surviving initial appointees, he has deployed a similarly inflammatory style. In response to questions about Trump\u2019s authority to implement the travel ban, Miller said the president \u201cwill not be questioned\u201d. His response to the four Democratic congresswoman known as the Squad? \u201cThey want to tear down the structure of our country.\u201d How to explain the zero-tolerance policy which allowed for mass family separations at the border? \u201cA simple decision.\u201d The email leak, however, showed a new depth to Miller\u2019s anti-immigration agenda.

But in all its 150 years, the house has never staged an opera written by a woman.

Orlando, which has been called the first English-language trans novel due to its playful exploration of gender fluidity, has been a favourite of Neuwirth\u2019s since she first read it at 15. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about gender bending, it questions all binary systems,\u201d she said. \u201cOrlando is a remarkable human being who questions every kind of duality and experiences a sense of \u2018in-betweenness\u2019 in both life and art.

Added to this are several electronic sonic layers, a jazz band that enters and exits the stage on a podium, and what Neuwirth described as \u201cnoisemakers\u201d using props such as coconuts to make sound effects similar to those in live showings of silent movies.

I\u2019m afraid the gross misbehaviour of one pathetic princeling, a man of hubristic insensitivity, will not topple the crown.</p> <p>The Windsors will survive this turmoil, much as they did that rocky period in the aftermath of Princess Diana\u2019s death. Despite some facile claims about the throne being shaken to its foundations by Prince Andrew\u2019s unwise choice of a friend and his clumsy TV interview, the Buckingham Palace soap opera still has a way to run. This royal line\u2019s singular achievement is survival.</p> <p>There is no political will to end the anachronism that is our constitutional monarchy. Nor is there a public clamour to bring it down. As for the mainstream media, a clear-eyed assessment of its relationship with the royal family suggests its owners and editors have no appetite to call for a republic. They are happy to rock the boat but not to overturn it. Better to keep them where they are. Praise them, condemn them. It\u2019s all good for sales.</p> <p>Before we turn to the Andrew business, consider the media\u2019s treatment of his nephew, Prince Harry, and his wife, Meghan. The unfolding saga of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is a classic case of media hypocrisy and royal hauteur.</p> <p>A fairytale start. Isn\u2019t she a beauty? Not only a commoner, but mixed race, too. The palace moving with the times. Endless newspaper pages of guff. TV scenes of a glittering wedding. Media job done: the couple lapped it up; the people lapped it up.</p> <p>It was over almost as soon as it began. Royal correspondents reported \u201crumours\u201d of a tiff, even a rift, between the new duchess and her sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. I have no idea whether there was, or is, any truth in it, and frankly, my dears, I don\u2019t give a damn, but the allegations changed the media narrative.</p> <p>A royal row is manna for the tabloids. After a brief interlude of fawning when the duchess gave birth, the press turned frosty once again. This was exacerbated by the coverage of her estranged father: the Mail on Sunday seemed to have him on a recall button, coaxing indiscretions at will. The tabs were cooking with gas.</p> <p>Harry decided to take matters into his own hands by issuing a hands-off statement. Avert your eyes, hacks. Play nice. In fact, don\u2019t play at all. We\u2019re not public property.</p> <p>As media tactics go, this was a big mistake. And it got worse. On a trip to South Africa, the couple starred in an ITV documentary so lacking in impartiality it looked like a promotional video. Poor me, said the duchess, standing amid genuine poverty. It hadn\u2019t taken long for a new recruit to acquire the royal family\u2019s sense of entitlement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfe395bbf434b471fb7ca3db668099d59e3092aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfe395bbf434b471fb7ca3db668099d59e3092aa/0_92_4530_2718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex attend the WellChild awards ceremony\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The unfolding saga of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is a classic case of media hypocrisy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then, as if on cue, Prince Andrew stepped on to the stage. He had been ducking and diving in the wings for months. Learning nothing from the experience of Harry and Meghan, he made his own attempt to win public favour with a television appearance to explain his extraordinary friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p> <p>After months of silence, interspersed with occasional releases of carefully crafted palace statements, the prince ignored professional advice by giving an interview to one of British TV\u2019s best and most forceful presenters, Emily Maitlis. She had researched and rehearsed. We do not know if he did the same, but his performance suggests otherwise.</p> <p>In casting himself as a victim of circumstances beyond his control, he relied on what passes for his wits to counter Maitlis\u2019s questions. By common consent (from the Times to the Telegraph, from the Sun to the Mirror) it was a car crash. He betrayed a lack of empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and gave wholly unconvincing answers to several questions.</p> <p>Among them was his failure to explain why he stayed for four days in Epstein\u2019s New York home in order to tell him he would not speak to him in future.</p> <p>His choice of vocabulary when addressing his friend\u2019s multiple abuses of young girls was utterly inappropriate. Unbecoming, he said. The exasperated, almost whispered, response from Maitlis spoke for the nation: \u201cUnbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u201d</p> <p>It unleashed unanimous condemnation by the press, and notably by the Queen\u2019s most obedient servants. Rarely has a Times leading article called anyone, let alone a prince, \u201cinept, tone-deaf \u2026 reckless \u2026 an embarrassment and a disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph summed it up perfectly: \u201cAs an exercise in making a bad situation worse, it has few equals.\u201d Elsewhere, \u201cthe Duke of Hazard\u201d became a figure of fun. \u201cNow he\u2019s really taking the pizza,\u201d said the Sun. For the Metro, he was \u201cthe prince of porkies\u201d and for the Mirror, the \u201cpariah prince\u201d. Social media was replete with gifs belittling the Queen\u2019s second son.</p> <p>Amid pages of criticism, all gratefully repeated and amplified in TV commentaries and in radio phone-ins, other unanswered questions were repeated. How did he afford a \u00a313m chalet in Switzerland? Why did he sell his house for \u00a33m more than its asking price to the oligarch son-in-law of Kazakhstan\u2019s controversial former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev? What part did he play in Epstein\u2019s decision to pay off the debts of his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, who he stubbornly refers to as \u201cthe duchess\u201d?</p> <p>Those newspaper nicknames of long ago \u2013 \u201cRandy Andy\u201d and \u201cAir Miles Andy\u201d \u2013 have been forgotten. They were light-hearted compared with the dark tagline now routinely appended to his name: \u201cthe prince and the paedophile\u201d. Several papers called for him to be stood down. A serious decision had to be made, although the Queen and her retinue of leaden-footed advisers took their time to punish him.</p> <p>If the palace thinks the media will allow this rogue prince to fade into the background, it should think again. He will be fair game from now on, pictured every time he appears anywhere in public. As for the rest of the family, they will go on struggling to avoid both proper and improper media scrutiny. But they should beware of what will happen in the post-Elizabethan era. Then, perhaps, we republicans will have reason, at last, to rejoice.</p>",

The unfolding saga of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex is a classic case of media hypocrisy and royal hauteur. A fairytale start. Isn\u2019t she a beauty? Not only a commoner, but mixed race, too. The palace moving with the times. Endless newspaper pages of guff. TV scenes of a glittering wedding. Media job done: the couple lapped it up; the people lapped it up. It was over almost as soon as it began. Royal correspondents reported \u201crumours\u201d of a tiff, even a rift, between the new duchess and her sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. I have no idea whether there was, or is, any truth in it, and frankly, my dears, I don\u2019t give a damn, but the allegations changed the media narrative. A royal row is manna for the tabloids. After a brief interlude of fawning when the duchess gave birth, the press turned frosty once again. This was exacerbated by the coverage of her estranged father: the Mail on Sunday seemed to have him on a recall button, coaxing indiscretions at will. The tabs were cooking with gas. Harry decided to take matters into his own hands by issuing a hands-off statement. Avert your eyes, hacks. Play nice. In fact, don\u2019t play at all. We\u2019re not public property. As media tactics go, this was a big mistake. And it got worse. On a trip to South Africa, the couple starred in an ITV documentary so lacking in impartiality it looked like a promotional video. Poor me, said the duchess, standing amid genuine poverty. It hadn\u2019t taken long for a new recruit to acquire the royal family\u2019s sense of entitlement. Then, as if on cue, Prince Andrew stepped on to the stage. He had been ducking and diving in the wings for months. Learning nothing from the experience of Harry and Meghan, he made his own attempt to win public favour with a television appearance to explain his extraordinary friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. After months of silence, interspersed with occasional releases of carefully crafted palace statements, the prince ignored professional advice by giving an interview to one of British TV\u2019s best and most forceful presenters, Emily Maitlis. She had researched and rehearsed. We do not know if he did the same, but his performance suggests otherwise. In casting himself as a victim of circumstances beyond his control, he relied on what passes for his wits to counter Maitlis\u2019s questions. By common consent (from the Times to the Telegraph, from the Sun to the Mirror) it was a car crash. He betrayed a lack of empathy for Epstein\u2019s victims and gave wholly unconvincing answers to several questions. Among them was his failure to explain why he stayed for four days in Epstein\u2019s New York home in order to tell him he would not speak to him in future. His choice of vocabulary when addressing his friend\u2019s multiple abuses of young girls was utterly inappropriate. Unbecoming, he said. The exasperated, almost whispered, response from Maitlis spoke for the nation: \u201cUnbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u201d It unleashed unanimous condemnation by the press, and notably by the Queen\u2019s most obedient servants. Rarely has a Times leading article called anyone, let alone a prince, \u201cinept, tone-deaf \u2026 reckless \u2026 an embarrassment and a disgrace\u201d. The Daily Telegraph summed it up perfectly: \u201cAs an exercise in making a bad situation worse, it has few equals.\u201d Elsewhere, \u201cthe Duke of Hazard\u201d became a figure of fun. \u201cNow he\u2019s really taking the pizza,\u201d said the Sun. For the Metro, he was \u201cthe prince of porkies\u201d and for the Mirror, the \u201cpariah prince\u201d. Social media was replete with gifs belittling the Queen\u2019s second son. Amid pages of criticism, all gratefully repeated and amplified in TV commentaries and in radio phone-ins, other unanswered questions were repeated. How did he afford a \u00a313m chalet in Switzerland? Why did he sell his house for \u00a33m more than its asking price to the oligarch son-in-law of Kazakhstan\u2019s controversial former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev? What part did he play in Epstein\u2019s decision to pay off the debts of his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, who he stubbornly refers to as \u201cthe duchess\u201d? Those newspaper nicknames of long ago \u2013 \u201cRandy Andy\u201d and \u201cAir Miles Andy\u201d \u2013 have been forgotten. They were light-hearted compared with the dark tagline now routinely appended to his name: \u201cthe prince and the paedophile\u201d. Several papers called for him to be stood down. A serious decision had to be made, although the Queen and her retinue of leaden-footed advisers took their time to punish him. If the palace thinks the media will allow this rogue prince to fade into the background, it should think again. He will be fair game from now on, pictured every time he appears anywhere in public. As for the rest of the family, they will go on struggling to avoid both proper and improper media scrutiny. But they should beware of what will happen in the post-Elizabethan era. Then, perhaps, we republicans will have reason, at last, to rejoice.",

She describes a time at university where she was trying to figure out where to study - the library or a cafe. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018Will I work better in one place? Would I like a cup of tea? Will there be enough seats?\u2019\u201d O\u2019Donaghue describes working herself up over this for 15 minutes until she had a stress-induced stomach ache. \u201cI ended up going to the library, and then to the cafe. So it didn\u2019t even really matter\u201d she laughs ruefully.</p> <p>So what\u2019s going on? McGinnis, who has been researching <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Missing-Out-Decision-Making-Overwhelming/dp/1492694940\" title=\"\">F</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Missing-Out-Decision-Making-Overwhelming/dp/1492694940\" title=\"\">omo and F</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Missing-Out-Decision-Making-Overwhelming/dp/1492694940\" title=\"\">obo over several years for his </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Missing-Out-Decision-Making-Overwhelming/dp/1492694940\" title=\"\">forthcoming book</a>, and for his <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/04/podcast-fomo-sapiens\" title=\"\">podcast Fomo Sapiens</a>, argues that Fobo is not necessarily a new human behaviour. \u201cThese feelings are biologically part of who we are. I call it the biology of wanting the best. Our ancestors a million years ago were programmed to wait for the best because it meant they were more likely to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>But the mass introduction of sophisticated technology and the internet has accelerated Fomo and Fobo into a common social behaviour. After all, we are now able to easily compare ourselves with each other (thus producing feelings of Fomo) and overwhelm ourselves with choice (producing Fobo).</p> <p>\u201cGo on Amazon to buy a pair of white shoelaces and you have in excess of 200 choices, whereas 50 years ago you would go to Woolworths and choose between three,\u201d says McGinnis. \u201cSo that\u2019s the context. The other factor \u2013 which is more emotional \u2013 is that Fobo is driven by narcissism, because when you have Fobo, you\u2019re putting your own interests well before anybody else\u2019s, which leaves all the people around you on hold.\u201d</p> <p>McGinnis himself experienced feelings of Fomo and Fobo when he coined the terms in a Harvard Business School paper 15 years ago.</p> <p>\u201cHarvard is a place unlike others in terms of the amount of opportunities you have \u2013 classes, social events, interviews \u2013 at your disposal,\u201d he says. \u201cI came from a simple background \u2013 a small town in New England \u2013 and when I arrived I found it extremely overwhelming. I wanted to do everything \u2013 which is Fomo \u2013 but at the same time, I wasn\u2019t willing to say no to anything and just choose one thing, which was Fobo. I would wait until the last minute to see if a better option came along. And I realised that that was a pervasive behaviour at Harvard because of it being a choice-rich environment.\u201d</p> <p>This is the main difference between Fomo and Fobo. Anyone with a smartphone looking over the often manipulated and unrealistic lives of others on social media might feel Fomo. But Fobo, according to McGinnis, is an issue for the privileged.</p> <p>\u201cFobo is an affliction of affluence,\u201d says McGinnis. \u201cTo have Fobo you must have options. So the richer you are, the more powerful you are, the more options you have. That\u2019s when you start to feel it.\u201d</p> <p>McGinnis doesn\u2019t believe that Fobo is restricted to the individual either \u2013 large corporations can be affected by it (\u201ca multinational with access to big data can always find a reason to justify not doing something\u201d), and so can countries.</p> <p>\u201cI have come to believe that the Brexit situation is Fobo. Fobo is the inability to choose between one of many acceptable outcomes. You may not like Brexit but there are plenty of acceptable ways it could be structured, without going to no deal. But any time Mrs May brought a proposal to the Commons, she couldn\u2019t get a vote because all of the MPs were waiting for a slightly better option.\u201d</p> <p>On the individual level, though, O\u2019Donaghue is not entirely convinced. \u201cI\u2019m a privileged person, compared with other people. But I don\u2019t think the things I\u2019m choosing between are very luxurious. I\u2019m talking about choosing dinner, or what\u2019s on the telly. Maybe my problem is one of overthinking.\u201d</p> <p>Decision-making is a complex mental procedure involving several of the brain\u2019s executive functions, that is, the key cognitive processes your brain uses to control your behaviour \u2013 from planning to managing impulses. People with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/13/adhd-illness-us-fund-treatments\" title=\"\">conditions such as ADHD</a> and autism, where executive functions can be impaired, may find themselves struggling to choose between options.</p> <p>But is Fobo just an easy-to-swallow euphemism for something more serious or taboo, such as an anxiety disorder?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/icky-lidbetter-my-anxiety-has-been-motivator-mental-health\" title=\"\">Nicky Lidbetter, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/icky-lidbetter-my-anxiety-has-been-motivator-mental-health\" title=\"\">chief executive of the charity Anxiety UK</a>, doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cIt is possible for anxiety to be experienced around many different issues, of which a fear of choosing the wrong option in regards to big life decisions may be one,\u201d she says. \u201cFear of a better option, however, is more likely to be linked to or a trigger for a pre-existing anxiety condition as opposed to being sufficient to warrant being categorised as an anxiety disorder in its own right.\u201d</p> <p>So for those without pre-existing conditions, what exactly is everyone afraid of? What is the \u201cfear\u201d in Fobo?</p> <p>McGinnis says it is a \u201cfear of letting go\u201d. \u201cIn order to choose something you must let go of another thing and it\u2019s the fear of having to mourn the road untaken. So we would rather not decide at all and keep all of our options open.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Maximisers set themselves high standards and are disappointed when they fail to reach them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is some psychological foundation to this. Some psychologists have found that when it comes to decision-making, people can be split into two groups: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/21/choice-stressing-us-out-dating-partners-monopolies\" title=\"\">maximisers\u201d or \u201csatisficers\u201d</a>. Maximisers are people who make a choice based on maximum benefit later on, while satisficers (a portmanteau of \u201csatisfied\u201d and \u201csufficed\u201d first coined by the Nobel laureate Herbert Simon in 1956) will make choices based on a modest criteria.</p> <p>Maximisers, for example, may pay more for a bigger car than they actually need in case they want a bigger one in future, whereas a satisficer is likely to pick the car that is good for now. Maximisers set themselves high standards and are disappointed when they fail to reach them, lingering on what was lost rather than what they have. Both have been the subject of many studies, but <a href=\"https://www.fsu.edu/news/2011/12/15/ehrlinger.indecision/\" title=\"\">one from 2011</a> conducted by a team led by Joyce Erlingher from Florida State University and published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences aimed to explore whether \u201cmaximisers show less commitment to their choices than satisficers in a way that leaves them less satisfied\u201d. That is, are maximisers more likely to be unhappy with their choice, once they finally land on it? Their conclusion: a resounding yes. \u201cMaximisers miss out on the psychological benefits of commitment,\u201d the authors say. \u201cCurrent research is trying to understand whether they can change. High-level maximisers certainly cause themselves a lot of grief.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps then, those with Fobo are simply maximisers facilitated by contemporary technology, or perhaps contemporary technology is turning more of us into maximisers. Or maybe people just don\u2019t really want to do half the things they say they do.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/24/icky-lidbetter-my-anxiety-has-been-motivator-mental-health\">Nicky Lidbetter: \u2018My anxiety has been a motivator\u2019 | Nicola Slawson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever the case, for McGinnis, correctly identifying this phenomena and giving it a name is crucial in changing these behaviours, which he sees as being \u201cdestructive\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my view that Fomo isn\u2019t all bad because Fomo can be that little whisper in your ear that we should try something different. If you see your friend starting a business on the side, or you see your friends going on a vacation to Malta and you feel Fomo, that\u2019s a cue to try something else and open up your perspective. So a little Fomo is fine. But Fobo is not good.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Donaghue however, is not so concerned about tackling her Fobo. \u201cI think its an inherent part of my personality,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople get used to you being like that if you\u2019re good friends.\u201d</p> <p>Neither is Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s part of who I am, I have always been this way\u201d he says. \u201cLast year, it took four attempts and three hours for me to buy a turkey, looking across M&amp;S, Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s. In fact, it got so late, they couldn\u2019t even deliver it by the time I chose one.\u201d But he is confident he will get this year\u2019s turkey soon. He has already decided which one.</p>",

But any time Mrs May brought a proposal to the Commons, she couldn\u2019t get a vote because all of the MPs were waiting for a slightly better option.\u201d On the individual level, though, O\u2019Donaghue is not entirely convinced. \u201cI\u2019m a privileged person, compared with other people. But I don\u2019t think the things I\u2019m choosing between are very luxurious. I\u2019m talking about choosing dinner, or what\u2019s on the telly. Maybe my problem is one of overthinking.\u201d Decision-making is a complex mental procedure involving several of the brain\u2019s executive functions, that is, the key cognitive processes your brain uses to control your behaviour \u2013 from planning to managing impulses. People with conditions such as ADHD and autism, where executive functions can be impaired, may find themselves struggling to choose between options. But is Fobo just an easy-to-swallow euphemism for something more serious or taboo, such as an anxiety disorder? Nicky Lidbetter, chief executive of the charity Anxiety UK, doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cIt is possible for anxiety to be experienced around many different issues, of which a fear of choosing the wrong option in regards to big life decisions may be one,\u201d she says. \u201cFear of a better option, however, is more likely to be linked to or a trigger for a pre-existing anxiety condition as opposed to being sufficient to warrant being categorised as an anxiety disorder in its own right.\u201d So for those without pre-existing conditions, what exactly is everyone afraid of? What is the \u201cfear\u201d in Fobo? McGinnis says it is a \u201cfear of letting go\u201d. \u201cIn order to choose something you must let go of another thing and it\u2019s the fear of having to mourn the road untaken. So we would rather not decide at all and keep all of our options open.\u201d There is some psychological foundation to this. Some psychologists have found that when it comes to decision-making, people can be split into two groups: \u201cmaximisers\u201d or \u201csatisficers\u201d. Maximisers are people who make a choice based on maximum benefit later on, while satisficers (a portmanteau of \u201csatisfied\u201d and \u201csufficed\u201d first coined by the Nobel laureate Herbert Simon in 1956) will make choices based on a modest criteria. Maximisers, for example, may pay more for a bigger car than they actually need in case they want a bigger one in future, whereas a satisficer is likely to pick the car that is good for now. Maximisers set themselves high standards and are disappointed when they fail to reach them, lingering on what was lost rather than what they have. Both have been the subject of many studies, but one from 2011 conducted by a team led by Joyce Erlingher from Florida State University and published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences aimed to explore whether \u201cmaximisers show less commitment to their choices than satisficers in a way that leaves them less satisfied\u201d. That is, are maximisers more likely to be unhappy with their choice, once they finally land on it? Their conclusion: a resounding yes. \u201cMaximisers miss out on the psychological benefits of commitment,\u201d the authors say. \u201cCurrent research is trying to understand whether they can change. High-level maximisers certainly cause themselves a lot of grief.\u201d Perhaps then, those with Fobo are simply maximisers facilitated by contemporary technology, or perhaps contemporary technology is turning more of us into maximisers. Or maybe people just don\u2019t really want to do half the things they say they do. Whatever the case, for McGinnis, correctly identifying this phenomena and giving it a name is crucial in changing these behaviours, which he sees as being \u201cdestructive\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s my view that Fomo isn\u2019t all bad because Fomo can be that little whisper in your ear that we should try something different. If you see your friend starting a business on the side, or you see your friends going on a vacation to Malta and you feel Fomo, that\u2019s a cue to try something else and open up your perspective. So a little Fomo is fine. But Fobo is not good.\u201d O\u2019Donaghue however, is not so concerned about tackling her Fobo. \u201cI think its an inherent part of my personality,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople get used to you being like that if you\u2019re good friends.\u201d Neither is Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s part of who I am, I have always been this way\u201d he says. \u201cLast year, it took four attempts and three hours for me to buy a turkey, looking across M&amp;S, Waitrose, Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s. In fact, it got so late, they couldn\u2019t even deliver it by the time I chose one.\u201d But he is confident he will get this year\u2019s turkey soon. He has already decided which one.",

      "body": "<p>The Davis Cup, a competition that had its genesis as a colonial indulgence at an American cricket club in Boston 119 years ago, will never be the same after its Spanish inquisition. But it might be better if lessons are learned from the refit in Madrid that wound up in the Caja M\u00e1gica on Sunday night.</p> <p>Tennis is in a rare state of flux. Gerard Piqu\u00e9, the Barcelona footballer who inspired and organised the World Cup of Tennis, as it is now sold, is sensible enough to acknowledge the International Tennis Federation may have to merge with its premier competition, the fledgling Association of Tennis Professionals Cup, which starts in Australia in January.</p> <p>The two cannot co-exist indefinitely and both governing bodies, who have had a fractious relationship in recent years, will have to consider a compromise to save the Davis Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/23/rafael-nadal-spain-great-britain-davis-cup-semifinal\">Rafael Nadal powers Spain past Great Britain into Davis Cup final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are no guarantees but once the dust settles they will have to talk about the future of an unwieldy event that was stumbling along as an anachronism until desperation forced this experiment of bringing 18 countries together for one week. It was no more than a qualified success and will return to Madrid next year, at least, with the losing semi-finalists Great Britain assured a place.</p> <p>There was even speculation after the dramatic 2-1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/23/rafael-nadal-spain-great-britain-davis-cup-semifinal\" title=\"\">defeat by Spain in the semi-finals</a> on Saturday that Great Britain may be a future host, although there is no space that could accommodate the revised format, which almost buckled as teams crammed their three daily matches into a physically draining schedule across three courts.</p> <p>The finals tournament needs fewer teams and more courts to avoid the many post-midnight, mid-winter finishes, or it will risk surrendering primacy to the ATP Cup, an 18-team competition with a more relaxed format, in three cities over 10 days in the warmth of an Australian summer.</p> <p>Leon Smith looked quizzical when asked about the chances of the Davis Cup being held in Great Britain when it leaves Madrid in 2021. \u201cThat\u2019s a big question for me to answer in my low position in the ranks,\u201d he said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends. The calendar date is obviously going to be looked at, September being the one that\u2019s touted. Whether that\u2019s possible or not, I don\u2019t know. But we\u2019d be better to have it at that time of year. You need a lot of space. One of the things that would help with the scheduling is having more match courts. If it was an outdoor event, that would help. Indian Wells has been spoken about, having something like that where we can get through the matches a different way.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of in Britain, clearly you\u2019re looking at indoor. I\u2019m not sure how many potential venues we\u2019d have for something like that. I don\u2019t know what the answer is. Would it be great to have an event like that?

      "bodyText": "The Davis Cup, a competition that had its genesis as a colonial indulgence at an American cricket club in Boston 119 years ago, will never be the same after its Spanish inquisition. But it might be better if lessons are learned from the refit in Madrid that wound up in the Caja M\u00e1gica on Sunday night. Tennis is in a rare state of flux. Gerard Piqu\u00e9, the Barcelona footballer who inspired and organised the World Cup of Tennis, as it is now sold, is sensible enough to acknowledge the International Tennis Federation may have to merge with its premier competition, the fledgling Association of Tennis Professionals Cup, which starts in Australia in January. The two cannot co-exist indefinitely and both governing bodies, who have had a fractious relationship in recent years, will have to consider a compromise to save the Davis Cup. There are no guarantees but once the dust settles they will have to talk about the future of an unwieldy event that was stumbling along as an anachronism until desperation forced this experiment of bringing 18 countries together for one week. It was no more than a qualified success and will return to Madrid next year, at least, with the losing semi-finalists Great Britain assured a place. There was even speculation after the dramatic 2-1 defeat by Spain in the semi-finals on Saturday that Great Britain may be a future host, although there is no space that could accommodate the revised format, which almost buckled as teams crammed their three daily matches into a physically draining schedule across three courts. The finals tournament needs fewer teams and more courts to avoid the many post-midnight, mid-winter finishes, or it will risk surrendering primacy to the ATP Cup, an 18-team competition with a more relaxed format, in three cities over 10 days in the warmth of an Australian summer. Leon Smith looked quizzical when asked about the chances of the Davis Cup being held in Great Britain when it leaves Madrid in 2021. \u201cThat\u2019s a big question for me to answer in my low position in the ranks,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends. The calendar date is obviously going to be looked at, September being the one that\u2019s touted. Whether that\u2019s possible or not, I don\u2019t know. But we\u2019d be better to have it at that time of year. You need a lot of space. One of the things that would help with the scheduling is having more match courts. If it was an outdoor event, that would help. Indian Wells has been spoken about, having something like that where we can get through the matches a different way. \u201cIn terms of in Britain, clearly you\u2019re looking at indoor. I\u2019m not sure how many potential venues we\u2019d have for something like that. I don\u2019t know what the answer is. Would it be great to have an event like that? Of course. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking at ways to showcase our sport. Hosting the world\u2019s best team event in tennis would be one of them. Hopefully we could look at it.\u201d What Smith can look at on the court is an encouraging future after a string of uplifting performances by Kyle Edmund, the doubles team of Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski, Dan Evans, who came good against Germany to get GB into the semi-finals, and, in a cameo on day one before a minor thigh strain and stamina deficit kicked in, Andy Murray. \u201cWe should be excited by what we have in British tennis,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a raft of great doubles players, these two [Jamie Murray and Skupski] and what Joe Salisbury\u2019s doing.

After 10 long seconds, producers cut away.</p> <p>Tazeen was mortified, but the incident proved a turning point.

      "body": "<p>Singer-songwriter and producer Davido has said that <em>A Good Time</em> was so called partly in acknowledgement of the current global appreciation for Nigerian pop music. The sound of Afrobeats is joyously ubiquitous, and Davido, who grew up between Nigeria and the US, is one of its key players. This is a celebration, then: the release also follows the birth of his son, and the cover art features Davido, his father and a sculpture of his late mother.</p> <p>His 2012 debut was criticised for a lack of variety, but here he pushes past that complaint with a broader array of sonic palettes beneath his gliding vocals. He enlists international features from the likes of current R&amp;B favourite Summer Walker, who adds her caramel vocals to the lithe D&amp;G, and trap star Gunna offering choppy, melodic bars on the intense energy of Big Picture, alongside some standout moments from his Nigerian cohort including WurlD, Zlatan and Naira Marley.</p> <p>At 17 tracks long, <em>A Good Time</em> can drift into sunshine-infused listlessness, but it\u2019s rescued by Davido\u2019s undeniable charisma and intricate understanding of warm, uplifting pop instrumentation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9H3iinXZv0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B9H3iinXZv0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9H3iinXZv0\">Davido: Risky, ft Popcaan video</a>.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Singer-songwriter and producer Davido has said that A Good Time was so called partly in acknowledgement of the current global appreciation for Nigerian pop music. The sound of Afrobeats is joyously ubiquitous, and Davido, who grew up between Nigeria and the US, is one of its key players. This is a celebration, then: the release also follows the birth of his son, and the cover art features Davido, his father and a sculpture of his late mother. His 2012 debut was criticised for a lack of variety, but here he pushes past that complaint with a broader array of sonic palettes beneath his gliding vocals. He enlists international features from the likes of current R&amp;B favourite Summer Walker, who adds her caramel vocals to the lithe D&amp;G, and trap star Gunna offering choppy, melodic bars on the intense energy of Big Picture, alongside some standout moments from his Nigerian cohort including WurlD, Zlatan and Naira Marley. At 17 tracks long, A Good Time can drift into sunshine-infused listlessness, but it\u2019s rescued by Davido\u2019s undeniable charisma and intricate understanding of warm, uplifting pop instrumentation.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d That\u2019s the refrain at my grandparents\u2019 if anyone visits and tries to leave without having a drink or a bite. My grandmother, Mumji, is especially notorious for force-feeding guests. Some of us don\u2019t tell her in advance that we\u2019re coming, so she won\u2019t have time to prepare \u2013 because she makes way too much food, pressures you to over-eat, never sits with you since she\u2019s too busy hurrying between hob and table, piling plates with fresh chapattis.</p> <p>She keeps a mental log of what you consume and is at her nicest when you\u2019ve had too much. Mumji puts care into cooking, but is slapdash about serving: she isn\u2019t bothered by sauce drips on the side of a serving bowl, the way the table is laid or how the conversation flows. If there\u2019s any talk, she prefers it to be about her culinary skills, but the best compliment is simply to eat \u2013 a lot \u2013 and quickly, while it\u2019s hot. A few family members have become so habituated to being served steaming fare they pop their plates into the microwave mid-meal. My grandfather used to send back food or coffee in restaurants asking for it to be re-heated, dismissing concerns that this would affect the flavour. Mumji\u2019s food is so intensely spiced, nothing can alter its flavour, which is created to leave the distinct after-taste of power. Her hospitality dictates that even as you indulge guests, you demand certain treatment in return: she cooks in order to be praised, adored, respected \u2013 even feared.</p> <p>I have enjoyed and suffered under Mumji\u2019s regime and, involuntarily, adopted some of her hosting habits. Try as I might to be reasonable and sustainable, part of me remains prone to being profuse. I wonder if it is even possible to be a modestly generous host, for isn\u2019t it in the very nature of hospitality to offer more than is necessary, more than could ever be taken?</p> <p>The French philosopher Alain Badiou wrote: \u201cLove begins when something impossible is overcome.\u201d The same could be said of hospitality: the act of accepting from another, of receiving the other, only begins, only touches the rim of true hospitability, when it pushes you beyond your limits, discomfits you, allows in the unexpected, brings about what you never imagined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My grandmother cooks in order to be praised, adored, respected \u2013 even feared</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The word for hospitality in German is <em>gastfreundschaft</em>, which literally means guest-friendship. Besides connoting food, sharing and community, the word is understood as a philosophical and political term. Living in Berlin and learning German helped me see what an extraordinarily all-encompassing notion hospitality is. In English, the word has been co-opted by the \u201chospitality industry\u201d so the first association is often to do with being a paying guest in a restaurant or hotel. Yet, historically, the word has rich associations: its ancient Indo-European root, <em>ghos-ti</em>, meant host, guest and stranger, the trio of roles through which we \u2013 consciously or unconsciously \u2013 shift our lives. It seems so apt that this inescapable flux was once contained in a single word.</p> <p>Ghos-ti also birthed \u201chostility\u201d, sibling-word to hospitality. Learning of this linguistic lineage helped me make sense of the tension I\u2019ve experienced at Mumji\u2019s table, the way her well-meant excesses could suddenly tip into a form of assault. Hospitality, for all the sense of accommodation it implies, can also be an imposition \u2013 on both sides. This is the case at the table and in society at large. What becomes decisive is how we handle the burden of obligation, deal with the frustration; what counts is how we surmount the feeling of not being able to take any more, how we try to overcome the impossible.</p> <p>With Mumji I tried different strategies. Inviting her to be your guest is also testing: she eats before coming over, makes disparaging remarks about what\u2019s served and is impatient to leave. Yet, there are rewards: her enduring curiosity about new flavours, her delight on the rare occasions she likes something you\u2019ve cooked, her gratitude for the small amount of time you spend with her.</p> <p>My relationship with Mumji has been one of the training grounds for tolerance. In some arenas, practice does not make perfect, it just makes clear how much more practice is needed. We are forced to exercise forbearance in the family and, because of the deep bonds, we are generally more accepting of the challenge. Again and again, even in the most difficult circumstances \u2013 and sometimes to our own detriment \u2013 we persuade ourselves to reach out again, to try once more, to keep loving. The ability to make this effort may be the foundation of humanity. I\u2019m intrigued by how far the hospitable impulse might stretch: who are we ready to include in the circle of belonging, what efforts are we prepared to make for each other as inhabitants of a shared world, how might actively embracing more distant others alter our sense of ourselves?</p> <p>On 17 December last year, I was in a small ground floor room in the District Office for Mitte, Berlin.

I signed a few final documents and then stood to pledge: \u201cI solemnly declare that I will respect the Constitution and the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.\u201d It was the most unassuming ceremony and yet the grandest, most moving occasion, because in that moment a world unfurled, full of promise, saying yes, saying welcome.

      "body": "<h2>Mutual Admiration Society</h2> <p>Mo Moulton<br><em>Corsair, \u00a320, pp384</em></p> <p>One November evening in 1912, a group of new friends gathered over cocoa and toasted marshmallows at Somerville College, Oxford, to read aloud their literary efforts. One of the young women would go on to become a birth control advocate, another a popular historian. There was also Dorothy L Sayers, who was \u201cserious and a little weird\u201d. She suggested the Mutual Admiration Society as a name. Others would call them that anyway, so why not claim it for themselves? It\u2019s an anecdote that crisply captures their spirit of defiant togetherness \u2013 one that would become vital to them in a world of grudging advancements in women\u2019s rights. Slender though the society is as a topic, academic Mo Moulton has spun from its scattered archives a largely enjoyable anthem to friendship.</p> <h2>The Cheffe</h2> <p>Marie NDiaye (trans Jordan Stump)<br><em>MacLehose Press, \u00a312.99, pp288</em></p> <p>Let\u2019s get the title out of the way first. \u201cCheffe\u201d, we\u2019re told in a footnote, is a relatively new word in French meaning, naturally, female chef. It\u2019s also the only name by which the legendary restaurateur heroine of this whimsical novel goes. The narrator is as unreliable as they come, a younger male employee who fell in love with the Cheffe and whose reward was to be made her confidant. Now that she\u2019s dead, he\u2019s ready to tell her story, in part to thwart his nemesis, her ungrateful daughter. Throughout this rags-to-riches yarn, the Cheffe remains as mysterious as a secret ingredient, and it all ends up feeling a little like one of those foamy amuse-bouches: rich yet ultimately unsatisfying.</p> <h2>Impossible Owls: Essays from the Ends of the World</h2> <p>Brian Phillips<br><em>Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a39.99, pp352 (paperback)</em></p> <p>There\u2019s no doubting this new author\u2019s commitment to immersive journalism. Determined tTo follow the Iditarod, an epic Alaskan dog sled race whose conditions also make it the world\u2019s least spectator-friendly sporting event, Phillips must first learn to fly a perilous two-seater bush plane on skis, just in case his pilot conks out mid-air. Somehow, they both make it to the finish line in one piece but, as in the rest of these appealing long-form essays, which take in sumo wrestling, Area 51 and our own royal family, the real drama here is psychic. As he muses, there\u2019s an \u201cunmanageable sadness\u201d to life in Alaska. He tends to ham up his own jadedness, and his wisecracking style can feel a bit tired, but suchsoulful digressions make it all worthwhile.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>To order <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/mutual-admiration-society-9781472154439.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Mutual Admiration Society: How Dorothy L Sayers and Her Oxford Circle Remade the World for Women</a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-cheffe-9780857058904.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">The Cheffe</a> </em>or<em> <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/impossible-owls-9781474607841.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Impossible Owls: Essays from the Ends of the World</a></em> go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a> or call 020-3176 3837.

      "bodyText": "Mutual Admiration Society Mo Moulton Corsair, \u00a320, pp384 One November evening in 1912, a group of new friends gathered over cocoa and toasted marshmallows at Somerville College, Oxford, to read aloud their literary efforts. One of the young women would go on to become a birth control advocate, another a popular historian. There was also Dorothy L Sayers, who was \u201cserious and a little weird\u201d. She suggested the Mutual Admiration Society as a name. Others would call them that anyway, so why not claim it for themselves? It\u2019s an anecdote that crisply captures their spirit of defiant togetherness \u2013 one that would become vital to them in a world of grudging advancements in women\u2019s rights. Slender though the society is as a topic, academic Mo Moulton has spun from its scattered archives a largely enjoyable anthem to friendship. The Cheffe Marie NDiaye (trans Jordan Stump) MacLehose Press, \u00a312.99, pp288 Let\u2019s get the title out of the way first. \u201cCheffe\u201d, we\u2019re told in a footnote, is a relatively new word in French meaning, naturally, female chef. It\u2019s also the only name by which the legendary restaurateur heroine of this whimsical novel goes. The narrator is as unreliable as they come, a younger male employee who fell in love with the Cheffe and whose reward was to be made her confidant. Now that she\u2019s dead, he\u2019s ready to tell her story, in part to thwart his nemesis, her ungrateful daughter. Throughout this rags-to-riches yarn, the Cheffe remains as mysterious as a secret ingredient, and it all ends up feeling a little like one of those foamy amuse-bouches: rich yet ultimately unsatisfying. Impossible Owls: Essays from the Ends of the World Brian Phillips Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a39.99, pp352 (paperback) There\u2019s no doubting this new author\u2019s commitment to immersive journalism. Determined tTo follow the Iditarod, an epic Alaskan dog sled race whose conditions also make it the world\u2019s least spectator-friendly sporting event, Phillips must first learn to fly a perilous two-seater bush plane on skis, just in case his pilot conks out mid-air. Somehow, they both make it to the finish line in one piece but, as in the rest of these appealing long-form essays, which take in sumo wrestling, Area 51 and our own royal family, the real drama here is psychic. As he muses, there\u2019s an \u201cunmanageable sadness\u201d to life in Alaska. He tends to ham up his own jadedness, and his wisecracking style can feel a bit tired, but suchsoulful digressions make it all worthwhile. \u2022 To order Mutual Admiration Society: How Dorothy L Sayers and Her Oxford Circle Remade the World for Women, The Cheffe or Impossible Owls: Essays from the Ends of the World go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

      "body": "<p>Labour\u2019s plans for Britain involve a big increase in the size of the state. Government spending as a share of national output would rise to 45%. And apart from brief spikes in the mid-1970s and during the more recent financial crash, it has not reached those levels since the second world war.</p> <p>To which the mature response should be: so what? A glance around the world shows that there are rich developed countries where the state is relatively small and there are rich developed countries where the state is large. In democracies, voters get the right to choose between the competing models.</p> <p>Take Sweden and the US as examples of the contrasting approaches. The Scandinavian country, population just over 10 million, has a state that spends 50% of gross domestic product. The United States, population 329 million, operates with a much smaller state that accounts for 38% of national output.</p> <p>The received wisdom, particularly among free-market economists, is that a small state means economic dynamism while a big state means the opposite: a sclerosis caused by governments burdening their populations with levels of taxation that stifle enterprise.</p> <p>So how do the US and Sweden stack up against each other?</p> <p>In terms of growth rates, there\u2019s not been a lot to choose between the two in recent years, with both averaging around 2.5% a year in the half-decade up to 2018. If anything, Sweden\u2019s growth rate was a tad higher.</p> <p>The US has a slight edge when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/gdp/gdp-per-capita/\">living standards</a>. The average American had an income of $59,928 (\u00a346,700) in 2017 while Sweden\u2019s per capita income was $51,405.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s plans for Britain involve a big increase in the size of the state. Government spending as a share of national output would rise to 45%. And apart from brief spikes in the mid-1970s and during the more recent financial crash, it has not reached those levels since the second world war. To which the mature response should be: so what? A glance around the world shows that there are rich developed countries where the state is relatively small and there are rich developed countries where the state is large. In democracies, voters get the right to choose between the competing models. Take Sweden and the US as examples of the contrasting approaches. The Scandinavian country, population just over 10 million, has a state that spends 50% of gross domestic product. The United States, population 329 million, operates with a much smaller state that accounts for 38% of national output. The received wisdom, particularly among free-market economists, is that a small state means economic dynamism while a big state means the opposite: a sclerosis caused by governments burdening their populations with levels of taxation that stifle enterprise. So how do the US and Sweden stack up against each other? In terms of growth rates, there\u2019s not been a lot to choose between the two in recent years, with both averaging around 2.5% a year in the half-decade up to 2018. If anything, Sweden\u2019s growth rate was a tad higher. The US has a slight edge when it comes to living standards. The average American had an income of $59,928 (\u00a346,700) in 2017 while Sweden\u2019s per capita income was $51,405. But the Swedes, as tends to be the way in Europe, are prepared to sacrifice income for leisure time. They work 1,621 hours a year on average compared to 1,781 hours for the average American. What\u2019s more, the focus on GDP per capita is a bit misleading since it says nothing about the way in which national income is divided up. In some countries, there is a wide gulf in incomes between those at the top and those at the bottom; in others there is a more even split. The US falls into the former category, Sweden into the latter. One way of assessing income inequality is through the Gini coefficient.

Obviously, every country is bunched around the middle of this range, but Sweden is closer to the bottom than the US. It has a Gini coefficient of 0.27 while the US\u2019s is 0.41. Big-state Sweden has a higher unemployment rate than the US \u2013 6.3% against 3.9% \u2013 in 2018, but its employment rate is also higher.

The big economic numbers \u2013 income per head, unemployment, inflation and the current account \u2013 do not provide a complete picture of how successful a country is. Sweden has a much lower murder rate than the US \u2013 1.1 per 100,000 inhabitants against 5.3 \u2013 and has a much lower incarceration rate \u2013 59 per 100,000 people as opposed to 655 per 100,000 in the US. Swedes live more than four years longer than Americans on average. When it comes to Nobel prize winners, the countries have similar records once their differing populations are taken into account \u2013 383 for the US and 32 for Sweden. Here, though, the US has the edge. Only three of Sweden\u2019s laureates have come since the turn of the millennium while 130 Americans have been awarded during the same period.

      "bodyText": "We open on the White House lawn. President Trump (Alec Baldwin) fields questions with the help of his \u201csuper important notes\u201d written in big \u201cblack licorice\u201d. He denies allegations revealed in the Ukraine investigation and tries to spin some of the damning testimony given to Congress by Ambassador Gordon Sondland, only for Sondland (Will Ferrell) to show up and incriminate him further. After Ferrell and Baldwin trip over each other\u2019s lines, we\u2019re abruptly hit with \u201cLive From New York!\u201d I didn\u2019t think it possible for the cold opens to get any lazier, but here we are. At this point they\u2019re almost impressive in their badness but hey, at least this one was short. This is Ferrell\u2019s fifth turn as host. He begins by recounting his years as a cast member but becomes distracted when he spots actor Ryan Reynolds sitting in the front row. Suddenly, the host is reduced to a giddy fan. He begins giggling, gawking and rambling, suddenly taking up a Tracy Morgan impersonation \u2013 he explains, \u201cWhenever I get nervous I go into Tracy Morgan. In fact, I delivered my wedding vows in this voice!\u201d \u2013 much to Reynolds\u2019 embarrassment. Then the actual Tracy Morgan shows up, spouting nonsense about prophecies, Star Wars and the River Styx. It\u2019s a mess but an enjoyable one. Morgan is always welcome and Reynolds is a surprisingly good straight man. Heinz Relax is a new container designed to keep the ketchup bottle from making fart noises when you squeeze it. The only problem is that the new noise, supposed to be a relaxed sigh, sounds more like a female orgasm. Like the cold open, the sketch is over almost as soon as it begins. Next up is MSNBC\u2019s coverage of the latest Democratic debate, which is overrun by nominees. There\u2019s \u201coverambitious\u201d Elizabeth Warren (Kate McKinnon); America\u2019s \u201cfun aunt\u201d (or \u201cfunt\u201d), Kamala Harris (Maya Rudolph); \u201cadorable\u201d Mayor Pete (Colin Jost); on-the-mend socialist Bernie Sanders (Larry David); shaky moderate Amy Klobuchar (Rachel Dratch); toothy and out of touch Joe Biden (Woody Harrelson); coy billionaire Michael Bloomberg (Fred Armisen); and \u201cunderdog candidate and tonight\u2019s villain\u201d Tulsi Gabbard (Cecily Strong). Cory Booker and Andrew Yang are also present, but as in real life they don\u2019t have much to say or do.

      "body": "<p>Every once in a while, something chances along that illuminates our baffling world with sudden clarity. One such something is <em><a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/ep/podcasts\" title=\"\">The Sun King</a>, </em>a six-part podcast by David Dimbleby about the long career of Rupert Murdoch. I listened to it all through once and then again and I recommend that you do, too. In telling the story of the rise of the most powerful media tycoon the world has known, it serves among other things to explain the fertile germ of populism in Britain and the US, a byproduct of the corrosive tone of Murdoch\u2019s tabloids, and outlines the threat to democracy presented by a US president who was a creation of Fox News.</p> <p>The series gains its authority in the voice of Dimbleby, never less than wry and reasonable, whose career has covered a similar span to Murdoch\u2019s. The pair first met in 1968 when Dimbleby interviewed the Australian \u2013 and his second wife Anna (\u201cI don\u2019t like him being called a tycoon\u201d) \u2013 after Murdoch arrived in Britain having bought the <em>News of the World</em>. The two men had a few things in common, Dimbleby felt: both had lost their famous fathers in their 20s and both had inherited a newspaper business to run; Murdoch in Melbourne and Adelaide, and Dimbleby, on a smaller scale, in the local papers of south-west London. In the decades since, those journalistic legacies have been exploited in markedly different ways, like some parable of the media talents. Dimbleby has followed in his father\u2019s footsteps to become the most trusted and avuncular of the BBC\u2019s voices over 50 years; Murdoch continues to reshape partisan journalism to suit his own cynical billionaire ends.</p> <p>Now that both men are in, or approaching, their final acts, it feels like a good moment to tally those stellar careers against each other. We think we know all about the tensions and tenor of Murdoch\u2019s swansong from the compulsive drama of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2019/oct/15/bolshy-biting-brilliant-is-succession-the-new-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em>. It has been less clear, since Dimbleby gave up his chair at <em>Question Time</em> and at the helm of elections and state occasions at the end of last year, how gentle, at 81, he would go into semi-retirement. The argument made by <em>The Sun King</em> is, happily, not at all.</p> <p>Dimbleby is one of those figures in British public life who has loosened up as he has aged. He could seem a priggish presence in his earlier broadcasting career \u2013 I can just about remember him as part of the BBC furniture in the 1970s with a version of his father\u2019s received pronunciation and an earnest ambition to prove himself on his own terms, but he has grown more puckish as he \u2013 and we \u2013 have aged; more himself. He plans to use this new chapter of his broadcasting life to go back to basics, out from behind a studio desk to on-the-road reporting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9545ae28a5747ed8c42ee95056f587314d052f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9545ae28a5747ed8c42ee95056f587314d052f6/115_6_2339_1403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You there in the shirt\u2019: Dimbleby presenting Question Time in 2009.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You there in the shirt\u2019: Dimbleby presenting Question Time in 2009.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His first foray into this braver new world, beside the Murdoch series, was a documentary about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bggw\" title=\"\">Brexit for </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bggw\" title=\"\">Panorama</a></em>, which was broadcast a fortnight ago. As the man who uttered those fateful words at 4.40am on the morning of 24 June 2016: \u201cThe British people have spoken and their answer is: we\u2019re out!\u201d, Dimbleby\u2019s film saw him attempt to get behind the \u201cjust get it done\u201d soundbites and listen to Brexit-divided families around their dining tables or in front of their gas fires. In something like a comparable spirit, I went to see Dimbleby in his London townhouse last week, in a quiet side road in Pimlico \u2013 he also has a farm in East Sussex (the one time he missed <em>Question Time</em> in 25 years he had been knocked unconscious by a bull). His house, around the corner from a street food market, is set between hair salons and delis and, like its occupant, bounding to the door in his corduroy suit, it seems perfectly comfortable in its own skin.</p> <p>We talked first, while he made coffee, about the progress of the election campaign \u2013 there are well-thumbed newspapers scattered across his kitchen table along with stacks of novels and laptops and chargers and cables \u2013 the first that he has not been anchoring since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979. He insists he is not going to miss it, will just be watching like the rest of us. \u201cI\u2019ve done 10 elections,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the thing is, all elections, if you are in the studio, are pretty much the same. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a landslide or a hung parliament, it\u2019s all about getting the facts straight on the night.\u201d</p> <p>I begin to suggest that politics now seems more unsettled and unsettling than at any time during those years, but he insists it was probably ever thus. To prove the point, he gallops \u2013 with his freakish Attenborough-esque energy \u2013 up the stairs that rise out of the kitchen to the first-floor sitting room to grab a copy of Anthony Trollope\u2019s novel <em>Phineas Redux</em>.</p> <p>He comes down the stairs quoting triumphantly a passage that might have been written last week. \u201c\u2018The country had now reached that period of its life in which rapid decay was inevitable, and\u2026 national decrepitude was imminent, and natural death could not long be postponed\u2026\u2019 You see?\u201d he says, delighted, \u201cthis was 1870 or whatever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"358f6244baff17f7117069a9fceb488b9c85cce4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/358f6244baff17f7117069a9fceb488b9c85cce4/291_871_3398_4245/800.jpg\" alt=\"Just a bit of fun: with Robin Day and Peter Snow on election night in 1987.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Just a bit of fun: with Robin Day and Peter Snow on election night in 1987.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radio Times/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He goes on: \u201c\u2018Had [Daubeny, the Tory prime minister] been allowed to operate he would have cut the taproots of the national cancer, have introduced fresh blood into the national veins, and resuscitated the national digestion, and he seemed to think that the nation, as a nation, was willing enough to undergo the operation and be treated as he should choose to treat it \u2013 but that the incubus of Mr Gresham, backed by an unworthy House of Commons, had prevented, and was preventing, the nation from having its own way\u2026 \u2019</p> <p>\u201cI sent that passage to Nick Robinson,\u201d Dimbleby says. \u201cIsn\u2019t it perfect?\u201d</p> <p>He pours us coffee from a cafetiere, which, in the absence of its plunger, he filters ineffectively through a tea strainer.</p> <p>I wonder how the Murdoch thing came about.</p> <p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Dimbleby asks, with his ever-urgent curiosity. \u201cA producer, Joe Sykes, came to me with the idea just after I had finished <em>Question Time</em> and I absolutely leapt at it. I am really interested in changing the way I broadcast.\u201d He loves the intimacy of the podcast format, the way his words might creep into peoples\u2019 heads and occupy them while they are on trains or riding bikes. \u201cIt is quite different even from radio documentaries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is like me talking to you across this table.\u201d</p> <p>He knew his time at <em>Question Time</em> was up when he started to meet people in their 40s who told him they had watched him on it every Thursday night since their teens. \u201cIt was great to do but as a broadcaster it was quite constraining. First, because it was Westminster-politics based. So you have to spend all your time reading the papers. And then the second thing is with the audience, you never got much further than saying, \u2018You in the red shirt\u2019. And that became very frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>Because he could never find out who these angry people were?</p> <p>\u201cWe did have an idea in the last few years of somehow taking people from the audience and telling their stories,\u201d he says, \u201cyou know, \u2018that nurse we had in Southampton talking about the NHS was really good, why not get her story, or that farmer\u2019s daughter in Lincolnshire who was saying they had to put signs on the gate in Polish\u2026\u2019 But that never worked out. I got very frustrated by it.\u201d</p> <p>Watching the last couple of years, in which he tried to maintain his interest in the weekly slanging match, I say it often felt like he was eyeing the fire exits along with the rest of the country, wondering if he could make a break for it.</p> <p>He smiles. \u201cAfter 2016, it was just Brexit, Brexit, Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.\u201d The film he made for <em>Panorama</em> was an effort to add the kind of depth he had in mind when they had talked about following the stories of the audience. He believes vox pops \u2013 the pervasive notion that the voice of the people might authentically be the first thing that comes into the head of a trawlerman in Grimsby when a BBC microphone is thrust in front of him \u2013 are not journalism at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97afc0da3f5698980f041d903fb40d6e4053eb66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97afc0da3f5698980f041d903fb40d6e4053eb66/0_25_1266_760/1000.png\" alt=\"Hosting the EU referendum coverage. \u2018After 2016, it was just Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hosting the EU referendum coverage. \u2018After 2016, it was just Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey wander out into Market Harborough or somewhere and say, \u2018What do you think about this complex thing?\u2019 and someone says, \u2018I don\u2019t really know\u2019 and that\u2019s presented as news.\u201d</p> <p>Remembering the golden age of television reporting \u2013 Dimbleby once spent a couple of years on and off in South Africa, making a film that tried to get into the heads of Afrikaners and have them account for apartheid \u2013 he knows that the longer you spend listening to people, the more likely you are to hear a story. He liked the hairdresser he spoke to in Merthyr Tydfil for his Brexit programme, who told him, honestly: \u201cI like Boris because he is a liar. And he has balls of steel.\u201d He pauses, laughs uproariously at the idea. \u201cBalls of steel indeed!\u201d</p> <p>T<em>he Sun King</em> finds plenty of authentic voices to tell their tales. Vic Giles, Murdoch\u2019s designer at the <em>Sun</em>, is unearthed at his home in London\u2019s Barbican, aged 91, to explain jovially how he came up with the concept of the Page 3 girl.<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/06/24/rip-steve-dunleavy-the-heart-of-the-modern-new-york-post/\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/06/24/rip-steve-dunleavy-the-heart-of-the-modern-new-york-post/\" title=\"\">Steve Dunleavy</a><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/06/24/rip-steve-dunleavy-the-heart-of-the-modern-new-york-post/\" title=\"\">, \u201cMr Blood and Guts\u201d of the </a><em><a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/06/24/rip-steve-dunleavy-the-heart-of-the-modern-new-york-post/\" title=\"\">New York Post</a></em>, spoke (before his death in June) about the way he helped to inject the lowest common denominator sensibility of Murdoch\u2019s British tabloids into the American bloodstream, using crime stories to stoke fear and division. (If you thought the tone of Breitbart and Steve Bannon came out of nowhere, you need to look no further than some of the extremes of Kelvin MacKenzie\u2019s <em>Sun</em>) One contributor memorably calls News Corp \u201ca pirate ship\u201d. David Yelland, who was press-ganged into the <em>Sun</em> editor\u2019s chair because, in the years of Tony Blair, he seemed to be the only lefty in Murdoch\u2019s employ, seems to concur. And so does Nick Davies of the <em>Guardian</em>, who broke the story of phone hacking and Milly Dowler.</p> <p>I ask Dimbleby about that original connection he felt with Murdoch, his fellow newspaper proprietor (the Dimbleby \u201cempire\u201d was based on local weekly papers around Richmond upon Thames. David bought sole ownership of the business from his family in 1983 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/apr/10/newsquest.pressandpublishing\" title=\"\">eventually sold for a reported \u00a312m to the American group Newsquest in 2001</a>).</p> <p>\u201cThe difference is I took on the newspaper with a certain reluctance and ran it like a family grocery business for 30 years or whatever it was,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile Murdoch is a newspaper man through and through. What I liked about him from when I first met him was this romantic idea that he had of it all. I knew that during a journalists\u2019 strike in Sydney he had put the paper to bed [overseen production of it] himself, for example.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3d0acc171af0b8dc4d9b8805b5caa4109c3426d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3d0acc171af0b8dc4d9b8805b5caa4109c3426d/105_0_3239_4049/800.jpg\" alt=\"David Dimbleby as a student at Oxford, where he was editor of the student newspaper Isis.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Dimbleby as a student at Oxford, where he was editor of the student newspaper Isis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The question of what motivates his subject beyond that romance is the starting point of Dimbleby\u2019s inquiry. His conclusion is unequivocal. \u201cNews is just profit to Murdoch,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he is a great political operator, who wants to push a particular set of ideas. Look at his relationships with Thatcher, with Blair, with Trump \u2013 who he calls \u2018a fucking idiot\u2019. The only line you can trace through everything is money.\u201d</p> <p>Dimbleby interviewed Murdoch once more for the BBC in the 1980s and met him on a couple of other occasions, once, memorably, when Dimbleby was deputed by a number of journalists at the <em>Times</em> to see if Murdoch would sell them the paper. They had a surreal breakfast. \u201cI sat down and said, \u2018I\u2019d like to buy the <em>Times</em> off you,\u2019\u201d Dimbleby recalls with a chuckle. \u201cMurdoch listened politely and then told me it was not for sale.\u201d The other occasion was at a memorial service for the historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/lord-briggs-of-lewes-asa-briggs-obituary\" title=\"\">Asa Briggs</a>, who had taught Murdoch at Oxford. Dimbleby came across Murdoch standing on his own, cradling a sherry, afterwards. \u201cI just went and had a chat with him. He is not pompous at all. But then his approach to everything is: how can I hijack this for my own ends?\u201d</p> <p>One of the things that makes Dimbleby\u2019s approach to that megalomania compelling is that he is never censorious or judgmental. Sometimes, in the episode about the print unions and Wapping, you sense Dimbleby\u2019s qualified admiration for Murdoch\u2019s irresistible energy (Dimbleby had his well-publicised battles with union leaders at his own titles, for which he is unrepentant). You sense, too, a regard for the mischief-making, outlaw quality of some of Murdoch\u2019s journalism, as if Dimbleby was sometimes of the devil\u2019s party without knowing it.</p> <p>I ask him about the untold story in his investigation, the way that the no-holds-barred populism of Murdoch\u2019s tabloids infected the finer aspirations of all British media. How it made balance and accuracy seem dull, put gossip on the front page and suggested personal privacy and journalistic ethics were the stuff of liberal elitism. How did Murdoch\u2019s \u201cgiving the people what they want\u201d destabilise the certainties of the BBC? </p> <p>He considers the question as if for the first time. \u201cI tried to be director general of the BBC once,\u201d he says, \u201cand chairman of it twice, so I am always a little diffident about making criticisms of it \u2013 but that sounds like I have an agenda.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019ll say this, I know why they do it, but I think that there is a little too much populism in the BBC news, in the selections of stories and the way they are presented. I do think that. <em>Question Time</em> was accused of doing that as well of course. Which I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d</p> <p>Was there never a pressure to ramp up divisions, drive up viewing figures?</p> <p>He is not convinced that there was. \u201cThe language of politics has always been full of energy,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look back to that Trollope quote, the brutality of it was there. I think perhaps there have been times when we thought politics should be a more polite, gentle thing \u2013 with Macmillan and Eden, say, and Brown and Blair. Thatcher upped the ante and we have that again. But it\u2019s a raw thing, politics. The fact is, parliament has always been shouting and waving, but we never saw it. It is about power. They are all mini-Murdochs really.\u201d</p> <p>He has lived through a good many apocalyptic political moments: is he not fearful at all for what we are seeing now?</p> <p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we are in a lot of turmoil around the decision and 48% and 52%. I think a lot of the stuff around whether we will be richer or poorer is often surmise \u2013 you never really know. I would have thought five years from now, people won\u2019t still be talking about the EU and referendums. I\u2019m not a seer. I do think the issues that were opened up about identity are very profound.\u201d</p> <p>One of the things that the referendum split seems to have jeopardised in our identity, I say, is that shared sense of British self-deprecation and decency that the media were so good at reflecting. (I find myself mentioning <em>Test Match Special</em> and <em>Down Your Way</em> \u2013 \u201cThat was my dad\u2019s programme,\u201d Dimbleby says, a little wistfully.) Does he not think a coarser, nastier idea of the national character is in the ascendancy?</p> <p>\u201cI am not sure it is in the ascendancy. It is just more visible because of social media.\u201d Dimbleby does not do Twitter. \u201cAnd I think social media is a far smaller world than people pretend. The ghastliness of the insults and the death threats; I bet if you added up the number who do that, it would be a very small number indeed, but it is amplified.\u201d</p> <p>How does he feel about the fact that <em>Question Time</em> under his watch was routinely pilloried for giving Nigel Farage a platform greater than his stridency perhaps merited?</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t an editorial choice by <em>Question Time</em>, but by the BBC,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was laid down that after Ukip got the seats in the European parliament, we had to have them on a certain number of times a year. I think probably the mistake was that it was nearly always Farage \u2013 but the problem was that there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone else from Ukip who could string two words together.\u201d</p> <p>He concedes that the booking system for the <em>Question Time</em> audience also favoured those people prepared to shout loudest. \u201cWe want people with something to say. [So] it\u2019s a contrivance, it inevitably plays to people with strong views. But outside <em>Question Time</em> I don\u2019t think people are so angry \u2013 they have many more important things on their minds. And that encourages me to think that we are not falling apart.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5a9513b6cf7e86654facad4d9e80238d6499276\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5a9513b6cf7e86654facad4d9e80238d6499276/0_25_772_463/500.jpg\" alt=\"Hosting coverage of the UK\u2019s first European referendum in 1975.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hosting coverage of the UK\u2019s first European referendum in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his farewell interview on the <em>Today</em> programme, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/22/david-dimbleby-rebuffs-sneering-john-humphrys-in-interview\" title=\"\">Dimbleby got miffed when John Humphrys had the temerity to describe him as \u201cposh\u201d</a>. \u201cI\u2019m about as posh as you are,\u201d Dimbleby said. Humphrys, the son of a french polisher from Cardiff, who dropped out of school at 15, pointed to the family connections that had got Dimbleby and brother, Jonathan, a start at the BBC, but then backed down, affably. He could, by rights, have also mentioned Dimbleby\u2019s Charterhouse schooling, the fact that he was a member of the Bullingdon club at Oxford, the fact his second wife, Belinda Giles, is the granddaughter of an earl, the fact he sent his son Henry, the food entrepreneur, to Eton \u2013 but perhaps his hesitation was just.</p> <p>No doubt you can make a case that Dimbleby\u2019s is the voice of an elite that refuses to recognise itself as such \u2013 the target of Murdoch-style populist disruption \u2013 but if so, in his case, it also clearly represents values that we would miss if they were lost. There is no reason beyond ingrained fair play for him, in his Audible podcast, not to editorialise against Murdoch, to express a personal view, but old habits die hard. While some of his interviewees hold the view that Murdoch has been a \u201cforce of evil in the world\u201d or retain the hope that [Murdoch\u2019s fourth wife] Jerry Hall will \u201cshag him to death\u201d, Dimbleby keeps his counsel. Wasn\u2019t he tempted to put the boot in?</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. I mean, what you choose to use, what you choose to say, all those things are editorialising. But the blunt question of Murdoch good or bad? No, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to opine on that.\u201d</p> <p>We talk some more about <em>Succession,</em> of which he and his wife are late adopters and now avid fans. \u201cTheir life seems like something you would run a million miles from, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he says. \u201cI think the life of the rich and famous is always the most depressing sight.\u201d He says this in the confident belief that it is a million miles from his own existence. \u201cThe life of the super-rich is not one to be envied, whizzing round in those horrid little jet planes all the time.\u201d</p> <p>If there is a moral to Dimbleby\u2019s story, and perhaps even to Murdoch\u2019s, it is never to let success or money elevate you above the things you care about.</p> <p>\u201cI feel liberated,\u201d Dimbleby says before I leave, with the voice that has proved as serviceable in describing royal nuptials as natural disasters. \u201cGoing back to reporting, it is what life is about really, isn\u2019t it? I could make documentaries about quantitative easing, I guess, and go around the world talking to political leaders about globalisation. But the reality of all that is the guy like the one in our Brexit film in Cannock who makes plastic widgets for a Japanese car that is assembled in Slovakia or wherever, and how it affects his life.\u201d He grins his haphazard grin. \u201cThere is masses to do!\u201d he says. \u201cAnd all you have to do is just listen, keep listening.

      "bodyText": "Every once in a while, something chances along that illuminates our baffling world with sudden clarity. One such something is The Sun King, a six-part podcast by David Dimbleby about the long career of Rupert Murdoch. I listened to it all through once and then again and I recommend that you do, too. In telling the story of the rise of the most powerful media tycoon the world has known, it serves among other things to explain the fertile germ of populism in Britain and the US, a byproduct of the corrosive tone of Murdoch\u2019s tabloids, and outlines the threat to democracy presented by a US president who was a creation of Fox News. The series gains its authority in the voice of Dimbleby, never less than wry and reasonable, whose career has covered a similar span to Murdoch\u2019s. The pair first met in 1968 when Dimbleby interviewed the Australian \u2013 and his second wife Anna (\u201cI don\u2019t like him being called a tycoon\u201d) \u2013 after Murdoch arrived in Britain having bought the News of the World. The two men had a few things in common, Dimbleby felt: both had lost their famous fathers in their 20s and both had inherited a newspaper business to run; Murdoch in Melbourne and Adelaide, and Dimbleby, on a smaller scale, in the local papers of south-west London. In the decades since, those journalistic legacies have been exploited in markedly different ways, like some parable of the media talents. Dimbleby has followed in his father\u2019s footsteps to become the most trusted and avuncular of the BBC\u2019s voices over 50 years; Murdoch continues to reshape partisan journalism to suit his own cynical billionaire ends. Now that both men are in, or approaching, their final acts, it feels like a good moment to tally those stellar careers against each other. We think we know all about the tensions and tenor of Murdoch\u2019s swansong from the compulsive drama of Succession. It has been less clear, since Dimbleby gave up his chair at Question Time and at the helm of elections and state occasions at the end of last year, how gentle, at 81, he would go into semi-retirement. The argument made by The Sun King is, happily, not at all. Dimbleby is one of those figures in British public life who has loosened up as he has aged. He could seem a priggish presence in his earlier broadcasting career \u2013 I can just about remember him as part of the BBC furniture in the 1970s with a version of his father\u2019s received pronunciation and an earnest ambition to prove himself on his own terms, but he has grown more puckish as he \u2013 and we \u2013 have aged; more himself. He plans to use this new chapter of his broadcasting life to go back to basics, out from behind a studio desk to on-the-road reporting. His first foray into this braver new world, beside the Murdoch series, was a documentary about Brexit for Panorama, which was broadcast a fortnight ago. As the man who uttered those fateful words at 4.40am on the morning of 24 June 2016: \u201cThe British people have spoken and their answer is: we\u2019re out!\u201d, Dimbleby\u2019s film saw him attempt to get behind the \u201cjust get it done\u201d soundbites and listen to Brexit-divided families around their dining tables or in front of their gas fires. In something like a comparable spirit, I went to see Dimbleby in his London townhouse last week, in a quiet side road in Pimlico \u2013 he also has a farm in East Sussex (the one time he missed Question Time in 25 years he had been knocked unconscious by a bull). His house, around the corner from a street food market, is set between hair salons and delis and, like its occupant, bounding to the door in his corduroy suit, it seems perfectly comfortable in its own skin. We talked first, while he made coffee, about the progress of the election campaign \u2013 there are well-thumbed newspapers scattered across his kitchen table along with stacks of novels and laptops and chargers and cables \u2013 the first that he has not been anchoring since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s victory in 1979. He insists he is not going to miss it, will just be watching like the rest of us. \u201cI\u2019ve done 10 elections,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the thing is, all elections, if you are in the studio, are pretty much the same. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a landslide or a hung parliament, it\u2019s all about getting the facts straight on the night.\u201d I begin to suggest that politics now seems more unsettled and unsettling than at any time during those years, but he insists it was probably ever thus. To prove the point, he gallops \u2013 with his freakish Attenborough-esque energy \u2013 up the stairs that rise out of the kitchen to the first-floor sitting room to grab a copy of Anthony Trollope\u2019s novel Phineas Redux. He comes down the stairs quoting triumphantly a passage that might have been written last week. \u201c\u2018The country had now reached that period of its life in which rapid decay was inevitable, and\u2026 national decrepitude was imminent, and natural death could not long be postponed\u2026\u2019 You see?\u201d he says, delighted, \u201cthis was 1870 or whatever.\u201d He goes on: \u201c\u2018Had [Daubeny, the Tory prime minister] been allowed to operate he would have cut the taproots of the national cancer, have introduced fresh blood into the national veins, and resuscitated the national digestion, and he seemed to think that the nation, as a nation, was willing enough to undergo the operation and be treated as he should choose to treat it \u2013 but that the incubus of Mr Gresham, backed by an unworthy House of Commons, had prevented, and was preventing, the nation from having its own way\u2026 \u2019 \u201cI sent that passage to Nick Robinson,\u201d Dimbleby says. \u201cIsn\u2019t it perfect?\u201d He pours us coffee from a cafetiere, which, in the absence of its plunger, he filters ineffectively through a tea strainer. I wonder how the Murdoch thing came about. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d Dimbleby asks, with his ever-urgent curiosity. \u201cA producer, Joe Sykes, came to me with the idea just after I had finished Question Time and I absolutely leapt at it. I am really interested in changing the way I broadcast.\u201d He loves the intimacy of the podcast format, the way his words might creep into peoples\u2019 heads and occupy them while they are on trains or riding bikes. \u201cIt is quite different even from radio documentaries,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is like me talking to you across this table.\u201d He knew his time at Question Time was up when he started to meet people in their 40s who told him they had watched him on it every Thursday night since their teens. \u201cIt was great to do but as a broadcaster it was quite constraining. First, because it was Westminster-politics based. So you have to spend all your time reading the papers. And then the second thing is with the audience, you never got much further than saying, \u2018You in the red shirt\u2019. And that became very frustrating.\u201d Because he could never find out who these angry people were? \u201cWe did have an idea in the last few years of somehow taking people from the audience and telling their stories,\u201d he says, \u201cyou know, \u2018that nurse we had in Southampton talking about the NHS was really good, why not get her story, or that farmer\u2019s daughter in Lincolnshire who was saying they had to put signs on the gate in Polish\u2026\u2019 But that never worked out. I got very frustrated by it.\u201d Watching the last couple of years, in which he tried to maintain his interest in the weekly slanging match, I say it often felt like he was eyeing the fire exits along with the rest of the country, wondering if he could make a break for it. He smiles. \u201cAfter 2016, it was just Brexit, Brexit, Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.\u201d The film he made for Panorama was an effort to add the kind of depth he had in mind when they had talked about following the stories of the audience. He believes vox pops \u2013 the pervasive notion that the voice of the people might authentically be the first thing that comes into the head of a trawlerman in Grimsby when a BBC microphone is thrust in front of him \u2013 are not journalism at all. \u201cThey wander out into Market Harborough or somewhere and say, \u2018What do you think about this complex thing?\u2019 and someone says, \u2018I don\u2019t really know\u2019 and that\u2019s presented as news.\u201d Remembering the golden age of television reporting \u2013 Dimbleby once spent a couple of years on and off in South Africa, making a film that tried to get into the heads of Afrikaners and have them account for apartheid \u2013 he knows that the longer you spend listening to people, the more likely you are to hear a story. He liked the hairdresser he spoke to in Merthyr Tydfil for his Brexit programme, who told him, honestly: \u201cI like Boris because he is a liar. And he has balls of steel.\u201d He pauses, laughs uproariously at the idea. \u201cBalls of steel indeed!\u201d The Sun King finds plenty of authentic voices to tell their tales. Vic Giles, Murdoch\u2019s designer at the Sun, is unearthed at his home in London\u2019s Barbican, aged 91, to explain jovially how he came up with the concept of the Page 3 girl. Steve Dunleavy, \u201cMr Blood and Guts\u201d of the New York Post, spoke (before his death in June) about the way he helped to inject the lowest common denominator sensibility of Murdoch\u2019s British tabloids into the American bloodstream, using crime stories to stoke fear and division. (If you thought the tone of Breitbart and Steve Bannon came out of nowhere, you need to look no further than some of the extremes of Kelvin MacKenzie\u2019s Sun) One contributor memorably calls News Corp \u201ca pirate ship\u201d. David Yelland, who was press-ganged into the Sun editor\u2019s chair because, in the years of Tony Blair, he seemed to be the only lefty in Murdoch\u2019s employ, seems to concur. And so does Nick Davies of the Guardian, who broke the story of phone hacking and Milly Dowler. I ask Dimbleby about that original connection he felt with Murdoch, his fellow newspaper proprietor (the Dimbleby \u201cempire\u201d was based on local weekly papers around Richmond upon Thames. David bought sole ownership of the business from his family in 1983 and eventually sold for a reported \u00a312m to the American group Newsquest in 2001). \u201cThe difference is I took on the newspaper with a certain reluctance and ran it like a family grocery business for 30 years or whatever it was,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile Murdoch is a newspaper man through and through. What I liked about him from when I first met him was this romantic idea that he had of it all. I knew that during a journalists\u2019 strike in Sydney he had put the paper to bed [overseen production of it] himself, for example.\u201d The question of what motivates his subject beyond that romance is the starting point of Dimbleby\u2019s inquiry. His conclusion is unequivocal. \u201cNews is just profit to Murdoch,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he is a great political operator, who wants to push a particular set of ideas. Look at his relationships with Thatcher, with Blair, with Trump \u2013 who he calls \u2018a fucking idiot\u2019. The only line you can trace through everything is money.\u201d Dimbleby interviewed Murdoch once more for the BBC in the 1980s and met him on a couple of other occasions, once, memorably, when Dimbleby was deputed by a number of journalists at the Times to see if Murdoch would sell them the paper. They had a surreal breakfast. \u201cI sat down and said, \u2018I\u2019d like to buy the Times off you,\u2019\u201d Dimbleby recalls with a chuckle. \u201cMurdoch listened politely and then told me it was not for sale.\u201d The other occasion was at a memorial service for the historian Asa Briggs, who had taught Murdoch at Oxford. Dimbleby came across Murdoch standing on his own, cradling a sherry, afterwards. \u201cI just went and had a chat with him. He is not pompous at all. But then his approach to everything is: how can I hijack this for my own ends?\u201d One of the things that makes Dimbleby\u2019s approach to that megalomania compelling is that he is never censorious or judgmental. Sometimes, in the episode about the print unions and Wapping, you sense Dimbleby\u2019s qualified admiration for Murdoch\u2019s irresistible energy (Dimbleby had his well-publicised battles with union leaders at his own titles, for which he is unrepentant). You sense, too, a regard for the mischief-making, outlaw quality of some of Murdoch\u2019s journalism, as if Dimbleby was sometimes of the devil\u2019s party without knowing it. I ask him about the untold story in his investigation, the way that the no-holds-barred populism of Murdoch\u2019s tabloids infected the finer aspirations of all British media. How it made balance and accuracy seem dull, put gossip on the front page and suggested personal privacy and journalistic ethics were the stuff of liberal elitism. How did Murdoch\u2019s \u201cgiving the people what they want\u201d destabilise the certainties of the BBC? He considers the question as if for the first time. \u201cI tried to be director general of the BBC once,\u201d he says, \u201cand chairman of it twice, so I am always a little diffident about making criticisms of it \u2013 but that sounds like I have an agenda.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI\u2019ll say this, I know why they do it, but I think that there is a little too much populism in the BBC news, in the selections of stories and the way they are presented. I do think that. Question Time was accused of doing that as well of course. Which I don\u2019t think it did.\u201d Was there never a pressure to ramp up divisions, drive up viewing figures? He is not convinced that there was. \u201cThe language of politics has always been full of energy,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look back to that Trollope quote, the brutality of it was there. I think perhaps there have been times when we thought politics should be a more polite, gentle thing \u2013 with Macmillan and Eden, say, and Brown and Blair. Thatcher upped the ante and we have that again. But it\u2019s a raw thing, politics. The fact is, parliament has always been shouting and waving, but we never saw it. It is about power. They are all mini-Murdochs really.\u201d He has lived through a good many apocalyptic political moments: is he not fearful at all for what we are seeing now? \u201cNot really,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we are in a lot of turmoil around the decision and 48% and 52%. I think a lot of the stuff around whether we will be richer or poorer is often surmise \u2013 you never really know. I would have thought five years from now, people won\u2019t still be talking about the EU and referendums. I\u2019m not a seer. I do think the issues that were opened up about identity are very profound.\u201d One of the things that the referendum split seems to have jeopardised in our identity, I say, is that shared sense of British self-deprecation and decency that the media were so good at reflecting. (I find myself mentioning Test Match Special and Down Your Way \u2013 \u201cThat was my dad\u2019s programme,\u201d Dimbleby says, a little wistfully.) Does he not think a coarser, nastier idea of the national character is in the ascendancy? \u201cI am not sure it is in the ascendancy. It is just more visible because of social media.\u201d Dimbleby does not do Twitter. \u201cAnd I think social media is a far smaller world than people pretend. The ghastliness of the insults and the death threats; I bet if you added up the number who do that, it would be a very small number indeed, but it is amplified.\u201d How does he feel about the fact that Question Time under his watch was routinely pilloried for giving Nigel Farage a platform greater than his stridency perhaps merited? \u201cThat wasn\u2019t an editorial choice by Question Time, but by the BBC,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was laid down that after Ukip got the seats in the European parliament, we had to have them on a certain number of times a year. I think probably the mistake was that it was nearly always Farage \u2013 but the problem was that there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone else from Ukip who could string two words together.\u201d He concedes that the booking system for the Question Time audience also favoured those people prepared to shout loudest. \u201cWe want people with something to say. [So] it\u2019s a contrivance, it inevitably plays to people with strong views. But outside Question Time I don\u2019t think people are so angry \u2013 they have many more important things on their minds. And that encourages me to think that we are not falling apart.\u201d In his farewell interview on the Today programme, Dimbleby got miffed when John Humphrys had the temerity to describe him as \u201cposh\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m about as posh as you are,\u201d Dimbleby said. Humphrys, the son of a french polisher from Cardiff, who dropped out of school at 15, pointed to the family connections that had got Dimbleby and brother, Jonathan, a start at the BBC, but then backed down, affably. He could, by rights, have also mentioned Dimbleby\u2019s Charterhouse schooling, the fact that he was a member of the Bullingdon club at Oxford, the fact his second wife, Belinda Giles, is the granddaughter of an earl, the fact he sent his son Henry, the food entrepreneur, to Eton \u2013 but perhaps his hesitation was just. No doubt you can make a case that Dimbleby\u2019s is the voice of an elite that refuses to recognise itself as such \u2013 the target of Murdoch-style populist disruption \u2013 but if so, in his case, it also clearly represents values that we would miss if they were lost. There is no reason beyond ingrained fair play for him, in his Audible podcast, not to editorialise against Murdoch, to express a personal view, but old habits die hard. While some of his interviewees hold the view that Murdoch has been a \u201cforce of evil in the world\u201d or retain the hope that [Murdoch\u2019s fourth wife] Jerry Hall will \u201cshag him to death\u201d, Dimbleby keeps his counsel. Wasn\u2019t he tempted to put the boot in? \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I mean, what you choose to use, what you choose to say, all those things are editorialising. But the blunt question of Murdoch good or bad? No, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to opine on that.\u201d We talk some more about Succession, of which he and his wife are late adopters and now avid fans. \u201cTheir life seems like something you would run a million miles from, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he says. \u201cI think the life of the rich and famous is always the most depressing sight.\u201d He says this in the confident belief that it is a million miles from his own existence. \u201cThe life of the super-rich is not one to be envied, whizzing round in those horrid little jet planes all the time.\u201d If there is a moral to Dimbleby\u2019s story, and perhaps even to Murdoch\u2019s, it is never to let success or money elevate you above the things you care about. \u201cI feel liberated,\u201d Dimbleby says before I leave, with the voice that has proved as serviceable in describing royal nuptials as natural disasters. \u201cGoing back to reporting, it is what life is about really, isn\u2019t it? I could make documentaries about quantitative easing, I guess, and go around the world talking to political leaders about globalisation. But the reality of all that is the guy like the one in our Brexit film in Cannock who makes plastic widgets for a Japanese car that is assembled in Slovakia or wherever, and how it affects his life.\u201d He grins his haphazard grin. \u201cThere is masses to do!\u201d he says. \u201cAnd all you have to do is just listen, keep listening. I love that!\u201d The Sun King is available at audible.co.uk",

It\u2019s hard to believe that I have the chance to be the second.\u201d</p> <p>He has a chance all right. On an afternoon which was long dominated by Rory McIlroy, Rahm played the inward half in 32 before signing for his second 66 of the week. Lorenzo-Vera\u2019s bogey at the last ensured a tie with Rahm at 15 under par. Soon the Frenchman was making social-media waves after casually throwing in the f-word during a televised post\u2011round interview. \u201cI\u2019m French,\u201d was his nonchalant explanation for the accidental profanity.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe tomorrow you shoot six under and then you put your family out of any trouble for the rest of your life,\u201d said Lorenzo\u2011Vera, who has never won on the European Tour. \u201cSo of course it\u2019s going to add some pressure. But you don\u2019t control anything except your mind. That\u2019s the only thing you can control tomorrow, so I just hope for the same game plan and let\u2019s see if golf wants to give me something.\u201d</p> <p>Tommy Fleetwood, who is also in the Race to Dubai hunt, made a 70 to lie four behind Rahm and Lorenzo\u2011Vera. This marks the third year in a row Fleetwood has taken to day four in Dubai with order of merit hope; he took the title in 2017. \u201cI\u2019m obviously used to this situation and that\u2019s a positive,\u201d said the Southport man. \u201cI\u2019ve got all the experience, so I\u2019ve got to hit golf shots now. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>McIlroy described golf as a fickle business after his round-two score was 10 shots worse than his opening effort. He pretty much endorsed the point with a day three 65, which leaves him as a clear and obvious threat at minus 13. McIlroy was out in 31 and did not drop a single shot during his third round.</p> <p>Should McIlroy prevail at the Earth Course, it would be the first time he had won a tournament at the same venue three times.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be a nice box to tick,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is nice to come back to courses that you\u2019re familiar with all the time, and that brings its own advantages, I guess, compared to maybe some of the other guys in the field.

It would be wonderful going into the break to finish on a high.\u201d</p> <p>Bernd Wiesberger, who arrived in the Middle East as the Race to Dubai leader, slipped to a 73 which leaves him in a share of 24th.

There is nothing else for miles around, except a tiny white Cycladic church, its mushroom-cap dome peeping from the landscape. The Greek island of Ios, tucked between heaving holiday hotspots Santorini and Naxos, is known as a teen and 20-something \u201cparty island\u201d, but there\u2019s no sign of that here. Instead, the island is largely tranquil, maybe thanks to the fact that there\u2019s no airport, which means you can take the long, more exciting route if you have the time.</p> <p>The short way is to fly to Santorini then cross by ferry to Ios. For the more adventurous, there is the option of boarding the Eurostar to Paris, followed by a TGV to Italy, and then an overnight ferry to Athens, which takes 48 hours but offers the benefit of some impressive scenery along the way. Then it\u2019s a four to six-hour ferry from Athens, or you can break this up with some island hopping in between.</p> <p>On a hilltop at the island\u2019s northern tip, I stand in a little stone enclosure in front of a simple marble tombstone carved with a bearded head of Homer. Ios has been associated with Greece\u2019s most famous poet since classical times. It is said to have been his mother\u2019s home, and the place where he died and was buried.

      "bodyText": "The coast is punctuated by empty beaches of golden sand and, above, hillsides of rock and scrub are scattered with purple vegetation. There is nothing else for miles around, except a tiny white Cycladic church, its mushroom-cap dome peeping from the landscape. The Greek island of Ios, tucked between heaving holiday hotspots Santorini and Naxos, is known as a teen and 20-something \u201cparty island\u201d, but there\u2019s no sign of that here. Instead, the island is largely tranquil, maybe thanks to the fact that there\u2019s no airport, which means you can take the long, more exciting route if you have the time. The short way is to fly to Santorini then cross by ferry to Ios. For the more adventurous, there is the option of boarding the Eurostar to Paris, followed by a TGV to Italy, and then an overnight ferry to Athens, which takes 48 hours but offers the benefit of some impressive scenery along the way. Then it\u2019s a four to six-hour ferry from Athens, or you can break this up with some island hopping in between. On a hilltop at the island\u2019s northern tip, I stand in a little stone enclosure in front of a simple marble tombstone carved with a bearded head of Homer. Ios has been associated with Greece\u2019s most famous poet since classical times. It is said to have been his mother\u2019s home, and the place where he died and was buried. Ios isn\u2019t the only claimant, but whether Homer came here or not, this is a spectacular spot with a full-circle pristine panorama \u2013 a perfect place for a peaceful (bring your own) aperitif or an island hike. At the other end of the island, however, sunset during the summer season is another story altogether. There, you\u2019re likely to find bikini-clad teens dancing precariously on tables to a thudding bass and splashing happily into the swimming pool at Pathos Sunset Lounge, a bar, restaurant and club near Chora, the island\u2019s main town, which stretches up the hillside. The rest of us can choose whether to engage with the party side of Ios, or enjoy the delights of the hardly inhabited majority of the island. Perhaps oddly, it is Pathos\u2019s owners who are helping to ensure that this choice remains and Ios never becomes another cheek-by-jowl Santorini or Mykonos. Over the past 15 years Athenian entrepreneur Angelos Michalopoulos and his wife Vasso have bought up more than a quarter of the island, preserving much of the land and investing millions in low-density developments. Ios is the couple\u2019s passion project and they have publicly pledged to build on no more than 1% of the land they own. \u201cI do not want this to be an ex-beautiful island,\u201d says Michalopoulos, but the project still has to pay its way, \u201cor my children might decide to do it differently.\u201d His company has now built several venues, including a couple of stylish beach bars and two highly individual hotels: the boutique Agalia and recently opened five-star Calilo.

      "body": "<p>My mum fainted with excitement the day I gave birth. I came home from hospital to find her and my dad waiting outside our flat and, as I got out of the car and they embraced me, she collapsed into our group hug. That\u2019s the story most of my friends and family know about my birth experience. It\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s censored, it deflects from the stitches, the rollercoaster emotions, the stuff that\u2019s harder for everyone to say or to hear. Our birth stories get lost when our newborns are put into our arms. There\u2019s no time to look back as we hurtle headfirst into caregiving. But birth is a miracle, right? Another person grows inside you and then gets out of your body and lives its own life. It is objectively, painfully, hilariously awe-inspiring. As traumatic as it is hopeful. And interesting, too. So why don\u2019t we make more room to talk about it? And why is discussion of the topic generally confined to women who are about to give birth or have recently done so? As part of an ongoing project, I spoke to women around the world to hear different stories that were also in many ways universal. Here are six of them\u2026</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I wanted a caesarean\u2019:</strong> Sima, 42, London</h2> <p>I opted for a caesarean section, much to the annoyance of my midwife and consultant. Up to the last minute they tried to convince me to have a vaginal birth. I resented it because they made me feel I couldn\u2019t make decisions about my body.</p> <p>I was still traumatised by my first birth three years before. I\u2019d been two weeks overdue when I was induced and my baby didn\u2019t react well to the drugs. Her heart rate crashed three times during labour. There were alarms going off and the crash team came in each time. I was terrified. I felt that I was failing as a woman because my body wasn\u2019t doing what it was supposed to. After 12 stressful hours I was taken into an operating room for an emergency caesarean.</p> <p>I\u2019ve not spoken much to anyone about what happened because I blocked it out. It still upsets me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She was born to Tears Dry on Their Own by Amy Winehouse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was early in my second pregnancy that I told my midwife I wanted to take the elective caesarean route. At every appointment someone would say, \u201cWe really want you to consider a vaginal birth.\u201d I understood the health benefits of vaginal, but it wasn\u2019t an off-the-cuff decision for me. I\u2019d had a horrific experience the first time and couldn\u2019t face repeating it.</p> <p>Five weeks before my due date I was booked in for a caesarean. It was surreal to know the birth date of my unborn baby. The night before we went in, I tucked my daughter into bed and told her she\u2019d meet her brother or sister the next day.</p> <p>There was zero stress driving to the hospital the next morning. I knew what the operating theatre was going to be like and knew we weren\u2019t going to be in the same panic. I was actually excited.</p> <p>I was wheeled in at 9am. The team were chirpy and the consultant explained everything. Somebody asked which radio station I\u2019d like on and I couldn\u2019t believe that was even an option. Smooth FM seemed a bit cheesy so I said Heart. Even though I was numbed, I felt the consultant\u2019s hands rooting around inside me. It was a strange sensation, but it didn\u2019t hurt. Fifteen minutes after they started, my daughter was pulled out to Tears Dry on Their Own by Amy Winehouse. I asked to see her. She was covered in blood and mucus and still attached by the umbilical cord. She took her first breath and let out a massive cry.</p> <p>I still have a scar where both my daughters came out. It doesn\u2019t bother me. I feel like, \u201cThis is part of my life, part of my body, this is what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018My mum was with me\u2019: </strong>Anita, 38, Ghana</h2> <p>Around midnight on a Sunday I started to get severe pains. My mum told me not to scream but to save my energy for when I needed to push. She helped me stay calm with deep breathing, which was hard because it felt like someone was cutting my stomach open with a knife. She put her fingers in my vagina to check how much I had dilated and discouraged me from going to the hospital just yet.</p> <p>I\u2019d travelled from Accra to the city where she lives, to be with her. She used to be a midwife and she\u2019d helped me with the birth of my first child and I just felt so comfortable with her.</p> <p>We went to the hospital at about 6am and within a few hours I was ready to push. My mum went home to get some things for me and then it was just me and the midwife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30260479932f51a8206846fe9a192ff1c6ae98e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30260479932f51a8206846fe9a192ff1c6ae98e0/0_0_1364_2043/668.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of a woman breast-feeding her baby with the father lying next to them touching the baby\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The midwife gave her to me and I was just so excited.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Stephanie Wunderlich/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as I started pushing, the midwife told me to cross my legs. She said that she had to go somewhere but didn\u2019t explain where. I was so confused. She knew that I was about to give birth \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand why she had to leave me on my own right then. But I couldn\u2019t talk because of the pain. After a few minutes, I had to shout to a janitor outside the room to get her back as I couldn\u2019t hold on any longer.</p> <p>When she came back, I just opened my legs, my waters broke, I pushed really hard and the baby came out. The midwife gave her to me and I was just so excited. It was my daughter just staring back up at my face. My husband arrived from Accra that evening. It was his first baby and he couldn\u2019t contain himself. He was touching her so enthusiastically all over her face that I had to warn him, \u201cMy friend, don\u2019t be touching her like that.\u201d</p> <p>I tore during labour but the midwife said that because it was only a small tear, she wasn\u2019t going to give me stitches. A few days later I told my mum that I was feeling uncomfortable down there. She had a look and said I clearly needed some stitches. Over the next few months I was given stitches three separate times but I continued to bleed and then I developed low blood pressure.</p> <p>I felt angry with the nurse.

My mother was using drugs and she would get me to drive her around to pick them up. When I ran away and the courts found out what was going on, I was put in a maternity home.</p> <p>I realised that I might be in labour when I was watching my cousins\u2019 softball practice. I was 7cm dilated when we got to the hospital and the baby was in the birth canal. The doctor said I had probably been in labour for three days without realising.

I decided to leave the state and we started travelling because I didn\u2019t want my child taken from me again.</p> <p>I had my last child last month in a tent in a park in Texas. It was a super-hot day. We were relatively prepared but the baby was early and the contractions weren\u2019t usual. We wanted to call an ambulance but were afraid of drawing attention to being homeless with children. When the baby\u2019s head came out, my husband didn\u2019t think he was OK.

We were excited and relaxed. And I was proud of my decision, especially when I met my midwife. But on the second day, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It was devastating to be told the risks to the baby were so serious that a hospital birth was an option I\u2019d have to consider.</p> <p>But I wasn\u2019t ready to give up on the birth I wanted. I tried to improve my insulin levels. The midwives supported me and became like family. I was put on insulin and a strict diet and increased my exercise. Nothing helped though.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I focus on my time at the birth centre as it\u2019s such a positive memory</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We had been in Kerala a month when my waters broke. My midwife and I were still hopeful that I could have a natural birth. But after three days of waiting for labour to start, there was meconium in my discharge that became very green. The birth centre told me that I needed a caesarean section as soon as possible. My heart was still not accepting it though. I wanted to stay where I had planned to have my baby and where I felt safe. I really fought with myself.</p> <p>The drive to the hospital took an hour, and was extremely painful. My midwife came. I had become used to being asked for my consent when anyone did anything to my body but when we got to the hospital a nurse inserted her fingers in me without any warning. It was a teaching hospital and as I lay on the operating table, 30 to 40 students watched. No one asked me if they could be there.</p> <p>Within minutes of the anaesthetic, everything went hazy. I couldn\u2019t feel but I could hear. I saw a vague image of my baby being held up and the doctor saying, \u201cNimisha, you delivered a boy.\u201d </p> <p>Two hours later a nurse brought our son to me. With an IV in my hand and just having had a surgical procedure, it was painful to even try to feed him. I felt so flat. Even though I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t feel happiness. That was four months ago. Now, when I look back at my birth, I don\u2019t think so much about the hospital. I focus on my time at the birth centre as it\u2019s such a positive memory. If I do have another baby, I\u2019ll try for a natural birth again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My mum fainted with excitement the day I gave birth. I came home from hospital to find her and my dad waiting outside our flat and, as I got out of the car and they embraced me, she collapsed into our group hug. That\u2019s the story most of my friends and family know about my birth experience. It\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s censored, it deflects from the stitches, the rollercoaster emotions, the stuff that\u2019s harder for everyone to say or to hear. Our birth stories get lost when our newborns are put into our arms. There\u2019s no time to look back as we hurtle headfirst into caregiving. But birth is a miracle, right? Another person grows inside you and then gets out of your body and lives its own life. It is objectively, painfully, hilariously awe-inspiring. As traumatic as it is hopeful. And interesting, too. So why don\u2019t we make more room to talk about it? And why is discussion of the topic generally confined to women who are about to give birth or have recently done so? As part of an ongoing project, I spoke to women around the world to hear different stories that were also in many ways universal. Here are six of them\u2026 \u2018I wanted a caesarean\u2019: Sima, 42, London I opted for a caesarean section, much to the annoyance of my midwife and consultant. Up to the last minute they tried to convince me to have a vaginal birth. I resented it because they made me feel I couldn\u2019t make decisions about my body. I was still traumatised by my first birth three years before. I\u2019d been two weeks overdue when I was induced and my baby didn\u2019t react well to the drugs. Her heart rate crashed three times during labour. There were alarms going off and the crash team came in each time. I was terrified. I felt that I was failing as a woman because my body wasn\u2019t doing what it was supposed to. After 12 stressful hours I was taken into an operating room for an emergency caesarean. I\u2019ve not spoken much to anyone about what happened because I blocked it out. It still upsets me. It was early in my second pregnancy that I told my midwife I wanted to take the elective caesarean route. At every appointment someone would say, \u201cWe really want you to consider a vaginal birth.\u201d I understood the health benefits of vaginal, but it wasn\u2019t an off-the-cuff decision for me. I\u2019d had a horrific experience the first time and couldn\u2019t face repeating it. Five weeks before my due date I was booked in for a caesarean. It was surreal to know the birth date of my unborn baby. The night before we went in, I tucked my daughter into bed and told her she\u2019d meet her brother or sister the next day. There was zero stress driving to the hospital the next morning. I knew what the operating theatre was going to be like and knew we weren\u2019t going to be in the same panic. I was actually excited. I was wheeled in at 9am. The team were chirpy and the consultant explained everything. Somebody asked which radio station I\u2019d like on and I couldn\u2019t believe that was even an option. Smooth FM seemed a bit cheesy so I said Heart. Even though I was numbed, I felt the consultant\u2019s hands rooting around inside me. It was a strange sensation, but it didn\u2019t hurt. Fifteen minutes after they started, my daughter was pulled out to Tears Dry on Their Own by Amy Winehouse. I asked to see her. She was covered in blood and mucus and still attached by the umbilical cord. She took her first breath and let out a massive cry. I still have a scar where both my daughters came out. It doesn\u2019t bother me. I feel like, \u201cThis is part of my life, part of my body, this is what I\u2019ve done.\u201d \u2018My mum was with me\u2019: Anita, 38, Ghana Around midnight on a Sunday I started to get severe pains. My mum told me not to scream but to save my energy for when I needed to push. She helped me stay calm with deep breathing, which was hard because it felt like someone was cutting my stomach open with a knife. She put her fingers in my vagina to check how much I had dilated and discouraged me from going to the hospital just yet. I\u2019d travelled from Accra to the city where she lives, to be with her. She used to be a midwife and she\u2019d helped me with the birth of my first child and I just felt so comfortable with her. We went to the hospital at about 6am and within a few hours I was ready to push. My mum went home to get some things for me and then it was just me and the midwife. Just as I started pushing, the midwife told me to cross my legs. She said that she had to go somewhere but didn\u2019t explain where. I was so confused. She knew that I was about to give birth \u2013 I didn\u2019t understand why she had to leave me on my own right then. But I couldn\u2019t talk because of the pain. After a few minutes, I had to shout to a janitor outside the room to get her back as I couldn\u2019t hold on any longer. When she came back, I just opened my legs, my waters broke, I pushed really hard and the baby came out. The midwife gave her to me and I was just so excited. It was my daughter just staring back up at my face. My husband arrived from Accra that evening. It was his first baby and he couldn\u2019t contain himself. He was touching her so enthusiastically all over her face that I had to warn him, \u201cMy friend, don\u2019t be touching her like that.\u201d I tore during labour but the midwife said that because it was only a small tear, she wasn\u2019t going to give me stitches. A few days later I told my mum that I was feeling uncomfortable down there. She had a look and said I clearly needed some stitches. Over the next few months I was given stitches three separate times but I continued to bleed and then I developed low blood pressure. I felt angry with the nurse. I told my husband that I wouldn\u2019t be giving birth again. But that has changed as time passed. I\u2019m expecting my third child next month. Anita has been supported by WaCHAG, an organisation that works to reduce maternal mortality in Ghana \u2018Our baby was stillborn\u2019: Jessica, 32, Southampton It was a quiet, slow realisation. The midwife couldn\u2019t find a heartbeat so she tried another machine, then she got a doctor who got a second doctor who confirmed there wasn\u2019t one. I sat there looking at my wife\u2019s face not knowing what to do. I was waiting for somebody to snap their fingers and everything to start moving again. We were taken to a private room for families who experience the loss of a child and the midwife gave me a tablet to start the labour induction process. We were to go home and wait two days. I was 37 weeks pregnant and hadn\u2019t had any major complications. I took my whole pregnancy day-by-day, because we\u2019d been through five rounds of IVF to get there. I was on maternity leave when I\u2019d woken up from a nap and realised the baby wasn\u2019t moving. When I felt for his feet and pressed against them, where I would normally get a swift kick back, nothing happened. Those two days waiting at home were terrifying. I was still carrying our son, Leo. He was still digging in my ribs and getting in the way, but I could feel that he was dead. Our families came over, but there was a lot of staring at the floor.

But, along with my second and third child, the state took the baby away from me even though I didn\u2019t believe they had the legal authority to do so. When I got pregnant again, I had no trust in doctors, children\u2019s services and authority in general. I decided to leave the state and we started travelling because I didn\u2019t want my child taken from me again. I had my last child last month in a tent in a park in Texas. It was a super-hot day. We were relatively prepared but the baby was early and the contractions weren\u2019t usual. We wanted to call an ambulance but were afraid of drawing attention to being homeless with children. When the baby\u2019s head came out, my husband didn\u2019t think he was OK. But I got him to latch on and even though he\u2019s tiny, he\u2019s doing well so far. \u201830 students watched\u2019: Nimisha, 33, Mumbai I knew I wanted a natural, midwife-led birth, but it wasn\u2019t an option where I lived. Whenever I told anyone I was going to Kerala to have my baby they were shocked. \u201cYou live in Mumbai and you have the best facilities right here,\u201d they\u2019d say. At 36 weeks, my husband and I flew 800 miles to a natural birth centre. We were excited and relaxed. And I was proud of my decision, especially when I met my midwife. But on the second day, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It was devastating to be told the risks to the baby were so serious that a hospital birth was an option I\u2019d have to consider. But I wasn\u2019t ready to give up on the birth I wanted. I tried to improve my insulin levels. The midwives supported me and became like family. I was put on insulin and a strict diet and increased my exercise. Nothing helped though. We had been in Kerala a month when my waters broke. My midwife and I were still hopeful that I could have a natural birth. But after three days of waiting for labour to start, there was meconium in my discharge that became very green. The birth centre told me that I needed a caesarean section as soon as possible. My heart was still not accepting it though. I wanted to stay where I had planned to have my baby and where I felt safe. I really fought with myself. The drive to the hospital took an hour, and was extremely painful. My midwife came. I had become used to being asked for my consent when anyone did anything to my body but when we got to the hospital a nurse inserted her fingers in me without any warning. It was a teaching hospital and as I lay on the operating table, 30 to 40 students watched. No one asked me if they could be there. Within minutes of the anaesthetic, everything went hazy. I couldn\u2019t feel but I could hear. I saw a vague image of my baby being held up and the doctor saying, \u201cNimisha, you delivered a boy.\u201d Two hours later a nurse brought our son to me. With an IV in my hand and just having had a surgical procedure, it was painful to even try to feed him. I felt so flat. Even though I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t feel happiness. That was four months ago. Now, when I look back at my birth, I don\u2019t think so much about the hospital. I focus on my time at the birth centre as it\u2019s such a positive memory. If I do have another baby, I\u2019ll try for a natural birth again.",

The task of finishing those songs was passed, at Cohen\u2019s request, to his son, Adam. The results can be heard on <em>Thanks for the Dance</em>, released last Friday.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, I wanted to take the listener on an unconscious journey through the sonic signatures of my father\u2019s career, without it sounding like a regurgitation,\u201d says Adam Cohen, who, in his soft Canadian cadences and carefully constructed sentences, can sound uncannily like his father. \u201cMy dad always rejected invitations from producers like Rick Rubin and Don Was to make a retro record that sounded like his older stuff. He said he didn\u2019t want to do the nostalgia act.\u201d</p> <p>What is immediately striking about <em>Thanks for the Dance</em> is how organic these meticulously constructed songs sound, given that five of them were assembled from the barest musical sketches and four others from lyrics Leonard had recited, but not put to music. It sounds, above all, like a labour of love, and one that is entirely faithful to Cohen\u2019s abiding spirit.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d says Adam, smiling, \u201cFor me, it is very much a continuation of <em>You Want It Darker</em>, on which I worked with him for the first time, when he was in quite bad shape. This, though, was a more daunting undertaking. We had to ensure that he was with us all the way as we give these songs a musical language that he had already developed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d05e2e83c7a4a492fb24a3be30f6b9730f98fe57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d05e2e83c7a4a492fb24a3be30f6b9730f98fe57/0_0_4818_4818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leonard, Adam and Adam\u2019s son, Cassius, photographed at Leonard\u2019s house in Los Angeles, early 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leonard, Adam and Adam\u2019s son, Cassius, photographed at Leonard\u2019s house in Los Angeles, early 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Adam Cohen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the previous album was produced in Leonard\u2019s living room with, as Adam puts it, \u201cPro Tools on the table and my father in his medical chair\u201d, the new album initially took on a rough shape in Adam\u2019s converted garage before being finessed in recording studios in Los Angeles and Berlin. It was created with the help of a stellar cast of musicians, including Damien Rice, Daniel Lanois, Feist and Beck, as well as seasoned Cohen collaborators such as vocalist Jennifer Warnes and virtuoso guitarist Javier Mas. \u201cMost records you struggle to make, but this was not hard,\u201d says Adam. \u201cIt was, as the Arabs say, <em>maktoob</em> \u2013 already written.

The Goal, a short, sombre spoken-word piece, begins \u201cI can\u2019t leave my house, or answer the phone\u201d and contains the poignant self-observation: \u201cI sit in my chair, I look at the street, the neighbour returns my smile of defeat.\u201d The infirmities of old age are broached again on The Hills, on which he sings, \u201cI\u2019m living on pills, for which I thank God\u201d, delivering the last three words with heartfelt emphasis.</p> <p>Throughout, death is a given, its looming presence articulated with a characteristic degree of Buddhist acceptance. Here and there, though, there are glimpses of the sensuality that characterised several of his early songs and poems. On The Night of Santiago he sings: \u201cHer thighs they slipped away from me/ Like schools of startled fish\u201d. The song is actually an adaptation of a poem by Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, one of Leonard\u2019s literary touchstones. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite poems and I begged him to read it,\u201d says Adam.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AMMb9CiScI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2AMMb9CiScI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AMMb9CiScI\">Watch the video for Happens to the Heart from Cohen\u2019s final album, Thanks for the Dance</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>On an album of powerfully personal songs, the first line of the spoken word Puppets is like a punch from a velvet-gloved fist. \u201cGerman puppets burned the Jews,\u201d Leonard intones, against a brooding backdrop of synthesiser and voices. The poem is a litany of accusation \u2013 \u201cPuppet troops command/ Puppet troops to burn the land\u201d \u2013 offset by a chorus from the combined voices of the Shaar Hashomayim choir and Cantus Domus from Berlin \u2013 \u201cGermans and Jews singing together as if in a classical Greek play,\u201d as Adam puts it.</p> <p>On the regretful Moving On, it feels like Leonard is addressing someone specific, perhaps a former lover \u201cwho broke the heart and made it new\u201d. Adam nods and smiles. \u201cYes, that is indeed the case. When he was recording that vocal, he had just learned of Marianne\u2019s passing and I remember him adapting a few lines of the song.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/leonard-cohen-marianne-ihlen-love-affair-of-a-lifetime-nick-broomfield-documentary-words-of-love\" title=\"\">As every Cohen devotee knows</a>, Marianne Ihlen was the woman he met on the Greek island of Hydra in 1960 and later immortalised on one of his best-loved songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XzAjfwQtvM\" title=\"\">So Long, Marianne</a>. In July 2016, he learned that she was terminally ill and sent her an email via a friend.

We spent an hour or so, going over and over the words. It was as if we were trying to bring the Greek taverna back to life, and conjure the ghostly presence of a woman in the next room.\u201d</p> <p>It seems a good moment to ask if Adam\u2019s father and his mother, Suzanne Elrod, were on good terms. The two were together for more than 10 years, having reputedly met in a Scientology class in 1969. She is the striking woman to the right on the cover of Cohen\u2019s 1977 album, <em>Death of a Ladies\u2019 Man</em>. My question prompts a wry smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterise it as good terms exactly,\u201d he says, \u201cbut he was always gracious and devoted and supportive of my mother right to the end.\u201d</p> <p>Adam Cohen is disarmingly honest about the emotional complexity of his creative collaboration with his famously single-minded father. \u201cHe was an extraordinarily generous person,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if I was playing his guitar or his keyboard, he would say: \u2018It\u2019s like you\u2019re using my toothbrush.\u2019\u201d Did working together so closely give him a deeper understanding of his father as a person as well as an artist? \u201cWell, I almost feel that we were closer before we started working together. You have to understand there were other things at stake \u2013 this was his career, his art. So there were tensions and demands. I remember he once said: \u2018I\u2019ve compromised everything in my life, being a father even, at the service of trying to be a writer and blacken pages\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f7609d7ae9641565932472f44c8cb79457dd30f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7609d7ae9641565932472f44c8cb79457dd30f7/0_0_1280_848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young Adam with his father.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young Adam with his father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did he say that with regret? \u201cNo. He was saying, \u2018This is the way it has always been for me, and I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t a better father, but my creative mandate was a call of duty I couldn\u2019t ignore, the loudest call of duty of all\u2019. That mandate was to go into the darkness and emerge with something for the rest of us.\u201d</p> <p>How is he coping with his father\u2019s death? Is he still in grief? \u201cWell, it\u2019s more like disbelief than grief. I still can\u2019t believe that I don\u2019t have that source of wisdom to consult, and that I have to have imaginary conversations sometimes rather than real ones. But mostly it\u2019s just a case of missing one\u2019s old man.\u201d</p> <p>At times, <em>Thanks for the Dance</em> has an ambience that sounds almost haunted. It\u2019s there on the ghostly chorus of Puppets and, throughout, in the grain of Leonard\u2019s ageing voice. And, it is perhaps most evident on Listen to the Hummingbird, the short, spoken word piece that ends the album. Its serene sense of intimacy is surprising given the circumstances of its creation.</p> <p>\u201cHummingbird was actually recorded last,\u201d explains Adam. \u201cWe needed another song and I remembered that the last time my father spoke in public was at the press conference for the release of<em> You Want It Darker</em>. As he was prone to do, he recited a poem that he was working on. Impromptu.\u201d Adam managed to track down a recording of the recital from the vaults of Sony Records. \u201cIt\u2019s that vocal, recited in a halogen-lit press conference, that I manipulated to make it sound like a studio recording.\u201d</p> <p>If this is to be Cohen\u2019s final word as a recording artist \u2013 and his son insists that \u201cthere is no more material\u201d \u2013 it offers a wry last laugh from a man whose dark humour often went unappreciated. The last words on the final Leonard Cohen album are: \u201cListen to the hummingbird/ Don\u2019t listen to me.\u201d It is, says his son, \u201cvery modest, very Buddhist and very funny\u201d.

      "body": "<p>So what is new about Michael Greif\u2019s production of <strong><a href=\"https://dearevanhansen.com/london/#\" title=\"\">Dear Evan Hansen</a></strong>, the multi-garlanded Broadway hit, which has music and lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (<em>La La Land</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/20/the-greatest-showman-review-pt-barnum-hugh-jackman\" title=\"\">The Greatest Showman</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/20/the-greatest-showman-review-pt-barnum-hugh-jackman\" title=\"\">)</a> and a script by Steven Levenson? Most joyously, its British star. Sam Tutty, making his West End debut, is quiveringly good. Most strikingly, its bold weirdness in tackling the subject of grief tourism. Most hauntingly, its pervasive lack of ease: there is wit but no giant jolly sunbursts. The show is part of the current remaking of the musical: it murmurs as well as shouts, and contains as much social embarrassment as emotional turmoil.</p> <p><em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> is not the first musical to feature teenage pain and suicide: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/08/spring-awakening-wedekind-review\" title=\"\">Spring Awakening</a></em> (2006) had both. But this is a very 21st-century story: fuelled by social media (laptop screens slide across the stage), taking for granted a need for full confessionalism which will make some (me) queasy. The \u201closer\u201d hero, friendless and transfixed by anxiety, has his life transformed when he is thought to have been the confidant of a thuggish schoolfellow who has killed himself. He turns the misconception into a lie, consoling the dead boy\u2019s family by inventing a close friendship with their bullying son, and causing his own popularity to soar. At school everyone wants to claim closeness to the suicide, made glamorous by death: a cult develops, with badges, wristbands and fund-raising campaigns, and tweeting of fabricated emails. The creepiness and the comfort of this is especially well caught by Nicole Raquel Dennis, avid and lonely, and by Jack Loxton, comic and calculating like a teenage politician. It is a lie that at first brings happiness and then recoils on its perpetrator and his unwitting mother, played with fury and pain by Rebecca McKinnis.</p> <p>Until the soppy perfunctory ending \u2013 with hugs and instructions about being true to yourself \u2013 the evening is vivid with almost every kind of teenage and adult embarrassment and exclusion: parental desertion, paralysing shyness, sibling hatred, financial humiliation, even (newly fashionable) sweating. A few big ballads \u2013 notably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSfH2AuhXfw\" title=\"\">You Will Be Found</a> \u2013 land with an eyes-to-the-sky expansiveness. Yet often speech and song dip in and out of each other, interwoven in conversational melancholy, given a pulse of urgency by guitar strums. Tutty handles this expertly. He brims with all sorts of tiny violence: he plucks at his shirt; he squirms as if he\u2019s trying to escape his skin; his words are often explosive spurts. Yet every now and then his falsetto floats high above everything else, as if to show what Evan could be one day.</p> <p>Why stage <strong><a href=\"https://touchingthevoidplay.com/ticket-information/\" title=\"\">Touching the Void</a></strong>? Because it was there? It is obviously perverse to heave a mountain on to the stage without help of special effects, and to follow a tale of (literal) suspense when its ending is well known.</p> <p>Yet Tom Morris\u2019s Bristol Old Vic production, adapted by David Greig from Joe Simpson\u2019s book, excels. It dramatically projects Simpson\u2019s Andean ordeal: dropped with a broken leg into a crevasse when his climbing partner, assuming him dead, cut the rope from which he dangled. It dares the audience to ask themselves what they would do if trapped or holding the end of the rope. It makes a play about imaginative as well as physical endurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5af1b16eb97872afb13ce19437ce46e2947dd7e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5af1b16eb97872afb13ce19437ce46e2947dd7e3/0_0_4513_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Williams in Touching the Void.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"701\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A play about imaginative as well as physical endurance\u2019: Josh Williams in Touching the Void.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greig\u2019s adaptation is illuminating. He turns the voice in Simpson\u2019s head into a tormenting hallucination of his sister, who nags him to drag himself out of the abyss. He creates a nerdy non-climbing hippy who lightens the action. He catches an authentic-sounding bluff lingo: \u201cbit of a cheeky one\u201d, a climber says when faced with an impossible ascent. Fiona Hampton, Patrick McNamee, Josh Williams and Angus Yellowlees act with unshowy strength.</p> <p>Yet the triumph of Morris\u2019s production is to steer events primarily through Ti Green\u2019s set and Jon Nicholls\u2019s sound design. The mountain begins as an idea: a pile of rickety chairs and tables by the side of the proscenium arch. A peanut is held up against a table to give a sense of scale. Hampton turns this into a place of risk and achievement as, roped for climbing, she seeks a foothold on smooth surfaces, and eventually arrives giddyingly high above the stalls clinging to the proscenium arch \u2013 to applause. Then Simpson and his partner appear on what looks like a dinosaur\u2019s skeleton, a fragile structure swivelled sideways to the audience; around them is the noise of scrabbling scree and hoovering blasts of wind. The final scene is entirely realistic: a huge photograph of Siula Grande, looming white and chiselled and in front of it, a small orange tent, which glows like a night light in a freezing world. So the unthinkable is imagined and the imaginary becomes true. A story of survival and of the theatre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90d0a73c2cd6faeacbdfe8afdbd77c5f9a3a5d9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90d0a73c2cd6faeacbdfe8afdbd77c5f9a3a5d9e/0_381_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Hamilton Dyer as imprisoned journalist Can D\u00fcndar in #WeAreArrested.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Electric shrewdness\u2019: Peter Hamilton Dyer as imprisoned journalist Can D\u00fcndar in #WeAreArrested.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellie Merridale</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/whats-on/we-are-arrested/\" title=\"\">#WeAreArrested</a></strong>, a joint production with the RSC, has been adapted by Pippa Hill and Sophie Ivatts from the book by Can D\u00fcndar, editor-in-chief of a Turkish newspaper who was arrested in 2016 and charged with espionage, for publishing evidence that Turkish state intelligence had been secretly sending weapons into Syria.

She would get odd looks and long sighs from friends and family when she tried to explain that she didn\u2019t want gifts and wouldn\u2019t be buying any either. Christmas crackers \u2013 \u201ca horrible waste: a bang, some tat and then it\u2019s all chucked away\u201d \u2013 were banned at her home. Shiny wrapping paper (which can\u2019t be recycled) made way years ago for plain brown or newspaper, then, last December, she tried <a href=\"https://www.1millionwomen.com.au/blog/how-furoshiki-japanese-fabric-wrapping/\" title=\"\">furoshiki</a> \u2013 the Japanese art of fabric wrapping. Tandy\u2019s artificial tree will next month be wheeled out for its 31st Christmas, and will be decorated from a carefully stored box of decorations handmade or collected, one by one, over the years.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get to the end of Christmas Day and look around and feel like we\u2019d made a week\u2019s worth of waste in just a few hours,\u201d says Tandy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stomach it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48370e052389e65fb8f34c719d92fd33390a97fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48370e052389e65fb8f34c719d92fd33390a97fd/0_138_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wrapping presents in newspaper avoids much Christmas waste.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wrapping presents in newspaper avoids much Christmas waste.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photos by Sally Jane Photographic Art/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tandy, 50, works as an ethical financial adviser in Chester and lives with her husband and 22-year-old son. Eight years ago, she quit her job in mainstream banking and audited her life against her impact on the planet; she now runs sustainability workshops as a climate ambassador for the Women\u2019s Institute and a Friends of the Earth co-ordinator,</p> <p>\u201cBack then, people thought I was weird, but now they\u2019ve started to engage and talk differently. More people understand why it\u2019s not right for Christmas to become a consumerist nightmare. I\u2019m not religious at all but the pandemonium of sales and buying things for the sake of buying something goes against what the festive season is all about.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s safe to say that her husband and son weren\u2019t fully on board when Tandy first started scaling back on what she considered unnecessary waste. \u201cI\u2019ve dragged everyone along with me and in some ways they were kicking and screaming to start with, but they\u2019ve come to realise that we need less stuff and more time together. When I buy presents now, they\u2019re experiences, not objects\u201d.</p> <p>A Tandy-style family Christmas \u2013 more sustainable, less wasteful and better for the environment \u2013 might have seemed anachronistic or simply mean a few years ago but there are signs that many more families will be opting for an eco-friendly Christmas this year. Activists behind Buy Nothing Day and Green Friday, which both encourage supporters to spend nothing and celebrate sharing and mending instead, are mounting a direct challenge to the rampant commercial frenzy of this week\u2019s Black Friday. But can a growing backlash against buying really make a difference?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more about a personal sense of relief,\u201d says L\u00e9on Pearce, a 28-year-old sound engineer who lives with his musician wife, Rebecca Hawley, in Liverpool. Opting out and \u201cnot buying stuff I don\u2019t really need\u201d puts him more at ease with his conscience, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s as if something quite negative has just gone from my life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebfb38ed30fc536168284631f0fd7aebb9691ff9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebfb38ed30fc536168284631f0fd7aebb9691ff9/0_261_4191_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u00e9on Pearce and Rebecca Hawley at home in Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L\u00e9on Pearce and Rebecca Hawley at home in Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Howard Barlow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple are embarking on their first Buy Nothing Christmas this year. \u201cI haven\u2019t always been anti-consumerist,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil six months ago I was quite a clothes addict. I justified it to myself by never buying fast fashion and choosing more expensive stuff that would last a few years. But now I don\u2019t care so much about the latest clothing or trends, and I have much more money. I do miss browsing around shops looking at nice things, but just not enough.\u201d</p> <p>For their first Christmas together, four years ago, Pearce says he bought his wife lots of gifts. \u201cAll the presents were of a certain type. They probably weren\u2019t things that would get thrown away as that\u2019s never been my vibe, but it\u2019s definitely going to be different this year. It sounds really cheesy but the main gift is being together and committing to not working, because we both work a hell of a lot.

      "bodyText": "Everyone used to call Helen Tandy \u201cthe Grinch\u201d at Christmas. She would get odd looks and long sighs from friends and family when she tried to explain that she didn\u2019t want gifts and wouldn\u2019t be buying any either. Christmas crackers \u2013 \u201ca horrible waste: a bang, some tat and then it\u2019s all chucked away\u201d \u2013 were banned at her home. Shiny wrapping paper (which can\u2019t be recycled) made way years ago for plain brown or newspaper, then, last December, she tried furoshiki \u2013 the Japanese art of fabric wrapping. Tandy\u2019s artificial tree will next month be wheeled out for its 31st Christmas, and will be decorated from a carefully stored box of decorations handmade or collected, one by one, over the years. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get to the end of Christmas Day and look around and feel like we\u2019d made a week\u2019s worth of waste in just a few hours,\u201d says Tandy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stomach it.\u201d Tandy, 50, works as an ethical financial adviser in Chester and lives with her husband and 22-year-old son. Eight years ago, she quit her job in mainstream banking and audited her life against her impact on the planet; she now runs sustainability workshops as a climate ambassador for the Women\u2019s Institute and a Friends of the Earth co-ordinator, \u201cBack then, people thought I was weird, but now they\u2019ve started to engage and talk differently. More people understand why it\u2019s not right for Christmas to become a consumerist nightmare. I\u2019m not religious at all but the pandemonium of sales and buying things for the sake of buying something goes against what the festive season is all about.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say that her husband and son weren\u2019t fully on board when Tandy first started scaling back on what she considered unnecessary waste. \u201cI\u2019ve dragged everyone along with me and in some ways they were kicking and screaming to start with, but they\u2019ve come to realise that we need less stuff and more time together. When I buy presents now, they\u2019re experiences, not objects\u201d. A Tandy-style family Christmas \u2013 more sustainable, less wasteful and better for the environment \u2013 might have seemed anachronistic or simply mean a few years ago but there are signs that many more families will be opting for an eco-friendly Christmas this year. Activists behind Buy Nothing Day and Green Friday, which both encourage supporters to spend nothing and celebrate sharing and mending instead, are mounting a direct challenge to the rampant commercial frenzy of this week\u2019s Black Friday. But can a growing backlash against buying really make a difference? \u201cIt\u2019s more about a personal sense of relief,\u201d says L\u00e9on Pearce, a 28-year-old sound engineer who lives with his musician wife, Rebecca Hawley, in Liverpool. Opting out and \u201cnot buying stuff I don\u2019t really need\u201d puts him more at ease with his conscience, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s as if something quite negative has just gone from my life.\u201d The couple are embarking on their first Buy Nothing Christmas this year. \u201cI haven\u2019t always been anti-consumerist,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil six months ago I was quite a clothes addict. I justified it to myself by never buying fast fashion and choosing more expensive stuff that would last a few years. But now I don\u2019t care so much about the latest clothing or trends, and I have much more money. I do miss browsing around shops looking at nice things, but just not enough.\u201d For their first Christmas together, four years ago, Pearce says he bought his wife lots of gifts. \u201cAll the presents were of a certain type. They probably weren\u2019t things that would get thrown away as that\u2019s never been my vibe, but it\u2019s definitely going to be different this year. It sounds really cheesy but the main gift is being together and committing to not working, because we both work a hell of a lot. Ours are the sorts of jobs that take up your life rather than nine to five, so it\u2019ll be phones off and laptops off for a couple of days, That\u2019s more than enough.\u201d Pearce has been inspired in part by his involvement with Extinction Rebellion and a growing distaste for unsustainable consumption of \u201cstuff\u201d. \u201cWe both stopped buying from Amazon a few months ago, which was a new challenge, and I consciously began boycotting Black Friday three years ago. We always used to take advantage of Black Friday for work \u2013 buying audio and musical equipment, microphones and gadgets and that sort of thing.\u201d The couple have urged friends and family not to buy them anything or, \u201cif they really must, it has to be something edible or a bottle of wine we can all share rather than something wrapped in plastic wrapped in wrapping paper\u201d. Not having children, Pearce admits, makes having a green Christmas much easier. \u201cThe youngest person we would normally buy a gift for is 12, and in some ways he\u2019s the most supportive of what we\u2019re doing. He understands it.\u201d According to a study by waste management company Biffa, the UK creates 30% more waste than usual over Christmas. This includes an estimated 227,000 miles of wrapping paper and 114,000 tonnes of plastic packaging. Retailers may well not welcome this shift.

Maud Barrett, 36, a textile artist originally from Paris who now runs a social enterprise in south London teaching DIY and crafting skills, says it is becoming clear that \u201cwasteful accumulation of things\u201d can\u2019t be considered the norm for much longer. \u201cIt\u2019s a pressure,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has an impact on your wellbeing.

I do this delicately, since, like funfair goldfish or those waterproof watches you can buy at the airport, halloumi comes sealed in a bag of liquid, as if the poor cheese was in a rush to reach you and has lost a good part of its weight in sweat. I slice the spongy, cuboid form and let its segments slap and sizzle into the pan, where its edges turn from brilliant, Tipp-Ex white to a golden yellow.

At least, that was the case until Cyprus lost the trademark to its name earlier this year, owing to mismanagement of the filings for this registration in the UK \u2013 a feat of incompetence which prompted an investigation by the Cypriot Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Tourism, still ongoing. Whatever the legal rubrics, however, the island of Cyprus is still the only place on Earth where \u201cauthentic\u201d halloumi can be found, and this small Mediterranean island, with less than a million inhabitants, is tasked with supplying the entire global demand for the un-melting cheese.</p> <p>And that demand is huge. The past decade has seen it go from being an inside favourite of London\u2019s Cypriot diaspora to a fixture on the menus of Nando\u2019s, Burger King and your barbecue-mad Uncle Gary if he thinks a vegetarian might pop round. It has grown so popular, in fact, that experts warn demand will shortly outstrip supply.</p> <p>I was brought up on a Northern Irish diet so epicureally indifferent that Babybels were considered a somewhat exotic cheese. My father still talks of the time some Spanish cousins came to visit and could only find olive oil in a pharmacy, where it was kept on hand to unblock ears. This was, he assures me, around 1994 or so. I came to regard halloumi as an intoxicating new delicacy when I moved to London. For Heard and most other London Cypriots, however, halloumi was a constant presence, and one whose bewildering rise to popularity is hard to pinpoint in time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5237283bbb3174b8bb2a9afe63e5d19421274233\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5237283bbb3174b8bb2a9afe63e5d19421274233/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Very bleat: a Cypriot herder milks a goat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Very bleat: a Cypriot herder milks a goat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emily Irving-Swift/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen halloumi started coming to the UK market in a bigger way,\u201d he says, \u201cI was like, \u2018What the hell is happening?\u2019 It was slightly bizarre because my grandma and my great-grandma sent over little tinfoil wrappers \u2013 which I think a lot of Cypriots in London can identify with \u2013 filled with cheese, in the post.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst time I heard about the shortage was about six months ago,\u201d says chef Selin Kiazim, a north Londoner of Turkish-Cypriot parents, who owns and operates Shoreditch Turkish restaurant <a href=\"https://www.oklava.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Oklava</a>. \u201cIt was always a staple at home,\u201d she tells me, \u201cI\u2019d even get annoyed at my mum, opening the fridge saying, \u2018Why \u2013 why is it always halloumi and no other cheeses?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s always been there,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/apr/26/anna-jones-30-minute-recipes\" title=\"\">Anna Jones</a>, food writer, stylist and vegetarian cook. \u201cThe parts of London that I\u2019ve lived in have always had strong Greek and Turkish communities, so there is generally a bit more halloumi in the shops when that\u2019s the case. It was maybe 2005/6 when I remember seeing it around more.\u201d</p> <p>According to the Cyprus Trade Centre, global halloumi shipments more than doubled in the years between 2013 and 2017, from \u00a366.4 million to \u00a3140 million. Of that figure, more than 40% went to the UK, making us by some distance the world\u2019s largest buyer of the cheese.

I do this delicately, since, like funfair goldfish or those waterproof watches you can buy at the airport, halloumi comes sealed in a bag of liquid, as if the poor cheese was in a rush to reach you and has lost a good part of its weight in sweat. I slice the spongy, cuboid form and let its segments slap and sizzle into the pan, where its edges turn from brilliant, Tipp-Ex white to a golden yellow. The rectangles don\u2019t melt so much as separate at each end, until each resembles something like a chubby letter H, or an artist\u2019s representation of a chromosome. Halloumi has been a consistent part of my diet for most of the nine years I\u2019ve been in London. Its appeal is in its zesty tang and its odd, formless texture. That tooth-satisfying squish and give that makes it readily applicable to so many methods of cooking; barbecued in strips, cooked with a salad, or positioned as a meat substitute wherever needed. Alas, there are mounting alarms that the world\u2019s halloumi stocks are now at risk and it turns out, much like that one Joni Mitchell song that predicted the death of parks but not the decline of centralised taxi services, we really don\u2019t know what we\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone. \u201cI could see it coming,\u201d Anthony Heard, who is half-Cypriot, tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s why I started the business.

      "body": "<p>For <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-rylance\" title=\"\">Mark Rylance</a>, the opportunity to track down the truth about his late grandfather\u2019s wartime life seemed a way to get closer to the memory of a loved family member. But delving into that past has also accentuated a painful gulf between them.</p> <p>\u201cI knew him very well, but there was a lot I hadn\u2019t heard about, though I\u2019d suspected some of it,\u201d the Oscar-winning star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/23/dunkirk-review-terrifyingly-immersive-christopher-nolan\" title=\"\"><em>Dunkirk</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/29/bridge-of-spies-review-tom-hanks-mark-rylance-steven-spielberg\" title=\"\"><em>Bridge of Spies</em></a> told the <em>Observer</em> before the broadcast of a television documentary that will follow his journey of discovery. \u201cI understand his feelings about the Japanese better now, although I can\u2019t agree with them.\u201d</p> <p>The acclaimed actor and anti-war campaigner agreed to join forces with the team making <em>My Grandparents\u2019 War</em>, a four-part Channel 4 series marking the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict, because he wanted to learn more about his mother\u2019s father, Osmond Skinner, and to understand his prejudices, as well as the reasons for his later reticence to talk about the second world war. Rylance knew he had been held prisoner in a Japanese camp, but heard little of the atrocities he witnessed or the hardships endured.</p> <p>Painting a largely bleak picture of Skinner\u2019s prison camp days, the programme-makers unearth one secret of a much happier kind: Rylance learns that his grandfather also loved acting and took part in several amateur productions as a PoW.</p> <p>\u201cI knew he had been involved in concert parties and had dressed up; but acting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/18/twelfth-night-richard-iii-review\" title=\"\">Shakespeare\u2019s <em>Twelfth Night</em></a>, which I did myself in the West End later, meant there was an odd synchronicity,\u201d said Rylance. \u201cHe must have taken it seriously too, because there was a line someone had noted down about \u2018Skinner coming to blows\u2019 in one production. It has never quite come to that for me, but these were all revelations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1ad038157da3c26aa4f58d7f1b971ba68eb3ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ad038157da3c26aa4f58d7f1b971ba68eb3ae3/227_257_3246_1947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rylance\u2019s grandfather Osmond Skinner, grandmother Hazel, mother Anne and uncle Richard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rylance\u2019s grandfather Osmond Skinner, grandmother Hazel, mother Anne and uncle Richard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Pictures/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the crueller details of those years are revealed for the first time by the documentary because Rylance\u2019s beloved \u201cOs\u201d had drawn a veil over the period to protect himself and his family. \u201cOften you find that generation don\u2019t like to talk about it much,\u201d said Rylance, who has a strong interest in Japanese culture. \u201cIt was difficult for us both later when I got very obsessed with the work of the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/31/ran-review-re-release-of-kurasawas-dark-epic-version-of-king-lear\" title=\"\">Akira Kurosawa</a> and the films of the actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/04/toshiro-mifune-star-wars-turned-down-obi-wan-kenobi-and-darth-vader-roles\" title=\"\">Toshiro Mifune</a>. He would become very quiet and look distressed, and then say: \u2018I am sorry about this, old chap. I feel an absolute failure because I can\u2019t forgive them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The reluctance of survivors to speak to relatives about wartime experiences is a central theme of the series, which starts on Wednesday. Rylance\u2019s story follows Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s; further episodes feature Carey Mulligan and Kristin Scott Thomas.</p> <p>Confronted with evidence of the cruelty of his grandfather\u2019s captors, Rylance found he was unable to condemn them as evil. Instead, he questioned the moral cover given by the Geneva Convention and the concept of fairness in warfare. There is no distinction, he will say controversially to camera, between \u201cwar criminals and non-war criminals\u201d, adding that: \u201cI think that\u2019s all a con to get young people to sign up, as if it will be a civilised thing they\u2019re going to. I don\u2019t believe it at all.\u201d</p> <p>Rylance is sorry, he said this weekend, if his comments offend those who watch the documentary: \u201cMy apologies go to viewers with survivors of Japanese camps in their family if they are upset by what I say about forgiveness. I don\u2019t want to disrespect them in any way, but we should not think that the enemy are the only brutal ones.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c7152e66fb16cc3d24a3311bb498293de5dea4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c7152e66fb16cc3d24a3311bb498293de5dea4b/0_97_3232_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rylance with his father David Waters outside HSBC bank in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rylance with his father David Waters outside HSBC bank in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wild Pictures/Wild Pictures/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Skinner, the son of a London grocer, was working for a bank in Hong Kong when war broke out. He had previously served in the Royal Air Force and so, at the age of 42, he signed up to join a volunteer regiment defending the British-controlled territory from the Japanese.</p> <p>\u201cOut of a sense of duty to the people of Hong Kong, or to Empire, he took up arms,\u201d said Rylance this weekend. \u201cSome of them were elderly. I don\u2019t know what Winston Churchill was thinking, sending all these civilians up against the Japanese forces. That black Christmas morning the Japanese came down the mountain towards the seaside port of Stanley and more than half of the volunteers died.\u201d</p> <p>The actor was also surprised by the \u201cimperial tone\u201d of government propaganda, urging British subjects to fight with phrases such as \u201cThe Empire is Watching You\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cJapan had been allies in the first world war, after all,\u201d said Rylance, \u201cand my own grandfather had lived there, in Kobe, for six years earlier, sending his family down to Australia while he worked in Hong Kong.\u201d</p> <p>Skinner was shot that Christmas Day and then spent almost four years as a PoW, suffering torture and the harsh living conditions that scarred him mentally. \u201cHe told me he witnessed atrocities that Christmas Day and in prison, yet he felt lucky as he was not sent to the Burma Road because he was older and short. That saved his life,\u201d said his grandson.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don't think grandfather would agree with everything I say, but I think he would be interested</p> <footer> <cite>Mark Rylance</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The actor\u2019s anti-war position now influences his choice of parts, he said, as does his dislike of violence: \u201cIt is not that I think art and entertainment should always be educational, and it is not that I want things to be censored either. It is more that films and plays should be honest about the impact of these actions.\u201d</p> <p>Holding art to high moral standards can be difficult, Rylance said, but red lines should be drawn by each actor. He saluted the Royal Shakespeare Company for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/shortcuts/2019/oct/08/bp-shakespeare-rsc-mark-rylance-simon-callow\" title=\"\">stepping away from the sponsorship of oil companies</a>, something he had protested against, dropping his own associations with the organisation.</p> <p>\u201cI am very pleased they are not now linking either their excellent work, or the name of Shakespeare, with those companies. I know these corporations say they are changing, but they are not doing enough. And what they are doing every day is really worse than murder. It has gone beyond the point where they should be allowed to lie about it.\u201d</p> <p>As a boy, Rylance became close to Skinner when staying in his Sussex home, \u201ca kind of paradise with an orchard\u201d, and he now wishes he could talk to him again about the big moral issues. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would agree with everything I say, but I think he would be interested. We would share a faith, I think, that there is goodness in people.</p> <p>\u201cOs was a very just man, but he had been through something terrible.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Mark Rylance, the opportunity to track down the truth about his late grandfather\u2019s wartime life seemed a way to get closer to the memory of a loved family member. But delving into that past has also accentuated a painful gulf between them. \u201cI knew him very well, but there was a lot I hadn\u2019t heard about, though I\u2019d suspected some of it,\u201d the Oscar-winning star of Dunkirk and Bridge of Spies told the Observer before the broadcast of a television documentary that will follow his journey of discovery. \u201cI understand his feelings about the Japanese better now, although I can\u2019t agree with them.\u201d The acclaimed actor and anti-war campaigner agreed to join forces with the team making My Grandparents\u2019 War, a four-part Channel 4 series marking the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict, because he wanted to learn more about his mother\u2019s father, Osmond Skinner, and to understand his prejudices, as well as the reasons for his later reticence to talk about the second world war. Rylance knew he had been held prisoner in a Japanese camp, but heard little of the atrocities he witnessed or the hardships endured. Painting a largely bleak picture of Skinner\u2019s prison camp days, the programme-makers unearth one secret of a much happier kind: Rylance learns that his grandfather also loved acting and took part in several amateur productions as a PoW. \u201cI knew he had been involved in concert parties and had dressed up; but acting in Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth Night, which I did myself in the West End later, meant there was an odd synchronicity,\u201d said Rylance. \u201cHe must have taken it seriously too, because there was a line someone had noted down about \u2018Skinner coming to blows\u2019 in one production. It has never quite come to that for me, but these were all revelations.\u201d Many of the crueller details of those years are revealed for the first time by the documentary because Rylance\u2019s beloved \u201cOs\u201d had drawn a veil over the period to protect himself and his family. \u201cOften you find that generation don\u2019t like to talk about it much,\u201d said Rylance, who has a strong interest in Japanese culture. \u201cIt was difficult for us both later when I got very obsessed with the work of the director Akira Kurosawa and the films of the actor Toshiro Mifune. He would become very quiet and look distressed, and then say: \u2018I am sorry about this, old chap. I feel an absolute failure because I can\u2019t forgive them.\u2019\u201d The reluctance of survivors to speak to relatives about wartime experiences is a central theme of the series, which starts on Wednesday. Rylance\u2019s story follows Helena Bonham Carter\u2019s; further episodes feature Carey Mulligan and Kristin Scott Thomas. Confronted with evidence of the cruelty of his grandfather\u2019s captors, Rylance found he was unable to condemn them as evil. Instead, he questioned the moral cover given by the Geneva Convention and the concept of fairness in warfare. There is no distinction, he will say controversially to camera, between \u201cwar criminals and non-war criminals\u201d, adding that: \u201cI think that\u2019s all a con to get young people to sign up, as if it will be a civilised thing they\u2019re going to. I don\u2019t believe it at all.\u201d Rylance is sorry, he said this weekend, if his comments offend those who watch the documentary: \u201cMy apologies go to viewers with survivors of Japanese camps in their family if they are upset by what I say about forgiveness. I don\u2019t want to disrespect them in any way, but we should not think that the enemy are the only brutal ones.\u201d Skinner, the son of a London grocer, was working for a bank in Hong Kong when war broke out. He had previously served in the Royal Air Force and so, at the age of 42, he signed up to join a volunteer regiment defending the British-controlled territory from the Japanese. \u201cOut of a sense of duty to the people of Hong Kong, or to Empire, he took up arms,\u201d said Rylance this weekend. \u201cSome of them were elderly. I don\u2019t know what Winston Churchill was thinking, sending all these civilians up against the Japanese forces. That black Christmas morning the Japanese came down the mountain towards the seaside port of Stanley and more than half of the volunteers died.\u201d The actor was also surprised by the \u201cimperial tone\u201d of government propaganda, urging British subjects to fight with phrases such as \u201cThe Empire is Watching You\u201d. \u201cJapan had been allies in the first world war, after all,\u201d said Rylance, \u201cand my own grandfather had lived there, in Kobe, for six years earlier, sending his family down to Australia while he worked in Hong Kong.\u201d Skinner was shot that Christmas Day and then spent almost four years as a PoW, suffering torture and the harsh living conditions that scarred him mentally. \u201cHe told me he witnessed atrocities that Christmas Day and in prison, yet he felt lucky as he was not sent to the Burma Road because he was older and short. That saved his life,\u201d said his grandson. The actor\u2019s anti-war position now influences his choice of parts, he said, as does his dislike of violence: \u201cIt is not that I think art and entertainment should always be educational, and it is not that I want things to be censored either. It is more that films and plays should be honest about the impact of these actions.\u201d Holding art to high moral standards can be difficult, Rylance said, but red lines should be drawn by each actor. He saluted the Royal Shakespeare Company for stepping away from the sponsorship of oil companies, something he had protested against, dropping his own associations with the organisation. \u201cI am very pleased they are not now linking either their excellent work, or the name of Shakespeare, with those companies. I know these corporations say they are changing, but they are not doing enough. And what they are doing every day is really worse than murder. It has gone beyond the point where they should be allowed to lie about it.\u201d As a boy, Rylance became close to Skinner when staying in his Sussex home, \u201ca kind of paradise with an orchard\u201d, and he now wishes he could talk to him again about the big moral issues. \u201cI don\u2019t think he would agree with everything I say, but I think he would be interested. We would share a faith, I think, that there is goodness in people. \u201cOs was a very just man, but he had been through something terrible.\u201d",

Which brings me to the other main gripe my wife has about that picture. She\u2019s long maintained I chose it because I, and I alone, looked moderately handsome in it, even though it made my son look like an alien that\u2019s just received an unexpectedly large gas bill. This is a charge I can\u2019t really defend myself against. Primarily because I have admitted many times in person, and at least once in this very column, that this is precisely what happened. My defence is twofold: First, since I am the one who actually writes these articles, I should be allowed to use my beauty to promote their contents (and vice versa). Second, if someone takes 400 pictures of me then, yes, I am going to pick the most handsome one, whether my son looks like a half-digested turnip in it or not. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised this is even a discussion. I need the help; he doesn\u2019t. Babies are an aesthetic free hit. I, on the other hand, have about four angles that work for me, roughly once a fortnight, and usually while catching my impeccable male model-like reflection during night-time tube trips. Sidebar: I have never worked out if I do actually look super great in the darkened echo of night tube windows, or if the fact I\u2019m on the tube at night means I\u2019m sufficiently pissed to regard myself with a smirking, \u2018Hmmm you still got it.\u2019 In the end, my son did everything he could to replicate his first shoot, spending an hour plaintively wailing as if each snap of the flashbulb was a precursor to the entrance of a firing squad. But, it all came good with the shot you see before you \u2013 me sporting a sassy little kink in my hip, he with the folded hands of a gentle little cartoon church mouse. Perhaps there\u2019s room in the family for two models after all. Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter @shockproofbeats",

Roughly one in every dozen air passengers was British. Britons took to the skies 126.2m times in 2018, beating Americans and Chinese people into second and third place. Needless to say, this comes at an environmental price.</p> <p>The UK aviation industry pumped 37m tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere last year alone.

By \u201cnet zero\u201d this means that any greenhouse gases that are still used will have to be offset in some way.

However, the temptation of local farmers to cut down tropical rainforest to plant palm trees to sell to the fuel companies has seen airlines withdraw pretty quickly from that route. Instead British Airways and a number of others are turning to something that we make far too much of every day: rubbish.</p> <p>The fuel produced by chemically processing this rubbish is an artificial kerosine. Present rules allow it to be mixed in a 50/50 ratio with fossil kerosine. This is unlikely to change because the fossil kerosine contains naturally occurring chemicals that cause the rubber seals on a jet engine to swell, making them tight. Engine manufacturers rely on this process to make the engines Safe. Artificial kerosine does not contain these special molecules in anything like the same quantity and so cannot be used exclusively in current engines.</p> <p>Even if they could, Tim Johnson is sceptical that Safs would make a real difference. Last year, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rutherdan/status/1182676188159827969?s=20\" title=\"\">7m </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rutherdan/status/1182676188159827969?s=20\" title=\"\">litres</a> were used on flights. \u201cThat sounds like a reasonable amount by volume but it\u2019s enough to power the global aviation industry for 10 minutes,\u201d he says, \u201cso in terms of scaling up Safs, we\u2019re a long way from making that a reality.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The airlines make\u00a0money through volume. This means the growth of the industry is essential</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Added to this, they are twice the price of ordinary kerosine \u2013 a cost airlines may have to pass on to their passengers.</p> <p>There are other things that airlines and aircraft designers may be able to do to increase carbon efficiency. More effective air traffic control could prevent aircraft having to take detours to avoid congested skyways. Better wing design could reduce the drag of aircraft. Better carbon fibre manufacturing techniques could result in lighter airframes. And airlines could always squeeze more seats in. All of these together can offer small percentage-level improvements that will contribute towards reaching the 2050 target.</p> <p>It remains a big challenge, however, with a lot of risk. A delay in any one of the proposed technologies coming online, such as the electric engines or the sustainable aviation fuels, could torpedo any hope of hitting the net zero carbon emissions the law requires by 2050. If it becomes clear during the next decade that the target is unreachable on the current trajectory, some real pain may have to be endured by the industry and the people who use it.</p> <p>At the heart of the predicament is the fact that the airlines operate on very small profit margins, making their money through volume. This means that the growth of the industry is essential, yet this very growth is the chief obstacle in halting the environmental impact. At present, technological innovation is delivering a 1% per annum saving in carbon efficiency, but this is completely outstripped by the industry growing at 4-5% a year.</p> <p>Unfortunately, says Johnson, carbon offsetting schemes are little more than a temporary fix. Those schemes rely on some form of preserving or planting trees, but as the 2050 deadline approaches, all the countries we traditionally use for carbon offsetting, such as India, China and others in South America, are going to need those hectares to offset their own rising carbon emissions.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the fundamental obstacle to us reaching our environmental objective,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIf this industry were static in terms of people flying, all the improvements we\u2019ve discussed would be improving the industry on an annual basis.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"610172330122c529bd8eff53d54413aea4d54a9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/610172330122c529bd8eff53d54413aea4d54a9e/322_0_9375_5628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eviation Alice prototype\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eviation Alice was unveiled at this year\u2019s Paris air show.

And that means only one thing according to Johnson: restricting the demand for air travel. It\u2019s a conversation that an increasing number of people may already be having with themselves. The Swedish concept of <em>flygskam</em> or \u201cflight shame\u201d entered the lexicon this year. The Swiss bank UBS surveyed 6,000 people in the US, Germany, France and the UK and found that 21% of respondents said they had cut the number of flights they took during the last 12 months.</p> <p>A 2014 survey of 1,000 UK residents revealed that just <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/do-15-people-take-70-flights/\" title=\"\">15% of Britons were </a><a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/do-15-people-take-70-flights/\" title=\"\">responsible for 70% of flights</a> and this led to calls for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/24/frequent-flyers-could-face-extra-tax-under-plans-to-cut-emissions\" title=\"\">frequent flyer tax</a>. Some sort of carbon pricing scheme has also been suggested by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ETC_energy\" title=\"\">Energy Transitions Commission</a> (ETC), an international organisation dedicated to roadmapping ways to a low carbon future. Under such schemes, carbon could be priced at up to \u00a3200 per tonne, and a proportionate contribution added to each plane ticket.</p> <p>Even if passengers in the west do think more carefully about flying, and the price of tickets goes up to deter them further, the decrease in passenger numbers will probably be outstripped by rising demand in developing economies such as India and China. That means globally the number of us flying will still rise, and that means to achieve net zero by 2050, airlines may have to expand into the carbon capture market, developing commercial technology to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere.</p> <p>Such technologies do exist but they are small-scale devices used to keep the air breathable on submarines and spacecraft. To scale these up to something capable of making a global impact will require serious investment in green startup companies and probably government incentives. To delay the investment in this technology almost certainly means having to abandon net zero carbon emissions by 2050, or the introduction of draconian measures to limit air travel in the coming decade, no matter what economic damage that does to the aviation industry.</p> <p>When it comes to aviation and the environment, one thing is certain, says Johnson. \u201cWe are going to have to have difficult conversations about how we hit our net zero targets.\u201d </p>",

That means globally the number of us flying will still rise, and that means to achieve net zero by 2050, airlines may have to expand into the carbon capture market, developing commercial technology to pull CO2 out of the atmosphere. Such technologies do exist but they are small-scale devices used to keep the air breathable on submarines and spacecraft. To scale these up to something capable of making a global impact will require serious investment in green startup companies and probably government incentives. To delay the investment in this technology almost certainly means having to abandon net zero carbon emissions by 2050, or the introduction of draconian measures to limit air travel in the coming decade, no matter what economic damage that does to the aviation industry. When it comes to aviation and the environment, one thing is certain, says Johnson. \u201cWe are going to have to have difficult conversations about how we hit our net zero targets.\u201d",

Warren unveiled a series of ambitious social policy plans designed to please leftists, and some of us <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/04/elizabeth-warrens-excellent-ideas\">praised</a> her promises to levy new taxes on wealth, expand childcare and give workers new power within their companies. In debates, the more centrist candidates accused both Warren and Sanders of being too radical. Warren memorably snapped back at those who ran for president to tell the country that change was impossible.</p> <p>It\u2019s been difficult for progressives to know what to make of Warren. She\u2019s been antagonizing the super-rich, but some of them <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/23/20916138/wall-street-elizabeth-warren-supporters-donald-trump\">also seem fond of her</a>, perhaps because <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathanJRobinson/status/1187011003810222080\">they recognize</a> that her regulatory proposals are actually a modest and pragmatic way of staving off a populist revolution. She has long been attacked for supporting Medicare for All, but she has also been troublingly vague about the details in ways that left single-payer proponents unsure whether she was with them or against them. (Harry Reid, having been Warren\u2019s colleague in the Senate, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Robillard/status/1183190368436850688\">said</a> she would probably ditch single-payer when she was actually in office, in favor of something more \u201cpragmatic\u201d.)</p> <p>But lately, Warren has finally begun to make her true feelings clear, and progressives no longer need to wonder whether she\u2019s with us or not. She\u2019s not. Warren released a Medicare for All plan that called it a \u201clong-term\u201d plan, which leftwing political analyst Ben Studebaker <a href=\"https://benjaminstudebaker.com/2019/11/05/elizabeth-warrens-medicare-for-all-plan-is-pretend/\">pointed out</a> is \u201ccode to rich people for \u2018this is all pretend\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Warren <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/11/19/elizabeth-warren-gives-up-on-medicare-for-all/\">confirmed</a> that while in theory she supported single-payer healthcare, it would not be one of her primary initiatives, and she would initially push for a more moderate proposal similar to those advocated by Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg. Political analysts quickly saw Warren\u2019s statement for what it was: an <a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2019/11/elizabeth-warren-health-care-transition-medicare-for-all.html\">admission that she did not really intend to pass single-payer at all</a>. Doug Henwood <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/11/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all-m4a-wall-street-insurance\">noted</a> that Barclays bank put out an analysis assuring Wall Street that Warren\u2019s plan to put off Medicare for All until late in the first term \u201cdecreases the likelihood that this plan comes to fruition\u201d. So much for <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/big-structural-change-weve-done-it-before-and-we-can-do-it-again-c9a042ed8b59\">big structural change</a>.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s foreign policy. Warren has <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/05/elizabeth-warren-foreign-policy\">never been particularly progressive on foreign policy</a>, or even shown much interest in it at all. She has defended US military aid to Israel, and infamously, when Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in Gaza, killing thousands of Palestinians including children playing on the beach, <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/21890/elizabeth-warren-war-military-iran-north-korea-venezuela-bernie-sanders\">Warren spoke up for</a> \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to defend itself\u201d.</p> <p>Recently Warren has given progressives even more cause for alarm. Instead of condemning an obvious rightwing coup in Bolivia (as Bernie Sanders did), and denouncing the seizure of power by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/16/world/americas/bolivia-anez-morales.html\">Christian theocrats</a>, Warren gave a tepid statement that recognized the legitimacy of the country\u2019s new \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1196519189583974402\">interim leadership</a>\u201d. On Venezuela, Warren\u2019s statements were even worse; she recently told Pod Save America<em> </em>that she believes the US should recognize the leader of the opposition as the legitimate president, and should maintain the sanctions that economist Jeffrey Sachs <a href=\"http://cepr.net/press-center/press-releases/report-finds-us-sanctions-on-venezuela-are-responsible-for-tens-of-thousands-of-deaths\">has said</a> \u201care deliberately aiming to wreck Venezuela\u2019s economy and thereby lead to regime change\u201d.

Foreign policy is one of the most important parts of a president\u2019s role. A president who is not a progressive in their dealings with the rest of the world is not a progressive at all. US policy has the potential to destroy lives and undermine popular movements, or to save lives and support those movements. It is critical to have a president who will take on human rights abusers like Saudi Arabia and Israel, and who will stand up for authentic democracy around the world. Nobody on the left can support someone who casually supports the Trump administration\u2019s crippling sanctions, who excuses the wanton killing of Palestinians, and who declines to call a military coup a military coup.</p> <p>It is helpful, at least, that we can now see more clearly the distinction between Warren and Sanders. She is not just a more wonkish and pragmatic advocate of the same politics. The politics themselves are very different.

Everyman\u2019s Library did not publish just obvious works that might appeal, such as Dickens or Shakespeare, but such \u201clengthy and intimidating\u201d works as George Grote\u2019s 12-volume <em>History of Greece</em> and six volumes of Ibsen, all of which found a ready audience. Such reading provided not just cultural ballast but political hope, too, revealing the possibility of new worlds, and expanding horizons that might have been limited by the factory or the mine. \u201cThe Labour movement,\u201d a Coventry millworker observed, \u201cgrew out of mutual improvement societies.\u201d</p> <p>It was a tradition sustained by communities that helped cultivate dignity, organisations that nurtured the spirit of self-improvement, collective struggles that enlarged the range of the possible. Much of that has disappeared. The dislocation of working-class communities, the destruction of Labour movement organisations and the expunging of trade union struggles have all unstitched the relationship between knowledge and political change.</p> <p>Education today, as the political scientist David Runciman has observed, \u201csorts us according to where we feel we belong\u201d.

Another triumph of the autodidact tradition was the Everyman\u2019s Library, launched in 1906 by J\u2009M Dent, the 10th child of a Darlington house-painter, who left school aged 13, became a bookbinder and eventually a publisher, whose dream had always been to ensure that \u201cfor a few shillings the reader may have a whole bookshelf of the immortals\u201d. Everyman\u2019s Library did not publish just obvious works that might appeal, such as Dickens or Shakespeare, but such \u201clengthy and intimidating\u201d works as George Grote\u2019s 12-volume History of Greece and six volumes of Ibsen, all of which found a ready audience. Such reading provided not just cultural ballast but political hope, too, revealing the possibility of new worlds, and expanding horizons that might have been limited by the factory or the mine. \u201cThe Labour movement,\u201d a Coventry millworker observed, \u201cgrew out of mutual improvement societies.\u201d It was a tradition sustained by communities that helped cultivate dignity, organisations that nurtured the spirit of self-improvement, collective struggles that enlarged the range of the possible. Much of that has disappeared. The dislocation of working-class communities, the destruction of Labour movement organisations and the expunging of trade union struggles have all unstitched the relationship between knowledge and political change. Education today, as the political scientist David Runciman has observed, \u201csorts us according to where we feel we belong\u201d. As western societies have become more technocratic, \u201cempowering a new class of experts, for whom education is a prerequisite of entry into the elite\u201d \u2013 bankers, lawyers, doctors, civil servants, pundits, academics \u2013 so knowledge no longer seems to \u201cspeak for itself\u201d but \u201cfor the world view of the people who possess it\u201d. Knowledge, instead, becomes a marker of the place one possesses in society. This has led one side to deride \u201cexperts\u201d, the other to view the electorate as ignorant and incapable of deep reasoning. That a 40-year-old debate is more clarifying about Brexit than one held last week reveals the degree to which politics has become hollowed out. We should take care that the contempt shown to the electorate does not become a self-fulfilling prophecy. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

They reportedly regarded the Mughals, India\u2019s imperial rulers from the 16th to the 19th century, as \u201ccommon as dirt\u201d and considered \u201cordinariness not just a crime [but] a sin!\u201d.</p> <p>Their subsequent lives of poverty in Malcha Mahal, a dilapidated palace in jungle outside the city, were considered a physical representation of the trauma, devastation and cruelty India suffered through partition at the hands of British. Except it turns out that the carefully crafted family legend was a sensational lie: these were not descendants of the royal house of Oudh. They were simply imposters.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/world/asia/the-jungle-prince-of-delhi.html\" title=\"\">An astonishing story published last week in </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/world/asia/the-jungle-prince-of-delhi.html\" title=\"\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/world/asia/the-jungle-prince-of-delhi.html\" title=\"\">New York Times</a></em>, by journalist Ellen Barry tells how after four years of work in India and Pakistan as well as Bradford, West Yorkshire, she discovered that the family legend was simply made up.</p> <p>\u201cI had become curious,\u201d Barry wrote,\u201d \u2026 about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest \u2013 about who they were.\u201d The tangled web of lies and eccentricity she uncovered has since gone viral.</p> <p>Begum Wilayat arrived at New Delhi station in the early 1970s and occupied a VIP waiting room with her dogs, servants and two children, demanding that the state return to her the looted wealth and property of her ancestors. Refusing to move, she squatted in the room, furnishing it with rugs and antiques, for almost 10 years before being granted Malcha Mahal, a 14th-century hunting lodge in thick forest south-west of the city. \u201cWilayat announced to the world that she was the Queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed,\u201d wrote Barry. \u201cAn ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.\u201d</p> <p>Her Royal Highness, as she was called, moved into the palatial ruin in 1985 and would give rare, eccentric interviews in which she and her children would rail against the injustices of the British and Indian governments. They died in poverty: Begum was alleged to have committed suicide in the 1990s by drinking poison mixed with powdered diamonds and pearls. Sakina apparently died in 2016, and Cyrus, Barry\u2019s key contact and friend, died alone, reportedly of dengue fever, in late 2017.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no nice way to put this,\u201d wrote Barry. \u201cI\u2019m unravelling a story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn\u2019t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him.\u201d</p> <p>In her pursuit of the truth, Barry discovered that Wilayat had, before partition, been in fact the widow of a civil servant, Inayatullah Butt, in Lucknow, former capital of the Oudh region. She had been admitted to a Lahore mental hospital after her husband died, and later announced that she was Queen of Oudh.</p> <p>While her younger children simply believed her, Wilayat\u2019s eldest son, Shahid Butt, left for England in his teens and secretly sent money to support the family. He died at home in Bradford earlier this month, holding his wife\u2019s hand.</p> <p>\u201cThey were so convincing, and so insistent,\u201d wrote Barry, \u201cthat for 40 years people believed them.\u201d</p>",

They reportedly regarded the Mughals, India\u2019s imperial rulers from the 16th to the 19th century, as \u201ccommon as dirt\u201d and considered \u201cordinariness not just a crime [but] a sin!\u201d. Their subsequent lives of poverty in Malcha Mahal, a dilapidated palace in jungle outside the city, were considered a physical representation of the trauma, devastation and cruelty India suffered through partition at the hands of British. Except it turns out that the carefully crafted family legend was a sensational lie: these were not descendants of the royal house of Oudh. They were simply imposters. An astonishing story published last week in the New York Times, by journalist Ellen Barry tells how after four years of work in India and Pakistan as well as Bradford, West Yorkshire, she discovered that the family legend was simply made up. \u201cI had become curious,\u201d Barry wrote,\u201d \u2026 about how a family with wealth and status had become lost in the forest \u2013 about who they were.\u201d The tangled web of lies and eccentricity she uncovered has since gone viral. Begum Wilayat arrived at New Delhi station in the early 1970s and occupied a VIP waiting room with her dogs, servants and two children, demanding that the state return to her the looted wealth and property of her ancestors. Refusing to move, she squatted in the room, furnishing it with rugs and antiques, for almost 10 years before being granted Malcha Mahal, a 14th-century hunting lodge in thick forest south-west of the city. \u201cWilayat announced to the world that she was the Queen of Oudh, demanding the vast properties of a kingdom that no longer existed,\u201d wrote Barry. \u201cAn ordinary grievance, unaddressed, had metastasised to become an epic one.\u201d Her Royal Highness, as she was called, moved into the palatial ruin in 1985 and would give rare, eccentric interviews in which she and her children would rail against the injustices of the British and Indian governments. They died in poverty: Begum was alleged to have committed suicide in the 1990s by drinking poison mixed with powdered diamonds and pearls. Sakina apparently died in 2016, and Cyrus, Barry\u2019s key contact and friend, died alone, reportedly of dengue fever, in late 2017. \u201cThere is no nice way to put this,\u201d wrote Barry. \u201cI\u2019m unravelling a story that was the central work of their lives. It is impossible to know, now that he and his sister are dead, whether they even knew it wasn\u2019t all true. Either way, this article would have crushed him.\u201d In her pursuit of the truth, Barry discovered that Wilayat had, before partition, been in fact the widow of a civil servant, Inayatullah Butt, in Lucknow, former capital of the Oudh region. She had been admitted to a Lahore mental hospital after her husband died, and later announced that she was Queen of Oudh. While her younger children simply believed her, Wilayat\u2019s eldest son, Shahid Butt, left for England in his teens and secretly sent money to support the family. He died at home in Bradford earlier this month, holding his wife\u2019s hand. \u201cThey were so convincing, and so insistent,\u201d wrote Barry, \u201cthat for 40 years people believed them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Two dramatic matches of football, in the W-League and the A-League, for fans who made it out to McKellar Park in the nation\u2019s capital and in Gosford what a feast of action they witnessed. Canberra United hugely unfortunate not to get something out of a game in which they pushed a star-studded Melbourne City team all the way. No less than seven Matildas on show for the big-money team from the south, but it was the mixture of youth and foreign talent that almost won it for Heather Garriock\u2019s side. An added-time penalty the decider there. In the A-League it was a drought-ending win and clean sheet for a Mariners\u2019 side that\u2019s season was threatening to slide away after some heavy defeats. Great spirit and tenacity shown by the home side to condemn the foreign stars of Alessandro Diamanti and Panagiotis Kone\u2019s Western United to back-to-back losses. They rode their luck at times, but with tough VAR calls against them earlier in the season it does all come out in the wash. Great drama, great spectacle. Thanks for your company today! Diamanti thumps a volley goalwards, and again it cannons off the body of a man in yellow. And there\u2019s the whistle! A rare win in Gosford for the Mariners, and a first clean sheet in almost two years! Back-to-back losses for Western United. Some temper between Berisha and his coach as well. Is there trouble in paradise brewing inside Mark Rudan\u2019s close-knit family? 90 +1 min: Four minutes added on is the word from the sideline, and just a few seconds into this it\u2019s Josh Risdon that rises for a far post header that flashes past Birighitti\u2019s post. Durante now tangles with Silvera, and they\u2019ll be in no hurry to take this freekick, the Mariners. 89 min: It breaks nicely to Connor Pain - another former Mariner now in green and black - and he thumps a shot goalwards, but it strikes Gallifuoco in the midrift. Oh my. A replay suggests that\u2019s come of the arm as well, and there\u2019s a movement towards the ball. They are well and truly riding their luck now, the Mariners! The VAR\u2019s popped out for a dart, apparently. 86 min: Western United earn a corner, and they play a combination that almost bears fruit. It falls to Diamanti outside the box, but he can\u2019t connect cleanly with his non-preferred right boot! It flashes past the post, they\u2019re still trying to ratchet up the pressure, Western United. Five or so minutes left to conjure something. 83 min: Oh no. We have a very nervy pause, as a cross from the new man Pierias appears to hit the hand of Gordon, just inside the box. It\u2019s definitely ball to hand, but in the lottery that is the present IFAB handball rules in combination with the non-stop chuckles factory that is VAR, WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! The home fans are sitting on nails - but a huge cheer tells you, referee Alex King has said play on. 80 min: So, a huge last ten minutes to this one. Our match commentary team have just dropped the stat that Central Coast haven\u2019t had a clean sheet in 37 A-League matches. Which necessarily makes this a terrifying last 10, as they hold a slender 1-0 heading onto the home straight. The youngster Miller comes off with cramp, and it\u2019s Captain Elbows, Matt Simon who comes on to make a nuisance of himself up front for the Mariners. Not a bad idea, it gives them an attacking outlet, and he\u2019s got more than enough experience to know how to hold it up and give his side some breathing room. 73 min: Durante collects Silvera, again with Mariners on the transition, and he follows Calver into the book. A final sub for the home side - it\u2019s Kim who makes way, a fine first starting showing from the experienced Korean, still making his way back from a long injury lay-off. The diminutive Josh Nisbet fills his boots. Rudan rolls his last dice (after MacDonald, Burgess on earlier) - as Dylan Pierias prepares to come on for the visitors. 71 min: Wow. Nothing says \u201cgrowing in confidence\u201d like Jack Clisby belting a 25m effort goalwards, and it\u2019s another superb save, this time from Kurto. Gee, we\u2019ve seen some top-notch goalkeeping today. And you just sense there could be more goals in this one today - but for whom? 67 min: As this goes on Central Coast are increasingly growing into this contest - what a great final stanza we have ahead of us. Fox Sports has just shown the live ladder - should Mariners win, they could remarkably leap into the top six! Plenty of teams down in the mire, and we\u2019ve still got a twist or turn left in this one, you\u2019d imagine. 62 min: Hello. Besart Berisha looks up, and it\u2019s his number up on the subsitutes board and he\u2019s absolutely steaming. He fires a thousand-yard-stare at the touchline and Mark Rudan locks the jaw. No handshake - could there be trouble in paradise? No doubt they\u2019ll be all smiles later if Western can grab some points late on, but if they don\u2019t, watch this space. 57 min: It breaks for Western and they look to fly in transition, but Stensness hauls down Appiah-Kubi and earns a booking for the cynical foul. He\u2019s been a terrific acquisition, the Kiwi youth-international. He was brought through the Phoenix academy with huge wraps on him, but it\u2019s the Mariners that pinched him for his first season in the A-League. 55 min: Sam Silvera opts for a shot from just outside the box, but it\u2019s right into the breadbasket of Kurto who claims it comfortably. They\u2019ve won a corner now - this is a better patch for the Mariners. Can they craft a second and really put the cat among the pigeons? 51 min: A fair slice of fortune in that goal, but when you\u2019re at the bottom of the table, sometimes you\u2019re due a lucky break. And at the other end - it\u2019s a huge miss from Besart Berisha! Appiah-Kubi does well down the right - he lifts a cross to pick out his striker, but it\u2019s marginally behind the A-League\u2019s all-time top goalscorer, and his jabbed effort spins just over the crossbar! Has Birighitti put a charm on this Mariners\u2019 goal? How are they not level, United?! Goal! Central Coast Mariners 1-0 Western United (Calver og) 48 min: Oh wow. They\u2019ve been stomped all over for about 15 minutes at the back end of that half, but it\u2019s the Mariners that take an unlikely lead! It\u2019s a cross into the heart of defence that\u2019s headed clear, and Gallifuoco hits a first-time volley from deep, that spins viciously off the heel of Aaron Calver and completely wrong-foots his own \u2018keeper, Kurto! Second half! So, a chance for both sides to revisit the tactics boards, and your humble scribe to grab a quick coffee and some rice porridge. No expense spared at Guardian Towers. But we\u2019re back in action at Gosford, and it\u2019s Western United looking to drive from the back, through Aaron Calver. Half-time: Central Coast Mariners 0-0 Western United They do survive, unscathed, the home side. Coach Alen Stajcic will be happy with not conceding, but you have to say it was fingers in the dam-wall territory near the end. They need something extra in the second half - what can the 2015 World Cup coach find to inspire his side? 44 min: Oh wow. It\u2019s Diamanti and Kone combining again. He\u2019s starting to completely run the show out there, the Italian. It\u2019s another terrific chipped pass, and he picks out the Greek international entirely unmarked, but he blazes over the crossbar! Big let off for the Mariners. 39 min: Oh my! That\u2019s spectacular football all round! Diamanti with a sumptuous freekick from just outside the box, but the save from Birighitti was top draw. How\u2019d he keep that out? I called him in Guardian\u2019s pre-season previews as \u201cworth at least five to 10 points\u201d for the Mariners - I think he\u2019s earned those already, across just seven rounds. Great signing. (That said, the rest of the team still have to earn some points; so maybe worth 10-20 goals might have been a better shout?) 36 min: A nice cameo of Western United\u2019s two vastly experience marquee midfielders. Diamanti with a terrific first time pass out to Pain, who crosses back in for Kone, who sizes up a curling finish that only just flashes wide of Birighitti\u2019s post. Quality contributions from two vastly experienced players. 33 min: Berisha looks to twist and turn in the box, but the Kosovan international can\u2019t get a clean shot away with Kye Rowles in close attendance. He\u2019s really come along in recent years, the Olyroo. And he starts today ahead of Dylan Fox and Ruon Tongyik in the heart of defence. And a yellow card for Josh Risdon who scythes down the promising youngster Sammy Silvera on a rare Mariners foray forward. 30 min: It\u2019s a lot of passing without too much purpose at this stage. Both sides guilty of \u201cpatience\u201d at the back, which can often be a synonym for either a lack of ambition or a dearth of courage in picking out a more attacking option. Western United happy to counter, as is their way under Rudan, but as the home side the onus is on the Mariners to show a little more. 25 min: Good covering defence from the Scotsman Ziggy Gordon, moved to the centre from his customary right back role. He concedes the corner and it\u2019s an important clearance from Birighitti, before on the follow up it\u2019s Andrew Durante.. cleared off the line! He scored his first goal in over 10,000 minutes of A-League action a week or so back - and he so very nearly had a second there, the veteran! 20 min: A break in play as Appiah-Kubi receives treatment for an accidental elbow from the veteran Korean Kim. No malice, he had eyes for the ball, but it\u2019s ruffled a few feathers out there. The flying Auckland-born winger was of course a former Mariner. But then with five A-League clubs in his back catalogue he\u2019s played at a few stadiums. 16 min: Now it\u2019s Diamanti with the long raking ball, and he earns his side a corner as Clisby is forced to clear for the Mariners. What can they fashion from the set piece, the visitors? Mariners defend, but they turn the ball over cheaply, and Connor Pain almost finds Appiah-Kubi in the box. A half-scare for home fans. 12 min: Mariners allowed the ball at the back, before Gordon goes long for Oar. The skipper looks for a clever chip, and he has Kurto scrambling; but it loops harmlessly over the bar. 8 min: It\u2019s the visitors with it at the back - a classic \u201cfeeling out\u201d opening to this one, and a first look at Lewis Miller down CCM\u2019s right who\u2019s handed a first start to the season as part of a Stajcic backline reschuffle. 4 min: It\u2019s a clever chip over the top from the United skipper Diamanti, who almost finds Appiah-Kubi. He\u2019s preferred today to Scott McDonald the former Phoenix flyer. Can he make the most of his start? Kick-off! A-League: Central Coast v Western United 1 min: A first early take for Birighitti after Jertec\u2019s shot is deflected with all the sting taken off it. A really big test of Alen Stajcic and his team today. After Wellington\u2019s win yesterday they\u2019re now bottom. He\u2019s rung the changes a bit, the former Matildas boss. Will his new XI respond? Here\u2019s how we line up for CCM v Western United: And Western United: Late drama in the W-League, therefore. I\u2019d love to forensically relive a lot of that second half - a really great game of football, and a terrific advert for the women\u2019s game in Australia. But! Time marches on, and we\u2019re off to Central Coast where it\u2019s A-League action as the Mariners about to host Mark Rudan\u2019s Western United. What a cruel game football is! They couldn\u2019t have done more here today, Canberra United. And with the very last passage of the game, it\u2019s City that have pinched it. Van Egmond was hugely fortunate to sneak that penalty home after the heroics of Khamis in goals looking to deny it. And they\u2019ve spared their blushes, the star-studded City lineup. They grab their first win of the season, and take four points from six, while a brave United side slump to their first loss of 2019/20. Penalty! Canberra United 1-2 Melbourne City (van Egmond) Oh my - Sham Khamis picks the right side and gets a hand on it - but only pushes into the post, and it bounces back into her net! How cruelly unlucky, she couldn\u2019t have done more there! 90 + 2 min: Oh my. They\u2019ve hardly mounted a shot in anger this second half, but a brilliant combination between Carpenter and Catley creates the chance centrally, and there\u2019s a player pulled down! No hesitation, it\u2019s a penalty! 89 min: Brilliantly defended by Rebekah Stott, as Stengel receives a long ball into the box and looks to twist and turn, but the experienced Kiwi CB steps in and clears, eventually. That could have been the winner, if it wasn\u2019t for Stott\u2019s tenacity. 84 min: As we get closer to the final whistle it\u2019s Canberra finishing the stronger. You have to say, has it been too long a year for some of these Matildas? Players of the known quality of van Egmond look like they\u2019re trotting round in about third gear there, while some of these new faces and younger teammates are really lighting up this contest. 79 min: Ooph. The intent from this Canberra side is hugely impressive. The foreign brigade of Camila, Stengel and Charley are pinning the ears and really going for this. And it\u2019s the Brazilian who lashes as fierce shot from distance - but it just rises and fails to test Williams. 75 min: Double change for Canberra, as Horsey and Crofts come on, and the youngster Hughes and the veteran Khamis make way. And speaking of Horsey - I\u2019m trusting you sports fans have seen what\u2019s being dubbed as \u201cthe greatest sports interview of all time\u201d from earlier this week. Joe Marler, ladies and gentlemen. 70 min: Post! This game has just exploded to life. It\u2019s Charley who jinks inside her defender, drops the shoulder and fires an effort past the outstretched arm of Williams - but it clatters back off the inside of the post. We were goalless for almost an hour, but could have had three in ten minutes! Brilliant football, great move from Charley. Goal! Canberra United 1-1 Melbourne City (Mijatovi\u0107) 66 min: Well, we didn\u2019t have to wait long to find out! It\u2019s a superb slide ball pass from the Japanese veteran Kinga that finds the Serbian Mijatovi\u0107 after a slick one-two. A clever touch to round Khamis and then tucked into the back of the net! That was a high-class combination and finish. Can they go on from this? 63 min: And all of a sudden, questions are being posed to this star-studded City line up. With Sydney FC already winning their first two games of this sprint of a season, they can\u2019t afford to fall five points behind after just two games. What can they muster now after going behind - and who can be the X-factor to drag them back into this contest? No shortage of individual talent, that\u2019s for sure. Goal! Canberra United 1-0 Melbourne City (Stengel) 59 min: And there\u2019s the breakthrough! It\u2019s another mazy dribble from Charley, before it breaks for Camila. It\u2019s a phenomenal strike from distance from the Brazilian, but it comes back off the post! It\u2019s Katie Stengel, the former Jet, who is first on the spot following up, and they\u2019ve tucked one home, to the delight of their fans. Game on! 58 min: Carpenter chases a lost cause and almost wins a corner. You do worry sometimes about the metres she gets through at such a young age. There was of course huge concern a few years back about Matildas picking up injuries due to cumulative NWSL, W-League and international duty. 53 min: Oh my! If that had gone in, it could have been goal of the season! That was a tremendous run from Simone Charley - she\u2019s run through about six players, jinking straight through the heart of the City defence - and when you think who\u2019s in this side, that\u2019s some effort. It\u2019s a trailing leg of a covering defender that prevents a clean shot at the end. What a shame - that was terrific to watch. 48 min: Huge save! It is Dobson who fires in a tantalising cross - and it\u2019s Emily van Egmond who makes the near post run, but it\u2019s saved at close range by Khamis. She might not have known too much about that, but she was immensely brave and stood strong to keep her side in it. Second half! 45 min: So an early change - as Simon makes way for Rhali Dobson. She was hugely impressive at times with the Jets, and was on the fringes of the Matildas\u2019 squad at once stage, Dobson - let\u2019s hope she can have an impact here. Half-time: Canberra United 0-0 Melbourne City And there\u2019s the whistle! Not overbounding with goalmouth action, but far from a snore draw. Heather Garriock and Rado Vidosic with plenty to ponder at the break. City have controlled a fair bit of possession, but they\u2019ve not fashioned too much apart from a few set pieces and that early attack on Khamis\u2019 goal. While at the other end, former United stalwart Lydia Williams has hardly had a touch. You sense that that could change in the second half though, with the pace of Charley always a danger for the home side. 43 min: It\u2019s all huff no puff so far from City, as they mount another raid on the United box - but they can\u2019t quite find the final pass. Terrific defending from Kurtz. And a bit of passion as Simon and Camila come together. Do you reckon there\u2019s some history there? The Matildas and Brazil aren\u2019t exactly best bed-fellows at international level. A bit of niggle out there, for sure. 36 min: A good foray by Charley, now down Canberra\u2019s right. She twists and turns Catley, before the City defence eventually clears. Great to see the veteran Leena Khamis - so synonymous with the sky blue of Sydney FC - now in the green of Canberra, alongside her sister Sham. She\u2019ll bring much needed experience to this side - a good balance for coach Heather Garriock. 32 min: They are three times champions in their short four-season history, City - really changing the women\u2019s game when they came into the competition. But it should be noted outside that blinding first season they haven\u2019t won a premiership, finishing 4th, 4th, and 5th since then. Some pressure on coach Rado Vidosic perhaps this year, after the shock of missing the finals last campaign - they can\u2019t afford a repeat of that this year. 27 min: Some feisty tackles as Charley flies in on Carpenter, but the teenager gets the better of it and launches another transitional raid, finding Simon once again down the right. It bobbles for Aivi Luik centrally, but the Canberra defence scrambles well and clears. 22 min: Big chance for City! It starts with Carpenter who pick\u2019s Camila\u2019s pocket and charges forward before sliding a pass wide to Kyah Simon. The Matildas\u2019 teammates combine nicely, before Simon picks out a teammate far post, but the final shot is driven wide! Was it Mijatovi\u0107 on the end of it? I believe so. And a yellow card for the veteran Kinga, who slides in aggressively on Hughes. 15 min: So 0-0 after an early feeling out period. Just the early goal-action threatening Canberra\u2019s line, but it\u2019s the home side looking to launch something through their Brazilian international Camila. It\u2019s another former United star, Kinga that steps in to break up the attack though - what a player she\u2019s been for the competition, credit Canberra for bringing her to Australia in the first place. Interesting to see the Serbian Milica Mijatovi\u0107 in City\u2019s ranks. It\u2019s a powerhouse football nation of the men\u2019s game, but we\u2019re yet to see their female players ruffling the world stage. Could she be a trailblazer? First season in the W-League, let\u2019s hope she has an impact and entices more of her countrywomen down under. The skipper Steph Catley looks to swing in a freekick for City, but it evades teammates to the relief of home fans. 10 min: A nervy settling period for the young home side. Age is as they say just a number mind, when you have players like Karly Roestbakken and Ellie Carpenter out there. Both teenagers - but both with a World Cup under their belts (and an Olympic campaign, in Carpenter\u2019s case) so hugely experienced players despite their tender age. Carpenter did of course have a few seasons with Canberra as well, but she\u2019s now in the sky blue of City. W-League: Canberra v Melbourne City - kick-off! 1 min: With a Matildas\u2019 studded lineup no surprises it\u2019s the \u201csilvertails\u201d of the women\u2019s game that are the team to beat once again this season (despite silverware evading City last campaign). Early corners for City as Japanese import Yuri Kinga draws a fine save from Shan Khamis in the Canberra goals. Emily van Egmond also tries her hand from distance - fresh from scoring against her old club Newcastle last weekend - but she thumps her effort into the wall. Afternoon all! My regards to you and yours from wherever you\u2019re following our coverage today. Let\u2019s leap straight in, because my spies at McKellar Park in the nation\u2019s capital tell me we\u2019re already underway in the W-League. Let\u2019s follow that one with some live updates asap. W-League and the A-League take centre stage as the old powers and new powers go head to head. Canberra United - once the benchmark of the women\u2019s game - take on the big spending Melbourne City. While in the men\u2019s game, early-day competition frontrunners Central Coast are now the whipping boys - looking to climb off the bottom of the table with a win over new kids on the block, Mark Rudan\u2019s Western United. As always with Sportwatch there will be plenty more from elsewhere - shoot us an email or text if there\u2019s some sporting action from around Australia you\u2019d like to hear about.",

The Greek hero Achilles is shown in glinting black armour, bearing down on Penthesilea, leader of the Amazons. Just as his spear pierces her white throat, their eyes meet and Achilles falls in love.

And what are they even fighting about? Everyone knows the myth of origin. Trojan prince Paris abducts Helen, wife of Spartan king Menelaus. The Greeks lay siege to Troy in revenge. A decade of war ends only when Odysseus comes up with the ruse of a gigantic wooden horse, filled with soldiers, which the Trojans foolishly drag inside their city only to be massacred by night.

Take Helen of Troy. Was she abducted, did she go willingly, why isn\u2019t she known as Helen of Sparta? Why is she stinted in Homer\u2019s <em>Iliad</em>, and never even makes it to Troy in Euripides\u2019 eponymous play. These questions seem newly reasonable, here, in front of so many different depictions.</p> <p>For what did Helen actually look like? Face like thunder, vast nose and bigger chin, according to one Etruscan wall painting; hair down to her knees, according to another. On an Athenian water jar from 470BC she is pert nosed, with high breasts and luxurious curls, her toga covered with sparkles. And perhaps she knows her own beauty, staring approvingly at herself in the mirror on a Grecian urn.</p> <p>But in an Etruscan tomb relief, she simply looks like everybody else in the milling scene. And what\u2019s equally striking is that Paris appears conspicuously bored, as his soldiers shove Helen on to the ship like another spoil of war. Perhaps she was just a military pawn, and the thousand ships were launched more by belligerence than beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"281c736f80cc4c1d2eaedb4bdf991727db99520d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/281c736f80cc4c1d2eaedb4bdf991727db99520d/0_0_5206_6017/865.jpg\" alt=\"Red-figure jar, c480-470BC: Odysseus, strapped to the mast, sails past the Sirens. \" width=\"865\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Red-figure jar, c480-470BC: Odysseus, strapped to the mast, sails past the Sirens. </em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: British Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Achilles, bravest hero of them all, may appear in action on the battlefield, but he is also depicted dragging the corpse of Hector behind his chariot until it turns to a pulp, and slitting the throat of one Trojan teenager after another in psychotic vengeance.

      "body": "<p>\u201cAm I a real addict now? I ask. Yes, he says, with his shy, tentative smile, now you are a real addict.\u201d The Copenhagen trilogy, Tove Ditlevsen\u2019s majestic memoir of art and addiction, was originally published in Danish in the late 1960s and early 70s, and now appears in English for the first time, translated by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favela Goldman. The three novella-length books are called <em>Childhood</em>, <em>Youth</em> and <em>Dependency</em> and trace the arc of Ditlevsen\u2019s story from birth to literary stardom to the seamy, grasping years of addiction that ended with her suicide in 1976. The trilogy is stridently honest, entirely revealing \u2013 she makes no effort to hide the many shameful episodes of a shambolic, drug-addled existence \u2013 and, in the end, devastating.</p> <p>Ditlevsen was born in Vesterbro, Copenhagen, in 1917, the daughter of a fretful, socially ambitious mother and a socialist father who was fired from one job after another for his politics. Their down-at-heel neighbourhood is full of drunks, and the future for Ditlevsen is \u2013 at best \u2013 one of marriage to a \u201cstable skilled worker\u201d. Already, though, there were traces of the mental illness that will shipwreck her adult life, with a suffocating sense of melancholy settling over her childhood.</p> <p>Ditlevsen is an unusually solemn young woman \u2013 she has few friends, and those she does have appear unknowably foreign, uncomfortably interchangeable. \u201cChildhood,\u201d she writes, \u201cis long and narrow like a coffin, and you can\u2019t get out of it on your own.\u201d Rather than play in the courtyard of her tenement block, Ditlevsen prefers to read and write poems. This is, in part, a <em>K\u00fcnstelerroman</em>, seeking traces of future literary stardom in the early life. <em>Childhood</em> ends, beautifully, thus: \u201cMy childhood falls silently to the bottom of my memory, that library of the soul from which I will draw knowledge and experience for the rest of my life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ece6ff854768925dd2a5b45bad5f11d6b6ef069\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ece6ff854768925dd2a5b45bad5f11d6b6ef069/0_0_3912_2536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Copenhagen in the late 60s, when Ditlevsen\u2019s books were published in Denmark\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Copenhagen in the late 60s, when Ditlevsen\u2019s books were published in Denmark.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hum Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the many semi-miraculous elements of Ditlevsen\u2019s prose, which appears at first glance breezily artless, is the way she\u2019ll settle on an object and rub her characters up against it, grounding them in the physicality of her world. So she writes that \u201cmy mother\u2019s dark anger always ended in her slapping my face or pushing me against the stove\u201d. But then her father is \u201cbig and black and old like the stove, but there is nothing about him that I\u2019m afraid of\u201d. And, finally, a page later, the stove becomes a point of solidity as her childhood rushes by: \u201cThe living room sails through time and space, and the fire roars in the stove.\u201d</p> <p>The affectless prose is interrupted by glorious poetical flourishes, and these bursts of lyricism are more than merely ornamental. The books handle time by stepping between the present tense and the past so that, as in the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/10/the-end-karl-ove-knausgaard-my-struggle-volume-six-review\" title=\"\">Knausgaard</a>, we move kaleidoscopically from minutely observed particularities to the broad sweep of a life. \u201cTime passed and my childhood grew thin and flat, paperlike,\u201d she writes at one point.</p> <p>The rise of Nazism makes her feel \u201cas if the swells from the great ocean of the world could capsize my fragile little ship at any moment\u201d. She aborts a child because it will get in the way of her writing, and says: \u201cI don\u2019t regret what I did, but in the dark, tarnished corridors of my mind there is a faint impression, like a child\u2019s footprints in damp sand.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the final book in the trilogy, <em>Dependency</em>, that is the most memorable. After taking on and discarding two husbands, Ditlevsen meets Carl, a doctor, at a party to celebrate the end of the war. The next day, even though he has \u201can underbite and 64 teeth in his mouth instead of 32\u201d, she goes to see Carl again and he injects her with Demerol. \u201cThe room expands to a radiant hall,\u201d she writes, although when it wears off \u201cit feels as if a grey, slimy veil covers whatever my eyes see\u201d. Carl is a monster and becomes the last and worst of a long line of men to abuse the fragile Ditlevsen.</p> <p>He controls her first with Demerol, then with methadone, and the writing career she dreamed of so fiercely as a child begins to wither. In a jealous rage, Carl silently extracts Ditlevsen from a dinner with Evelyn Waugh, then placates her with a shot of Demerol. Even the book\u2019s half-hopeful conclusion is coloured by the reader\u2019s knowledge of what is to come.</p> <p>Writing about drug addiction and mental illness are difficult, because both offer a direct challenge to our ability to shape experience into language. Ditlevsen\u2019s trilogy is remarkable not only for its honesty and lyricism; these are books that journey deep into the darkest reaches of human experience and return, fatally wounded, but still eloquent. The Copenhagen trilogy is as raw and poignant as J<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">anet Frame\u2019s</a> <em>An Angel at My Table</em>. Like that book, it radiates the clear light of truth and stands as the ultimate victory of a life that must have felt, in the living of it, like a defeat.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/childhood-9780241391938.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Childhood</a>, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/youth-9780241405550.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Youth</a> and <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/dependency-9780241391747.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">Dependency</a> by Tove Ditlevsen are published by Penguin (\u00a39.99 each).

Yes, he says, with his shy, tentative smile, now you are a real addict.\u201d The Copenhagen trilogy, Tove Ditlevsen\u2019s majestic memoir of art and addiction, was originally published in Danish in the late 1960s and early 70s, and now appears in English for the first time, translated by Tiina Nunnally and Michael Favela Goldman. The three novella-length books are called Childhood, Youth and Dependency and trace the arc of Ditlevsen\u2019s story from birth to literary stardom to the seamy, grasping years of addiction that ended with her suicide in 1976. The trilogy is stridently honest, entirely revealing \u2013 she makes no effort to hide the many shameful episodes of a shambolic, drug-addled existence \u2013 and, in the end, devastating. Ditlevsen was born in Vesterbro, Copenhagen, in 1917, the daughter of a fretful, socially ambitious mother and a socialist father who was fired from one job after another for his politics. Their down-at-heel neighbourhood is full of drunks, and the future for Ditlevsen is \u2013 at best \u2013 one of marriage to a \u201cstable skilled worker\u201d. Already, though, there were traces of the mental illness that will shipwreck her adult life, with a suffocating sense of melancholy settling over her childhood. Ditlevsen is an unusually solemn young woman \u2013 she has few friends, and those she does have appear unknowably foreign, uncomfortably interchangeable. \u201cChildhood,\u201d she writes, \u201cis long and narrow like a coffin, and you can\u2019t get out of it on your own.\u201d Rather than play in the courtyard of her tenement block, Ditlevsen prefers to read and write poems. This is, in part, a K\u00fcnstelerroman, seeking traces of future literary stardom in the early life. Childhood ends, beautifully, thus: \u201cMy childhood falls silently to the bottom of my memory, that library of the soul from which I will draw knowledge and experience for the rest of my life.\u201d One of the many semi-miraculous elements of Ditlevsen\u2019s prose, which appears at first glance breezily artless, is the way she\u2019ll settle on an object and rub her characters up against it, grounding them in the physicality of her world. So she writes that \u201cmy mother\u2019s dark anger always ended in her slapping my face or pushing me against the stove\u201d. But then her father is \u201cbig and black and old like the stove, but there is nothing about him that I\u2019m afraid of\u201d. And, finally, a page later, the stove becomes a point of solidity as her childhood rushes by: \u201cThe living room sails through time and space, and the fire roars in the stove.\u201d The affectless prose is interrupted by glorious poetical flourishes, and these bursts of lyricism are more than merely ornamental. The books handle time by stepping between the present tense and the past so that, as in the work of Knausgaard, we move kaleidoscopically from minutely observed particularities to the broad sweep of a life. \u201cTime passed and my childhood grew thin and flat, paperlike,\u201d she writes at one point. The rise of Nazism makes her feel \u201cas if the swells from the great ocean of the world could capsize my fragile little ship at any moment\u201d. She aborts a child because it will get in the way of her writing, and says: \u201cI don\u2019t regret what I did, but in the dark, tarnished corridors of my mind there is a faint impression, like a child\u2019s footprints in damp sand.\u201d It\u2019s the final book in the trilogy, Dependency, that is the most memorable. After taking on and discarding two husbands, Ditlevsen meets Carl, a doctor, at a party to celebrate the end of the war. The next day, even though he has \u201can underbite and 64 teeth in his mouth instead of 32\u201d, she goes to see Carl again and he injects her with Demerol. \u201cThe room expands to a radiant hall,\u201d she writes, although when it wears off \u201cit feels as if a grey, slimy veil covers whatever my eyes see\u201d. Carl is a monster and becomes the last and worst of a long line of men to abuse the fragile Ditlevsen. He controls her first with Demerol, then with methadone, and the writing career she dreamed of so fiercely as a child begins to wither. In a jealous rage, Carl silently extracts Ditlevsen from a dinner with Evelyn Waugh, then placates her with a shot of Demerol. Even the book\u2019s half-hopeful conclusion is coloured by the reader\u2019s knowledge of what is to come. Writing about drug addiction and mental illness are difficult, because both offer a direct challenge to our ability to shape experience into language. Ditlevsen\u2019s trilogy is remarkable not only for its honesty and lyricism; these are books that journey deep into the darkest reaches of human experience and return, fatally wounded, but still eloquent. The Copenhagen trilogy is as raw and poignant as Janet Frame\u2019s An Angel at My Table. Like that book, it radiates the clear light of truth and stands as the ultimate victory of a life that must have felt, in the living of it, like a defeat. \u2022 Childhood, Youth and Dependency by Tove Ditlevsen are published by Penguin (\u00a39.99 each).

And when you leave home at 16 and you don\u2019t have a plan and you have to fend for yourself and put yourself through high school\u2026 that builds a powerful character.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think you did make it as an actor?</strong><br>I always felt confident about my skills and my ability. I had to overcome some physical attributes that, on the surface, you would think would be an asset, because I happened to be a very attractive young man. But I was sort of androgynous at a time when androgynous was not necessarily the thing. I was young, skinny as a rail and had long hair and my features\u2026 I was kind of a pretty boy. That\u2019s not the way I felt about myself, but it was the thing I had to overcome to be taken seriously.</p> <p><strong>You don\u2019t hear many people, especially men, talk about the pitfalls of being too good looking.</strong><br>Yeah, it was a detriment in a lot of ways.

      "bodyText": "A few weeks shy of turning 70, the American actor Don Johnson can look back on a rich, never-dull career. \u201cI feel the same as I always have,\u201d he says, flashing that smile, \u201c16 and unruly!\u201d He broke through in the 1980s as a swaggering Sonny Crockett in the TV series Miami Vice. Life on screen and off was fast and glamorous; Johnson has been married five times (twice to Melanie Griffith) and engaged in Olympic-level hedonism. But the work has rarely slowed, including roles in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Django Unchained and now Knives Out, a slick, funny whodunnit from Rian Johnson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). The film also stars Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Christopher Plummer, who plays a successful crime novelist whose untimely death turns a dysfunctional family against one another. It looks like you and the cast of Knives Out had a great time making it. Or was that really good acting on your part? I always say when people mention this that \u201cit\u2019s kind of our job to make it look easy and fun\u201d. You have to look like that even with people that you could do time for any sort of heinous act you committed on them. But no, this was one of those joyous occasions where we actually did have fun. One of the more serious ideas in Knives Out is whether you actually help your children by bankrolling their careers. As a father of five, what do you think? Oh, I could write many books on that. I think you destroy your children, I do. You start off wanting better for them than what you had for yourself, but the more you do for them, the more you cripple them. Struggle is the fuel that drives creativity, discovery and curiosity. Do you speak from experience here? Your path to acting wasn\u2019t exactly straightforward, was it? Hell no. I had a horrible childhood, horrible. I had the quinella: abuse and parents who divorced when I was 12 years old and I was the oldest. I really was unhappy and I left home at 16. And when you leave home at 16 and you don\u2019t have a plan and you have to fend for yourself and put yourself through high school\u2026 that builds a powerful character.

Since his departure from the navy, he had performed a nebulous role as a \u201cfull-time working royal\u201d, a bit of ribbon cutting here, a spot of patronising there and a position created to give him the appearance of utility, as Britain\u2019s special representative for trade and investment.

He imagined that, like the plumber he yearned to be, he could fix things, for himself and his family. Instead, he took a wrench to the delicate pipework that sustains the monarchy, an institution that owes its survival to the infrequency with which its subjects question its value or right to exist. It had borne his misdemeanours, but this infraction it could not brook and accepted \u2013 or forced \u2013 his retirement from public duties.</p> <p>That may be little comfort to the girls and women trafficked and abused by the convicted sex offender <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/14/jeffrey-epstein-estate-victim-compensation\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who saw the prince use the BBC\u2019s global platform to deny culpability instead of acknowledging their suffering or, in one breathtaking answer, their humanity. How could he have failed to notice their presence? Maitlis asked. He replied: \u201cI live in an institution at Buckingham Palace which has members of staff walking around all the time and I don\u2019t wish to appear grand but there were a lot of people who were walking around Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s house.\u201d He could not, he said, recall Virginia Roberts.</p> <p>The backlash has plunged the monarchy into its most profound crisis since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1936/dec/11/queenmother.monarchy\" title=\"\">the abdication</a> just as it appeared at the apex of its popularity, puffed and glamorised by <em>The Crown</em> and refreshing its brand through Meghan Markle.</p> <p>Yet the interview would never have taken place if not for behind-the-scenes turbulences.

Since the Women\u2019s Equality party announced that it would field candidates \u2013 all women who have experienced rape or domestic abuse \u2013 against five MPs facing unresolved allegations, four of those MPs decided not to contest their seats. We continue to push for properly funded refuges and services for the survivors of violence and for an amendment to the Recall of MPs Act 2015. In its current form, the law enables voters to recall their MPs for fiddling expenses but not for sexual harassment.</p> <p>This omission is not accidental. Money oils the wheels of the culture of impunity. The roll call of men who socialised with the wealthy Epstein includes two US presidents, Clinton and Trump, both notorious abusers \u2013 of power. Some of Epstein\u2019s victims are represented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gloria-allred\" title=\"\">Gloria Allred</a>, a lawyer who criticised California\u2019s forthcoming ban on non-disclosure agreements in cases alleging sexual assault, harassment or discrimination. She argues that perpetrators, deprived of the opportunity to buy victims\u2019 silence, will be less likely to settle, forcing claimants into lengthy legal battles. As someone <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/05/catherine-mayer-time-magazine-sex-discrimination-lawsuit\" title=\"\">whose own sex discrimination lawsuit</a> drew new supporting evidence as a result of becoming public, I would question that assessment. The #MeToo movement laid bare how the same systemic and structural imbalances that leave people vulnerable to abuse also deny them recourse when organisations close ranks against them. There are obvious steps to improving Westminster and most other workplaces, not least in tackling their underlying inequalities. It\u2019s harder to propose a solution for an institution whose central proposition is inequality.</p> <p>Prince Andrew\u2019s fate illuminates this. He lost his trade envoy gig <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/21/prince-andrew-trade-envoy-palace\" title=\"\">in 2011</a> after an investigation exposed his ties to Epstein. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, had taken money from Epstein to pay her debts. The prince had stayed with Epstein after his release from jail. The palace simply redeployed Andrew to front <a href=\"https://thedukeofyork.org/initiatives/pitch-palace/\" title=\"\">Pitch@Palace</a>, notionally founded to \u201caccelerate the work of entrepreneurs\u201d, specifically as a berth for a problematic prince. I would not be surprised if he were to take up residence in a country with its own royals and a less inquisitive media.</p> <p>The last time I saw him was at a 2014 book party for Hillary Clinton. He said: \u201cI\u2019m doing what you do; I\u2019ve become an investigative journalist.\u201d I was too busy trying not to laugh to ask what he meant. I now wonder if he might have been attempting oppositional research into Epstein\u2019s accusers rather than merely continuing his fruitless search for a suitable occupation.</p> <p>Only one role befits him now: helping the authorities with their inquiries and Epstein\u2019s victims to get justice.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Catherine Mayer is the author of </em>Charles: The Heart of a King<em> and co-founder of the Women\u2019s Equality </em><em>party</em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard to propose a solution for an institution whose central proposition is inequality</p> </blockquote> </aside>",

Some of Epstein\u2019s victims are represented by Gloria Allred, a lawyer who criticised California\u2019s forthcoming ban on non-disclosure agreements in cases alleging sexual assault, harassment or discrimination. She argues that perpetrators, deprived of the opportunity to buy victims\u2019 silence, will be less likely to settle, forcing claimants into lengthy legal battles. As someone whose own sex discrimination lawsuit drew new supporting evidence as a result of becoming public, I would question that assessment. The #MeToo movement laid bare how the same systemic and structural imbalances that leave people vulnerable to abuse also deny them recourse when organisations close ranks against them. There are obvious steps to improving Westminster and most other workplaces, not least in tackling their underlying inequalities. It\u2019s harder to propose a solution for an institution whose central proposition is inequality. Prince Andrew\u2019s fate illuminates this. He lost his trade envoy gig in 2011 after an investigation exposed his ties to Epstein. His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, had taken money from Epstein to pay her debts. The prince had stayed with Epstein after his release from jail. The palace simply redeployed Andrew to front Pitch@Palace, notionally founded to \u201caccelerate the work of entrepreneurs\u201d, specifically as a berth for a problematic prince. I would not be surprised if he were to take up residence in a country with its own royals and a less inquisitive media. The last time I saw him was at a 2014 book party for Hillary Clinton. He said: \u201cI\u2019m doing what you do; I\u2019ve become an investigative journalist.\u201d I was too busy trying not to laugh to ask what he meant. I now wonder if he might have been attempting oppositional research into Epstein\u2019s accusers rather than merely continuing his fruitless search for a suitable occupation. Only one role befits him now: helping the authorities with their inquiries and Epstein\u2019s victims to get justice. \u2022 Catherine Mayer is the author of Charles: The Heart of a King and co-founder of the Women\u2019s Equality party",

What was required was a careful development of Labour\u2019s 2017 manifesto, prioritising the need to raise investment on targeted programmes with feasible tax and borrowing increases, along with a more forensic approach to the reshaping of capitalism and an unambiguous commitment to Remain. The 2019 manifesto, notwithstanding the virtue of its ambition, stretches even the kindest observer\u2019s credulity to the limit. The doubling of 2017\u2019s already ambitious borrowing and taxation targets to fulfil a faux \u201cevery wish granted\u201d radicalism means that suddenly one of Johnson\u2019s \u201clies\u201d \u2013 that Labour will lift corporation tax to extravagant levels \u2013 turns out to be uncomfortably near the mark.

      "body": "<p>More than 10,000 EU nationals have left the NHS since the Brexit referendum, including almost 5,000 nurses. These new figures will add fuel to concerns about a wider staffing crisis.</p> <p>So far this year more than 3,250 EU staff have left the NHS, according to data released under the Freedom of Information Act. The figures are from less than half England\u2019s trusts and cover only 10 months, so the actual figure is likely to be higher. This year alone, 1,116 EU nurses have left.</p> <p>Compiled by the Liberal Democrats, the data shows 11,600 EU staff have left since the Brexit vote, including 4,783 nurses. Some of the worst affected trusts include London North West, which has lost 362 EU staff this year, Oxford University Hospitals with 304 departures and University Hospitals Bristol, with 203. The number of EU leavers increased by 23% from 3,504 in 2015 to 4,335 in 2017. The number of EU staff leaving levelled slightly to 4,013 in 2018, still up 14% on 2015.</p> <p>There is also evidence that as more EU health workers leave, fewer nurses are arriving. Recent figures from the <a href=\"https://www.nmc.org.uk/news/news-and-updates/new-nmc-figures-continue-to-highlight-major-concern-as-more-eu-nurses-leave-the-uk/\" title=\"\">Nursing and Midwifery Council </a> show that the number of nurses arriving from the EU dropped by 87% from 6,382 in 2016-17 to 805 in 2017-18.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d86677a228c9fcedb33daf5508151f53bba2274e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d86677a228c9fcedb33daf5508151f53bba2274e/0_182_5448_3269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luciana Berger, the Lib Dem health spokeswoman, says the Conservative treatment of EU nationals in the NHS is \u2018utterly shameful\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luciana Berger, the Lib Dem health spokeswoman, says the Conservative treatment of EU nationals in the NHS is \u2018utterly shameful\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle\u2019n/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has also emerged that the NHS trust in Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge constituency has raised concerns about the morale of EU nationals. Documents from a Hillingdon trust board meeting this spring warn that the most significant risk posed by Brexit is the \u201canxiety felt by approximately 300 EU nationals in the workforce in terms of their jobs and future\u201d. Another document concluded that \u201cthe risks to plant and equipment/parts where the supply is from the EU is significant\u201d.</p> <p>Wider fears of NHS workforce problems were revealed in an <a href=\"https://www.nhsconfed.org/news/2019/11/health-leaders-set-priorities-for-new-government-to-tackle-huge-pressures\" title=\"\">NHS Confederation survey</a> published last week. Nine out of 10 hospital bosses in England said they are concerned the severe shortages could damage patients\u2019 health, with 58% believing this winter will be the toughest yet.</p> <p>In a sign of serious concerns in government, ministers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/22/nhs-england-pledges-pensions-top-up-in-bid-to-tackle-staffing-crisis\" title=\"\">agreed to pay doctors\u2019 pension tax bills</a> this year to try to halt a rise in doctors refusing to work extra shifts for fear of being financially penalised. The trend has seen hospitals cancel thousands of operating lists and outpatient clinics.</p> <p>The Lib Dems also accuse the Tories of planning to introduce a \u201cnurse tax\u201d after Brexit by imposing visa and NHS surcharge fees on health professionals from the EU, who do not currently pay any fees if they work in the NHS.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/23/actor-rob-delaney-praises-nhs-as-pinnacle-of-human-achievement\">Actor Rob Delaney praises NHS as \u2018pinnacle of human achievement\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Luciana Berger, the Lib Dem\u2019s health spokeswoman, said: \u201cThese damning documents reveal the major threat Brexit poses to our NHS, including in Boris Johnson\u2019s own backyard where EU staff are worried about their future here. The Conservatives\u2019 treatment of nurses and doctors from the EU has been utterly shameful. Now the Tories want to clobber them with a nurse tax worth thousands of pounds to come and work in the NHS. This will make the severe staff shortages faced by the NHS even worse and patient care will suffer.\u201d</p> <p>A Conservative spokesperson said: \u201cSince these documents were written, Boris Johnson has negotiated a deal with the EU that would have ended any anxiety felt by millions of people, including EU nationals. The Liberal Democrats voted against that deal, causing more delay and more uncertainty for those whose interests they claim to want to protect.</p> <p>\u201cA vote for Jo Swinson will only result in a Corbyn-Surgeon alliance, and two referendums in 2020. That\u2019s not good for the country, and it\u2019s not good for EU citizens living here, who just want to work hard and get on.</p> <p>\u201cA majority Conservative government will get Brexit done and introduce an NHS fast-track visa for qualified doctors and nurses \u2013 because we value their contribution to our fantastic NHS.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 10,000 EU nationals have left the NHS since the Brexit referendum, including almost 5,000 nurses. These new figures will add fuel to concerns about a wider staffing crisis. So far this year more than 3,250 EU staff have left the NHS, according to data released under the Freedom of Information Act. The figures are from less than half England\u2019s trusts and cover only 10 months, so the actual figure is likely to be higher. This year alone, 1,116 EU nurses have left. Compiled by the Liberal Democrats, the data shows 11,600 EU staff have left since the Brexit vote, including 4,783 nurses. Some of the worst affected trusts include London North West, which has lost 362 EU staff this year, Oxford University Hospitals with 304 departures and University Hospitals Bristol, with 203. The number of EU leavers increased by 23% from 3,504 in 2015 to 4,335 in 2017. The number of EU staff leaving levelled slightly to 4,013 in 2018, still up 14% on 2015. There is also evidence that as more EU health workers leave, fewer nurses are arriving. Recent figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show that the number of nurses arriving from the EU dropped by 87% from 6,382 in 2016-17 to 805 in 2017-18. It has also emerged that the NHS trust in Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge constituency has raised concerns about the morale of EU nationals. Documents from a Hillingdon trust board meeting this spring warn that the most significant risk posed by Brexit is the \u201canxiety felt by approximately 300 EU nationals in the workforce in terms of their jobs and future\u201d. Another document concluded that \u201cthe risks to plant and equipment/parts where the supply is from the EU is significant\u201d. Wider fears of NHS workforce problems were revealed in an NHS Confederation survey published last week. Nine out of 10 hospital bosses in England said they are concerned the severe shortages could damage patients\u2019 health, with 58% believing this winter will be the toughest yet. In a sign of serious concerns in government, ministers have agreed to pay doctors\u2019 pension tax bills this year to try to halt a rise in doctors refusing to work extra shifts for fear of being financially penalised. The trend has seen hospitals cancel thousands of operating lists and outpatient clinics. The Lib Dems also accuse the Tories of planning to introduce a \u201cnurse tax\u201d after Brexit by imposing visa and NHS surcharge fees on health professionals from the EU, who do not currently pay any fees if they work in the NHS. Luciana Berger, the Lib Dem\u2019s health spokeswoman, said: \u201cThese damning documents reveal the major threat Brexit poses to our NHS, including in Boris Johnson\u2019s own backyard where EU staff are worried about their future here. The Conservatives\u2019 treatment of nurses and doctors from the EU has been utterly shameful. Now the Tories want to clobber them with a nurse tax worth thousands of pounds to come and work in the NHS. This will make the severe staff shortages faced by the NHS even worse and patient care will suffer.\u201d A Conservative spokesperson said: \u201cSince these documents were written, Boris Johnson has negotiated a deal with the EU that would have ended any anxiety felt by millions of people, including EU nationals. The Liberal Democrats voted against that deal, causing more delay and more uncertainty for those whose interests they claim to want to protect. \u201cA vote for Jo Swinson will only result in a Corbyn-Surgeon alliance, and two referendums in 2020. That\u2019s not good for the country, and it\u2019s not good for EU citizens living here, who just want to work hard and get on. \u201cA majority Conservative government will get Brexit done and introduce an NHS fast-track visa for qualified doctors and nurses \u2013 because we value their contribution to our fantastic NHS.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Henry Marsh: \u2018I am worried about drug pricing and caving in to the pharmaceutical companies\u2019</h2> <p>Born in 1950, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/16/henry-marsh-mind-matter-not-a-problem-interview-neurosurgeon-admissions\" title=\"\">Henry Marsh</a> grew up in London and studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford before taking up medicine. His decision to specialise in neurosurgery was influenced, in part, by his infant son\u2019s successful treatment for a brain tumour. \u201cA year later, by coincidence, I saw my first serious neurosurgical operation and it was a genuinely epiphanic experience,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s all I\u2019ve wanted to do ever since.\u201d Until 2015, Marsh was a senior consultant neurosurgeon at St George\u2019s hospital in south London. The year before retiring, he published his first memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/30/do-no-harm-stories-brain-surgery-review-henry-marsh\" title=\"\"><em>Do No Harm</em></a>, which Ian McEwan described as \u201cexquisitely attuned to the tense and transient bond between doctor and patient\u201d. A second book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/08/admissions-a-life-brain-surgery-henry-marsh-review\" title=\"\"><em>Admissions: A Life in Brain Surgery</em></a>, followed in 2017 and a third memoir (less medical, more \u201cphilosophical\u201d) is under way. Marsh, who lives between London and Oxford with his wife, the author Kate Fox, continues to perform neurosurgery in Nepal and Ukraine, where he has worked since the early 1990s.</p> <p><strong>What compelled you to write <em>Do No Harm</em>?</strong><br>I\u2019ve always kept a diary but never thought of publishing until my wife read a bit of it and said: \u201cThat should be a book.\u201d A literary agent said the same, so I spent the next 10 years rewriting my diary and telling stories.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think medical memoirs have become such a hit with the reading public?</strong><br>There have been lots of medical memoirs in the past but, dare I say it, mine was the first one that talked about doubt and uncertainty and bad results. As junior doctors, we learned never to show our feelings, even though you\u2019re often extremely anxious. And so, traditionally, medical memoirs were rather boring, and only talked about success and glossed over the difficult bits. But I think we live in a society of less deference, and there\u2019s more and more critical reporting now about doctors and nurses. I didn\u2019t realise this at the time, but I was, in effect, trying to tell the other side of the story, that, actually, doctors are human beings. We make mistakes, we get anxious, and being responsible for other people\u2019s lives seems very wonderful but it comes with an enormous price.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1167a46894133bd5220f6047e90dbd5f86bd98c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1167a46894133bd5220f6047e90dbd5f86bd98c4/0_0_3744_5616/667.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Marsh photographed in the operating room at the children\u2019s hospital in Lviv, Ukraine.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Marsh photographed in the operating room at the children\u2019s hospital in Lviv, Ukraine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail?</strong><br>I find it pretty contemptible. The fact of the matter is, healthcare costs all over the world are going up, because more people are living into old age, and old age is expensive medically. This country spends less on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than all countries we would consider ourselves on a level with, such as Germany and Holland. So I wish the politicians would be a bit more honest and tell people, if you want high-quality healthcare, you\u2019re going to have to pay more money.</p> <p><strong>Is there a country you think we could look to?</strong><br>The problem is, all healthcare systems reflect their underlying society. Why the American healthcare system is so bad, in the sense of terrible life-expectancy figures, infant and perinatal mortality figures, is because of profound inequality. Scandinavian countries have very good healthcare systems, but they\u2019re the most equal societies in terms of wealth and income. So to say we\u2019d like to have a system as good as the Scandinavian ones, we\u2019re really saying we want a society as reasonable and fair, with as strong a welfare state as the Scandinavian countries have.</p> <p><strong>What will Brexit do to the NHS?</strong><br>It won\u2019t help it, that much is clear. There\u2019s already a huge shortage of both doctors and nurses. And I\u2019m very worried about trade deals with America. I am worried about drug pricing and caving in to the pharmaceutical companies \u2013 they\u2019re not altruists, they\u2019re businessmen, and there\u2019s no market economics in setting drug prices, it\u2019s all power politics.</p> <p><strong>What single thing would improve the NHS?</strong><br>There\u2019s no easy answer to that, but it is underfunded. Having said that, the Labour government under Blair and Brown threw money at the NHS but mainly by lashing out on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/hammond-abolishes-pfi-contracts-for-new-infrastructure-projects\" title=\"\">PFI [private finance initiative] contracts</a>, which were very poor value for money. I think you need some kind of long-term commitment to put more money into it. And I might be naive, but if doctors had more autonomy again within the NHS, I think that might help a bit.</p> <p><strong>What is the best book \u2013 fiction or non</strong><strong>fiction \u2013 that you have ever read about hospitals and the medical profession?</strong><br>I\u2019ve just read a book by the palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke called <a href=\"https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/rachel-clarke/dear-life/9781408712511/\" title=\"\"><em>Dear Life</em></a>, which is coming out in January. It\u2019s about death and dying, and about the death of her father, and I think it\u2019s a very powerful book.</p> <p><strong>Who is your favourite fictional doctor?</strong><br>I like Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s short story collection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/sep/09/books-to-give-you-hope-a-country-doctors-notebook-by-mikhail-bulgakov\" title=\"\"><em>A Country Doctor\u2019s Notebook</em></a>. Bulgakov was a country doctor in the Russian countryside during the first world war. I like the rawness of it, and the fact that he admitted to being so terrified half the time, having to deal with medical emergencies on his own.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever seen happen in a hospital?</strong><br>Mistakes I\u2019ve made, because I feel responsible for them. In neurosurgery, which is so serious and where there are so many bad results and deaths, the difficulty is not getting inured to it, not getting a bit institutionalised and desensitised to the reality of what\u2019s going on. Also, the times when I spoke very badly to patients and families.</p> <p><strong>Do you think that was down to stress?</strong><br>Usually, but also sometimes just laziness or being in a hurry or being a bit muddled. What I\u2019ve learned is that talking to patients \u2013 it\u2019s a cliche \u2013 is all about listening. Saying as little as possible but never appearing to be in a hurry. But I found that very difficult, it took me a long time. And one of the great problems in medicine is that, when you talk to patients, you never get any feedback afterwards, so how do you get better, if you never know how you come across? I think most doctors, including myself, have a rather rose-tinted view of how they are.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a good tip for staying healthy?</strong><br>Get lots of exercise. I try to run and do exercises every day. My gloomy, anxious, depressive nature is greatly helped in the short term by running, but the only problem is, I\u2019m now almost 70, and it does become more of an effort. Having a busy social life and a sense of meaning is important, too, because life by my age is not about how long you live. That\u2019s irrelevant. The question is whether you still have a sense of purpose.<br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/killianfox\" title=\"\"><strong>Killian Fox</strong></a></p> <h2>Christie Watson: \u2018The NHS is not failing, it\u2019s being failed\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6d0ee75a649891e645bbf96572df685f35b3df3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d0ee75a649891e645bbf96572df685f35b3df3a/0_584_5267_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christie Watson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christie Watson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Doak/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christie Watson became a nurse at the age of 17. She trained at Great Ormond Street Hospital and spent most of her 20-year nursing career in paediatric intensive care. In 2011, after taking an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, she published her first novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/tiny-sunbirds-far-away-review\" title=\"\"><em>Tiny Sunbirds F</em><em>ar Away</em></a>, which won the Costa first novel award. Her memoir \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/26/language-of-kindness-nurse-christie-watson-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Language of Kindness</em></a> \u2013 was published in 2018 and detailed some of the most challenging moments in her life as a nurse.</p> <p><strong>Why have medical memoirs become such a hit with the reading public?</strong><br>We are living in politically chaotic times and I think people are searching for meaning and connection. Medical memoirs are about all of us; they are about life and death and everything in between. Every single one of us is going to be touched at some stage by illness, loss or grief, and understanding that we\u2019re not alone at those times is a wonderful thing. These books remind people of what\u2019s important: faith and tolerance and respect for every single human being.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best or most surprising reaction you\u2019ve had to your memoir?</strong><br>The best thing has been the sheer volume of people writing me letters and contacting me on social media who just want to share their stories. Sometimes I get a message about someone\u2019s terrible day. They just want to tell me what they\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s also striking how many student nurses contact me to say they have been struggling with their mental health. That happens a lot. I obviously then refer them to professionals or the Samaritans.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail?</strong><br>It\u2019s infuriating but it\u2019s what politicians have always done pre-election. You see them with babies and dogs, going into hospitals and giving out lots of rhetoric about how they are going to transform the NHS. But I don\u2019t think Boris Johnson turning up at the A&amp;E ward is going to change the public perception of how bad things have become since austerity was introduced. The truth is, the NHS has been desperately underfunded and the staffing situation, particularly with nurses, is horrific. The NHS is not failing, it\u2019s being failed. And the public can see the staff working their absolute hardest. Patients deserve better and staff deserve better as well.</p> <p><strong>Are you worried the NHS is creeping towards privatisation?</strong><br>It\u2019s not creeping, it\u2019s marching. The number of NHS patients being sent to private hospitals at the expense of NHS trusts because the NHS is too busy and understaffed to cope with them itself is growing all the time. And the contrast between the private and the public sector is shocking. I remember borrowing a blanket from a private patients\u2019 wing in an NHS hospital and taking it back to an elderly ward I was working on because the NHS patients didn\u2019t have any blankets. In the private wing there were plump pillows and fluffy towels on the bed and Molton Brown products and a massive menu. Back in the elderly ward the patients were being fed slop, frankly, and shivering.</p> <p><strong>What single thing would improve the NHS?</strong><br>More staff. We\u2019re 42,000 nurses short in England and due to the bursary for student nurses being scrapped two years ago that number is going to get worse. We need safe staffing legislation: there should be a minimum number of nurses per shift per patient. The Brexit vote hasn\u2019t helped at all. Five thousand EU nurses have left the NHS in the past three years and we desperately need those nurses. Some of the best nurses I\u2019ve worked with and some of the best doctors are from the EU.</p> <p><strong>What gives you hope for the future?</strong><br>The fact that the NHS is one of the most incredible organisations in the world and the people who work for it, despite the pressure they are under, provide the absolute best care, compassion and kindness to people every single day.</p> <p><strong>Who is your favourite fictional nurse?</strong><br>Hana from <em>The English Patient</em> by Michael Ondaatje. She is such a complex character, a young nurse who is at times childlike and innocent yet also stoic and tough. She wants to believe the best about difficult people and somehow manages to be non-judgmental. Despite dire circumstances and personal trauma, she rolls up her sleeves and gets on with it, reminding the reader that nurses are soldiers too.</p> <p><strong>Do you have one </strong><strong>tip for staying healthy?</strong><br>The biggest health crisis we\u2019ve got in this country is in mental health. So safeguarding your mental health is the most important thing you can do.<br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gregory-robinson\" title=\"\"><strong>Gregory Robinson</strong></a></p> <h2>Adam Kay: \u2018I think it\u2019s shameful that the NHS is used as a political pawn\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7febf75f3c651a887f3aaf6b2daec241ae6c3e56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7febf75f3c651a887f3aaf6b2daec241ae6c3e56/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Kay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Kay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adam Kay is a former junior doctor who left the profession in 2010. While working as a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology, he kept diaries of his experiences, which he later realised were his form of therapy to deal with difficult experiences. In 2017 , those diaries formed the basis of his bestselling memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/04/this-is-going-to-hurt-secret-diaries-of-a-junior-doctor-by-adam-kay-review\" title=\"\"><em>This Is Going to Hurt</em></a>, which has sold more than 1.5m copies and won him a host of awards. His live show based on the book has been selling out at theatres around the country for the past year. Kay has been an outspoken advocate for junior doctors receiving greater emotional and psychological support, and for the NHS to be free of party politics. Last month he published his second memoir, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/twas-the-nightshift-before-christmas-9781529018585.html\" title=\"\"><em>Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>What made you want to become a doctor?</strong><br>You decide to be a doctor when you\u2019re 16, when you choose your A-levels, which is a very bad age to decide anything. I was from a family of doctors and went to a school that churned out a lot of doctors, and that seemed to be enough.</p> <p><strong>Why did you write <em>This Is Going to Hurt</em> and <em>Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas</em>?</strong><br>When the junior doctors came under fire from the government a few years ago, and after they lost the battle, I realised that the public might benefit from knowing more about what doctors do: for example, that they\u2019re not, in fact, in it for the money.</p> <p><strong>Why have medical memoirs become such a hit with the reading public?</strong><br>We are \u2013 and always have been \u2013 obsessed with the human body and the exciting ways in which it will malfunction. It\u2019s difficult to find an evening when there aren\u2019t at least a couple of medical shows on television. A huge amount of our media boils down to medicine, crime and sex.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail?</strong><br>I think it\u2019s shameful that the NHS is used as a political pawn. I think it\u2019s crucial that politicians know what it\u2019s like on the frontline, but that\u2019s very different to rocking up for a photo call with a list of empty promises.</p> <p><strong>Are you worried the NHS is creeping towards privatisation?</strong><br>I am. I think it\u2019ll be a slow, insidious process. I think the danger of Brexit is not that the NHS is \u201cfor sale\u201d but that all the drugs we rely on will be [for sale], and that the cost of buying these drugs at inflated tariffs might be what pushes the NHS from being just about able to run on its reserves to not at all.</p> <p><strong>What single thing would improve the NHS?</strong><br>Money. The NHS has been systematically starved of funds for the best part of a decade. We\u2019re short 100,000 members of staff. We need to invest in the NHS and that probably involves, I\u2019m afraid, putting our hands in our pockets.</p> <p><strong>What is the worst thing you have ever seen happen in a hospital?</strong><br>I was drawn to working on labour wards for the height of the highs without ever appreciating quite how low the lows get.

He started training as a surgeon in 1974 and later set up the Oxford Heart Centre at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. By his own estimation, Westaby performed more than 11,000 open-heart operations over a 35-year career. He also helped develop an artificial heart pump, the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070930021005/http://www.jarvikheart.com/basic.asp?id=19\" title=\"\">Jarvik 2000</a>, which broke records by keeping a patient alive for 1,513 days.</p> <p>Westaby wrote his first memoir, the Costa-shortlisted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/13/fragile-lives-stephen-westaby-emergency-admissions-kit-wharton-review\" title=\"\"><em>Fragile Lives</em></a>, shortly before retiring in 2016 \u2013 the <em>Times</em> said it \u201creads like a thriller, except with rather more corpses\u201d. He followed it up with a second memoir, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-knife-s-edge-9780008285777.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Knife\u2019s Edge</em></a>, in March this year. Westaby is married to Sarah, a former nurse, and lives in the Cotswolds. \u201cThe development of heart surgery is the great romance of the 20th and 21st centuries,\u201d he says, \u201cand I had the great privilege of living all the way through it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why did you decide to write a memoir?</strong><br>I wanted to show kids that they could come from a very underprivileged background and, if they made the effort, do whatever they liked. Nobody in my family had ever been to university before, never mind a medical school, but I had grim determination to succeed. I also felt I needed to show what could be achieved with modern life-saving technology \u2013 I spent the latter part of my career developing technology that would be equivalent to an off-the-shelf heart transplant.</p> <p>There was a further reason. When the newspapers started publishing surgeons\u2019 death rates, the profession was intimidated, and became risk-averse, so patients suffered. Why get yourself into trouble by operating on the sickest patients? I argue that the best surgeons were bound to get the highest death rates because they operated on the sickest patients \u2013 you may succeed or you may not, but that\u2019s what pioneering is about.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail?</strong><br>Politicians saying an extra few bob is going to make a difference to the NHS is complete rubbish. It\u2019s the system that\u2019s the problem. The NHS offers what I call secondhand-shop healthcare: what you get is determined by cost, and even the time a patient has with their GP is rationed. The UK\u2019s cancer death rates are worse than other places, not because we don\u2019t have great doctors, but because of the system. And why should we have more overseas doctors registering per year than British trainees? Why can\u2019t we train our own medical and nursing staff?</p> <p><strong>What would you do to improve the NHS?</strong><br>I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ve got to privatise it. One positive step would be reintroducing rehabilitation. In Germany every patient that has major surgery goes to a rehabilitation hospital for a period afterwards. In the UK, rehabilitation hospitals have been abolished, so we can do fancy operations on people, but they suffer because they don\u2019t make the sort of recovery that they could with a simple adjunct. Getting the government to adopt a simple raft of measures that would need some initial investment could transform the way the system works.</p> <p><strong>Have you read many books about the medical profession and does any one stand out?</strong><br>I thought Henry Marsh\u2019s <em>Do No Harm</em> was good. But a substantial amount has been written that is overemotive and not objective. I used to have to tell parents that they\u2019d lost their child, and that\u2019s not something that you can do and be emotional about \u2013 you\u2019ve got to put it aside. It doesn\u2019t stop us being empathetic, but you do need a detachment.</p> <p><strong>Do you have one</strong><strong> tip for staying healthy?</strong><br>I recommend exercise. I\u2019ve got a lovely dog that I walk for an hour every morning. I used to play a lot of rugby, but I kept having accidents. In fact, one bad head injury from rugby completely changed my personality. I lost fear and inhibition, and that meant that, as a surgeon, I would do cases that were way out on the edge.<br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/killianfox\" title=\"\"><strong>Killian Fox</strong></a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Henry Marsh: \u2018I am worried about drug pricing and caving in to the pharmaceutical companies\u2019 Born in 1950, Henry Marsh grew up in London and studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford before taking up medicine. His decision to specialise in neurosurgery was influenced, in part, by his infant son\u2019s successful treatment for a brain tumour. \u201cA year later, by coincidence, I saw my first serious neurosurgical operation and it was a genuinely epiphanic experience,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s all I\u2019ve wanted to do ever since.\u201d Until 2015, Marsh was a senior consultant neurosurgeon at St George\u2019s hospital in south London. The year before retiring, he published his first memoir, Do No Harm, which Ian McEwan described as \u201cexquisitely attuned to the tense and transient bond between doctor and patient\u201d. A second book, Admissions: A Life in Brain Surgery, followed in 2017 and a third memoir (less medical, more \u201cphilosophical\u201d) is under way. Marsh, who lives between London and Oxford with his wife, the author Kate Fox, continues to perform neurosurgery in Nepal and Ukraine, where he has worked since the early 1990s. What compelled you to write Do No Harm? I\u2019ve always kept a diary but never thought of publishing until my wife read a bit of it and said: \u201cThat should be a book.\u201d A literary agent said the same, so I spent the next 10 years rewriting my diary and telling stories. Why do you think medical memoirs have become such a hit with the reading public? There have been lots of medical memoirs in the past but, dare I say it, mine was the first one that talked about doubt and uncertainty and bad results. As junior doctors, we learned never to show our feelings, even though you\u2019re often extremely anxious. And so, traditionally, medical memoirs were rather boring, and only talked about success and glossed over the difficult bits. But I think we live in a society of less deference, and there\u2019s more and more critical reporting now about doctors and nurses. I didn\u2019t realise this at the time, but I was, in effect, trying to tell the other side of the story, that, actually, doctors are human beings. We make mistakes, we get anxious, and being responsible for other people\u2019s lives seems very wonderful but it comes with an enormous price. What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail? I find it pretty contemptible. The fact of the matter is, healthcare costs all over the world are going up, because more people are living into old age, and old age is expensive medically. This country spends less on healthcare as a proportion of GDP than all countries we would consider ourselves on a level with, such as Germany and Holland. So I wish the politicians would be a bit more honest and tell people, if you want high-quality healthcare, you\u2019re going to have to pay more money. Is there a country you think we could look to? The problem is, all healthcare systems reflect their underlying society. Why the American healthcare system is so bad, in the sense of terrible life-expectancy figures, infant and perinatal mortality figures, is because of profound inequality. Scandinavian countries have very good healthcare systems, but they\u2019re the most equal societies in terms of wealth and income. So to say we\u2019d like to have a system as good as the Scandinavian ones, we\u2019re really saying we want a society as reasonable and fair, with as strong a welfare state as the Scandinavian countries have. What will Brexit do to the NHS? It won\u2019t help it, that much is clear. There\u2019s already a huge shortage of both doctors and nurses. And I\u2019m very worried about trade deals with America. I am worried about drug pricing and caving in to the pharmaceutical companies \u2013 they\u2019re not altruists, they\u2019re businessmen, and there\u2019s no market economics in setting drug prices, it\u2019s all power politics. What single thing would improve the NHS? There\u2019s no easy answer to that, but it is underfunded. Having said that, the Labour government under Blair and Brown threw money at the NHS but mainly by lashing out on PFI [private finance initiative] contracts, which were very poor value for money. I think you need some kind of long-term commitment to put more money into it. And I might be naive, but if doctors had more autonomy again within the NHS, I think that might help a bit. What is the best book \u2013 fiction or nonfiction \u2013 that you have ever read about hospitals and the medical profession? I\u2019ve just read a book by the palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke called Dear Life, which is coming out in January. It\u2019s about death and dying, and about the death of her father, and I think it\u2019s a very powerful book. Who is your favourite fictional doctor? I like Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s short story collection A Country Doctor\u2019s Notebook. Bulgakov was a country doctor in the Russian countryside during the first world war. I like the rawness of it, and the fact that he admitted to being so terrified half the time, having to deal with medical emergencies on his own. What\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever seen happen in a hospital? Mistakes I\u2019ve made, because I feel responsible for them. In neurosurgery, which is so serious and where there are so many bad results and deaths, the difficulty is not getting inured to it, not getting a bit institutionalised and desensitised to the reality of what\u2019s going on. Also, the times when I spoke very badly to patients and families. Do you think that was down to stress? Usually, but also sometimes just laziness or being in a hurry or being a bit muddled. What I\u2019ve learned is that talking to patients \u2013 it\u2019s a cliche \u2013 is all about listening. Saying as little as possible but never appearing to be in a hurry. But I found that very difficult, it took me a long time. And one of the great problems in medicine is that, when you talk to patients, you never get any feedback afterwards, so how do you get better, if you never know how you come across? I think most doctors, including myself, have a rather rose-tinted view of how they are. Do you have a good tip for staying healthy? Get lots of exercise. I try to run and do exercises every day. My gloomy, anxious, depressive nature is greatly helped in the short term by running, but the only problem is, I\u2019m now almost 70, and it does become more of an effort. Having a busy social life and a sense of meaning is important, too, because life by my age is not about how long you live. That\u2019s irrelevant. The question is whether you still have a sense of purpose. Killian Fox Christie Watson: \u2018The NHS is not failing, it\u2019s being failed\u2019 Christie Watson became a nurse at the age of 17. She trained at Great Ormond Street Hospital and spent most of her 20-year nursing career in paediatric intensive care. In 2011, after taking an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia, she published her first novel, Tiny Sunbirds Far Away, which won the Costa first novel award. Her memoir \u2013 The Language of Kindness \u2013 was published in 2018 and detailed some of the most challenging moments in her life as a nurse. Why have medical memoirs become such a hit with the reading public? We are living in politically chaotic times and I think people are searching for meaning and connection. Medical memoirs are about all of us; they are about life and death and everything in between. Every single one of us is going to be touched at some stage by illness, loss or grief, and understanding that we\u2019re not alone at those times is a wonderful thing. These books remind people of what\u2019s important: faith and tolerance and respect for every single human being. What\u2019s the best or most surprising reaction you\u2019ve had to your memoir? The best thing has been the sheer volume of people writing me letters and contacting me on social media who just want to share their stories. Sometimes I get a message about someone\u2019s terrible day. They just want to tell me what they\u2019ve been going through. It\u2019s also striking how many student nurses contact me to say they have been struggling with their mental health. That happens a lot. I obviously then refer them to professionals or the Samaritans. What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail? It\u2019s infuriating but it\u2019s what politicians have always done pre-election. You see them with babies and dogs, going into hospitals and giving out lots of rhetoric about how they are going to transform the NHS. But I don\u2019t think Boris Johnson turning up at the A&amp;E ward is going to change the public perception of how bad things have become since austerity was introduced. The truth is, the NHS has been desperately underfunded and the staffing situation, particularly with nurses, is horrific. The NHS is not failing, it\u2019s being failed. And the public can see the staff working their absolute hardest. Patients deserve better and staff deserve better as well. Are you worried the NHS is creeping towards privatisation? It\u2019s not creeping, it\u2019s marching. The number of NHS patients being sent to private hospitals at the expense of NHS trusts because the NHS is too busy and understaffed to cope with them itself is growing all the time. And the contrast between the private and the public sector is shocking. I remember borrowing a blanket from a private patients\u2019 wing in an NHS hospital and taking it back to an elderly ward I was working on because the NHS patients didn\u2019t have any blankets. In the private wing there were plump pillows and fluffy towels on the bed and Molton Brown products and a massive menu. Back in the elderly ward the patients were being fed slop, frankly, and shivering. What single thing would improve the NHS? More staff. We\u2019re 42,000 nurses short in England and due to the bursary for student nurses being scrapped two years ago that number is going to get worse. We need safe staffing legislation: there should be a minimum number of nurses per shift per patient. The Brexit vote hasn\u2019t helped at all. Five thousand EU nurses have left the NHS in the past three years and we desperately need those nurses. Some of the best nurses I\u2019ve worked with and some of the best doctors are from the EU. What gives you hope for the future? The fact that the NHS is one of the most incredible organisations in the world and the people who work for it, despite the pressure they are under, provide the absolute best care, compassion and kindness to people every single day. Who is your favourite fictional nurse? Hana from The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje. She is such a complex character, a young nurse who is at times childlike and innocent yet also stoic and tough. She wants to believe the best about difficult people and somehow manages to be non-judgmental. Despite dire circumstances and personal trauma, she rolls up her sleeves and gets on with it, reminding the reader that nurses are soldiers too. Do you have one tip for staying healthy? The biggest health crisis we\u2019ve got in this country is in mental health. So safeguarding your mental health is the most important thing you can do. Gregory Robinson Adam Kay: \u2018I think it\u2019s shameful that the NHS is used as a political pawn\u2019 Adam Kay is a former junior doctor who left the profession in 2010. While working as a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology, he kept diaries of his experiences, which he later realised were his form of therapy to deal with difficult experiences. In 2017 , those diaries formed the basis of his bestselling memoir, This Is Going to Hurt, which has sold more than 1.5m copies and won him a host of awards. His live show based on the book has been selling out at theatres around the country for the past year. Kay has been an outspoken advocate for junior doctors receiving greater emotional and psychological support, and for the NHS to be free of party politics. Last month he published his second memoir, Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas. What made you want to become a doctor? You decide to be a doctor when you\u2019re 16, when you choose your A-levels, which is a very bad age to decide anything. I was from a family of doctors and went to a school that churned out a lot of doctors, and that seemed to be enough. Why did you write This Is Going to Hurt and Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas? When the junior doctors came under fire from the government a few years ago, and after they lost the battle, I realised that the public might benefit from knowing more about what doctors do: for example, that they\u2019re not, in fact, in it for the money. Why have medical memoirs become such a hit with the reading public? We are \u2013 and always have been \u2013 obsessed with the human body and the exciting ways in which it will malfunction. It\u2019s difficult to find an evening when there aren\u2019t at least a couple of medical shows on television. A huge amount of our media boils down to medicine, crime and sex. What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail? I think it\u2019s shameful that the NHS is used as a political pawn. I think it\u2019s crucial that politicians know what it\u2019s like on the frontline, but that\u2019s very different to rocking up for a photo call with a list of empty promises. Are you worried the NHS is creeping towards privatisation? I am. I think it\u2019ll be a slow, insidious process. I think the danger of Brexit is not that the NHS is \u201cfor sale\u201d but that all the drugs we rely on will be [for sale], and that the cost of buying these drugs at inflated tariffs might be what pushes the NHS from being just about able to run on its reserves to not at all. What single thing would improve the NHS? Money. The NHS has been systematically starved of funds for the best part of a decade. We\u2019re short 100,000 members of staff. We need to invest in the NHS and that probably involves, I\u2019m afraid, putting our hands in our pockets. What is the worst thing you have ever seen happen in a hospital? I was drawn to working on labour wards for the height of the highs without ever appreciating quite how low the lows get. All you ever want is a healthy mum and a healthy baby. I\u2019ll never get over the days I ended up with neither. What is the best book \u2013 fiction or nonfiction \u2013 that you have ever read about hospitals and the medical profession? Atul Gawande\u2019s Complications. Who is your favourite fictional doctor, nurse or medic? I always modelled myself on Dr Nick from The Simpsons. Do you have one tip for staying healthy? In 10 years\u2019 time we will know an awful lot more about the connection between what we put into our bodies and serious diseases such as cancer. But you\u2019re probably on firm ground cutting out meat and processed foods. What gives you hope for the future of the NHS? How loved it is and how hard I believe people will fight for it when they are inevitably put in the position where they have to. Hannah Beckerman Joanna Cannon: \u2018People who write promises on buses should be held accountable\u2019 Joanna Cannon is a former NHS junior doctor specialising in psychiatry. She left medicine in 2015 to become a full-time writer, and her two novels to date \u2013 The Trouble With Goats and Sheep and Three Things About Elsie \u2013 have both been bestsellers. Her recent memoir, Breaking and Mending: A Junior Doctor\u2019s Story of Compassion and Burnout, argues for a wider sociodemographic pool in medicine and more emphasis on the value of compassion during training and on the wards. What made you want to become a doctor? I was drawn to medicine because it\u2019s all about stories and people: everything in medicine rests on a narrative. Why did you write Breaking and Mending? I thought very hard about it because I didn\u2019t want to put people off doing medicine and I didn\u2019t want to scare people who are in hospital. But I think it\u2019s important to be honest and to talk about the bad as well as the good. Why have medical memoirs become such a hit with the reading public? Medical memoirs show that we are now interested in the lives of people around us who we might not have thought about before. And I think you don\u2019t realise how important something is until there\u2019s a chance of losing it \u2013 and there\u2019s a very big chance of losing the NHS. What single thing would improve the NHS? I think people who write promises on the sides of buses should be held accountable for them. And if the people making the decisions about the future of the NHS were actually aware of life at the coal face then they would be perhaps more mindful of the decisions they make. What is the worst thing you have ever seen happen in a hospital? The whole system is upsetting and distressing because it\u2019s broken, but it\u2019s the individual stories that sadden me: they illustrate how fragile everything is. You walk past beds full of bewildered people and you just haven\u2019t got the time to talk to them. And that\u2019s tragic. What single thing would have made your life as a doctor better? Someone to talk to. Junior doctors are very isolated. You need someone to offload to because you\u2019re collecting all this misery as you walk through your day and you have nowhere to put it. You need to put money into supporting the people who hold the NHS together. And this is perhaps why medical memoirs are so important: finally people are realising what it\u2019s like at that coal face. What is the best book \u2013 fiction or nonfiction \u2013 that you have ever read about the medical profession? The Shock of the Fall by Nathan Filer. It\u2019s an amazing book that fully illustrates living with mental health problems and life on a mental health ward. Do you have one tip for staying healthy? Be kind to yourself. We feel self-care is self-indulgent. We need to make space in our days for things that keep our minds quiet. What gives you hope for the future of the NHS? The people in it. The people who are going out to work now, who are going on to understaffed, underfunded wards full of small tragedies that they try to fix. And they do it every day, without any acknowledgement. These are the people who give me hope because they\u2019re the people who glue the NHS together and without them it would fall apart. Hannah Beckerman Stephen Westaby: \u2018Politicians saying an extra few bob is going to make a difference to the NHS is complete rubbish\u2019 Born in Scunthorpe in 1948, Prof Stephen Westaby resolved to become a heart surgeon aged just seven, following the death of his grandfather from heart failure and after watching the BBC medical documentary Your Life in Their Hands. He started training as a surgeon in 1974 and later set up the Oxford Heart Centre at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford. By his own estimation, Westaby performed more than 11,000 open-heart operations over a 35-year career. He also helped develop an artificial heart pump, the Jarvik 2000, which broke records by keeping a patient alive for 1,513 days. Westaby wrote his first memoir, the Costa-shortlisted Fragile Lives, shortly before retiring in 2016 \u2013 the Times said it \u201creads like a thriller, except with rather more corpses\u201d. He followed it up with a second memoir, The Knife\u2019s Edge, in March this year. Westaby is married to Sarah, a former nurse, and lives in the Cotswolds. \u201cThe development of heart surgery is the great romance of the 20th and 21st centuries,\u201d he says, \u201cand I had the great privilege of living all the way through it.\u201d Why did you decide to write a memoir? I wanted to show kids that they could come from a very underprivileged background and, if they made the effort, do whatever they liked. Nobody in my family had ever been to university before, never mind a medical school, but I had grim determination to succeed. I also felt I needed to show what could be achieved with modern life-saving technology \u2013 I spent the latter part of my career developing technology that would be equivalent to an off-the-shelf heart transplant. There was a further reason. When the newspapers started publishing surgeons\u2019 death rates, the profession was intimidated, and became risk-averse, so patients suffered. Why get yourself into trouble by operating on the sickest patients? I argue that the best surgeons were bound to get the highest death rates because they operated on the sickest patients \u2013 you may succeed or you may not, but that\u2019s what pioneering is about. What do you think of politicians going into hospitals on the election trail? Politicians saying an extra few bob is going to make a difference to the NHS is complete rubbish. It\u2019s the system that\u2019s the problem. The NHS offers what I call secondhand-shop healthcare: what you get is determined by cost, and even the time a patient has with their GP is rationed. The UK\u2019s cancer death rates are worse than other places, not because we don\u2019t have great doctors, but because of the system. And why should we have more overseas doctors registering per year than British trainees? Why can\u2019t we train our own medical and nursing staff? What would you do to improve the NHS? I\u2019m not saying you\u2019ve got to privatise it. One positive step would be reintroducing rehabilitation. In Germany every patient that has major surgery goes to a rehabilitation hospital for a period afterwards. In the UK, rehabilitation hospitals have been abolished, so we can do fancy operations on people, but they suffer because they don\u2019t make the sort of recovery that they could with a simple adjunct. Getting the government to adopt a simple raft of measures that would need some initial investment could transform the way the system works. Have you read many books about the medical profession and does any one stand out? I thought Henry Marsh\u2019s Do No Harm was good. But a substantial amount has been written that is overemotive and not objective. I used to have to tell parents that they\u2019d lost their child, and that\u2019s not something that you can do and be emotional about \u2013 you\u2019ve got to put it aside. It doesn\u2019t stop us being empathetic, but you do need a detachment. Do you have one tip for staying healthy? I recommend exercise. I\u2019ve got a lovely dog that I walk for an hour every morning. I used to play a lot of rugby, but I kept having accidents. In fact, one bad head injury from rugby completely changed my personality. I lost fear and inhibition, and that meant that, as a surgeon, I would do cases that were way out on the edge. Killian Fox",

I want to whizz through a long career and get to the cool part, his unexpected late-career renaissance as a comedy player, first in Tina Fey\u2019s sitcom <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/07/when-good-tv-turns-bad-how-30-rock\" title=\"\">30 Rock</a></em> and, afterwards, from 2016 to now, impersonating Donald Trump on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/saturday-night-live\" title=\"\">Saturday Night Live</a></em>. I want to talk about Baldwin\u2019s first marriage to the actor Kim Basinger, and the daughter they had together, Ireland, who is now 24 and living in New York. I want to talk about Baldwin\u2019s second marriage, to Hilaria Thomas, a former actor and yoga instructor, when he was in middle age and she was in her early 20s. I want to ask a difficult question, about what sort of personal reckoning is required, when you\u2019re a man of Baldwin\u2019s age and you\u2019ve just had four young kids in quick succession.</p> <p>Baldwin is waiting. I ramble something which he disregards, and he says to his wife, instead: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk about you. How lucky I am to have you in my life. Look, when I\u2019m done here I\u2019m gonna run home quickly. I\u2019m gonna try that. All right? I love you. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye-bye.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3fb69b8d413ad56a8aba25fa40a287d24eb0b49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3fb69b8d413ad56a8aba25fa40a287d24eb0b49/305_74_1270_761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New York Philharmonic Fall Gala, New York, USA - 07 Oct 2019Mandatory Credit: Photo by Lexie Moreland/WWD/REX/Shutterstock (10438614o) Hilaria Baldwin, Alec Baldwin New York Philharmonic Fall Gala, New York, USA - 07 Oct 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The thought of her being out there and I don\u2019t have her was unacceptable to me.

Rome, Paris, London. Moscow! Madrid!\u2019 And my wife, she found it amusing. But said she <em>would</em> like the kids to go to school.\u201d</p> <p>Their kids are Carmen, six, and her three younger brothers, Rafael, four, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, one. The <em>Baldwinitos</em>, Hilaria calls them. \u201cMy wife and I, we\u2019re like collectors,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cExcept that we collect our own children\u2026 I worry about my kids because they\u2019re so loved. They\u2019re so cared for. My kids get their ass kissed 24 hours a day by one of us.\u201d (At time of interview, Hilaria was expecting their fifth child, but later revealed, in an emotional Instagram post, that she had suffered a miscarriage.)</p> <p>In Motherless Brooklyn, Baldwin plays an intimidating industrial titan, loosely based on the New York infrastructure don <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/the-power-broker-robert-moses-and-the-fall-of-new-york-robert-caro-review\" title=\"\">Robert Moses</a>. He is someone who raves, bullies and strong-arms, never seeming less than utterly furious. I see no signs of it during our conversation, through which Baldwin sits, mildly, with his hands folded across his lap, but this actor is popularly assumed to have a bit of a temper, too. He has lived 40 years in New York, a place where you feel the simmering fight instinct being kept in check by its citizens at all times.</p> <p>There have been incidents. Baldwin was stopped in 2014 for riding his bike the wrong way on Fifth Avenue, and afterwards arrested for arguing with the cops. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/07/alec-baldwin-removed-plane-phone-game\" title=\"\">removed from a plane</a> in 2011 after refusing to turn off his phone, a much-teased-about event that recently prompted his daughter Ireland to quip: \u201cWhy would you even start shit with the one place that\u2019s still playing your movies?\u201d Years earlier, when Ireland was about 11, Baldwin had left a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/21/usa.richardadams\" title=\"\">mean-spirited message</a> on her answerphone that later leaked to TMZ. He has been in at least two scraps with street photographers (1995, 2013) and there is a suit playing through the Manhattan courts, just now, resulting from a disagreement he had with a man over a parking space. Members of his young family were present for that one. I ask him: now that you\u2019re the father of young boys, what do you tell them about confrontation?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d0bc115340f9d47f5836e163c2bc6e21613896a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d0bc115340f9d47f5836e163c2bc6e21613896a/0_0_2816_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early breaks: in Knots Landing, which ran on TV from 1979 to 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early breaks: in Knots Landing, which ran on TV from 1979 to 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baldwin takes the question in a playful spirit, and snorts. \u201cMy wife does a lot of that. My wife\u2019s not taking any <em>chances</em>\u2026 You know,\u201d he says, \u201cI was not an aggressive person when I was a kid. I was little. Skinny. The third-string quarterback or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Baldwin was born in 1958, on Long Island, an hour\u2019s train ride from Manhattan, the eldest of four brothers (Daniel, William, Stephen), all of whom would go on to become actors, with different degrees of success. Their father, Alexander, was a war veteran turned teacher, supportive but strict. Baldwin told an anecdote, once, about his father biting his own hand during disagreements \u2013 better to stop him raising it. \u201cHe had dignity and integrity,\u201d Baldwin tells me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t perfect, but he was a really good guy.\u201d</p> <p>Baldwin left Long Island in the mid-1970s, and in the early 80s he moved to Los Angeles, where he was cast as a heart-throb in <em>Dallas</em> spin-off <em>Knots Landing</em>. The actor recalls: \u201cWhen I went to LA, my dad died. And I had that inclination, healthy or not, to replace him, this man who to me was like Abraham Lincoln in terms of his integrity. And I\u2019m in <em>Hollywood</em>. Capital of integrity! Boy, that was a lonely time. It changed me and hardened me.\u201d</p> <p>Baldwin was 25. There were a couple of lost years when anything might have happened. \u201cI drove around shit-faced for two years before I got smart,\u201d he once said of a nascent drinking problem. He got sober at 27. A breakthrough Hollywood casting, as Jack Ryan in <em>The Hunt for Red October</em>, came aged 30.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c74470a388d632886abfbf4e828ee73ad21e9bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c74470a388d632886abfbf4e828ee73ad21e9bb/0_174_5856_3514/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Calling the shots: in Motherless Brooklyn in which he plays an \u2018intimidating industrial titan\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Calling the shots: in Motherless Brooklyn in which he plays an \u2018intimidating industrial titan\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glen Wilson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At that time, Baldwin says, he was \u201cobsessed with work. Trying to make it in the business and not getting that right, never getting that right. I married somebody who was successful. She was a very successful actress. Kim.\u201d</p> <p>Basinger. She had just been in <em>Nadine</em> and <em>9\u00bd Weeks</em>. \u201cShe was kind of peaking,\u201d Baldwin recalls. \u201cShe was 37 and I was 32. We got married. We both were working all the time.\u201d Their daughter Ireland was born in 1995. \u201cShe would go with Kim on location and I would go and meet them. Then we got divorced. There was a very acrimonious custody battle. Painful. Painful.\u201d</p> <p>What is Baldwin\u2019s relationship with Ireland like now? \u201cMy relationship with my daughter is normal. Of course, it\u2019s damaged as a result of high-conflict divorce. There are scars, there are echoes of that. It\u2019s tough. But I get along great with my daughter.\u201d Mostly, Baldwin says, \u201cyou look at all the time that was lost\u2026 If you did an analysis of the actual days I spent with Ireland [when she was growing up], you\u2019d be appalled at how little it was.\u201d</p> <p>Baldwin recently took part in a charity \u201croast\u201d for a cable network \u2013 a feature-length TV savaging, something like <em>This is Your Life</em>, only researched and written by Satan. A panel of comedians had great fun teasing Baldwin\u2019s reputation for absentee parenting. And then, midway through, as a surprise, his daughter walked out to make a speech of her own. \u201cHi dad,\u201d it began, \u201cI\u2019m Ireland.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1850da91167dba3ae1a0683f8ca9809d3f38cf82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1850da91167dba3ae1a0683f8ca9809d3f38cf82/0_0_3904_2343/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Baldwin boys: with brothers William, Stephen and Daniel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Baldwin boys: with brothers William, Stephen and Daniel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Baldwin left Ireland that angry voicemail message, in the mid 00s, his reputation took a heavy blow. On the charity roast they piled on this and other mistakes with glee. I ask Baldwin why he ever agreed to this. \u201cIt was unbearable,\u201d he says, helplessly, but it raised a lot of money \u2013 $1m, he claims. He hated the experience from the get-go. He only wanted to finish and go home.</p> <p>In 2011, Baldwin was coming to the end of a long run on <em>30 Rock</em>. That sitcom, about a comedy writer (Fey) and her dealings with a misanthropic TV exec (Baldwin), revived his reputation and his career. \u201cI mean, we won every award three or four times.\u201d He was as successful as he\u2019d ever been, but he was lonely. When he met Hilaria at a restaurant, \u201cit was incontrovertible. The thought of her being out there and I don\u2019t have her was unacceptable to me. I just had to marry Hilaria. I was so in love with her. It was somebody who I thought: \u2018I am intrigued by, I am fed by, I am buoyed by\u2026\u2019 There were a lot of other guys she could have married who were age-appropriate. It happened quickly. I met her in February. I moved in in November. We got married the following June.\u201d</p> <p>What did Baldwin\u2019s friends make of it all? The speed? The corking age difference? \u201cI think it was understood that I was hungry to be a father again. And [this time] I wanted to <em>know</em> these people. I wanted to watch human development in real time\u2026 I wanted a family,\u201d Baldwin shrugs, \u201cand boy! Do we have one.\u201d</p> <p>On that charity roast for cable, the most savage joke made at his expense was also the saddest; a joke, like all the best comedy, that was underpinned by basic human truth. \u201cThe good thing about having kids late in life?\u201d one panellist said. \u201cYoung, strong pall-bearers.\u201d</p> <p>When I mention this, I\u2019m not sure how Baldwin will react. His response is unexpectedly tender. Conversation with him is a little like riding a marine animal. You hold on. You laugh and gulp down water. You abandon, completely, efforts at navigation. Now he speaks softly. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. I sit there, with some regularity, driving in a car, or whenever I have a moment to breathe. And I sit there and I think: \u2018You know what? I wish I had more time.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Baldwin continues: \u201cThere\u2019s drawbacks to my kids, me being this age. But there are benefits, too. I\u2019m <em>there</em>. I\u2019ve made them a priority. It\u2019s made me much more mindful: \u2018How do I make the most of my time with them?\u2019\u201d He uncrosses and recrosses his legs. He\u2019s speaking so quietly I have to lean forward to hear him clearly.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, sometimes I sniff my kids.\u201d</p> <p>At first I don\u2019t catch this. I have to ask him to repeat himself.</p> <p>\u201cI <em>huff</em> them,\u201d Baldwin explains. \u201cYou know, like people would huff chemicals.\u201d</p> <p>There is something so unbearable about this image that I have to sit back on the sofa for a moment. Baldwin is a talented, capricious, occasionally ridiculous man. In this moment he only looks like a sad soft toy. \u201cTen extra years!\u201d he says. \u201cI wish I had 10 extra years! I wish I was 50. But, y\u2019know, life. There is no pause button. There is no reverse button.\u201d</p> <p>Baldwin checks his watch. He has to go, across town to another meeting and then home, to Hilaria and the <em>Baldwinitos</em>. \u201cThere\u2019s, like, a sacred part of the day,\u201d he explains, \u201cbetween 5pm and 7pm, when we don\u2019t do anything but be with the kids. Feed them. Bathe them. It takes time. There\u2019s so many of them\u2026 Which sounds insane, right? It <em>is</em> insane. Let\u2019s face it. It\u2019s insane.\u201d</p> <p> Baldwin is rubbing his head, but for all his talk of insanity he appears delighted, and when he strides from the room it\u2019s with a vast, cartoony smile on his face, those sloped shoulders and that wedge of hair weaving out the door, towards the lifts, as he moves against the clock.</p> <p><em>Motherless Brooklyn is in cinemas from 6 December</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Coming into a meeting room on the 24th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper, the actor Alec Baldwin strides up to the wraparound windows, takes in the glorious 180-degree panorama and jokes, to no one in particular, \u201cAh! Yes! This can be my next apartment.\u201d The 61-year-old lands his weight on a sofa and, taking out his phone, sitting extremely straight, nose almost touching the screen, he video-calls his wife Hilaria. \u201cLook at this view I have of the city!\u201d Baldwin cries, angling the camera for her. Quickly the couple are talking grocery needs, who missed whose call, which of their kids got bitten this morning during playtime at school. \u201cBitten?\u201d Baldwin repeats. \u201cBy who?\u201d As I\u2019m sitting here anyway, I settle in and enjoy the spectacle: Alec Bloody Baldwin, in the wild. Today the actor has on a navy suit, his hair cut into a close steep wedge, the shape of a piece of cheese in a cartoon. Up close you realise what an awesome amount of time you\u2019ve spent in this man\u2019s company over the years, the large scored face and the half-hoarse Long Island burr the stuff of a thousand movies, TV episodes, comedy sketches and voice-overs. By his own account, Baldwin has never been much good at saying no to work. Later on in our conversation he\u2019ll tell me: \u201cMy schedule, 10 years ago especially? When I didn\u2019t have a marriage at stake? I didn\u2019t have kids at home? I just kept moving. I cut every ribbon. I would show up.\u201d Baldwin will note that he has been in show business for 40 years, but his place in the culture is hard to define. He\u2019s just\u2026 Alec Baldwin. Actor. Scourge of presidents and paparazzi. Voice of sports docs, Wes Anderson movies, Boss Baby, the machines in the Mission: Impossible films that threaten to self-destruct. In a coming movie \u2013 Motherless Brooklyn, a gumshoe caper directed by Edward Norton, out this month \u2013 such great faith is shown in the public\u2019s intuitive recognition of Baldwin that for the first 15 minutes we are not shown his face, only the wide creased neck, those sloping Baloo-the-Bear shoulders. On the sofa Baldwin is saying to his wife on the phone, \u201cI think for legal reasons we don\u2019t want you to say the name of the biter\u2026 Where am I? I\u2019m here doing this interview. I\u2019m here to meet, uh\u2026 Tom?\u201d Still immaculately erect on the sofa, Baldwin swivels his eyes, Action Man-fashion, so that his gaze shifts past the phone. Oh! Me. I nod. \u201cI\u2019m here to meet Tom. We\u2019re going to talk about, uh\u2026 Hey. Tom. What are we gonna talk about?\u201d It\u2019s a matter I\u2019ve put some thought into. With Baldwin there\u2019s just so much. Today I want to talk about the deep personal animosity that exists between this actor and the President of the United States. I want to whizz through a long career and get to the cool part, his unexpected late-career renaissance as a comedy player, first in Tina Fey\u2019s sitcom 30 Rock and, afterwards, from 2016 to now, impersonating Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. I want to talk about Baldwin\u2019s first marriage to the actor Kim Basinger, and the daughter they had together, Ireland, who is now 24 and living in New York. I want to talk about Baldwin\u2019s second marriage, to Hilaria Thomas, a former actor and yoga instructor, when he was in middle age and she was in her early 20s. I want to ask a difficult question, about what sort of personal reckoning is required, when you\u2019re a man of Baldwin\u2019s age and you\u2019ve just had four young kids in quick succession. Baldwin is waiting. I ramble something which he disregards, and he says to his wife, instead: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna talk about you. How lucky I am to have you in my life. Look, when I\u2019m done here I\u2019m gonna run home quickly. I\u2019m gonna try that. All right? I love you. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye-bye.\u201d Baldwin hangs up and crosses his legs. Right! The interview. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything fresh to say in terms of Trump,\u201d he warns right away. People always want to talk to Baldwin about the president, who he impersonates with real venom. He simply has Trump-fatigue, he explains, which cannot really be true because for a good long while Baldwin discourses, with brio, on his Nemesis-in-Chief. \u201cNot only did I never dream a man like him would become president but, also, I didn\u2019t imagine that he would be able to find so many like-minded people to come and serve him. It\u2019s kind of a gallery of monsters, he has. Where do they come from, this malignant class of public servant?\u201d President Trump is also in Manhattan today, a few traffic-stuffed blocks away at the UN. Leaders from around the globe have travelled in for a summit, as has the young climate activist Greta Thunberg. I ask Baldwin what he makes of the Swedish teenager, her global constituency, on the whole, rather light on 61-year-old American males. Oh, says Baldwin, he\u2019s impressed, he\u2019s impressed. He thinks the UN should hire Thunberg full-time or something. \u201cI think we should have a young person who\u2019s given some kind of a job. They\u2019re given a title or they\u2019re a liaison to the young community. And this girl? Great.\u201d His sketch-show impersonation aside, there is something gently Trumpian about Baldwin\u2019s conversational manner. I have been told by those who\u2019ve interviewed him before to expect eccentricity and entertainment, and an answer to one in every three or four questions. Often, Baldwin takes the gist of an enquiry and then, with echoes of Trump, launches into a startling impromptu flight. \u201cI had a great plan once,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I really mean this. I said to my wife, \u2018Let\u2019s liquidate everything we own! We have a house on Long Island. We have our apartment in Greenwich Village. Let\u2019s sell everything. Convert it into cash. And we\u2019ll stay in the most beautiful hotels around the world. One year in each city, during the kids\u2019 childhood. We\u2019re in Vienna, we\u2019re in Tokyo, we\u2019re in Cape Town. Rome, Paris, London. Moscow! Madrid!\u2019 And my wife, she found it amusing. But said she would like the kids to go to school.\u201d Their kids are Carmen, six, and her three younger brothers, Rafael, four, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, one. The Baldwinitos, Hilaria calls them. \u201cMy wife and I, we\u2019re like collectors,\u201d Baldwin says. \u201cExcept that we collect our own children\u2026 I worry about my kids because they\u2019re so loved. They\u2019re so cared for. My kids get their ass kissed 24 hours a day by one of us.\u201d (At time of interview, Hilaria was expecting their fifth child, but later revealed, in an emotional Instagram post, that she had suffered a miscarriage.) In Motherless Brooklyn, Baldwin plays an intimidating industrial titan, loosely based on the New York infrastructure don Robert Moses. He is someone who raves, bullies and strong-arms, never seeming less than utterly furious. I see no signs of it during our conversation, through which Baldwin sits, mildly, with his hands folded across his lap, but this actor is popularly assumed to have a bit of a temper, too. He has lived 40 years in New York, a place where you feel the simmering fight instinct being kept in check by its citizens at all times. There have been incidents. Baldwin was stopped in 2014 for riding his bike the wrong way on Fifth Avenue, and afterwards arrested for arguing with the cops. He was removed from a plane in 2011 after refusing to turn off his phone, a much-teased-about event that recently prompted his daughter Ireland to quip: \u201cWhy would you even start shit with the one place that\u2019s still playing your movies?\u201d Years earlier, when Ireland was about 11, Baldwin had left a mean-spirited message on her answerphone that later leaked to TMZ. He has been in at least two scraps with street photographers (1995, 2013) and there is a suit playing through the Manhattan courts, just now, resulting from a disagreement he had with a man over a parking space. Members of his young family were present for that one. I ask him: now that you\u2019re the father of young boys, what do you tell them about confrontation? Baldwin takes the question in a playful spirit, and snorts. \u201cMy wife does a lot of that. My wife\u2019s not taking any chances\u2026 You know,\u201d he says, \u201cI was not an aggressive person when I was a kid. I was little. Skinny. The third-string quarterback or whatever.\u201d Baldwin was born in 1958, on Long Island, an hour\u2019s train ride from Manhattan, the eldest of four brothers (Daniel, William, Stephen), all of whom would go on to become actors, with different degrees of success. Their father, Alexander, was a war veteran turned teacher, supportive but strict. Baldwin told an anecdote, once, about his father biting his own hand during disagreements \u2013 better to stop him raising it. \u201cHe had dignity and integrity,\u201d Baldwin tells me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t perfect, but he was a really good guy.\u201d Baldwin left Long Island in the mid-1970s, and in the early 80s he moved to Los Angeles, where he was cast as a heart-throb in Dallas spin-off Knots Landing. The actor recalls: \u201cWhen I went to LA, my dad died. And I had that inclination, healthy or not, to replace him, this man who to me was like Abraham Lincoln in terms of his integrity. And I\u2019m in Hollywood. Capital of integrity! Boy, that was a lonely time. It changed me and hardened me.\u201d Baldwin was 25. There were a couple of lost years when anything might have happened. \u201cI drove around shit-faced for two years before I got smart,\u201d he once said of a nascent drinking problem. He got sober at 27. A breakthrough Hollywood casting, as Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October, came aged 30. At that time, Baldwin says, he was \u201cobsessed with work. Trying to make it in the business and not getting that right, never getting that right. I married somebody who was successful. She was a very successful actress. Kim.\u201d Basinger. She had just been in Nadine and 9\u00bd Weeks. \u201cShe was kind of peaking,\u201d Baldwin recalls. \u201cShe was 37 and I was 32. We got married. We both were working all the time.\u201d Their daughter Ireland was born in 1995. \u201cShe would go with Kim on location and I would go and meet them. Then we got divorced. There was a very acrimonious custody battle. Painful. Painful.\u201d What is Baldwin\u2019s relationship with Ireland like now? \u201cMy relationship with my daughter is normal. Of course, it\u2019s damaged as a result of high-conflict divorce. There are scars, there are echoes of that. It\u2019s tough. But I get along great with my daughter.\u201d Mostly, Baldwin says, \u201cyou look at all the time that was lost\u2026 If you did an analysis of the actual days I spent with Ireland [when she was growing up], you\u2019d be appalled at how little it was.\u201d Baldwin recently took part in a charity \u201croast\u201d for a cable network \u2013 a feature-length TV savaging, something like This is Your Life, only researched and written by Satan. A panel of comedians had great fun teasing Baldwin\u2019s reputation for absentee parenting. And then, midway through, as a surprise, his daughter walked out to make a speech of her own. \u201cHi dad,\u201d it began, \u201cI\u2019m Ireland.\u201d When Baldwin left Ireland that angry voicemail message, in the mid 00s, his reputation took a heavy blow. On the charity roast they piled on this and other mistakes with glee. I ask Baldwin why he ever agreed to this. \u201cIt was unbearable,\u201d he says, helplessly, but it raised a lot of money \u2013 $1m, he claims. He hated the experience from the get-go. He only wanted to finish and go home. In 2011, Baldwin was coming to the end of a long run on 30 Rock. That sitcom, about a comedy writer (Fey) and her dealings with a misanthropic TV exec (Baldwin), revived his reputation and his career. \u201cI mean, we won every award three or four times.\u201d He was as successful as he\u2019d ever been, but he was lonely. When he met Hilaria at a restaurant, \u201cit was incontrovertible. The thought of her being out there and I don\u2019t have her was unacceptable to me. I just had to marry Hilaria. I was so in love with her. It was somebody who I thought: \u2018I am intrigued by, I am fed by, I am buoyed by\u2026\u2019 There were a lot of other guys she could have married who were age-appropriate. It happened quickly. I met her in February. I moved in in November. We got married the following June.\u201d What did Baldwin\u2019s friends make of it all? The speed? The corking age difference? \u201cI think it was understood that I was hungry to be a father again. And [this time] I wanted to know these people. I wanted to watch human development in real time\u2026 I wanted a family,\u201d Baldwin shrugs, \u201cand boy! Do we have one.\u201d On that charity roast for cable, the most savage joke made at his expense was also the saddest; a joke, like all the best comedy, that was underpinned by basic human truth. \u201cThe good thing about having kids late in life?\u201d one panellist said. \u201cYoung, strong pall-bearers.\u201d When I mention this, I\u2019m not sure how Baldwin will react. His response is unexpectedly tender. Conversation with him is a little like riding a marine animal. You hold on. You laugh and gulp down water. You abandon, completely, efforts at navigation. Now he speaks softly. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. I sit there, with some regularity, driving in a car, or whenever I have a moment to breathe. And I sit there and I think: \u2018You know what? I wish I had more time.\u2019\u201d Baldwin continues: \u201cThere\u2019s drawbacks to my kids, me being this age. But there are benefits, too. I\u2019m there. I\u2019ve made them a priority. It\u2019s made me much more mindful: \u2018How do I make the most of my time with them?\u2019\u201d He uncrosses and recrosses his legs. He\u2019s speaking so quietly I have to lean forward to hear him clearly. \u201cYou know, sometimes I sniff my kids.\u201d At first I don\u2019t catch this. I have to ask him to repeat himself. \u201cI huff them,\u201d Baldwin explains. \u201cYou know, like people would huff chemicals.\u201d There is something so unbearable about this image that I have to sit back on the sofa for a moment. Baldwin is a talented, capricious, occasionally ridiculous man. In this moment he only looks like a sad soft toy. \u201cTen extra years!\u201d he says. \u201cI wish I had 10 extra years! I wish I was 50. But, y\u2019know, life. There is no pause button. There is no reverse button.\u201d Baldwin checks his watch. He has to go, across town to another meeting and then home, to Hilaria and the Baldwinitos. \u201cThere\u2019s, like, a sacred part of the day,\u201d he explains, \u201cbetween 5pm and 7pm, when we don\u2019t do anything but be with the kids. Feed them. Bathe them. It takes time. There\u2019s so many of them\u2026 Which sounds insane, right? It is insane. Let\u2019s face it. It\u2019s insane.\u201d Baldwin is rubbing his head, but for all his talk of insanity he appears delighted, and when he strides from the room it\u2019s with a vast, cartoony smile on his face, those sloped shoulders and that wedge of hair weaving out the door, towards the lifts, as he moves against the clock.

      "body": "<p>Drastic cuts to local government funding have seen the UK\u2019s most deprived metropolitan areas \u201cshoulder the burden of austerity\u201d while some more prosperous counties have flourished, according to new research.</p> <p>Analysis by the TUC and public service union Unison of central government funding for local councils in England since 2010 highlights a yawning chasm between urban and rural areas. It shows that , overall, councils in England are spending \u00a37.8bn a year less on key services than they did in 2010, which equates to a cut of \u00a3150m a week.</p> <p>The analysis reveals that the 20 councils with the biggest funding gaps are overwhelmingly metropolitan boroughs in London and the north of England. Of these 18 are controlled by Labour; only one is Conservative-run.</p> <p>In contrast, the 20 councils with the smallest funding cuts are overwhelmingly all Conservative-controlled county councils. Of these, 16 are controlled by the Conservatives and just two are Labour-run.</p> <p>The analysis \u2013 using methodology employed by both the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Centre for Cities \u2013 found that Labour-run Salford Council is spending 38% \u2013 or \u00a399m a year \u2013 less on key local services than a decade ago. That works out to \u00a3479 a year less per resident.</p> <p>Camden Council, also Labour-run, is spending 32% \u2013 \u00a3103m a year \u2013 less than in 2010. That works out as \u00a3620 a year less per resident.</p> <p>In contrast, Conservative-run Surrey Council is spending 7% \u2013 \u00a354m a year \u2013 more on key local services than in 2010, which works out at \u00a311 a year more per resident.</p> <p>Wiltshire Council, a Tory authority, is spending 8%, or \u00a327m a year, more on key local services than in 2010, which works out at \u00a316 a year more per resident.</p> <p>The Local Government Association estimates that in the past eight years, councils in general have lost 60p out of every \u00a31 the government used to provide prior to the funding cuts. This has left councils increasingly reliant on raising income through council tax, business rates and other charges and fees. Urban councils in more deprived areas have found this task more difficult than their rural counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cPoorer parts of England have suffered most from the Conservatives\u2019 local government cuts,\u201d said TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cBy slashing central government funding, they have made deprived areas shoulder the burden of austerity. We need fair and sustainable funding for all of our communities.

      "bodyText": "Drastic cuts to local government funding have seen the UK\u2019s most deprived metropolitan areas \u201cshoulder the burden of austerity\u201d while some more prosperous counties have flourished, according to new research. Analysis by the TUC and public service union Unison of central government funding for local councils in England since 2010 highlights a yawning chasm between urban and rural areas. It shows that , overall, councils in England are spending \u00a37.8bn a year less on key services than they did in 2010, which equates to a cut of \u00a3150m a week. The analysis reveals that the 20 councils with the biggest funding gaps are overwhelmingly metropolitan boroughs in London and the north of England. Of these 18 are controlled by Labour; only one is Conservative-run. In contrast, the 20 councils with the smallest funding cuts are overwhelmingly all Conservative-controlled county councils. Of these, 16 are controlled by the Conservatives and just two are Labour-run. The analysis \u2013 using methodology employed by both the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Centre for Cities \u2013 found that Labour-run Salford Council is spending 38% \u2013 or \u00a399m a year \u2013 less on key local services than a decade ago. That works out to \u00a3479 a year less per resident. Camden Council, also Labour-run, is spending 32% \u2013 \u00a3103m a year \u2013 less than in 2010. That works out as \u00a3620 a year less per resident. In contrast, Conservative-run Surrey Council is spending 7% \u2013 \u00a354m a year \u2013 more on key local services than in 2010, which works out at \u00a311 a year more per resident. Wiltshire Council, a Tory authority, is spending 8%, or \u00a327m a year, more on key local services than in 2010, which works out at \u00a316 a year more per resident. The Local Government Association estimates that in the past eight years, councils in general have lost 60p out of every \u00a31 the government used to provide prior to the funding cuts. This has left councils increasingly reliant on raising income through council tax, business rates and other charges and fees. Urban councils in more deprived areas have found this task more difficult than their rural counterparts. \u201cPoorer parts of England have suffered most from the Conservatives\u2019 local government cuts,\u201d said TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cBy slashing central government funding, they have made deprived areas shoulder the burden of austerity. We need fair and sustainable funding for all of our communities. Key services have been cut to the bone.\u201d Unison general secretary Dave Prentis agreed: \u201cLocal services hold communities together, but nine years of austerity has put paid to that. We\u2019ve seen libraries shut, care visits reduced, allotments and parks sold off, youth centres closed, subsidised bus services scrapped and public conveniences axed. The government\u2019s funding squeeze has forced councils to charge residents more, reduce key services or cut them altogether.

      "body": "<p>We are halfway through the election campaign and the Conservatives lead Labour by roughly 10-12 points. The lessons learned from the 2017 fiasco have been applied, and a more disciplined and focused campaign has produced a lead at half-time which is \u2026 exactly the same as the lead Theresa May held at the same point last time. Yet half-time in this race feels very different to the 2017 midpoint. What has changed?</p> <p>Trajectories matter. In 2017, May\u2019s was already firmly downward \u2013 a lead that peaked at over 20 points soon after the election was called had already been cut in half by this point. A botched manifesto launch, arguments over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto\" title=\"\">\u201cdementia tax\u201d social care proposals </a>and May\u2019s poor performances on the campaign trail had combined to produce a sense of crisis. Conservative polling this time has followed a gentle upward trajectory, like a well-executed jumbo jet takeoff. The campaign has featured the usual smattering of gaffes, wobbles and awkward encounters with angry voters, but nothing serious enough to blow things off course (yet).</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just about campaign \u201cmomentum\u201d. Several things really are breaking the Conservatives\u2019 way. Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-tory-seats-nigel-farage-says\" title=\"\"> stand down Brexit party candidates</a> in Conservative-held seats has given Boris Johnson a headstart in the race to squeeze third-party support, removing a competitor for Leave voters from the board in nearly half the country\u2019s constituencies, and signalling to Leave voters everywhere that Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy is tacitly endorsed by Farage himself.

      "bodyText": "We are halfway through the election campaign and the Conservatives lead Labour by roughly 10-12 points. The lessons learned from the 2017 fiasco have been applied, and a more disciplined and focused campaign has produced a lead at half-time which is \u2026 exactly the same as the lead Theresa May held at the same point last time. Yet half-time in this race feels very different to the 2017 midpoint. What has changed? Trajectories matter. In 2017, May\u2019s was already firmly downward \u2013 a lead that peaked at over 20 points soon after the election was called had already been cut in half by this point. A botched manifesto launch, arguments over the \u201cdementia tax\u201d social care proposals and May\u2019s poor performances on the campaign trail had combined to produce a sense of crisis. Conservative polling this time has followed a gentle upward trajectory, like a well-executed jumbo jet takeoff. The campaign has featured the usual smattering of gaffes, wobbles and awkward encounters with angry voters, but nothing serious enough to blow things off course (yet). This isn\u2019t just about campaign \u201cmomentum\u201d. Several things really are breaking the Conservatives\u2019 way. Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Conservative-held seats has given Boris Johnson a headstart in the race to squeeze third-party support, removing a competitor for Leave voters from the board in nearly half the country\u2019s constituencies, and signalling to Leave voters everywhere that Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy is tacitly endorsed by Farage himself. The Conservatives have gained nearly three points in polling since the announcement, while the Brexit party has fallen by a similar amount. Further Conservative advantages emerge when we dig beneath the headline polling figures. Johnson holds a massive lead over Jeremy Corbyn in favourability ratings and \u201cbest prime minister\u201d questions; while Corbyn\u2019s ratings have ticked upward slightly since the campaign started, there is no sign yet of the dramatic surge he received in 2017. Labour\u2019s image has worsened with voters: it is seen as less competent, more divided, more extreme than it was at this point in the last campaign. The public is also more focused on Brexit than they were in the last election, an important advantage given that the other major issues on voters\u2019 agendas \u2013 the NHS, education and the environment \u2013 are ones that typically favour Labour. And while Leave voters are fast uniting behind the Conservatives, Remain voters are still split. Labour has picked up some ground since the campaign started, but they still win less than half of the Remain vote. Labour Leave voters are switching to the Conservatives in much larger numbers than Conservative Remain voters are going to Labour, a difference that could prove decisive in the Leave-leaning marginals that may decide this election. A constituency poll last week from Great Grimsby, a Labour held marginal that voted 70% Leave in 2016, showed the Conservatives 13 points ahead. So the Conservative leadership will be happy with the state of thingsat the halfway stage. But there is still a long way to go. The same polls that give the Conservatives healthy leads also give them reasons to worry: more voters than ever before think they may change their minds before polling day, and record numbers say they are personally invested in who wins the election.

My ski guide was Peder Rausch, who has lived all of his 60-plus years here. There were relatively few skiers other than myself and Peder, despite it being a Saturday. Scuol\u2019s appeal lies in it being a low-key resort with enough good skiing to cater for all ability levels. It is not afflicted by mass tourism and retains much of the region\u2019s traditional mountain culture and architecture. A wander around the town revealed an attractive old settlement of squat, sturdy stone buildings featuring funnel-shaped windows and ornate wall paintings called sgraffito, all set beneath the slender spire of a church standing atop a rocky outcrop. It was a two-minute bus ride from my hotel back to Scuol station, from where I made my way back to France via Geneva. As with the rest of my trip, every leg of the journey was on schedule \u2013 with never more than a few minutes\u2019 wait between connections; ski storage was easy and, best of all, I enjoyed views almost as spectacular as those I\u2019d seen while skiing. \u2022 The trip was provided by MySwitzerland. An eight-day Swiss Rail travel pass costs \u00a3326 for unlimited travel on trains, buses and boats (four days \u00a3219). Trains from London St Pancras to Geneva take around seven hours, including a change of station in Paris Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "body": "<p>Being very common, I have something of a mania for aristo-lit: a passion for stories about big houses and the wanton eccentrics who inhabit them that began in childhood with Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-secret-garden-9780141385501.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Secret Garden</em></a>, continued into my teenage years with all things Mitford, and now finds ongoing sustenance mostly in diaries (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/24/sir-henry-channon-chips-diaries-final-shelf-life\" title=\"\">Chips Channon</a>, I salute you, and all who sailed in you). Nevertheless, I have to admit to being somewhat unprepared for <em>Lady in Waiting</em>, in which Anne Glenconner muses on her stiff upper lip and how it saw her through a marriage lasting 54 years to a man whose idea of a honeymoon treat was to take her \u2013 a girl who had been a virgin only hours before \u2013 to a fleapit of a hotel to watch two strangers having sex (\u201cThat\u2019s very kind, but no thank you,\u201d she said when invited to join in). Is her memoir a horror show or a delightful entertainment? A manual for how to live, or how <em>not</em> to live? In truth, I\u2019m not sure even she would know the answer to these questions.</p> <p>The eldest child of the fifth Earl of Leicester, Glenconner was maid of honour at the Queen\u2019s coronation and lady-in-waiting to her childhood friend Princess Margaret. She grew up at Holkham Hall in Norfolk \u2013 a house so huge that if the footmen put raw eggs in a bain-marie as they walked from kitchen to nursery, they\u2019d be boiled on arrival \u2013 and, aged 23, married Colin Tennant, later Lord Glenconner, the owner of a Scottish castle called Glen and of the Caribbean island of Mustique. Tennant was, she tells us repeatedly, great fun and <em>so</em> generous. But it can\u2019t have been too much fun when he deliberately trapped her in the fold-up bed in their cabin on a train, or when he took her to a cock fight (one of the cocks attached itself to her head, causing it to bleed; far from being sympathetic, he was furious that she\u2019d ruined the betting).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s impossible not to admire her fortitude as she deals with her fear and her grief</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What of his generosity? Well, there were certainly lots of parties, attended by Bianca Jagger et al. My favourite story, however, involves the visit to Glen of his aesthete kinsman, Stephen Tennant. Uncle Stephen being not at all keen on the purple of the heather, Colin kindly sprinkled the moors with blue paper flowers. \u201cOh, darling!\u201d said Uncle Stephen. \u201cThat\u2019s much better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Glenconner knows that she\u2019s privileged, and if the staff, the houses and the holidays come with a price in the form of a man who lies in the foetal position when he cannot get his own way, and who wears paper knickers (in order to be able to eat them for a party trick), so be it. She can cope. She has a Gypsy caravan into which she can escape when it gets too much \u2013 and later, she takes refuge in her duties for Princess Margaret, that great lover of prawn cocktail and <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>. (HRH, incidentally, is another of those she insists was great fun, in spite of all evidence to the contrary.) Additionally, she has her stoicism \u2013 which is where it all gets interesting. Much as I loved reading about the way, say, that she and her mother, the countess, would gather jackdaw eggs using a ladle attached to a walking stick (apparently, they\u2019re as delicious as plover\u2019s eggs, though since I\u2019ve tasted neither, I can\u2019t possibly comment), after a while there\u2019s no ignoring the painful and widening disjunction between the outward whirl of her life and the repeated tragedies that befall her family.</p> <p>Her first son, Charlie, a heroin addict, dies of hepatitis C. Her second son, Henry, dies of an Aids-related illness at just 29 (as a photo caption helpfully reminds us, her husband informed her that Henry was ill just moments before the couple donned fancy dress for the Peacock Ball they were throwing to celebrate his birthday). Her third son, Christopher, following an accident during his gap year, ends up in a coma for four months; it takes him years to learn to walk again. These are unimaginably terrible events, and it\u2019s impossible not to admire her fortitude as she deals with her fear and her grief; as she patiently sits by Christopher\u2019s bedside, refusing to believe he will never wake up. But as she admits, her two older boys were also the victims of a system, cold and inflexible, that insists on nannies, boarding schools and a certain emotional distance on the part of their parents (\u201cThere I was, immersed in royal life, while my eldest son was running wild,\u201d as she understatedly puts it).</p> <p>As a girl, Glenconner spent years away from her mother and father, having been evacuated during the war; they left her with a nanny who tied her by the wrists to her bed every night before she went to sleep. But though she remembers vividly the pain this caused her, somehow she cannot avoid visiting on her own children a similar fate. When they cry as she drops them at boarding school, she weeps too \u2013 and yet still she drives away. In the end, her book isn\u2019t only a record, funny and sometimes dazzling, of a way of life now almost disappeared. It\u2019s an unwitting examination of English repression: both of how it gets you through and of how it can slay you.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lady in Waiting </em>by Anne Glenconner<em> </em>is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a320).

      "bodyText": "Being very common, I have something of a mania for aristo-lit: a passion for stories about big houses and the wanton eccentrics who inhabit them that began in childhood with Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s The Secret Garden, continued into my teenage years with all things Mitford, and now finds ongoing sustenance mostly in diaries (Chips Channon, I salute you, and all who sailed in you). Nevertheless, I have to admit to being somewhat unprepared for Lady in Waiting, in which Anne Glenconner muses on her stiff upper lip and how it saw her through a marriage lasting 54 years to a man whose idea of a honeymoon treat was to take her \u2013 a girl who had been a virgin only hours before \u2013 to a fleapit of a hotel to watch two strangers having sex (\u201cThat\u2019s very kind, but no thank you,\u201d she said when invited to join in). Is her memoir a horror show or a delightful entertainment? A manual for how to live, or how not to live? In truth, I\u2019m not sure even she would know the answer to these questions. The eldest child of the fifth Earl of Leicester, Glenconner was maid of honour at the Queen\u2019s coronation and lady-in-waiting to her childhood friend Princess Margaret. She grew up at Holkham Hall in Norfolk \u2013 a house so huge that if the footmen put raw eggs in a bain-marie as they walked from kitchen to nursery, they\u2019d be boiled on arrival \u2013 and, aged 23, married Colin Tennant, later Lord Glenconner, the owner of a Scottish castle called Glen and of the Caribbean island of Mustique. Tennant was, she tells us repeatedly, great fun and so generous. But it can\u2019t have been too much fun when he deliberately trapped her in the fold-up bed in their cabin on a train, or when he took her to a cock fight (one of the cocks attached itself to her head, causing it to bleed; far from being sympathetic, he was furious that she\u2019d ruined the betting). What of his generosity? Well, there were certainly lots of parties, attended by Bianca Jagger et al. My favourite story, however, involves the visit to Glen of his aesthete kinsman, Stephen Tennant. Uncle Stephen being not at all keen on the purple of the heather, Colin kindly sprinkled the moors with blue paper flowers. \u201cOh, darling!\u201d said Uncle Stephen. \u201cThat\u2019s much better, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Glenconner knows that she\u2019s privileged, and if the staff, the houses and the holidays come with a price in the form of a man who lies in the foetal position when he cannot get his own way, and who wears paper knickers (in order to be able to eat them for a party trick), so be it. She can cope. She has a Gypsy caravan into which she can escape when it gets too much \u2013 and later, she takes refuge in her duties for Princess Margaret, that great lover of prawn cocktail and Antiques Roadshow. (HRH, incidentally, is another of those she insists was great fun, in spite of all evidence to the contrary.) Additionally, she has her stoicism \u2013 which is where it all gets interesting. Much as I loved reading about the way, say, that she and her mother, the countess, would gather jackdaw eggs using a ladle attached to a walking stick (apparently, they\u2019re as delicious as plover\u2019s eggs, though since I\u2019ve tasted neither, I can\u2019t possibly comment), after a while there\u2019s no ignoring the painful and widening disjunction between the outward whirl of her life and the repeated tragedies that befall her family. Her first son, Charlie, a heroin addict, dies of hepatitis C. Her second son, Henry, dies of an Aids-related illness at just 29 (as a photo caption helpfully reminds us, her husband informed her that Henry was ill just moments before the couple donned fancy dress for the Peacock Ball they were throwing to celebrate his birthday). Her third son, Christopher, following an accident during his gap year, ends up in a coma for four months; it takes him years to learn to walk again. These are unimaginably terrible events, and it\u2019s impossible not to admire her fortitude as she deals with her fear and her grief; as she patiently sits by Christopher\u2019s bedside, refusing to believe he will never wake up. But as she admits, her two older boys were also the victims of a system, cold and inflexible, that insists on nannies, boarding schools and a certain emotional distance on the part of their parents (\u201cThere I was, immersed in royal life, while my eldest son was running wild,\u201d as she understatedly puts it). As a girl, Glenconner spent years away from her mother and father, having been evacuated during the war; they left her with a nanny who tied her by the wrists to her bed every night before she went to sleep. But though she remembers vividly the pain this caused her, somehow she cannot avoid visiting on her own children a similar fate. When they cry as she drops them at boarding school, she weeps too \u2013 and yet still she drives away. In the end, her book isn\u2019t only a record, funny and sometimes dazzling, of a way of life now almost disappeared. It\u2019s an unwitting examination of English repression: both of how it gets you through and of how it can slay you. \u2022 Lady in Waiting by Anne Glenconner is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a320).

The vast majority of this archive had never been published. The curator and writer Lou Stoppard has excavated these boxes and files for a new book, published by Mack, which offers a fresh perspective on the range of Baker\u2019s interests, with pictures taken on family holidays in France, Italy and Japan, as well as those more familiar images from her home city.</p> <p>This picture, taken in 1965 in Manchester, is typical of her eye for the pathos of childhood games. Late in life, Baker recalled how she and her sister had been obsessed with a folding camera that their mother owned, which they were never allowed to play with: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on that camera!\u201d</p> <p>Stoppard notes how close the photographer and her sister were \u2013 they were known as the \u201ctwin Bakers\u201d \u2013 and speculates that this was the reason that Baker\u2019s camera was often drawn to pairs of people, old friends and canoodling couples. Here, certainly, the drama is doubled by making the two girls conspirators in the handbag\u2019s grown-up secrets.</p> <p>In adult life, Baker was, by her daughter\u2019s account, something of a loner, setting off in the morning with her camera in her own handbag, in search of pictures, and often returning after dark. Though Baker was drawn to the play of children in the street, Nan Levy is sad to tell Stoppard that she can hardly recall her mother playing with her outside at all. Photography was her mother\u2019s whole purpose. \u201cThere was never any food on the table, never anything ironed, never any children put to bed.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://mackbooks.co.uk/collections/frontpage/products/shirley-baker-br-lou-stoppard-ed\" title=\"\"><em>Shirley Baker, edited by Lou Stoppard,</em></a><em> is out now </em><em>(Mack, \u00a335)</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Shirley Baker, the great street photographer of Salford and Manchester, died in 2014, aged 82, she left behind a huge archive of negatives and prints in the attic of the house belonging to her daughter, Nan Levy. The vast majority of this archive had never been published. The curator and writer Lou Stoppard has excavated these boxes and files for a new book, published by Mack, which offers a fresh perspective on the range of Baker\u2019s interests, with pictures taken on family holidays in France, Italy and Japan, as well as those more familiar images from her home city. This picture, taken in 1965 in Manchester, is typical of her eye for the pathos of childhood games. Late in life, Baker recalled how she and her sister had been obsessed with a folding camera that their mother owned, which they were never allowed to play with: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on that camera!\u201d Stoppard notes how close the photographer and her sister were \u2013 they were known as the \u201ctwin Bakers\u201d \u2013 and speculates that this was the reason that Baker\u2019s camera was often drawn to pairs of people, old friends and canoodling couples. Here, certainly, the drama is doubled by making the two girls conspirators in the handbag\u2019s grown-up secrets. In adult life, Baker was, by her daughter\u2019s account, something of a loner, setting off in the morning with her camera in her own handbag, in search of pictures, and often returning after dark. Though Baker was drawn to the play of children in the street, Nan Levy is sad to tell Stoppard that she can hardly recall her mother playing with her outside at all. Photography was her mother\u2019s whole purpose. \u201cThere was never any food on the table, never anything ironed, never any children put to bed.\u201d Shirley Baker, edited by Lou Stoppard, is out now (Mack, \u00a335)",

Sometimes I like to put my face in the space between his shoulders and his neck, and breathe in its familiar smell.</p> <p><strong>Fresh air? </strong>We\u2019ve got a 10,000ft mountain at the back of the garden here in Palm Springs, so if we go for a stroll it\u2019s not for nature. We prefer to walk the streets to look at property and go to open houses. I love poking around other people\u2019s homes.</p> <p><strong>Your signature dish? </strong>Sundays are for bacon, always greasy, so brunch is either at <a href=\"http://www.johnsrestaurantpalmsprings.com/\" title=\"\">John\u2019s Restaurant</a> when we\u2019re here, or at a branch of <a href=\"https://www.dennys.com/\" title=\"\">Denny\u2019s</a>.

I\u2019d definitely like to be at home more, but I\u2019m not complaining. Meeting the people who\u2019ve given me success is a pleasure.</p> <p><strong>Do you shop?</strong> One Sunday I arrived home in a car I was test driving to see if Scott liked it. He said it was an old man\u2019s car. I took it back and turned up in another. \u2018It\u2019s sporty and fun,\u2019 he said, \u2018now take it back.\u2019 It was too late, I\u2019d already bought it.</p> <p><strong>How were Sundays spent growing up?</strong> At Gran Barrowman\u2019s council flat in Glasgow with sandwiches and matchbox cards on her swirly carpet. She\u2019d make a Victoria sponge every week without fail. I\u2019m still trying to hunt down the family recipe.</p> <p><strong>Do you have an evening routine?</strong> A cocktail or two at 5pm in the pool - that\u2019s my daily exercise. Then we watch a movie. I\u2019m at an age where I prefer to be sprawled out on the sofa with my husband scratching my feet than anywhere else.</p> <p><em>John Barrowman releases </em><em> A Fabulous Christmas</em><em> on 29</em><em> November on Decca Records.</em></p>",

After an hour I\u2019ll wake Scott up. Sometimes I like to put my face in the space between his shoulders and his neck, and breathe in its familiar smell. Fresh air? We\u2019ve got a 10,000ft mountain at the back of the garden here in Palm Springs, so if we go for a stroll it\u2019s not for nature. We prefer to walk the streets to look at property and go to open houses. I love poking around other people\u2019s homes. Your signature dish? Sundays are for bacon, always greasy, so brunch is either at John\u2019s Restaurant when we\u2019re here, or at a branch of Denny\u2019s. Scott always has a coupon. Do you work? Two weekends a month I\u2019m away at a fan convention: France, Asia, Italy, Scotland. Last week it was Rhode Island. I\u2019d definitely like to be at home more, but I\u2019m not complaining. Meeting the people who\u2019ve given me success is a pleasure. Do you shop? One Sunday I arrived home in a car I was test driving to see if Scott liked it. He said it was an old man\u2019s car. I took it back and turned up in another. \u2018It\u2019s sporty and fun,\u2019 he said, \u2018now take it back.\u2019 It was too late, I\u2019d already bought it. How were Sundays spent growing up? At Gran Barrowman\u2019s council flat in Glasgow with sandwiches and matchbox cards on her swirly carpet. She\u2019d make a Victoria sponge every week without fail. I\u2019m still trying to hunt down the family recipe. Do you have an evening routine? A cocktail or two at 5pm in the pool - that\u2019s my daily exercise. Then we watch a movie. I\u2019m at an age where I prefer to be sprawled out on the sofa with my husband scratching my feet than anywhere else. John Barrowman releases A Fabulous Christmas on 29 November on Decca Records.",

That total was put into context by Australia\u2019s response, a mammoth 580 that effectively rendered this match over inside three days. David Warner cashed in on his homecoming, scoring a first Test century for almost two years and going some way to exorcising the demons of his Ashes failure. But the talking point of this first Test was not Warner, nor Australia\u2019s 13th straight Gabba Test win over Pakistan and not even the no-ball controversy surrounding Mohammad Rizwan\u2019s dismissal on Thursday that will likely grow legs in the coming days. The story of this match was Marnus Labuschagne, whose maiden Test century answered any lingering questions about the composition of Australia\u2019s top order. His 185 was the knock of a man who will be scoring runs for his country long into the future. Pakistan battled gamely to almost make Australia bat again for victory - in Babar Azam and Rizwan there is plenty for Australia to work on - so they will at least head to Adelaide with optimism their best might be good enough. But, as these four days at the Gabba illustrated, a session or two here and there simply won\u2019t do. Pakistan will need to be at the top of their game from start to finish if they are to level this two-match series. Thanks for your company. Let\u2019s do it all again in Adelaide.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94e6d6745c8e0ad92712b26c61a4ec5687b7a50c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e6d6745c8e0ad92712b26c61a4ec5687b7a50c/0_349_4724_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marnus Labuschagne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia\u2019s Marnus Labuschagne will remember this match, and his first Test century, for some time to come.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dda1f668f083aa6d578a128\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T06:22:29.361Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After guiding Australia to their 13th consecutive Test victory over Pakistan at the Gabba, here\u2019s what captain <strong>Tim Paine</strong> has to offer:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cTo score 580, that\u2019s exactly what you want out of your Test batters on a very good wicket. It\u2019s fantastic to see Davey (Warner) back, he obviously had his struggles in England. We knew that when Davey got back to Australia, he\u2019s a different proposition. He played superbly. Everyone in the team was really happy for Marnus (Labuschagne). This was his first Test hundred. He works as hard as anyone, he loves the game of cricket and gives us some real energy. His Ashes in tough conditions was awesome and he looks like he\u2019s getting better and better.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>On Australia\u2019s bowling attack:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cI thought they were pretty good. We hold them to a really high standard, so we would have liked to clean up a little bit quicker today but the two guys in the middle batted really well. We know we\u2019ve got an excellent all-round attack, they\u2019ve taken 20 wickets which they continually do and we\u2019re very lucky to have them.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dda1d498f087b800b6200f5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T06:09:22.115Z\">6.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Josh Hazlewood</strong> took six wickets for the match, including four wickets in the second dig. Here\u2019s what he has to say: </p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always good fun coming back to the Gabba. Getting that extra bounce. I got a few rewards at the end there, and Mitchell Starc too, so all good.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>On Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both really good players and scored quite a few runs.

No century for Rizwan but that was still a fine knock in just his second Test. His 95 is the highest score by a visiting keeper in Tests at the Gabba. Yasir lives dangerously later in the over, sending a leading edge over the slip cordon and it\u2019s Paine, like Rizwan in Australia\u2019s innings, who chases the ball and saves a boundary. Yasir then flat bats Hazlewood down the ground for four. An eventful over, you could say.

The full Starc mixed bag, and no runs scored.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5dd9d91a8f080fd59fb1631e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-11-24T01:14:16.409Z\">1.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>32nd over: Pakistan 97-5 (Babar Azam 36, Rizwan 2) </strong>If you want to get a sense of the bowling accuracy this morning, look at how few runs have been scored to fine leg.

Babar played a shocker of a shot in the first dig and would love to make up for it. So they\u2019ll have the second hour of this morning session in Brisbane in the first instance.

Five went down without much addition to the score, and only a substantial rearguard from Asad Shafiq got them to 240. That could have been competitive had they bowled well, but they missed the control of Mohammad Abbas and weren\u2019t consistent enough to build pressure on Australia\u2019s top three, all of whom made big scores.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s a matter of time, unless Shan Masood and Babar Azam can produce something special. Shan was impressively committed in the first innings and in the field, so perhaps he\u2019ll fight on. Babar has the talent to play a big innings in Australia at some point. More likely, the quality of Cummins, Hazlewood, Starc and Lyon will tell.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "A highly convincing victory for Australia, which was set on its course when Pakistan were held to a mere 240 in their first innings. That total was put into context by Australia\u2019s response, a mammoth 580 that effectively rendered this match over inside three days. David Warner cashed in on his homecoming, scoring a first Test century for almost two years and going some way to exorcising the demons of his Ashes failure. But the talking point of this first Test was not Warner, nor Australia\u2019s 13th straight Gabba Test win over Pakistan and not even the no-ball controversy surrounding Mohammad Rizwan\u2019s dismissal on Thursday that will likely grow legs in the coming days. The story of this match was Marnus Labuschagne, whose maiden Test century answered any lingering questions about the composition of Australia\u2019s top order. His 185 was the knock of a man who will be scoring runs for his country long into the future. Pakistan battled gamely to almost make Australia bat again for victory - in Babar Azam and Rizwan there is plenty for Australia to work on - so they will at least head to Adelaide with optimism their best might be good enough. But, as these four days at the Gabba illustrated, a session or two here and there simply won\u2019t do. Pakistan will need to be at the top of their game from start to finish if they are to level this two-match series. Thanks for your company. Let\u2019s do it all again in Adelaide. After guiding Australia to their 13th consecutive Test victory over Pakistan at the Gabba, here\u2019s what captain Tim Paine has to offer: \u201cTo score 580, that\u2019s exactly what you want out of your Test batters on a very good wicket. It\u2019s fantastic to see Davey (Warner) back, he obviously had his struggles in England. We knew that when Davey got back to Australia, he\u2019s a different proposition. He played superbly. Everyone in the team was really happy for Marnus (Labuschagne). This was his first Test hundred. He works as hard as anyone, he loves the game of cricket and gives us some real energy. His Ashes in tough conditions was awesome and he looks like he\u2019s getting better and better.\u201d On Australia\u2019s bowling attack: \u201cI thought they were pretty good. We hold them to a really high standard, so we would have liked to clean up a little bit quicker today but the two guys in the middle batted really well. We know we\u2019ve got an excellent all-round attack, they\u2019ve taken 20 wickets which they continually do and we\u2019re very lucky to have them.\u201d Josh Hazlewood took six wickets for the match, including four wickets in the second dig. Here\u2019s what he has to say: \u201cIt\u2019s always good fun coming back to the Gabba. Getting that extra bounce. I got a few rewards at the end there, and Mitchell Starc too, so all good.\u201d On Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan: \u201cThey\u2019re both really good players and scored quite a few runs. So we\u2019ll take a look at them and try to figure them out.\u201d Some pockets of resistance from Pakistan today - most notably a couple of great knocks from Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan - but Australia wrap up a convincing win to take a 1-0 series lead. Imran goes out with all guns blazing, driving Starc for four before trying the same again but picking out Wade in the deep. Australia win by an innings and five runs. 84th over: Pakistan 331-9 (Imran Khan 1, Naseem Shah 0) Shaheen keeps on swinging but the middle is hard to find and he gets nowhere near this pull shot, directing a leading edge to Cummins at extra cover. That\u2019s four for Hazlewood now. Just one wicket to go. 83rd over: Pakistan 331-8 (Shaheen Afridi 10, Imran Khan 1) Starc to Shaheen, with a short leg in place. The way Shaheen is swinging, Labuschagne will be grateful for the invention of helmets. And swing he does, past the close-in fielder for one to deep midwicket. Imran then sees Starc off, not with conviction but he does it all the same. Pakistan trail by 9 runs. 82nd over: Pakistan 330-8 (Shaheen Afridi 9, Imran Khan 1) Yasir tries to work Hazlewood though midwicket but succeeds only in sending a leading edge to Wade at extra cover. The end is surely nigh, with the only question being can Pakistan make Australia bat again. Shaheen is certainly doing everything he can to ensure that happens, swinging very hard and sending Hazlewood flying over the slips for four. 81st over: Pakistan 324-7 (Yasir Shah 42, Shaheen Afridi 4) The new ball is taken, not by Cummins but by Starc. Shaheen swings hard and gets off the mark with a boundary through midwicket. Four leg-byes, then four byes off a ball that gained an enormous amount of bounce, follow and Pakistan now trail by 16 runs. 80th over: Pakistan 312-7 (Yasir Shah 42, Shaheen Afridi 0) Hazlewood on for one to blow out the cobwebs before the new ball is due. And his first ball is a loosener but it still gets the wicket, Rizwan helping a wide one over backward point and into the hands of Lyon in the deep. No century for Rizwan but that was still a fine knock in just his second Test. His 95 is the highest score by a visiting keeper in Tests at the Gabba. Yasir lives dangerously later in the over, sending a leading edge over the slip cordon and it\u2019s Paine, like Rizwan in Australia\u2019s innings, who chases the ball and saves a boundary. Yasir then flat bats Hazlewood down the ground for four. An eventful over, you could say. New ball now due. 79th over: Pakistan 305-6 (Rizwan 95, Yasir Shah 36) Gem of a ball from Cummins to beat Yasir with sheer pace and seam movement, which is no mean feat on this deck with a ball 78 overs old. Cummins\u2019 next over will be with the new cherry. He\u2019ll be nice and loose for that. 78th over: Pakistan 303-6 (Rizwan 94, Yasir Shah 35) Yasir leans back, plays nicer and late to send Lyon down to fine leg for two. Rizwan then muffs a paddle sweep, with Labuschagne claiming the catch, diving from short leg. The sift signal is out but the third umpire intervenes and rules that the ball did hit the ground. Not Out! After Rizwan\u2019s no-ball misfortune in the first dig, he deserves this. 77th over: Pakistan 299-6 (Rizwan 91, Yasir Shah 34) Cummins into the attack now. Interesting Cummins will want two overs with the old ball. Usually one ball is enough. He might be thinking otherwise now after Yasir clips him behind square for four. An uppish jab to the on side then lands safely, just in front of mid on. 76th over: Pakistan 293-6 (Rizwan 90, Yasir Shah 29) Lyon beats Rizwan\u2019s outside edge before the batsman picks up two wide of point and then moves into the 90s with a single. 75th over: Pakistan 289-6 (Rizwan 87, Yasir Shah 28) Labuschagne pitches the ball up, trying to draw the drive from Rizwan, and he does get a thick edge. But with just one slip and no gully in place, the threat is non-existent. 74th over: Pakistan 284-6 (Rizwan 83, Yasir Shah 27) Now Yasir gets in on the act, driving Lyon down the ground and carting him over midwicket for two more boundaries. While the ball is old and soft, why the heck not? At this rate, they\u2019ll be in front when the new ball is due. Pakistan trail by 56 runs. 73rd over: Pakistan 276-6 (Rizwan 83, Yasir Shah 19) And we\u2019re back for the final session of day four. Labuschagne to continue with his leggies. Think we\u2019ll see Paine getting to over No.80 as quickly as he can. From Australia\u2019s point of view, the new ball is the promised land. Rizwan gets a full toss but picks out the man in the deep and earns just the one. Last ball, however, he finds the gap at fine-leg and moves into the 80s with a boundary. Cricket\u2019s a funny game, we know that, and StickSports Fan can see the incumbent batsmen carrying on the good work for Pakistan: Take it away, SSF: \u201cYasir Shah scored a fancy half-century in one of the practice matches, with enough technique and temperament which I was unaware he possessed with the willow in hand. Now that Babar is dismissed, one might be tempted to believe that Pakistan will wrap up their innings soon enough. But with Rizwan more than capable to occupy one end, Yasir needs to hold on at the other. Doing so might seem futile for an external viewer, but it isn\u2019t - it will be a moral victory for the team, and a huge boost going into the second Test. So stick out there, guys, we know you can!\u201d If the rest of you need any proof that cricket is indeed a funny game, here you go. A good session for Pakistan, no doubt about that. A total of 124 runs for the loss of one wicket is a good return by anyone\u2019s standards. That wicket, however, belonged to century-maker Babar Azam, and Pakistan are all the more vulnerable now for his absence. That said, Mohammad Rizwan is batting quite beautifully and the visitors will be confident they can continue their war of resistance in the evening session. But the new ball is due in eight overs. How Pakistan handle that, and how Australia use it, will ultimately shape the destiny of this match. 72nd over: Pakistan 268-6 (Rizwan 77, Yasir Shah 17) Last over of the session. Lyon to bowl. Yasir attempts an extravagant sweep but plays so early that the ball actually hits the end of the bat, flush. You don\u2019t see that too often. You do see tea, however, and that is the juncture of day four at which we have arrived. 71st over: Pakistan 268-6 (Rizwan 77, Yasir Shah 17) Labuschagne on now. His first ball, a rank long hop, is sent to the fence by Yasir and Rizwan helps himself to the same later in the over. Thirteen runs from the over. I know Labuschagne is a part-timer, but I counted four looseners there. 70th over: Pakistan 255-6 (Rizwan 72, Yasir Shah 9) Lyon back in the attack now but it\u2019s Rizwan who roars, moving his feet and driving through extra cover for four. Great response from the spinner, who next ball gets one to turn out of a foot mark and takes the inside edge. No wicket but that\u2019ll get the batsman thinking. 69th over: Pakistan 247-6 (Rizwan 66, Yasir Shah 7) Just the single off Hazlewood\u2019s latest offering. Apologies I can\u2019t give you more than that. 68th over: Pakistan 246-6 (Rizwan 65, Yasir Shah 7) Yasir takes one for the team, trying to defend a short one with an angled bat but instead wearing it in the abdomen. Starc then affords Rizwan a little too much width and is punched through the covers for two. A short one is then pulled comfortably for one more before Starc\u2019s radar goes AWOL, and not even Paine can stop this one running away for four byes. Pakistan trail by 94 runs. 67th over: Pakistan 238-6 (Rizwan 62, Yasir Shah 6) Hazlewood on now for Cummins, who looked a bit off in that spell. Just a fraction. First ball, Yasir is trapped on his crease and the question of leg before is asked. But there looks to be an inside edge in play and the appeal is turned down. Yasir then gets a bit of width and drives square for four. 66th over: Pakistan 233-6 (Rizwan 62, Yasir Shah 1) Like an AFL player who kicks a goal and is immediately removed from play, Lyon grabs a wicket and is rewarded with a rest. Starc on now, around the wicket to new batsman Yasir, who gets off the mark with a single. The batsmen then go for a very cheeky single and Yasir is lucky to survive as Wade\u2019s shy at the stumps narrowly misses with the batsman short of his ground. 65th over: Pakistan 230-6 (Rizwan 61, Yasir Shah 0) Cummins again from around the wicket to Rizwan, and again he\u2019s very short. But Rizwan is equal to it, finishing the over with a boundary through backward point. You might recall Abhijato Sensarma writing in yesterday saying Babar Azam stood between Australia and an innings victory. With, Babar now gone, Abhijato has filed again: \u201cJust before the close of play yesterday, I sent in an email where I proposed two thoughts - Babar Azam was what stood between Australia and an innings victory; also, if there was any team in the world which would be able to make the opposition bat again after being in the position they were, it was Pakistan. You rightly responded by saying that I must possess a cricket romantic\u2019s imagination. Alas, Pakistan are any cricket romantic\u2019s sweetheart! The pitch has helped them, but there\u2019s still been the need to show resolve, which these two have shown quite effectively. The occurrence of a fourth innings is surely an unlikely likelihood now ...\u201d 64th over: Pakistan 226-6 (Rizwan 57) Babar\u2019s excellent century comes to and end. Lyon draws the cut shot and either Babr misjudges it or there is a touch of extra bounce. Either way, the edge finds a home in Paine\u2019s gloves and Australia have the breakthrough. That sixth-wicket stand was worth 132 and Pakistan trail by 114 runs. 63rd over: Pakistan 224-5 (Babar Azam 103, Rizwan 56) Cummins continues with customary gusto and bluster, but there looks to be less in it for the quicks on this fourth-day deck. It\u2019s definitely flattening out. He changes to around the wicket to Rizwan, who swoops on a mid-pitcher and collects two. 62nd over: Pakistan 221-5 (Babar Azam 102, Rizwan 54) Paine is chirping away behind the stumps. Something about one of the batsman not changing his gloves. Or something about wet gloves. Honestly, I\u2019m not sure. But he almost had a reason to get genuinely excited on the last ball of Lyon\u2019s over, with Rizwan cutting and missing. That was close to the edge. 61st over: Pakistan 220-5 (Babar Azam 101, Rizwan 54) Cummins persists with the short stuff, with short leg in place, but in most cases they\u2019ve been too high to draw a shot. Now fuller in length, his line deserts him and Rizwan drives for two. A better short ball to end the over takes Rizwan\u2019s interest, but he manages to keep the bat away. 60th over: Pakistan 217-5 (Babar Azam 100, Rizwan 52) Lyon resumes after drinks. First ball, Rizwan goes the sweep shot and as laboured as it is, he still gets enough of it to cross the rope and register his maiden Test fifty. Well played. These two have now put on 123 together, the same number as Pakistan\u2019s deficit - 123. Gratitude and platitudes, Jonathan. And indeed to Mr Lemon before you. Love your work. Well this is better from Pakistan. Though their backs remain against the wall, there\u2019s no reason Pakistan shouldn\u2019t be scoring runs: fourth day on a pancake-good batting deck, shine well and truly off the ball, overhead conditions divine. And, particularly in that first session, perhaps Australia\u2019s field settings might have been a tad more attacking. But when you see Pakistan playing well, as Babar Azam is doing so elegantly, it just makes you look at the flip side (and there\u2019s been plenty of that in this match) and scratch your head. Anyway, let\u2019s see if Pakistan can continue to show some fight and at least make Australia bat again. You know the drill, email me or tweet if you\u2019d like to get involved. Let\u2019s do this thing. Ok, that\u2019s drinks. When play resumes Scott Heinrich will be on the keys. Thanks for your company. 59th over: Pakistan 213-5 (Babar Azam 100, Rizwan 48) Lyon\u2019s brief and unsuccessful spell is ended by the return of Cummins. Babar is nonplussed, spanking an opening bouncer well in front of square for four. That takes him within one shot of a second Test century, and it arrives just three balls later with a classic cover drive! 25-years-old and just at that precious moment in his career when it all comes together at the highest level. 58th over: Pakistan 205-5 (Babar Azam 92, Rizwan 48) That Rizwan v Starc battle just received another highlight. Short and fast from the bowler, aggressive from the batsman, throwing his hands at the ball and watching it fly high and safely to the third-man boundary. Starc responds with more pace just back of a length, forcing Rizwan first to defend smartly but he\u2019s then flashing outside off and almost offering a chance to Paine. 57th over: Pakistan 201-5 (Babar Azam 92, Rizwan 44) Better from Lyon, finding his length from around the wicket to Babar; until he doesn\u2019t. Four probing deliveries are undone by a fifth that\u2019s too short, allowing Babar to pierce the offside field and collect a boundary. 56th over: Pakistan 197-5 (Babar Azam 88, Rizwan 44) Century partnership for the seventh wicket and both batsmen are looking set for handy scores. Rizwan clips Starc off his legs for three then Babar drills the big left-hander through the covers for three more. Starc responds with some extra pace and bounce but for all the oohs and ahs it elicits in the cordon it is not a wicket-taking delivery. 55th over: Pakistan 190-5 (Babar Azam 84, Rizwan 41) Pakistan are refusing to allow Lyon any chance to settle. Both batsmen are using their feet, both looking to score on either side of the wicket, and the outcome is Lyon losing control of his length and adjusting his line from over, to around, then back over the wicket. The highlight of the battle was a crunching four though the covers from Rizwan, pressing forward then rocking back, Ponting-like, before whipcracking the cut shot. 54th over: Pakistan 185-5 (Babar Azam 83, Rizwan 37) Double change for Australia with Starc coming on for his first spell since lunch. It doesn\u2019t change Pakistan\u2019s mindset though with Babar and Rizwan both finding gaps to run singles. The latter then almost comes a cropper midway through the over when he throws his hands at a short and wide delivery that he fails to get on top of, breathing a sigh of relief when it lands just short of the diving point fielder. Rizwan escapes again when he misses a pull shot that skims agonisingly close to his underedge. Starc v Rizwan; one to keep an eye on as this session progresses. 53rd over: Pakistan 183-5 (Babar Azam 82, Rizwan 36) A good time to introduce spin into the afternoon session but Lyon doesn\u2019t settle quickly and both batsmen find singles to keep the scoreboard moving. 52nd over: Pakistan 180-5 (Babar Azam 81, Rizwan 34) Singles apiece take this partnership into the 80s but that\u2019s only the prelude for a Babar slap through the covers that makes the kind of precise sound you imagine might herald the arrival of a unicorn. Glorious timing. It\u2019s just starting to get frustrating for Australia. Hazlewood in particular is stomping around like a man forced to tally untruths in the UK general election campaign. He always seems to be a fielder short somewhere, and his skipper is getting an earful. 51st over: Pakistan 173-5 (Babar Azam 76, Rizwan 32) The first maiden since lunch. Line and length from Cummins; watchful from Babar. 50th over: Pakistan 173-5 (Babar Azam 76, Rizwan 32) Following that narrow escape Babar gets off strike, allowing Rizwan to maintain his brisk strike-rate since lunch, squirting a boundary behind square on the off-side then pushing with hard hands away from his body to squeeze another couple through gully. Oooh, that was very very close. The appeal looked very good until DRS showed the ball hitting the bails within the margin of error for umpire\u2019s call. That could easily have bene given live but as soon as it goes to review the extra bounce of Australian pitches comes into effect. Hazlewood hammers Babar in front with a beauty that nips back from outside off stump but the appeal is declined on-field. 49th over: Pakistan 166-5 (Babar Azam 75, Rizwan 26) This is turning into a handy little counterattack from Pakistan since lunch. Babar exudes class with a drive en pointe through point for three before Rizwan hooks with fast hands for a boundary down to fine-leg. Singles are exchanged and then Cummins slings down a bouncer so short and loose it flies away for five wides. 48th over: Pakistan 152-5 (Babar Azam 71, Rizwan 21) Rizwan continues to keep the scorers busy, but it al feels a bit sketchy. His latest runs come off the top third of his blade after a length delivery from Hazlewood gets bit big on him, the ball scuttling down to third-man. Trigger warning for Pepe Reina: a beach ball has made its way onto the outfield. 47th over: Pakistan 150-5 (Babar Azam 71, Rizwan 19) Cummins shares duties with Hazlewood after lunch. His first delivery is a touch full which allows Rizwan to rotate strike, allowing Babar to cash in on a rare long-hop a few balls later. The Pakistan batsman thrashed one that was short and wide to the cover boundary like a man in complete control of his game. 46th over: Pakistan 145-5 (Babar Azam 67, Rizwan 18) Back underway after lunch with Hazlewood and he\u2019s into his work from the off, getting one to nip back off a length and rap Rizwan in the vicinity of his personal pipe. It makes the right-hander a little skittish and he drives on the up a couple of deliveries later, skewing the ball without control towards the covers, a stroke for which he earns a single. Meanwhile in the WBBL the Strikers required a super over to see off the Thunder. The win sees them move level on points with Heat at the top of the ladder. Sophie Devine was once again the star of the show. Want some more live cricket to keep you sated during the lunch interval? How about New Zealand making England\u2019s life a misery in the first Test at Bay Oval? Records are tumbling like a Simone Biles highlights package. Hello everybody, and thanks Geoff. I\u2019ll be around through the lunch break and the first hour or so of the afternoon session. It\u2019ll be fun watching Babar bat for a bit longer. We knew before the series he was going to be the key man for Pakistan and he\u2019s shown why this morning at the Gabba. A couple more wickets fell in that session, and it looked like Pakistan might subside, but this has been a really good partnership between Babar and Rizwan. Resolute and skilled to see off the premier fast bowlers, and now they\u2019ll have a chance to rest and rest. Shan Masood was good through the first hour too, sticking it out for a while, and Cummins and Hazlewood bowled beautifully. Still Australia\u2019s match to win today, but it\u2019ll be interesting to see if this partnership can push on. Once it gets broken, there\u2019s not much batting to come. I\u2019ll push off now, and Jonathan Howcroft will take over after lunch. 45th over: Pakistan 144-5 (Babar Azam 67, Rizwan 17) Labuschagne to Babar, who drives a run to cover, then Rizwan, who sweeps hard and airborne for a couple of runs to midwicket. Thinks about the third but Babar declines. You just wonder whether Rizwan might run out of patience and play a daft shot at some point. In the meantime, BJ Watling over in New Zealand has been batting for the duration of our lives and still isn\u2019t finished. Rizwan goes back to circumspection with a couple of blocks and a single, and that over takes long enough that we have reached lunch. 44th over: Pakistan 140-5 (Babar Azam 66, Rizwan 14) Lyon twirls through another over, a couple of singles. He\u2019ll probably get one more chance before the break with spin at the other end. 43rd over: Pakistan 138-5 (Babar Azam 65, Rizwan 13) Experiment time, as Marnus Labuschagne comes on to bowl his leg-breaks before the internal. Beats the outside edge early with a ball that zips through, but having gauged the bowling, Babar produces a lovely cover drive for four. Shorter goes Labuschagne, and longer goes Babar! Nearly six, pulled away and it bounces just inside the rope. Well, you can bowl your part-timer, says Babar, and I will feast. That was authoritative. 42nd over: Pakistan 130-5 (Babar Azam 57, Rizwan 13) A very subcontinent shot there, as Babar gets width from Lyon and squats to slap it away down the ground. The sort of shot that he and Kohli both love playing outside off stump against spin. Three runs for Babar this time, as lunch approaches. 41st over: Pakistan 127-5 (Babar Azam 54, Rizwan 13) Fifty for Babar! Lovely shot to bring it up. His first fifty in Australia, his 11th overall. He\u2019d love to turn it into his second century. He made 99 against Australia last year in Abu Dhabi. Starc gives him a nice short length, and Babar with the angle slays the cut shot for four. He waves briefly to acknowledge the applause, then resumes to pull a single. Short again to Rizwan, and he carves away a couple of runs behind point. Short for a fourth time, and another boundary, this time for Rizwan. Pulled away with authority, and Starc\u2019s over goes for 11. 40th over: Pakistan 116-5 (Babar Azam 49, Rizwan 7) Three singles from the Lyon over. Tim Paine gave a roasting to Joe Burns in that over, who threw in from the boundary. You can hear Paine very clearly on the ABC broadcast via the stump mics. \u201cHorrible throw,\u201d you heard Paine say, then call out to Burns with a degree of satire, \u201cGreat arm, Burnsy. Rocket arm.\u201d Enjoying themselves out there. 39th over: Pakistan 113-5 (Babar Azam 47, Rizwan 6) Starc down leg side again, outside off again, back to leg stump. Gets away with the first one, Babar punches two runs from the second, then a single from the third. Babar continues to awaken from his long morning sleep. 38th over: Pakistan 110-5 (Babar Azam 44, Rizwan 6) Lyon to Rizwan, a maiden as the Pakistani keeper-batsman is happy to just drop the ball at his feet and have a good long look. 37th over: Pakistan 110-5 (Babar Azam 44, Rizwan 6) Brilliant from Wade. That should be a boundary for Rizwan as he drives, but Wade dives across and deflects it to mid-on where Cummins is. Keeps it to one run. Babar is able to find scoring chances from Starc more easily than Cummins or Hazlewood, reaching and guiding a ball through gully for a couple of runs. 36th over: Pakistan 107-5 (Babar Azam 42, Rizwan 5) Talk about looking more comfortable against spin. Babar gets a do-over against Lyon\u2019s short ball. The first one he cuts straight to the field, the second one he cuts wider and through for four. A deep breath of relief for the batsman with that boundary. He\u2019s survived the tough pace examination well. 35th over: Pakistan 103-5 (Babar Azam 38, Rizwan 5) Starc to Rizwan, two action players, should be a good contest. Width to the right-hander to start, angled across him from over the wicket, left alone. Pitches up, Rizwan drives through cover and will belt back for three. That\u2019s his go, love this. Babar has to defend from back of a length, then defend a yorker. You have to be on your toes, because Starc will be on them otherwise. Then the bouncer for the full set, Babar swaying away, before taking a leg bye from the last ball. 34th over: Pakistan 99-5 (Babar Azam 38, Rizwan 2) Double change, with Lyon on for Hazlewood. Babar looks happier immediately, dropping back in his crease to make room to work two runs through square leg. Except his scoring rate to tick up. 33rd over: Pakistan 97-5 (Babar Azam 36, Rizwan 2) A bowling change, Mitchell Starc is on. Immediately there\u2019s an uptick in deliveries on leg stump. But one of them nearly produces a wicket, Rizwan gloving on the bounce through to Paine. There\u2019s also inswing and pace and a variety of lengths. The full Starc mixed bag, and no runs scored. 32nd over: Pakistan 97-5 (Babar Azam 36, Rizwan 2) If you want to get a sense of the bowling accuracy this morning, look at how few runs have been scored to fine leg. Babar gets one here from Hazlewood, and it\u2019s a rare gift for him to get off strike. Rizwan is a little more proactive, punching into a gap at cover for a run. 31st over: Pakistan 95-5 (Babar Azam 35, Rizwan 1) Cummins again, and Rizwan is happy to treat him with respect. A series of leaves, blocks, and a duck for the bouncer. Another maiden for Cummins, five in his dozen overs now. Two wickets for 24 for him. 30th over: Pakistan 95-5 (Babar Azam 35, Rizwan 1) Babar takes a single, Hazlewood takes a wicket. Easy as that. Rizwan comes to the middle along with the drinks trolley. A nice way to start your innings. Not much left in this match now for Pakistan except for these two to make a statement. Rizwan played really well in the first innings and was unlucky to be given out off what should have been called a no-ball. Babar played a shocker of a shot in the first dig and would love to make up for it. So they\u2019ll have the second hour of this morning session in Brisbane in the first instance. Hazlewood finishes the over after the break, and Rizwan almost ends his resistance very early by chopping onto the stumps. He\u2019s off the mark. Pakistan trail by 236. That didn\u2019t last long. A decent delivery from Hazlewood but nothing more than that. On off stump, moving away a touch, and it draws the pointless push and the edge behind. Now we\u2019ll get the entertainment of Mohammad Rizwan, after drinks. 29th over: Pakistan 93-4 (Babar Azam 34, Iftikhar 0) The new batsman is Iftikhar Ahmed, the all-rounder who bowls some off-spin for Pakistan. A short leg comes in so that Cummins can keep bouncing. Iftikhar sees it out, and it\u2019s a wicket maiden. The pull shot eventually proves his undoing! A bit of a nothing delivery, the short ball is heading down leg side and Masood just wants to help it on its way. The right choice of shot but he just doesn\u2019t execute, a bit late and instead of knocking it to ground he just nudges it through to the wicketkeeper. Cummins a bit fortunate with that particular ball, but it\u2019s been a fine spell leading up to it. 28th over: Pakistan 93-3 (Shan Masood 42, Babar Azam 34) Masood keeps playing the pull shot well, almost every time the bowlers have gone short. Such a useful shot when it can help you rotate strike against aggressive deliveries. Babar is becalmed for the last four balls again, but he\u2019s also almost castled by one of them, cutting into him and keeping low. That variable bounce again. 27th over: Pakistan 92-3 (Shan Masood 41, Babar Azam 34) Cummins to Masood again, and again bowls a beauty that sizzles past the outside edge again. This is some display of fast bowling, but Masood has survived so far. Leaves the next ball, ducks a bouncer, then find another run to the leg side. Nudge, run. 26th over: Pakistan 91-3 (Shan Masood 40, Babar Azam 34) Hazlewood continues, Masood in his sights, but again the batsman escapes early. He\u2019s been managing this innings well, keeping his score moving. Babar has found it harder to work the ball around. Leaves or blocks for the most part. 25th over: Pakistan 90-3 (Shan Masood 39, Babar Azam 34) Cummins nearly gets his man! Past the edge of Masood, that one bounces a lot from a fullish length and zings past the batsman chest-high. Variable bounce is the last thing Pakistan need. But I guess it is day four. Masood manages to get off strike with a midwicket single. Relief for him, annoyance for Cummins. The quarry has escape. Babar sees out the rest of the over. 24th over: Pakistan 89-3 (Shan Masood 38, Babar Azam 34) Hazlewood continues his working over of Babar. Off stump, off stump, leaving him, holding the line. From the fourth ball Babar pushes through cover and might have got a boundary, but Wade sprints back to support his bowler and keeps it to two. Then JH drops short and Babar pulls him, in the air but evading the midwicket catcher by enough. Just enough. Four runs. 23rd over: Pakistan 83-3 (Shan Masood 38, Babar Azam 28) Four for Shan Masood! A bit streaky, driving at Cummins who is bowling around the wicket to the left-hander, driven through backward point. Could easily have gone wrong, but it comes off this time. He plays the pull shot well a couple of balls later though. A bit of height around Shan, and he got over the ball. 22nd over: Pakistan 77-3 (Shan Masood 32, Babar Azam 28) Now Hazlewood gets his chance, with Lyon dragged after that expensive over. Time to turn the screws, Paine decides. Babar is determinedly defending. It\u2019s swinging a bit for the Hoff as he pitches up. Flirts with the outside edge of Babar a couple of times, once along the ground, twice beating the bat entirely. Top over. 21st over: Pakistan 77-3 (Shan Masood 32, Babar Azam 28) Another close one for Shan, who pushes at Cummins and edges him into the cordon. Went at it softly and so the edge didn\u2019t carry. Another maiden for Cummins. 20th over: Pakistan 77-3 (Shan Masood 32, Babar Azam 28) Shan Masood is nearly caught! Premeditates a wipe against Lyon, down the ground but not to the pitch, and hits it airborne. Burns dives across at mid-off and fingertips it away, mid air. Shan takes three, Babar comes on strike. Two runs for him square of the wicket, then goes back to cut a boundary through point, and returns to the leg side for two more. The over costs 11. Confidence booster, despite the near miss. 19th over: Pakistan 66-3 (Shan Masood 29, Babar Azam 20) Pat Cummins to start from the other end, outside Babar\u2019s off stump and left alone. Gets one that seems to jump at him, that might be a factor as the day wears on. He\u2019s not looking composed outside off, following up with an inside edge into the pads. A maiden for Cummins. 18th over: Pakistan 66-3 (Shan Masood 29, Babar Azam 20) Nathan Lyon starts the day, probably to allow Josh Hazlewood to swing around to the other end to where he was bowling last night, is the theory from Jason Gillespie on ABC Grandstand. Shan Masood starts with a cut shot for a couple of runs. Lots of chatter from the Australians coming through the stump mics, with Warner prominent as always. Everything is above board though for now. Remember you can email me at geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or find me on Twitter using @GeoffLemonSport. Here is our twin OBO of England\u2019s ongoing Test over in New Zealand, where Watling is still batting. Also India are playing a day-night Test against Bangladesh, where Virat Kohli last night made his 70th international ton. As you do. Here is the wires report of the day from yesterday if you want more details. Here we are again, for what should surely be the last day of this Test match, even if it\u2019s only the fourth. Pakistan are already three wickets down and a million runs behind (276 if you\u2019re counting), and Australia\u2019s bowlers had a good night\u2019s sleep after a brief frolic yesterday evening following two days with their feet up. Pakistan haven\u2019t been in this match since lunch on the first day, when their stubborn opening stand turned into a collapse of top-order wickets. Five went down without much addition to the score, and only a substantial rearguard from Asad Shafiq got them to 240. That could have been competitive had they bowled well, but they missed the control of Mohammad Abbas and weren\u2019t consistent enough to build pressure on Australia\u2019s top three, all of whom made big scores. Now it\u2019s a matter of time, unless Shan Masood and Babar Azam can produce something special. Shan was impressively committed in the first innings and in the field, so perhaps he\u2019ll fight on. Babar has the talent to play a big innings in Australia at some point. More likely, the quality of Cummins, Hazlewood, Starc and Lyon will tell.",

      "body": "<p>Steady rain for near endless days, wet leaves littered like old confetti. I want to do stuff at the allotment, but the ground is still sodden. I am exiled by wet. It\u2019s not that there are many chores \u2013 it is November after all. But the red tagetes are soaked and fallen and I want to save the plant\u2019s seed. I have carried it with me for a dozen years now. Maybe more than any other, it feels important to keep it alive.</p> <p>It came to me almost by accident, in a mixed batch from Lila Towle at the Danish Seed Savers. Originally found at the Danish Agricultural Museum, and thought to be German in origin, it was renamed Ildkongen (Fire King).</p> <p>I adopted it as a memory seed: a marigold akin to my brother Christopher\u2019s first flowers. I see strains close to it becoming available on small seed sites. Great Dixter has one that\u2019s close. But it is (whisper it) not quite as good. A red velvet face like ceremonial robes, its back is as beautiful and gilded. I have grown it since we first started on the plot.</p> <p>Seed saves better when the plant is dry, particularly with flowers. But there is little chance of that. I have been hoping for crisp frost. But the wet has been insistent. The flowers flattened. I worry about rot.</p> <p>I was never one for endless patience, a flaw in a gardener \u2013 particularly one with a day job when days have shortened to near dark before and after work. Reduced now to Saturdays and Sundays.</p> <p>So I am hoping for dry today to pick through flower heads, to gather memories and marigolds. To pack both away in a warm, dry, safe place. To care for them until another year, another spring. To sow them later than my impatience calls, when the soil is again warm and the sun is high.</p> <p><em>Allan Jenkins\u2019s Morning (4th Estate, \u00a38.99) is out now.

      "bodyText": "Steady rain for near endless days, wet leaves littered like old confetti. I want to do stuff at the allotment, but the ground is still sodden. I am exiled by wet. It\u2019s not that there are many chores \u2013 it is November after all. But the red tagetes are soaked and fallen and I want to save the plant\u2019s seed. I have carried it with me for a dozen years now. Maybe more than any other, it feels important to keep it alive. It came to me almost by accident, in a mixed batch from Lila Towle at the Danish Seed Savers. Originally found at the Danish Agricultural Museum, and thought to be German in origin, it was renamed Ildkongen (Fire King). I adopted it as a memory seed: a marigold akin to my brother Christopher\u2019s first flowers. I see strains close to it becoming available on small seed sites. Great Dixter has one that\u2019s close. But it is (whisper it) not quite as good. A red velvet face like ceremonial robes, its back is as beautiful and gilded. I have grown it since we first started on the plot. Seed saves better when the plant is dry, particularly with flowers. But there is little chance of that. I have been hoping for crisp frost. But the wet has been insistent. The flowers flattened. I worry about rot. I was never one for endless patience, a flaw in a gardener \u2013 particularly one with a day job when days have shortened to near dark before and after work. Reduced now to Saturdays and Sundays. So I am hoping for dry today to pick through flower heads, to gather memories and marigolds. To pack both away in a warm, dry, safe place. To care for them until another year, another spring. To sow them later than my impatience calls, when the soil is again warm and the sun is high. Allan Jenkins\u2019s Morning (4th Estate, \u00a38.99) is out now.

In a statement released on Sunday afternoon the Westpac chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, reiterated the bank\u2019s \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d for the failings identified by the financial intelligence agency, Austrac, earlier this week, which included potentially facilitating child exploitation. Maxsted said executive bonuses, granted through the bank\u2019s \u2018short term variable reward\u2019 would be either partly or entirely withheld as the bank attempts to recover from one of its most damaging PR weeks since the banking royal commission. Austrac has levelled more than 23m breaches of Westpac\u2019s duty to uphold anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance laws, in transactions topping $11bn. The board, including Maxsted and the chief executive, Brian Hartzer, have so far resisted calls to step down following the scandal, despite the widespread shock and condemnation in response to the Austrac allegations. Ahead of the bank\u2019s annual general meeting next month, and following Frydenberg\u2019s comments that the banking regulator was looking at using legislation to disqualify the board, Maxsted released the bank\u2019s three-step response, referred to as \u2018the plan\u2019. \u201cWe are determined to urgently fix these issues and lift our standards to ensure our anti-money laundering and other financial crime processes are industry leading,\u201d Maxsted said. \u201cAs a major bank we play a critical role in helping law enforcement agencies prevent criminals from carrying out illegal activity.\u201d Maxsted said the bank was working on \u201cimmediate fixes\u201d, which included closing the payment service alleged to have been used in some transactions identified as part of Austrac\u2019s investigation, \u201clifting our standards\u201d through cross-industry data sharing and \u201cprotecting people \u2013 including investments to reduce the human impact of financial crime\u201d. Of the 23m transactions, it was a handful of relatively small amounts of money which have created the biggest shockwaves, with Austrac accusing the bank of allowing a dozen customers to send money to the Philippines, despite warning signs they were consistent with transfers made to people involved in child exploitation.

Westpac has been accused of failing in its duty to ensure its programs detect transactions for illegal activity, as part of a global bid to shut down money trails. Both the government and opposition have walked the line in expressing shock and distress at the allegations raised as part of the Austrac investigation, while maintaining political distance at what the future should hold for the board. Frydenberg appeared on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning to say the independent regulator was looking at what mechanisms it could use in response to the investigation. \u201cNow Apra has the ability \u2013 under the banking executive accountability regime \u2013 to disqualify boards and to disqualify executives where there\u2019s a failure to appropriately enforce and uphold the duties under the legislation. \u201cThat legislation came into force in 2018. It\u2019s not retrospective, and some of those alleged breaches date back to 2013. But the anti-money laundering laws are a proscribed activity under Apra, and I know Apra are looking at it.\u201d Westpac has attempted to get ahead of the response by releasing a list of actions it has already completed, including correcting its non-reporting issues, consolidating its crime detective units, and developing a \u201cfinancial crime strategic plan\u201d, which included appointments from outside the bank. \u201cHowever the allegations indicated that there are still unacceptable shortcomings in this area and the board understands the need for action and accountability,\u201d Maxsted said. \u201cWe accept that we have fallen short of both our own and regulators\u2019 standards and are determined to get all the facts and access accountability.\u201d Westpac could also face fines of up to $500m for its failures, if proven. But it is the individual consequences, including job losses, which has gripped the national conversation in the days following the Austrac announcement. Frydenberg told the ABC he thought it too early to conclude who would or wouldn\u2019t survive the scandal, but said he expected some action would result from the bank\u2019s general meeting early next month. \u201cThey\u2019ve got an AGM on December 12,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some tough conversations between now and then. The board, management, they\u2019re all seized on this issue and they\u2019re now going through a process. But with Apra providing additional focus, as well as Austrac, certainly the heat is on the company.\u201d The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said on Sunday: \u201cThese are extremely serious and concerning allegations by Austrac against Westpac. \u201cThe scale of the alleged breaches are astounding and appalling. \u201cMoney laundering finances international crime syndicates, child exploitation and terrorist organisations. The big banks must do their bit to ensure that they are not a part of it.\u201d",

They claim to serve more than 1m steaks a year, though perhaps they\u2019re being modest. Since they launched in 2006, they have grown to 116 branches. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\" title=\"\">Hawksmoor</a> sells 750,000 steaks a year on just eight sites, we can assume this lot shift considerably more.</p> <p>I went to the outpost inside the redbrick warehouse buildings at Liverpool\u2019s Albert Dock. There\u2019s a flag-stoned floor, dark wood tables, a plate-glass wall looking out over the water and a lot of very smiley people working front of house who appear to mean it. They may ask you if you\u2019ve got anything nice planned for the rest of the day, without forcing your mouth into a rictus grin in response. They do not come across as staff who have been chained to a radiator for a month, while being made to watch a badly compiled customer relations PowerPoint on a loop.</p> <p>The menu is a thick piece of crisp, cream-coloured card with a bit of gold embossing of the sort you get on fancy barmitzvah invitations. At the top are starters. At the bottom is the \u201csteak experience\u201d. It\u2019s a model of conciseness. Until you turn the card over and find a terrifying array of further mains.

There are also troubling recommendations that both the rib-eye and rump should be served medium.

Only the fillet is proposed rare.</p> <p>Because I am a completist, I order the Butchers Block 26oz from the list headed \u201cultimate sharing experience\u201d for \u00a363.50.

I would even edge towards very good. Their version of medium is my medium rare. They are seared outside and a luscious pink inside. It\u2019s also quality beef, with tension and flavour. It\u2019s a relief. Given that eating steak can be controversial \u2013 watch the comments stack up below this review online; warm your hands on their righteous anger; join in, if you have the stamina \u2013 it would be hugely dispiriting if 116 steak houses were killing the animals twice. Curiously, the fillet is cut quite thin rather than served as a classic cylinder. I suspect that\u2019s because cooking a thick disc correctly is tricky. In this form it\u2019s 90 seconds a side. There\u2019s also an exceedingly good beef dripping gravy \u2013 one that I could quite happily sip neat from a brandy schooner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90505314d590b21153f8ece10f44c721e8cd6f61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90505314d590b21153f8ece10f44c721e8cd6f61/672_602_4271_2563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Naturally, it comes on a slate\u2019: dessert sharing platter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Naturally, it comes on a slate\u2019: dessert sharing platter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanna Shaw/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Price is interesting. I converted the weights and then compared them to Hawksmoor. Both charge around \u00a312 per 100g for fillet. Hawksmoor is cheaper for sirloin at \u00a37.75 as against \u00a38.22 here, and more expensive for rib-eye at \u00a38.25 as against \u00a37.20. However, at Hawksmoor you only get the steak. At Miller &amp; Carter, the price includes an iceberg wedge, a sauce and fries each. That makes it much cheaper.</p> <p>Or at least it would, if the extras were all nice. Yes, that gravy is very good. The b\u00e9arnaise, however, is so loose it looks like something to which a course of antibiotics should be administered immediately. The \u201conion loaf\u201d is a sponge for the vegetable oil which was clearly never hot enough. And let us never speak again of the halloumi fries. They just can\u2019t do deep frying here. The bacon crumb with one of the iceberg wedges is undercooked; it needs to be crisp. And the promising \u201cbeef dripping jacket chips\u201d are sad, lumpy halves of undercooked, underpeeled potato. There\u2019s a lot of this uneven quality. On a starter sharing platter the macaroni cheese is a model of its kind. The spiced rum BBQ chicken wings are as they\u2019re meant to be: a hit of sweet and sticky. Flabby miniature Yorkshires stuffed with pulled beef are an idea that should never have left the test kitchen.</p> <p>A dessert sharing platter is a bunch of things with the uniformity of confectionary bought in from elsewhere: a mash-soft brownie, a bunch of macarons, a little sorbet. Naturally, it comes on a slate. The wine list includes organic verdejo so is bang up to date. And so, to a verdict: if you live near a Hawksmoor and crave steak, I\u2019d advise you to spend the extra there. But most people don\u2019t live near a Hawksmoor. In which case Miller &amp; Carter really is a fair option. Just order damn carefully. </p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Keeping with the chain theme, my extra recommendation this week is an obscure outfit called Nando\u2019s. OK, not exactly unheard of. But I only recently tried their stir-fried chicken livers and they\u2019re a marvel: sweet and meaty with caramel tones, plus a peri peri kick according to taste. If I\u2019d had them at an independent, I\u2019d not think twice about raving. Hence, I\u2019m doing so now (<em><a href=\"https://www.nandos.co.uk/\">nandos.co.uk</a></em>).<br><br>The homelessness charity Caring in Bristol has joined forces with a group of local chefs for its Caring At Christmas initiative, a pop-up shelter across the festive period for people living on the streets. High quality meals will be provided across seven days by the likes of Romy Gill, Josh Eggleton of The Pony and Trap and Elliott and Tess Lidstone from Box-E (<em><a href=\"https://caringinbristol.co.uk/\">caringinbristol.co.uk</a></em>).<br><br>Congrats to Franklin\u2019s in East Dulwich, which celebrates 20 years in business on 29 November. To mark it Tim Sheehan, head chef throughout, will be serving his opening night menu at 1999 prices, including smoked quail and celeriac remoulade at \u00a36.50 and whole plaice for \u00a312.50 (<em><a href=\"http://www.franklinsrestaurant.com/\">franklinsrestaurant.com</a></em>).</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

The bacon crumb with one of the iceberg wedges is undercooked; it needs to be crisp. And the promising \u201cbeef dripping jacket chips\u201d are sad, lumpy halves of undercooked, underpeeled potato. There\u2019s a lot of this uneven quality. On a starter sharing platter the macaroni cheese is a model of its kind. The spiced rum BBQ chicken wings are as they\u2019re meant to be: a hit of sweet and sticky. Flabby miniature Yorkshires stuffed with pulled beef are an idea that should never have left the test kitchen. A dessert sharing platter is a bunch of things with the uniformity of confectionary bought in from elsewhere: a mash-soft brownie, a bunch of macarons, a little sorbet. Naturally, it comes on a slate. The wine list includes organic verdejo so is bang up to date. And so, to a verdict: if you live near a Hawksmoor and crave steak, I\u2019d advise you to spend the extra there. But most people don\u2019t live near a Hawksmoor. In which case Miller &amp; Carter really is a fair option. Just order damn carefully. News bites Keeping with the chain theme, my extra recommendation this week is an obscure outfit called Nando\u2019s. OK, not exactly unheard of. But I only recently tried their stir-fried chicken livers and they\u2019re a marvel: sweet and meaty with caramel tones, plus a peri peri kick according to taste. If I\u2019d had them at an independent, I\u2019d not think twice about raving. Hence, I\u2019m doing so now (nandos.co.uk). The homelessness charity Caring in Bristol has joined forces with a group of local chefs for its Caring At Christmas initiative, a pop-up shelter across the festive period for people living on the streets. High quality meals will be provided across seven days by the likes of Romy Gill, Josh Eggleton of The Pony and Trap and Elliott and Tess Lidstone from Box-E (caringinbristol.co.uk). Congrats to Franklin\u2019s in East Dulwich, which celebrates 20 years in business on 29 November. To mark it Tim Sheehan, head chef throughout, will be serving his opening night menu at 1999 prices, including smoked quail and celeriac remoulade at \u00a36.50 and whole plaice for \u00a312.50 (franklinsrestaurant.com).

Xy and three other men died: 38-year-old Kou Xiong, 31-year-old Phia Vang and 40-year-old Kalaxang Thao. Six other people were injured. All of the victims were members of the Central Valley\u2019s Hmong community, a tight-knit group of families who came to California as refugees fleeing war, tragedy and violence in south-east Asia.

Now, we\u2019re seeing it happen in this country.\u201d There are now an estimated 300,000 Hmong Americans, with roughly 34,000 living in Fresno, home to the second largest Hmong community in the country.

Xai, the father, said he didn\u2019t want retribution for his son\u2019s killer, but he wanted the person found and brought to justice \u2013 so he could ask him why he did it. \u2018The Hmong people are very resilient\u2019 As the families begin to prepare for funerals, many in the Hmong community are desperate to know who was responsible \u2013 and what the motive possibly could have been. No one seems to have answers. Pao Yang, the director of the Fresno Center, a not-for-profit working with the victims\u2019 families, said the comments from the Fresno police chief had been upsetting: \u201cThe community is coming together. There are so many good deeds \u2026 This is not an Asian gang.\u201d Still, the lack of information has left people terrified, said Nou Xiong, the reporter: \u201cIf people have a backyard, is someone just gonna walk in and shoot?\u201d Katie Moua, a 25-year-old Hmong organizer in Fresno, said some youth were trying to reassure their parents and grandparents that they weren\u2019t in danger, and that she was worried they were returning to a time when Hmong families felt unsafe or uncomfortable in these neighborhoods. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard to be free. We\u2019ve worked so hard to feel pride in our identity and our city,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope people can still find a way to continue to live how they were living and \u2026 find things to celebrate this season.\u201d Leng Thao, the cousin of one of the victims, said the community would find a way forward: \u201cThe Hmong people are very resilient. This tragedy has not weakened us, but actually strengthened us \u2026 and reinforced those bonds.\u201d Standing in the cold outside the home where his son Kou was killed, Cha Lee Xiong struggled to find the words to thank the community. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this mass killing will be the last one,\u201d he said, adding that he wanted to send a message to people outside of the Hmong community: \u201cIf it happens to your family, I will be there to support you.\u201d",

On 15 November, Trump\u2019s longtime friend and confidant Roger Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He faces a maximum of 50 years in prison. Stone will be only the most recent in a long line of Trump cronies to go to jail. Late last year, Trump\u2019s personal attorney and \u201cfixer\u201d Michael Cohen was convicted of multiple crimes including campaign finance violations in connection with hush-money payments to a porn star. He is now behind bars. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is also in prison. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, will be sentenced in December. Former foreign policy advisor George Papadopolous has already served time. This list doesn\u2019t even include the Star Wars cantina dredged up by Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, including Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, both of whom were recently arrested on campaign finance charges. Not to mention Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, whose released emails reveal the warped mind of a racist nationalist. Trump has surrounded himself not with the best and most serious but with the worst and most dangerous: thugs, liars and white supremacists. And yet in recent weeks, others in the Trump administration have shown themselves to be among the best and most honorable public servants in America, though Trump doesn\u2019t see them that way. I\u2019m talking about the career officials who have come before the House intelligence committee and, with dignity and restraint, confirmed Trump\u2019s abuses of power. Lt Col Alexander Vindman explained that he reported Trump\u2019s 25 July phone call seeking Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s help in digging up dirt on Biden \u201cout of a sense of duty\u201d, because it was \u201cimproper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a US citizen and political opponent\u201d.

Some are highly decorated military officers. In coming forth, they have shown remarkable courage and patriotism. Yet, true to form, Trump and his lackeys attack them. During Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony, Trump tweeted that \u201ceverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad\u201d, blaming her for a civil war in Somalia that started before she was posted there. When Vindman testified, the White House tweeted that his former boss had concerns about his judgment. Republican senator Ron Johnson said Vindman \u201cfits the profile\u201d of \u201cbureaucrats\u201d who have \u201cnever accepted President Trump as legitimate\u201d. Fox News accused him of having \u201cdual loyalties\u201d and committing \u201cespionage\u201d because he fled what is now Ukraine with his family, when he was three years old.

Douglas Adams noted in <em>The Salmon of Doubt</em> that attempts by wealthy countries to stop poorer ones wrecking their natural resources in the way we\u2019ve already ruined ours are a little hypocritical. Fortunately, this can be overcome.</p> <p>Harvard biologist EO Wilson\u2019s <em>The Diversity of Life</em> noted the huge potential for carefully using rainforests without wrecking them; he even calculated the economic benefits, and such an approach works in other areas eg restocking fisheries, silviculture and restoring US agri-deserts to grassland with bison grazing it. Tribal peoples have shown for thousands of years that conservation can be combined with careful use; we can\u2019t all live like that but the lesson is still valid. The problem is money: everybody wants something done, provided their wallet, convenience and choice are not affected.<br><strong>Iain Climie</strong><br>Whitchurch, Hants<br></p> <p>Your special report is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand what has happened and is happening in the Amazon rainforest and why it matters. Land-grabbers are destroying the habitats of birds and animals and robbing indigenous tribes of their homes and livelihoods. The Amazon contains the biggest rainforest on the planet. As your excellent report says: \u201cRainforests... should be put at the heart of discussions at the United Nations climate talks that will be held in Madrid next month.\u201d<br><strong>Penelope Maclachlan</strong><br>London W7<br></p> <h2>How to get the young to vote <br></h2> <p>While I was heartened to read that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/17/view-from-uxbridge-young-voters-battle-to-oust-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">\u201cYouth vote is key to ousting Johnson from his own seat\u201d</a> (News), by Tuesday I was dismayed to learn that one in three young people aged 18-24 have <a href=\"https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/media-centre/young-people-risk-missing-their-chance-vote\" title=\"\">not yet registered to vote</a> according to the Electoral Commission. The boomer generation has repeatedly been accused of betraying the young, as if we are all Leavers and they are all Remainers. Everyone who attended People\u2019s Vote rallies or last month\u2019s Let Us Be Heard march in London will know that all generations were well represented.</p> <p>If 3,000 voters have turned 18 in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency since the June 2017 election, how many have done so since June 2016? How many older voters have become incapacitated in the same period? Will the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/brits-who-didnt-vote-in-the-eu-referendum-now-wish-they-voted-against-brexit-a7326401.html\" title=\"\">13m who didn\u2019t vote</a> in the referendum have a strong preference now that we have a better idea of what Brexit entails?</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s one-year time limit for negotiating detailed agreements with the EU makes a no-deal Brexit very likely. Although there may be a majority for this outcome no one voted for it, so a confirmatory vote is essential. The young who wish to have their say can only do so by registering to vote by Tuesday and subsequently voting tactically in the general election. Do aim to at least double your generation\u2019s poor 40% turnout in the EU referendum rather than bemoan the fact that other groups are more motivated. <br><strong>Graham Rex</strong><br>Swansea</p> <h2>Russian-occupied Crimea?<br></h2> <p>The curious expression \u201cRussian-occupied Crimea\u201d was used in your story about Russian billionaire businessman Evgeny Lebedev (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/17/boris-johnson-met-alexander-lebedev-without-security-after-nato-summit\" title=\"\">Revealed: ex-KGB agent did meet Boris Johnson at Italian party</a>\u201d, News). This makes about as much sense as \u201cBritish-occupied Channel Islands\u201d or \u201cEnglish-occupied Scotland\u201d. There\u2019s no particular oddity about Lebedev being a \u201ccritic of Putin\u201d and believing Crimea should be part of Russia again; plenty of Russians, for better or worse, think similarly.<br><strong>Professor Robin Milner-Gulland</strong><br>Washington, West Sussex<br></p> <h2>In praise of righteous anger<br></h2> <p>Further to Bernie Evans\u2019s comment on George Osborne\u2019s toxic legacy, \u201cmost certainly history will not forgive Osborne\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/17/observer-letters---we-can-still-unite-in-forgiveness-and-tolerance\" title=\"\">Letters</a>): for all politicians who make decisions that cause lasting hardship to the people they should be serving, righteous anger is often the only way to hold them to account. People such as Osborne, with private wealth, job security and status, are beyond the reach of the electorate. Only by maintaining permanent righteous indignation against them and widely broadcasting the harmful consequences of their actions will history know and remember these people for who they really are.<br><strong>Steve Barker</strong><br>Newtown St Boswells, Scottish Borders<br></p> <h2>I\u2019ll show you real stoicism<br></h2> <p>\u201cIn 1966, the monarch\u2019s apparent stoicism served as a model for the people of Aberfan\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/17/television-drama-the-crown-portrays-aberfan-disaster\" title=\"\">How filming the agony of Aberfan revealed a village still in trauma</a>\u201d, News). Stoicism, like coal dust, was already in the veins of people from the Valleys long before the Queen graced them with her reluctant presence.</p> <p>While I am sure Her Majesty has had need to remain stoic, not least as her son makes news digging himself into a hole, it can hardly compare with trying to dig your child from under thousands of tons of coal slag with your bare hands. <br><strong>Dick Perry</strong><br>Woollard, Pensford, Somerset<br></p> <h2>The Victorians had a point<br></h2> <p>Sarah Ditum notes that, because of \u201cextra-paternity events\u201d, some fathers may have cared for children who were not actually theirs (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/16/whos-the-daddy-difficult-to-say-in-victorian-times\" title=\"\">Who\u2019s the daddy?

      "bodyText": "Lamentable though rainforest destruction is, countries such as Brazil cannot be blamed for wanting western lifestyles for their people and the jobs to afford them (\u201cBattle for the Amazon\u201d, Special report). Douglas Adams noted in The Salmon of Doubt that attempts by wealthy countries to stop poorer ones wrecking their natural resources in the way we\u2019ve already ruined ours are a little hypocritical. Fortunately, this can be overcome. Harvard biologist EO Wilson\u2019s The Diversity of Life noted the huge potential for carefully using rainforests without wrecking them; he even calculated the economic benefits, and such an approach works in other areas eg restocking fisheries, silviculture and restoring US agri-deserts to grassland with bison grazing it. Tribal peoples have shown for thousands of years that conservation can be combined with careful use; we can\u2019t all live like that but the lesson is still valid. The problem is money: everybody wants something done, provided their wallet, convenience and choice are not affected. Iain Climie Whitchurch, Hants Your special report is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand what has happened and is happening in the Amazon rainforest and why it matters. Land-grabbers are destroying the habitats of birds and animals and robbing indigenous tribes of their homes and livelihoods. The Amazon contains the biggest rainforest on the planet. As your excellent report says: \u201cRainforests... should be put at the heart of discussions at the United Nations climate talks that will be held in Madrid next month.\u201d Penelope Maclachlan London W7 How to get the young to vote While I was heartened to read that the \u201cYouth vote is key to ousting Johnson from his own seat\u201d (News), by Tuesday I was dismayed to learn that one in three young people aged 18-24 have not yet registered to vote according to the Electoral Commission. The boomer generation has repeatedly been accused of betraying the young, as if we are all Leavers and they are all Remainers. Everyone who attended People\u2019s Vote rallies or last month\u2019s Let Us Be Heard march in London will know that all generations were well represented. If 3,000 voters have turned 18 in Boris Johnson\u2019s constituency since the June 2017 election, how many have done so since June 2016? How many older voters have become incapacitated in the same period? Will the 13m who didn\u2019t vote in the referendum have a strong preference now that we have a better idea of what Brexit entails? Johnson\u2019s one-year time limit for negotiating detailed agreements with the EU makes a no-deal Brexit very likely. Although there may be a majority for this outcome no one voted for it, so a confirmatory vote is essential. The young who wish to have their say can only do so by registering to vote by Tuesday and subsequently voting tactically in the general election. Do aim to at least double your generation\u2019s poor 40% turnout in the EU referendum rather than bemoan the fact that other groups are more motivated. Graham Rex Swansea Russian-occupied Crimea? The curious expression \u201cRussian-occupied Crimea\u201d was used in your story about Russian billionaire businessman Evgeny Lebedev (\u201cRevealed: ex-KGB agent did meet Boris Johnson at Italian party\u201d, News). This makes about as much sense as \u201cBritish-occupied Channel Islands\u201d or \u201cEnglish-occupied Scotland\u201d. There\u2019s no particular oddity about Lebedev being a \u201ccritic of Putin\u201d and believing Crimea should be part of Russia again; plenty of Russians, for better or worse, think similarly. Professor Robin Milner-Gulland Washington, West Sussex In praise of righteous anger Further to Bernie Evans\u2019s comment on George Osborne\u2019s toxic legacy, \u201cmost certainly history will not forgive Osborne\u201d (Letters): for all politicians who make decisions that cause lasting hardship to the people they should be serving, righteous anger is often the only way to hold them to account. People such as Osborne, with private wealth, job security and status, are beyond the reach of the electorate. Only by maintaining permanent righteous indignation against them and widely broadcasting the harmful consequences of their actions will history know and remember these people for who they really are. Steve Barker Newtown St Boswells, Scottish Borders I\u2019ll show you real stoicism \u201cIn 1966, the monarch\u2019s apparent stoicism served as a model for the people of Aberfan\u201d (\u201cHow filming the agony of Aberfan revealed a village still in trauma\u201d, News). Stoicism, like coal dust, was already in the veins of people from the Valleys long before the Queen graced them with her reluctant presence. While I am sure Her Majesty has had need to remain stoic, not least as her son makes news digging himself into a hole, it can hardly compare with trying to dig your child from under thousands of tons of coal slag with your bare hands. Dick Perry Woollard, Pensford, Somerset The Victorians had a point Sarah Ditum notes that, because of \u201cextra-paternity events\u201d, some fathers may have cared for children who were not actually theirs (\u201cWho\u2019s the daddy? Difficult to say in Victorian times\u201d, Comment). It\u2019s worth adding that in Victorian times, and possibly even today, it was not unknown for neither partner in the marriage to be the parent of \u201ctheir\u201d child. Sometimes, when an older unmarried daughter became pregnant, to avoid the shame of her having the child out of wedlock, and the child\u2019s as it grew up, she was sent away for a few months to have the baby in secret. She then returned home to share in the congratulations being showered on her mother for the birth of another child that was very unexpected, as its siblings were all much older. The child was brought up thinking its real mother was its older sister and often such family secrets were carried to the grave. Even in the age of DNA, when such things, if not proved, can be at least disproved, I think it\u2019s safer to treat birth certificates as a guide to parentage rather than a statement of fact. Peter Barnett Oxted, Surrey The wrong priorities How ironic that the Home Office is outsourcing its visa processing services to French and Saudi Arabian companies at a time when the government claims that Brexit and having more controls on immigration will open up opportunities for UK nationals and UK companies (\u201cMigrants forced to wait months for UK visa despite paying \u00a3800 for priority\u201d, Business). This is clearly an opportunity for non-UK companies to make some serious money, while at the same time depriving the UK economy of sorely needed skills. Ian Hankinson Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire Weather report is skin deep Last week\u2019s weather report included news of \u201ca spotty shower in central parts of the UK\u201d.

Dolly Parton: country queen unites the States Christmas has come early for Dolly Parton fans. Thanks to Netflix\u2019s exuberant policy of commissioning absolutely loads of stuff, it has served up Dolly Parton\u2019s Heartstrings, eight really long episodes of drama, each adapted from a Parton song, with the source material of course including Down From Dover and Jolene (but sadly not Baby, I\u2019m Burning \u2013 maybe season two?). Parton introduces each one ,casing the entire endeavour in a retro jacket, and while it is predictably schmaltzy and spectacularly drawn out \u2013 these are stories taken from minutes-long songs, after all \u2013it does offer the TV movie comfort of a Sunday afternoon under a blanket. Better, though, is Dolly Parton\u2019s America, the podcast hosted by Radiolab\u2019s Jad Abumrad, which has been exploring how Parton unites a divided country. Abumrad has spent time with Parton, a notoriously charming but ungiving interviewee, and has spun it into gold as bright as her smile by speaking to family, friends, colleagues and, crucially, those most affected by her music. The episode on her \u201cDollitics\u201d expertly pulled apart the union anthem 9 to 5, while Jolene got an instalment of its own, and it is brilliant, informative and just about as entertaining as the legend herself. The Vivienne: no drag paying the licence fee for this show Congratulations to The Vivienne, the deserving winner of the inaugural RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK, who walked away with the kind of underwhelming prizes that only the BBC could offer with a straight face: three badges and the promise of a \u201cdigital series\u201d with the show\u2019s producers. Given the budgetary restraints, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that might end up being an Instagram story, perhaps, at a push, a YouTube video. But no. The production company has already announced two follow-up series: The Vivienne Takes Hollywood and Morning T&amp;T, which pairs the winner with her fellow finalist Baga Chipz, and has them reprising their Trump and Thatcher impersonations for a spoof talkshow. The Vivienne was the perfect reality TV contestant and the inevitable winner. She started strong, coasted at the top, dipped to the bottom, learned her lesson, then got her game back right when it counted. She had a serious, sympathetic backstory and she went on that crucial journey. The only disappointment was the lack of surprise, because she\u2019d been the clear frontrunner since episode one. As a longtime Drag Race viewer, the format had been flagging. It started to feel like there were more series than RuPaul has had birthdays and, as a result, it was in danger of becoming too meta, more about the show than the people on it, with contestants constantly referring to previous contestants, the cultural touchstones eating themselves. Drag Race UK has been a crude, smutty, utterly British defibrillator that has given it all a new lease of life. Its contestants were mucky, its drag more disruptive than one might have predicted and it provided one of the sweetest TV moments of the year, when Cheryl (formerly) Cole met her namesake Cheryl Hole. Now that\u2019s the kind of wholesome family entertainment I want my licence fee to fund. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

Six women, five men. Female commander called Joanna Root. Anyway, we land, and find the locals, much to our surprise, playing a rudimentary game of something closely resembling cricket. But they haven\u2019t got it quite right. They\u2019re only playing one innings a side, of a hundred balls. Joanna has a word with their leader, explains proper cricket to them, five days, two innings per side etc. And so begins the first interplanetary test match. We win the toss and bat. Our batting unit collapses after a good start and we scrape our way to 261 all out, despite me carrying my bat for 49 not out. Mars take a first innings lead of 78 after their leader and captain A.L. Greenman scores a maiden test century. We crumble to 73 all out in our second innings, I heroically carry bat again, 31 not out, and Joanna Root resigns both as captain and leader of the expedition, after which we blast off in embarrassment and head back to Earth to face a media feeding frenzy. There\u2019s hell to pay. Joanna falls on her sword and I, Geoffrey Boycott III, am appointed captain of the next mission in three years time when the planets align again. I demand complete control over team selection and strategy, obviously. </em></p> <p><em>Then I woke up. To be continued...</em><br></p> <p>Thanks Kim!

      "bodyText": "So England will not sleep easy tonight. A couple of pretty ropey shots by the openers - and two magnificent performances by New Zealand, in BJ Watling and Michell Santner. Santner went on to add 3-6 to his treasure chest, in his quietly underrated way, varying pace and zone. Sky remind us of Auckland 2013, one of the best backs-to-the-wall rearguards, when England- particular Matt Prior and Monty Panesar - held on to the end of the day. Hmm, let\u2019s see Jos Buttler has been sent out to chat. He\u2019s quietly matter of fact. England have a lot to do tomorrow. Yes they\u2019re confident. Well, that\u2019s it from me! I\u2019ll see you tomorrow at mid-afternoon drinks. Thanks for all the emails and limericks. Bye! 27.4 overs: England 55-3 ( Denly 7) Gulls circle the ground and in the crowd, a few people start gathering their affairs. Denly scampers a single off the first ball of the over, then Santner sends one in which fires off the pitch and hits Leach square in the helmet. Two balls later, Leach prods forward and, edge or no edge, seals his fate. England start tomorrow 207 behind, seven wickets left, and on the ropes. A sensational catch by a diving Latham at short leg as Leach prods forward. Hang on ...hot spot doesn\u2019t seem to show any contact with bat or glove - but Leach, though he contemplated, selflessly didn\u2019t review. 27th over: England 54-2 ( Leach 0, Denly 6) Wagner thunders in, sending stingers towards Leach\u2019s ribs, but he copes pretty well. Unfazed, as ever. And that leaves just one over left for England to survive. 26th over: England 53-2( Leach 0, Denly 5) Santer can do no wrong this match! A bit of a shocker from Burns to honest, with so few balls left - no need man, no need! Alas. Anyway, the world\u2019s favourite nightwatchman pulls on his gloves and marches his familiar march to the crease. An ugly dog\u2019s-breakfast of a sweep shot to de Grandhomme at square leg, with less than three overs to go... 25th over: England 53-1 (Burns 31, Denly 5) Wagner digs in, Denly ducks and delves.. and survives. I think this might have to be the last limerick.. I always thought Tanya Aldred/A cricket commentator quite well-read./So perhaps Cootamundra/Was an unusual blunder/And that session had just messed with her head. 24th over: England 53-1 (Burns 31, Denly 5) Santer causing more discomfort. He induces Burns to have a dart only for a diving Southee at mid-wicket to make a scrambled egg of it, then Burns plays dangerously close to his stumps. 23rd over: England 53-1 (Burns 31, Denly 5) Shot of the day from Denly who hooks and swivels at a short one from Wagner and pistol-shots the ball to the boundary. Just gorgeous. I didn\u2019t know how many limerickists there were out there. Jake McIntryre rolls out this one. O Archer and Broad felt the pain, The runs came again and again. Watling\u2019s wicket fell not;The best hope England has got? Light a candle and just pray for rain. 22nd over: England 49-1 (Burns 31, Denly 1) Super bowling by Santner, who hypnotised Sibley into pushing at something he could have left well alone. And England resist the temptation to send in a nightwatchman, Denly marches out. Santer goes wide, the ball spins broadly, Sibley follows, pushing, bat away from his body, and feathers through to the keeper. Damn, he\u2019d done the hard work. 21st over: England 48-0 (Burns 31, Sibley 12) Wagner wheels out more short balls, but Burns turns one away for four, before bottom-edging one straight into the soil. 20th over: England 44-0 (Burns 27, Sibley 12) An unremarkable maiden for Santner rolls by. Neil Dobson sends my pick-me up. Neil, did you write this? It\u2019s rather brilliant As I bat through the shadows as he bowls at the death I take a look at my stumps And realize there\u2019s nothing left \u2018Cause i\u2019ve been playing and missing so long That he bowled me even though his line and length had gone. But i ain\u2019t never faced a ball that didn\u2019t deserve it Treat it like a number 9? You know that\u2019s unheard of You better make sure you\u2019re yorking I won\u2019t be walking Both you and the umpire could be lined in chalk. I really hate that slip, but i gotta foc\u2019 As he drops, i see myself play another stroke. Fool, i\u2019m the kind o\u2019 three that Ian Bell would like to be On his knees in the night Saying prayers to the floodlights [Chorus] Been spending most my life Playing on a batsman\u2019s paradise. Double hundred on Day One I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be batting twice. Been spending most my life Playing on a batsman\u2019s paradise. Nine men on the ropes Still hitting sixes in bad light. Look at this reputation, you got me making, I can\u2019t play a normal knock, learnt my game on the street So i couldn\u2019t give a fuck \u2018bout the first team Too much twenty-twenty cricket, got me chasing dreams It\u2019s an educated risk with boundaries on my mind Got my willow in my hands and my guard on my thigh. I\u2019m a perfect three, come in after Banger, One wicket\u2019s now down, so please don\u2019t rouse my anger. Fool, D-L ain\u2019t nothing but a rainfall away, Taking guard wide of off, what can i say? I\u2019m twenty-three not out, but will I live to see twenty-fo\u2019, The way they is bowling it\u2019s fo\u2019 sho\u2019 Tell me why is he So blind to see That the ball he needs Is a goog-a-ly? Keep spending most my life Playing on a batsman\u2019s paradise. Double hundred on Day One I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be batting twice. Keep spending most my life Playing on a batsman\u2019s paradise. Nine men on the ropes Still hitting sixes in bad light. Powerplays are money, Moneyplays for power, Murdoch after Murdoch, Gower after Gower, Inzamam\u2019s stopped running, but half the balls he\u2019s hooking, Now he\u2019s back in the pavillion He should have thought of ducking. I gotta occupy the crease But nobody\u2019s here to teach me If i clear the Bedser Stand, then how can they reach me? I play through leg, I play through off, I play front foot, That\u2019s why i know i won\u2019t be out for a duck, fool! Been spending most my life Playing on a batsman\u2019s paradise. Double hundred on Day One I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be batting twice. Been spending most my life Playing on a batsman\u2019s paradise. Nine men on the ropes Still hitting sixes in bad light. Tell me why is he So blind to see. That the ball he needs Is a goog-a-ly. Here\u2019s the original, for those too young to know Coolio. 19th over: England 44-0 (Burns 27, Sibley 12) This all feels a bit like going through the motions to be honest. The pitch isn\u2019t being unreliable enough to give the New Zealanders much succour and Burns and Sibley are showing impressive patience. Burns hooks an inevitable Wagner short ball for four. 18th over: England 38-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 12) It is the long limbed and elegantly sleeved Santner. He gets one to spin, Sibley gets an inside edge into the pad that a scrambling Watling (back behind the stumps) can\u2019t hold on to. A chance, a tough one, but a chance. Ten overs left today. Philip Lewis, delves into his limericks from a schoolteacher: There once was a teacher named Singleton/Who dated both Bradman and Fingleton/She said that the latter/Was her kind of batter/So now her name\u2019s Singleton / Fingleton 17th over: England 37-0 (Burns 20, Sibley 12) Wagner slams his first ball of the innings half way down the deck and Burns ducks. Wagner send down another short ball. And another. And repeat. John from Turton joins Kim and Gary: There\u2019s obviously more to this great cricket field in the sky than meets the eye. I remember vividly from the cricket tours of my distant youth how, late at night, my team mates would declare that the 7th planet had appeared in front of the sightscreen. 16th over: England 36-0 (Burns 19, Sibley 12) Burns plays an ugly slog-sweep off Santner, but survives. What is this booty? I have six emails suddenly in my box. Ah... thank you Evelyn, James and Sixth Grade , how could I not know that Don Bradman was born in Cootamundra? Me bad, in my defence, I think of him as the Boy from Bowral. Have you not heard of Sir Donald Bradman? Why surely you must be a mad man! On grounds far and wide He carried his side Even Jack Fingleton said \u201cThat wasn\u2019t bad, man\u201d 15th over: England 34-0 (Burns 18, Sibley 11) Sibley calls for a towel and mops his damp head. De Grandhomme lumbers in, the ground creaking beneath him. Burns flips him down to the Caramel Wafer advertising boards for four, and that\u2019s drinks! 14th over: England 30-0 (Burns 14, Sibley 11) I\u2019m enjoying watching Santner, he starts with hands together, then follows up with a real twist in action. He\u2019s causing problems, Burns in particular is very cautious. 13th over: England 29-0 (Burns 13, Sibley 11) It\u2019s de Grandhomme, but he doesn\u2019t cause even a hint of chaos this over and Burns manages to clip him away for three runs. The ground, by the way, looks gorgeous, again. A good scattering of fans, lounging, playing cricket, and the Barmy Army blissfully quiet. 12th over: England 26-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 11)Santner, glasses-less, comes into the attack. He immediately causes trouble, pitching wide and drawing Sibley into drives he shouldn\u2019t be playing. A maiden. Meanwhile in Australia: 11th over: England 26-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 11) De Grandhomme making things happen again: four byes then he induces an edge from Burns, who snaps his head round to see the ball falling a glove short of Latham behind the sticks. 10th over: England 22-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 11) I need a pick-me-up. Any suggestions? Sibley has a very distinctive wobble to his bat as the bowler approaches. A Boult maiden, follows as an aircraft loudly swoops over the ground. Oh, someone send me some limericks. Ah James! Thank you. Pleasure is all mine. Up late again in misty Dublin. A couple of Limericks for you I found. Who is the first about do you know?[ I don\u2019t sorry] A young man once left Cootamundra, Not to seek out a life in the tundra. Not of reindeer or snow Are we glad he did know, But of runs he became quite the plunderer. If a cricket team wants to win matches, They ought to learn not to miss catches. But if England they\u2019re playing This isn\u2019t dismaying. The chances will come round in batches. 9th over: England 22-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 11) De Grandhomme replaces Southee and with his second delivery has the has a ball jack-in-a-boxing off the pitch, alarming Burns and cracking him on the arm. De Grandhomme glares, with fire. Burns gives him a cheeky grin. That could be a bit worrying for England. 7th over: England 21-0 (Burns 10, Sibley 10) Kane Williamson polishes the ball vigorously at every opportunity, and throws it back to Boult, who concedes two from the over, one of them coming when the ball zips through Williamson\u2019s legs. 7th over: England 17-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 7) England\u2019s openers getting a thorough going over from this excellent Kiwi new ball pair. Five dot balls, then Sibley jabs down and they scamper through for a couple. There\u2019s something about Sibley\u2019s face in a helmet that reminds me of Jonathan Trott, I think it is the pale skin and the eyes. Kim, meet Gary Harley: I was part of that first team on Mars.I was forced to play keeper, and the ball was moving and flying everywhere!I came in at number three and lost my wicket to a ball that spun off a meteorite and took out my off stump.I appealed to the umpires, but was told that local rules applied for that. It was a grassless wicket! Dry and with only Tony Greig\u2019s keys to move off, apart from the odd meteorite.Our second innings was, indeed, a disaster. I carried my bat, but scored zero! I was peppered my Mar\u2019s attack bowler, I.M. A\u2019lien. He had South African roots, obviously.We were humiliated, but Geoffrey Boycott III was a true hero and, obviously must lead our next quest for the intergalactic championship! 6th over: England 16-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 7) Boult over, then around, the wicket to Sibley. Five dots then he surprises him with a back of the length ball which Sibley plays with some alarm, the ball hitting him high on bat, back bending inelegantly, imagine an elderly ape falling out of a tree. 5th over: England 16-0 (Burns 9, Sibley 7) Southee\u2019s got the ball on a string, teasing, testing. He swings the ball into Burns who mis-hits for four, ah that\u2019s better, a more confident drive for two. 4th over: England 9-0 (Burns 3, Sibley 6) Boult\u2019s a willow-the-wisp of a bowler, and he tests Burns all the way through this over with length and cut. A maiden. Ted writes: \u201cIsn\u2019t the Kiwi lead (615-353=) 262 runs when they declared, rather than the 252 as you stated in your tagline? Or perhaps is it because I am an American following this and there is some metric conversion that I missed? Or could BREXIT be somehow involved? Argh, thanks Ted. I\u2019d like to blame Brexit, but incompetence is the more likely suspect. I shall amend. Brexit is to blame for most things though. 3rd over: England 9-0 (Burns 3, Sibley 6) Southee pitches it up, Sibley watches, shows the face, till Southee strays leg-side and he knocks a couple square. 2nd over: England 7-0 (Burns 3, Sibley 4) It is Boult. He cranks it up, left arm over, and Burns edges just a cough short of de Grandhomme at slip. A maiden. Basil has been in touch, from Vietnam I agree, he has a quiet authority, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s completely secure in the team yet, with Bairstow and Ben Foakes breathing down his neck. 1st over: England 7-0 (Burns 3, Sibley 4) Burns plays and misses at the brand new cherry at Southee\u2019s first ball. Then someone notices that one of the stumps is higher than all the rest. The umpire tries to screw it into the ground but it won\u2019t budge. The groundsman is called over and he prods some soil into the hole, then the umpires knocks the stump into the ground with the handle of Burns\u2019s bat. Burns picks up three runs next ball with a tidy clip to midwicket. Sibley off the mark with an on-drive for four. I\u2019ve aged three years in the time it took to complete that over. Give Ian Ward a mircrophone and he\u2019ll put his other hand in his pocket or on his hip, it\u2019s like a nervous twitch. Anyway, ever enthusiastic, he tells us that Tom Latham will keep wicket to give BJ Watling a bit of a rest. Rory Burns does an extraordinary stretch, legs behind him in a crouch, back bent behind him, as if he\u2019s Ronaldo celebrating a goal. New Zealand have three slips and a gully. 201st over: New Zealand 615-8 (Boult 1, Wagner 11) Wagner can\u2019t resist rubbing a final bit of salt into the wound, slapping ten off Leach\u2019s last two balls before he and Boult sprint off the pitch with the enthusiasm of the saved. England trudge away. They will have 27 overs to face before stumps. The general consensus is that they stuck to their task better today than yesterday - but tempers looked frayed at times. What can the batsmen do now? 200th over: New Zealand 602-8 ( Wagner 0) Archer creaks into action, less a liquid approach than a rusty one this afternoon. Watling drives through long--on for four before finally, wearily, making a mistake. What an innings, well played! Emails are rare tonight, but one drops in: Just had a dream in which I\u2019m part of an eleven person Mars mission by a post Brexit newly independent England. Six women, five men. Female commander called Joanna Root. Anyway, we land, and find the locals, much to our surprise, playing a rudimentary game of something closely resembling cricket. But they haven\u2019t got it quite right. They\u2019re only playing one innings a side, of a hundred balls. Joanna has a word with their leader, explains proper cricket to them, five days, two innings per side etc. And so begins the first interplanetary test match. We win the toss and bat. Our batting unit collapses after a good start and we scrape our way to 261 all out, despite me carrying my bat for 49 not out. Mars take a first innings lead of 78 after their leader and captain A.L. Greenman scores a maiden test century. We crumble to 73 all out in our second innings, I heroically carry bat again, 31 not out, and Joanna Root resigns both as captain and leader of the expedition, after which we blast off in embarrassment and head back to Earth to face a media feeding frenzy. There\u2019s hell to pay. Joanna falls on her sword and I, Geoffrey Boycott III, am appointed captain of the next mission in three years time when the planets align again. I demand complete control over team selection and strategy, obviously. Then I woke up. To be continued... Thanks Kim! I don\u2019t really know what to say. It\u2019s over! A tired touch to Buttler behind the stumps and Watling hurries off to a standing ovation after 473 balls. New Zealand crumbling now, if you can crumble with the score over 600... 199th over: New Zealand 598-8 (Watling 201,) That was a most unexpected wicket, especially after Southee had observed the carefully placed field, watched Leach run in and crashed his first ball for six over long-off. I\u2019ve had some lovely toast in the tea interval by the way, it reigns supreme as a night-time snack. Southee takes a sidewards step and gently knocks the ball back into a surprised Leach\u2019s hands. The players are walking out; Broad has his arm round Archer, Root waves his fielders into position... Something to mull over: 198th over: New Zealand 590-7 (Watling 200, Southee 2) A maiden, my boy, a maiden! Sammy Curran pockets the golden apple. England sportingly applaud Watling off the pitch, butI\u2019d make my excuses to avoid being in Root\u2019s dressing room right now. We think New Zealand will turn the screws and carry on batting, see you back here in ten minutes with a caffeine refill. 197th over: New Zealand 590-7 (Watling 200, Southee 2) \u201cA wicket lifts the gloom in the pommy camp,\u201d writes Hugh McCarroll. \u201c Declaration must be imminent don\u2019t you think?\u201d You didn\u2019t see how thorough hacked off Joe Root was when his lbw appeal against Southee was turned down. FFF-ing shortly followed by blinding. And repeat. The single comes, a nibble to square leg, then a sprightly sprint. He gets a bear hug from his giant partner and a standing ovation from the crowd: 643 minutes, 23 fours and one six, the first double hundred by a NZ wicket keeper and only the third by a New Zealander against England. Take that stats fans. 196th over: New Zealand 589-7 (Watling 199, Southee 2) Curran successfully restricts Watling to one run, can he get the double ton before tea? 195th over: New Zealand 587-7 (Watling 198, Southee 1) A frisson of excitement as Southee nearly runs his partner out two short of his double century - Watling dives full length in the dust and makes his ground. He\u2019d earlier swotted another four off Root through cover. And so we tick on. An aside, I\u2019ve just seen Kane Williamson biting his nails in the dressing-room. Who\u2019d have thought it, cool Kane. 194th over: New Zealand 580-7 (Watling 193, Southee 0) A New Zealand seventh wicket record of 261 between Watling and Santner, and a cracking innings from a man who had looked ill at ease when he first came in yesterday. In fact England went nearly a whole day between drinks. Southee prods at his first ball and England try to inject some gumption into an appeal. Yes you read correctly! Santner gets a standing ovation and walks off replaying his shot, after finally holing out at long on. And just before tea England have their first wicket of the day! 193rd over: New Zealand 575-6 (Watling 189, Santner 125) Joe Root tries a leg break. Don\u2019t do that again Joe. 192nd over: New Zealand 562-6 (Watling 185, Santner 124) Curran bowls and New Zealand knock him about for a steady seven runs. Any fizz they had in their boots this morning has long dribbled away, they aren\u2019t really even glancing at each other any more. It\u2019s like being at a dinner party with an unhappily married couple. 191st over: New Zealand 562-6 (Watling 180, Santner 123) Broad misjudges a chance-of-sorts at midwicket and the ball bounces over his head. Root paws the ground, Root is displeased. Jim Skea strokes his beard before pyjamas: When I went to bed last night, the Black Caps were something (321) for 6. I\u2019m preparing to tuck myself in for the evening and NZ are still something (551) for 6. How many Test matches have gone 24 hours without a wicket falling? Night night. See you all here tomorrow with the Kiwis something for 6. 190th over: New Zealand 552-6 (Watling 176, Santner 118) Sam Curran manages to put his finger in the dyke for four dot balls in a row. Then Watling quietly passes his highest first-class score with a quick single , and Santner charges past his with a one legged frying pan swat past a diving Stuart Broad for four, and the lead jazz-hands past 200. 189th over: New Zealand 551-6 (Watling 176, Santner 116) Joe Root is the sacrificial lamb from the other end as he introduces himself for a double bowling change. Watling reverse-flicks him for four, then three dribbling wides. Should it be their want, New Zealand would have to declare in the next five minutes if they wanted to put England in before tea. Tongue in cheek, the ground announcer puts on Wonderwall. 188th over: New Zealand 542-6 (Watling 171, Santner 116) Just the 13 from the over, Sam Curran the unfortunate recipient. Santner emboldened; polishing off the over with two successive boundaries, a charming drive and then a ruthless hoik for six. 187th over: New Zealand 529-6 (Watling 170, Santner 104) Santner celebrates that hundred by crashing Ben Stokes for four next ball, and so it goes on. Brought back to chunk out the New Zealand middle order, Santer has done just that!. 322 minutes of hard yakka completed with a push down to the cover boundary for two. He raises his bat and slowly tweaks the corners of his mouth into the hint of a smile. 186th over: New Zealand 523-6 (Watling 170, Santner 98) Thanks Daniel, hi all. I see things haven\u2019t been going that well for England. Santer charges into Jack Leach and clatters him for six to bring up the 200 partnership between this pair. A dab into cover leaves him just three short of a first Test hundred. 185th over: New Zealand 507-6 (Watling 169, Santner 91) Stokes bangs one in and off it flies for five wides; I wouldn\u2019t necessarily confide this in him, nor Jos Buttler flinging himself after it, but that was fairly amusing. The scoring is ticking along now, three more coming to make it 62 in the 13 overs since lunch. That\u2019s drinks; here\u2019s Tanya Aldred to navigate you through England\u2019s evening collapse. 184th over: New Zealand 507-6 (Watling 167, Santner 90) It\u2019s hot out there and Santner\u2019s been batting a long time, so instead of milking Leach for tiring singles he shmices him again, this time over long on for six - that\u2019s the 500 up. Two more singles follow taking Watling to 167, the Robin Smith. 183rd over: New Zealand 499-6 (Watling 166, Santner 83) Stokes begins with a wild bouncer; wide ball. I guess you could argue that England have bowled not bad here; with no assistance they\u2019ve been pretty tight, and that\u2019s taken time out of the game. I guess we\u2019ll have a better idea about that when Boult\u2019s swinging it around mazes sometime this evening. 182nd over: New Zealand 496-6 (Watling 164, Santner 83) Four dots, then Santner shimmies down and carts Leach over long off for six. He did not appear to find that challenging in the slightest. \u201cA joint England/NZ Tube Station XI,\u201d announces Ian Forth. \u201cGraham Goodge Street Nick Knightsbridge Rory Kilburns Rev David Shepherds Wood Kim High Barnet Kennington Barrington Brendon Central McCullum Scott Styris Street Kensington Jacob Oramton Crescent Kyle Mill Hills East Shane Bond Street 12th Man: Phil Tufnell Park.\u201d Collis Kings Cross is the best I can do at this point. 181st over: New Zealand 490-6 (Watling 164, Santner 77) A Stokes bouncer doesn\u2019t get up and Santner tries to pull but misses, wearing it on the body; he connects with the next ball, sending it behind square on the leg side and they run one. This brings Watling onto strike, and with Stokes going around to slant across, he makes room to go with it, snapping it to the point fence. 180th over: New Zealand 485-6 (Watling 160, Santner 76) The longer New Zealand bat, the more the pitch weathers and wears; same with England, really. They\u2019ve been fruitlessly toiling for quite sometime now, just two wickets yesterday and none so far today. I know I\u2019m still awake because I sort of laughed typing that; fruitless toil is one of the greatest things in all sport. Three singles from the over. 179th over: New Zealand 482-6 (Watling 159, Santner 74) Stokes on for Archer and Watling gets off the KP with a pull, then Santner nurdles one more; 74 is his highest Test score. Here\u2019s Carl Moeller, who quotes Bloc Party: \u201cWaiting for the 7.18 January is endless Weary-eyed and forlorn The Northern Line is the loudest\u201d Perhaps one of them remembers the heady mid-90s, but surely no one refers to a Tube train by its time? Thameslink, North London line and such, ok. But Tube? Norrinmahmanna. 178th over: New Zealand 480-6 (Watling 158, Santner 73) In Brisbane, Pakistan need 243 more runs to make Australia bat again, with five second-innings wickets intact. Good luck, lads. Back at the Mount, Leach is into the attack and Santner dances down to whack him through cover for four. The pleasure he and Watling must be taking in this, this being grinding their opponents into granules, very very slowly. 177th over: New Zealand 476-6 (Watling 158, Santner 69) I recall some Pakistan-England Tests that were as slow as this - one at Edgbaston in 1987. Mudassar Nazar made 124 off 362 and Pakistan finished on 439 all out off 173.3; by way of comparison, England made 521 off 169.5. That was a maiden, by the way; New Zealand lead by 123. 176th over: New Zealand 476-6 (Watling 158, Santner 69) Have they gone?! Santner takes Broad from outside off to pull him for four in front of square! That\u2019s the 150 partnership, and neither batsman looks ready to settle for that; it\u2019s literally the difference in this match, because England\u2019s batsmen did exactly settle. Santner then cleanses Broad through point via straight-drive ... then flicks four off his toes! Three fours in the over, they might have gone you know! 175th over: New Zealand 464-6 (Watling 158, Santner 57) A side benefit for New Zealand is that their batsment who don\u2019t play 50-over stuff have had a good look at Archer in a non-threatening environment. Out in the middle, he almost nails Watling with a yorker - it\u2019s dug out, just - but have a look! Archer goes short, and Watling makes room to catch the bottom corner of it, helping it over the slip for six! They\u2019re the only runs from the over. 174th over: New Zealand 458-6 (Watling 152, Santner 57) Watling snaffles a single, then Broad finds a little bit of lift and Santner weaves away from it. It\u2019s the only run from the over, giving New Zealand a lead of 105. I imagine they want another 150 if they can get them. 173rd over: New Zealand 457-6 (Watling 151, Santner 57) Archer will have a burst from the other end; this is his 39th over, and he\u2019s gone for 92 runs in the process of taking no wickets. I daresay that won\u2019t happen often but it\u2019s happening now, and Santner inside-edges onto the pad allowing them to run one before Watling clips three to midwicket, raising his 150. We\u2019ve seen nothing to think he won\u2019t significantly add to them. 172nd over: New Zealand 453-6 (Watling 148, Santner 56) Broad\u2019s radar has been fine, it\u2019s just with nothing in the air of or off the pitch, his pace isn\u2019t enough to be bothersome in and of itself. After the first day, Rory Burns said the pitch would get even slower while those in commentary expected it to get quicker; amazingly, the person who\u2019d spent a chunk of a day playing on it was right. Santner drives the final ball of the over towards cover for one, the only run off it. Ben Stokes does a handstand at slip, which is the highlight of the day\u2019s play so far, more or less. Stuart Broad has the ball... \u201cThe darts brought back hitherto repressed memories,\u201d teases Simon Richards, \u201cas a 12-year-old who lived a mile from Jollees nightclub and attended many of the sessions including the final - (my Dad knew somebody who knew somebody....) A great sporting event. I asked Bob \u2018Limestone Cowboy\u2019 Anderson for his flights after one game. He looked at me witheringly and asked.. \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Bob Anderson taught me a word: stotious. stotious. (\u02c8st\u0259\u028a\u0283\u0259s) adj. chiefly dialect Irish drunk; inebriated. [of obscure origin; perhaps from stot2] \u201cUsed to be the NZers would mow a strip of grass from a rugby field and then let Hadlee out of his kennel,\u201d muses David Griffiths. \u201cThis is an altogether different kind of non-pitch. John Donne had a premonition of it four centuries ago: The world\u2019s whole sap is sunk; The general balm th\u2019 hydroptic earth hath drunk... For I am every dead thing.\u201d Hadlee, you say? Lunchtime email: \u201cNot even the Northern Line\u2019s mother would nominate it in a top three,\u201d reckons James Debens, \u201cexcept Most Infested With Bum Dust/Botty Burps/Fusty Flatum. As VS Naipaul wrote: \u2018Piccadilly, Vicky and Jubilee Are the three for me As I go \u201cwheee!\u201d Under the city In that fart canister!\u2019\u201d I\u2019m biased - I went to school in Camden and every day at full-time, literally a thousand of us would get on it and sit on the floor all the way down the aisles and by the doors. By far the greatest assemblies came when the headmistress read out letters complaining about the accordant behaviour. Anyway, as far as I can see, it covers a pretty decent array of the better places. To actually go on, it\u2019s miserable, agreed. I\u2019m not sure anyone will remember that session, unless they\u2019re trying to remember least memorable sessions; in short, England are in shtuck. Join me again in about 35 for more larks, dear old Pip, dear old chap. 171st over: New Zealand 452-6 (Watling 148, Santner 55) Eeesh. A quick one from Archer clouts Watling on the helmet - I tihnk he lost the line of it so ducked into it - but it was a glancing blow, and he seems fine, though has a little rest nonetheless. And just to make a point, he swats the final ball of a sensationally uncompelling session to backward point for four. \u201cI agree totally about Root\u2019s captaincy,\u201d says geoff Wignall. \u201cIt\u2019s a straightforward job when your team\u2019s on top but captains earn their corn when their side is undet the cosh. All Root has shown is indecision and inertia time after time whenever clarity and imagination are required; most worryingly there has been nothing suggestive of improvement.Agreed there aren\u2019t that many alternatives, but Buttler is becoming established in the team (much as I\u2019d like to see Foakes included) and Burns nearly so.I really can\u2019t see the case of continuing with Root especially if it\u2019s to the detriment of his batting.\u201d Even in cricket, where there are so many decisions to be made, leading from the front is still the key element of captaincy. If you\u2019re not doing that, you\u2019re not doing much. 170th over: New Zealand 448-6 (Watling 144, Santner 55) Watling calmly shoves Curran into the covers, and that\u2019s his highest Test score - he\u2019s batted very well, on account of being a very good batsman. A single gives him one more, and the next over will probably be the last before lunch - I\u2019d expect England will make sure of that. 169th over: New Zealand 445-6 (Watling 141, Santner 55) Archer returns and his third ball nips away - Santner misses it by a fortnight. Maiden. \u201cKia ora Daniel, from about an hour southwest of the venue,\u201d emails Graeme Simpson. \u201cStop whinging about the pitch! The Aussies have a name for POMS like you, but we\u2019re far too polite in NZ. Seriously, while Kiwis are batting very well, this might be one that eluded England. Some very dubious captaincy, yesterday\u2026\u201d It\u2019s fine for Tests to be played on flat decks - on any deck - but when there\u2019s no pace either, it\u2019s not ideal to watch. England made too few, mainly because they decided they\u2019d mastered Test-match batting so no longer needed to attempt it. 168th over: New Zealand 445-6 (Watling 141, Santner 55) Santner plays forward to Curran and Buttler appeals enthusiastically, but that was a forward defensive. As punishment, four byes are then added to the total when the ball clips Santner\u2019s thigh pad, and a single follows. \u201cI\u2019m stuck on the Metropolitan line, desperate for a slash,\u201d advises Matthew Salkeld. \u201cThe drip-drip of maidens and singles is driving me mad. Even TMS is on my case; Steven Finn is talking about aiming at dead flies in urinals. The universe hates me...\u201d I used to run ting on the Met back in the day. A severely underrated line and in my top three with Northern and Victoria. 167th over: New Zealand 440-6 (Watling 141, Santner 54) At what point do New Zealand go? They might skittle England because England get skittled, but given the state of the pitch, they need some time to force the win, and the lead is only 83. Anyhow, Stokes last delivery is actually not bad, fullish, outside off, and Watling strokes four through cover. The partnership is now 124. 166th over: New Zealand 436-6 (Watling 137, Santner 54) What do England do about the captaincy situation? They can let it drift because who are the other options, but how long will Root be given to improve? Yes the pitch is flat, yes the Kookaburra is tame, but finding a way in those circumstances is part of his job. It\u2019s hard to make the case that he does that aspect of it well enough, and his batting has gone downhill too. Watling flicks three to midwicket, the only runs from the over. 165th over: New Zealand 433-6 (Watling 134, Santner 54) It\u2019s Stokes nor Archer from the other end; I\u2019m not sure about that. Anyway, he gets one to leap off a fullish length and Watling swivels out of the road. A single follows, then Santner breaks the wrists to drive square for two more. 164th over: New Zealand 430-6 (Watling 133, Santner 52) Curran takes the (third) new orb and Santner drives it to cover; they run two. Then he leans forward and gets a leading edge, naturally it drops shy of midwicket. This pitch is cancelled. Am I saying it right? 163rd over: New Zealand 428-6 (Watling 133, Santner 50) After a single apiece, Santner gets one to extra, giving him a fifty; he\u2019d\u2019ve took it. The new ball is now available; will England take it? On the one hand, the spinners have livened things a little and it\u2019s easier to hit when it\u2019s quicker; on the other, something has to change else time will stop and leave us marooned here forever. \u201cJust when you think the session can\u2019t get any worse,\u201d tweets @AsNaturalAsRain, \u201cover on TMS Aggers has started bantering about the local Pinot Noir.\u201d I do hope it\u2019s golf next. 162nd over: New Zealand 425-6 (Watling 132, Santner 48) Leach sends down a maiden, and this is brilliant from New Zealand, you have to say - England must be absolutely hating this. I think that\u2019s the best way of looking at this. 161st over: New Zealand 425-6 (Watling 132, Santner 48) Root drops short, so Santner cuts away for four. And then, after a dot, Root gets one into Santner\u2019s bat pad. There\u2019s a huge appeal but Umpire Oxenford says no and England can\u2019t go upstairs. I think that was missing leg as it goes - it hit the pad pretty much in front of leg. 160th over: New Zealand 420-6 (Watling 131, Santner 44) This pitch is flatter than a Dutchman\u2019s fart. Watling plays Leach\u2019s first ball to mid on and they sprint one - a direct hit and they\u2019re out, but we don\u2019t deserve the relief of a wicket. But we do get a four, when Santner dances down to belt through backward point; Leach responds well, turning one away from the bat. 159th over: New Zealand 415-6 (Watling 130, Santner 40) Root brings himself on to bowl at the end with the cracks \u2013 as you would. Santner misses his fifth ball, making room for a cover drive, and back round we go following another maiden. \u201cSlow change please, lads.\u201d 158th over: New Zealand 415-6 (Watling 130, Santner 40) In commentary they think England should\u2019ve persevered with the short stuff against Santner - they\u2019ve been full today - but now Leach is coming on. Apparently the more prominent cracks are at the end he\u2019s bowling from, not to; of course they are. Anyway he decides to come from over, then he goes around, and Watling drives his penultimate ball to mid off where Root dives to stop; they run one, then another from the final delivery. This is the kind of session you get when you\u2019re trying to introduce your child or significant other to the game. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s well good, I promise...\u201d 157th over: New Zealand 413-6 (Watling 129, Santner 39) One for the purists, this session; obviously if it wasn\u2019t this, I\u2019d be in the discotheque. Stokes tries a bouncer at Santner, then goes dead wide on the crease and beats the bat but not the thigh pad. Maiden and drinks, following 19 runs in 16 overs. Make mine a quintuple. 156th over: New Zealand 413-6 (Watling 129, Santner 39) Curran opens with a bouncer that\u2019s aeons from anywhere; wide ball. A single follows, and New Zealand lead by 60. 155th over: New Zealand 411-6 (Watling 129, Santner 38) Watling plays down to cover and Broad can\u2019t collect cleanly, so they snaffle a single. So Stokes goes around to Santner and immediately worries him with a bumper. that he only just evades. Another follows, and this time a bit of bat sends to backward square and they add one more. \u201cSince we\u2019re in NZ and talking about people\u2019s ages,\u201d says Ian Forth, \u201cit\u2019s worth pointing out that Bilbo Baggins got to 131 - and beat the Old Took - by the time he left Middle Earth. Watling\u2019s next landmark.\u201d Long way to Abraham - 175 - who also died in this week\u2019s portion. Perhaps we should compile a list of names for all the various scores, like how in darts - and now in cricket - a 138 is the Deller. 154th over: New Zealand 409-6 (Watling 128, Santner 37) Curran takes over from Archer. I don\u2019t know why, but I always picture him as a scrapping kid with a comedy angry face. Like Stokes, he has the gift of timing, but he\u2019s already done his job innings - he\u2019s not there to bowl sides out, he\u2019s there to contribute big wickets. Anyway, Santner takes one from his first ball, then he beats Watling with one that goes across him and keeps going. A further single follows. 153rd over: New Zealand 407-6 (Watling 127, Santner 36) Stokes takes the ball from Broad and, presumably, the plea to make something happen. And he does, Watling smacking him for four through cover; that\u2019s a lovely shot. I thought I\u2019d never see one again. Watling is now on 127, the age that Sarah, of bible fame, was when she died. Ironically, in synagogue today we read the story of that happening, which is ironic. \u201cAre stumps still made of the traditional ash wood?\u201d asks Andrew Goudie. \u201cIf so, why paint them such a bright white?\u201d They look better on telly? 152nd over: New Zealand 403-6 (Watling 123, Santner 36) I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen Archer look so neutered. He\u2019s bowling pretty full now, for all the good it\u2019s doing him; I cannot wait for when the pitch turns into pebble dashing after the roller goes on between innings. Maiden, Archer\u2019s fifth straight. 151st over: New Zealand 403-6 (Watling 123, Santner 36) I doubt England\u2019s bowlers are enjoying this much either, basically being told that they\u2019re not much threat freshest, and they\u2019re absolutely getting it later on. After four more dots, Santner turns a single away into the on side. 150th over: New Zealand 402-6 (Watling 123, Santner 35) There is a lot of time left in the game - even if New Zealand bat until tea, they\u2019ll have enough time to finish the job. Meantime, another maiden from Archer, and a battle of will for the batsmen, who will want this to end but are absolutely committed to not chucking it away. 149th over: New Zealand 402-6 (Watling 123, Santner 35) Two hilarious and zany funsters are now shouting their way through a song extremely loudly. Oh, them. Them. Broad looks loose now, and a full one hauls Santner forward; he edges, but the ball expires well before slip. AND HAVE A LOOK! After 35 consecutive dots, Santner slashes and gets four! What are we seeing?! \u201cI think what Root and his bowlers may be overlooking is the straightforward approach favoured by Neville Cardus over 100 years ago,\u201d elucidates Kim Thonger. \u201c\u2018I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene\u2019.\u201d 148th over: New Zealand 398-6 (Watling 123, Santner 31) Archer flings down a yorker that Watling misses, and now the crowd are singing his name to I Just Can\u2019t Get Enough, which is ironic because I\u2019ve already had more than enough. England have scored a double hat-trick. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit previous to be deciding Archer\u2019s batting prowess?\u201d asks John Starbuck. \u201cHe\u2019s only had a few test innings and should be given at least a full series before people decide his best position. PS We had apple &amp; cinnamon buns with cream for dessert today, so naturally a lot of Calvados was taken, which is why I may not last much longer for this Test. Still, catch up tomorrow with all the wit, eh?\u201d Once again, I\u2019m not quite sure where the irony starts and ends. But no, I think it\u2019s fair to assess Archer on what we\u2019ve seen, and better judges than me think it\u2019s not a whole lot. 147th over: New Zealand 398-6 (Watling 123, Santner 31) And there we are! Broad finds some movement off the pitch, away from Santner; these cracks are very morish. And it\u2019s there! Five maidens on the bounce, which tells us a wicket is due if that adage from when England were good is to be believed. 146th over: New Zealand 398-6 (Watling 123, Santner 31) More dots, three of them, then the point: Watling bunts, sets off, is sent back, and there are chances at either end but the throw misses. That\u2019s four maidens on the spin, but England missed the chance they created. 145th over: New Zealand 398-6 (Watling 123, Santner 31) Broad\u2019s bowling full today, but there\u2019s still nothing happening for him. I\u2019m sure, though, that he\u2019s inspired by the \u201cCome on Broady\u201ds from the crowd. I don\u2019t know how people even have time to shout at the cricket, when the mouth is fully booked for eating and drinking. Maiden. 144th over: New Zealand 398-6 (Watling 123, Santner 31) Watling looks extremely secure out there; maybe it\u2019s time for some rf from around the wicket. In the meantime, he sees away a second consecutive maiden. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering what \u2018Mount Maunganui\u2019 sounds like for two days,\u201d tweets Gary Naylor, \u201cand I think I have it. It\u2019s what a zookeeper might shout at a reluctant panda.\u201d I was thinking more what a taxonomist might say following the death of his pet hamster. 143rd over: New Zealand 398-6 (Watling 123, Santner 31) Broad opens up from the other end; I wonder what his plan is. Conditions aren\u2019t offering him much, but England desperately need wickets, so containment isn\u2019t loads of use unless it leads to a wicket. Maiden. \u201cSuper Furry Animals for the win, always,\u201d reckons Sean Clayton, \u201c (and Arab Strap, although a bit post-Britpop).\u201d I saw SFA recentlyish, playing Fuzzy Logic and Radiator. I didn\u2019t love the former at the time and the jaded crowd of middle-aged morons didn\u2019t properly get into that, but the latter was every bit as magic then as it was at the time. 142nd over: New Zealand 398-6 (Watling 123, Santner 31) This time Archer does have the ball but nothing matters because nothing can matter ever again, because a group of quality blokes have gathered to sing Jerusalem then applaud themselves. Meanwhile, away from the action out in the middle, Watling slashes and edges, adding four through gully. These are the only runs of the over, but I\u2019m struggling to type as I\u2019m still applauding Jersualem. Right then, eyes down. Off we go! \u201cOh come on,\u201d says Simon Sylvester. \u201cBritish Sea Power! National treasures one and all.\u201d I thought that\u2019d been stolen by the EU. It looks extremely pleasant round Mount Maunganui way. On the other hand, bumble is wearing a cream blazer and light brown slacks, so actually I\u2019m better off in a box room in north London. Ben Stokes tells Ian Ward that keeping New Zealand in check on a flat pitch was a good effort yesterday - they might\u2019ve got away but they didn\u2019t. He says Curran\u2019s fuller length got the ball moving in the air and troubled De Grandhomme, and explains that they thought they most likely route to wickets was that movement through the air, which is why Curran bowled ahead of Archer. Ward doesn\u2019t ask him if he thinks it worked. \u201cEvening Daniel,\u201d emails Finbar Anslow. \u201cFrom sodden Piedmont, I\u2019ve been doing a bit of research about tailenders\u2019 batting order; obviously runs are important but more so the ability to stick around. Either way if we take the Ashes averages I reckon it should be Leach (Ave 13.5 runs. Ave 40.7 balls faced) before Broad (Ave 12.2 runs. Ave 27 balls faced) and finally Archer (Ave 6.8 runs. Ave 12.7 balls faced) or is there some other determining factor I\u2019m missing here?\u201d Piedmont! I feel like I\u2019m back in History A-level, albeit considerably less state-altered. It might depend on circumstances \u2013 if you want someone to have a swing, Leach comes in last. But if you want someone to stick about while the batsman tries to bat, it makes no sense to have him below Archer, whose batting is not all that much like batting. BJ Watling tells Ian Ward that England\u2019s bowlers \u201casked some pretty good questions of us\u201d, and that he had to work hard for his runs. He says that there are some crack appearing in the pitch and it wasn\u2019t easy to score runs. Ward then tells him that his team-mates say he\u2019s useless at 400-4, but great at 140-6 \u2013 I can scarcely conceive of a greater compliment. \u201cIt\u2019s lacking a bit of spark this Test,\u201d tweets Michael Burgess. \u201cNow, if it was part of the World Test Championship 19-21, it would be absolutely gripping.\u201d I\u2019m not sure where the irony lies here, if anywhere. I agree that every series should be part of it, but I enjoyed days 1 and 2. Yesterday was dry, but it\u2019s set up today which has plenty of potential. How many of the Britpop bands have lasted better than Supergrass, and how many guitar bands do we have now who are anywhere near as good as them? Or, put another way: I am old. Athers doesn\u2019t get why Archer didn\u2019t start the day with the ball yesterday, but he also calls out England\u2019s lethargy. I reckon the first hour is crucial. Where do England find a spinner who can take first-innings wickets? I know this is no revelation, but the more I think about it, the more Graeme Swann was the key man in the side who got to world number 1. Quality spinners, especially in England, are so hard to find. I suppose it\u2019s possible that England mop up the last four New Zealand wickets early this morning, then collapse slightly earlier than scheduled. If you\u2019re not absolutely buzzing for an England batting collapse that starts around mid afternoon and continues for eternity, I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t help you. Either you want England to lose, in which gezundheit, or you want England to win, in which case you\u2019re eager to be gripped by a heady mix of nostalgia, mirth and self-hate. It\u2019s going to be absolutely glorious. The last two days have shown the absolute worst of Joe Root\u2019s England. They still struggle to make enough runs, and they still struggle to get wickets on flat tracks. As for the captain, he just doesn\u2019t have the feel for the game that a captain should have, so when things didn\u2019t go well \u2013 partly because of the aforementioned problem \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have the smarts to fiddle them back his way. Quite why Archer didn\u2019t bowl first up I\u2019ve don\u2019t know, and quite why Stokes bowled so little, no one knows. So, if they\u2019re to turn this match around, England need quick wickets, then quick runs. Alternatively, New Zealand bat until tea and we\u2019re all done by lunch tomorrow.

If only Andrew could have recalled royal etiquette \u2013 like the proper way to respond when a convicted child sex offender asks you to go for a walk. Anyway, dear old princey will have a bit more time on his hands now, so if he needs a brush-up on exactly what his ex-friend Jeffrey Epstein was up to when he wasn\u2019t busy relaxing at one of Andrew\u2019s \u201cstraightforward shooting weekends\u201d, or attending Princess Beatrice\u2019s 18th birthday party, or definitely not letting Andrew stay over at his New York apartment nor inviting him to any place where he might meet the 17-year-old Virginia Roberts\u2026 well, there are a few podcasts that could help. The prince could think of them as revision for that new interview he wants to do. After all, if he\u2019s properly prepared, the new chat will be no sweat.</p> <p>There are several Epstein podcasts out there, and of the three I\u2019ve listened to, <strong><a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/sony-music-podcasts/broken-jeffrey-epstein\" title=\"\">Broken: Jeffrey Epstein</a></strong> is the best. Hosted by <em>New Yorker</em> reporter Ariel Levy, it looks at the story from various angles. One of the most interesting (and frustrating) concerns Epstein\u2019s money. Though he\u2019s dead, some of his victims are suing his estate for compensation. But all his money is held in the Virgin Islands, where there are exactly two lawyers who process probate claims, and they\u2019re also responsible for handling all the traffic cases on the island too. \u201cMy client is an heir to an estate that\u2019s not particularly complicated,\u201d said one Virgin Islands lawyer, \u201cand it\u2019s been going on for eight years now\u201d. Still, there is a way around this: if it can be proved that Epstein\u2019s millions were earned through crime, then the money is not technically his, but the US government\u2019s.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a fascinating episode on the elusive Ghislaine Maxwell, in which we hear her giving a hilariously BS-ful speech about her ability to harness social media to save the oceans; as well as another that features in-depth interviews with two young women whom Epstein brought under his control. The first was not sexually attacked by him, the second says she was. Both were definitely groomed and then abruptly discarded.</p> <p>What makes this podcast better than others is the lack of salaciousness. There is interesting detail, given by people who have been involved with Epstein, or journalists who have been on the story for years, but the tone is right. You don\u2019t feel mucky when you listen. Unfortunately, <strong><a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/endeavor-co/epstein-devil-in-the-darkness\" title=\"\">Epstein: Devil in the Darkness</a></strong> is more lip-smacking, though it features revealing interviews with his former school mates. And the more recent <strong><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/the-mysterious-mr-epstein/\" title=\"\">The Mysterious Mr Epstein</a></strong> has a faintly ludicrous feel, with presenter Lindsay Graham hamming up his presentation and not changing his intonation when reading out adverts for other podcasts, so you end up occasionally wondering whether Epstein was an ex-sportsman who inner-tubed down a river. It does mention Andrew, though, in the Second Chances episode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8854d44cd85f13d2afafb7fbac5699cbfcc11c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8854d44cd85f13d2afafb7fbac5699cbfcc11c7/0_531_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michele Wade, owner of Maison Bertaux.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michele Wade, owner of Soho patisserie Maison Bertaux and the subject of Madame Bertaux on Radio 3: \u2018a sensual treat\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For something a little more cheeringly frou-frou, why not try a taste of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0007r2r\" title=\"\">Madame Bertaux</a></strong>, a half-hour <em>Between the Ears</em> confection centred on Michele Wade, who runs the Maison Bertaux patisserie cafe in London\u2019s Soho. Wade is a Soho institution (as is her sister Tania, not mentioned in the programme). She talks of fancy cakes \u2013 her first employer, Madame Vignaud, told her that cakes were like babies, more robust than they look \u2013 as well as local life, past and present. I know Wade, and this programme is a tribute to her character: a combination of playful, loving and boho, with real strength underneath. Sounds flit in and out, weaving around the ooh-la-la music and friendly chat, the chink of a spoon in a cup. Another lovely production from Falling Tree: a sensual treat, just like Maison Bertaux itself.</p> <p>And finally, <strong><a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Sun-King-Audiobook/B081D4VQM2?pf_rd_p=d897f3b2-02b7-40d3-b41b-8643f3c7a8e0&amp;pf_rd_r=4819VYA68VMV3N2VNQZY&amp;ref=a_ep_podcas_c2_zing_0\" title=\"\">The Sun King</a></strong>, about Rupert Murdoch, presented by David Dimbleby, is a classy affair. Dimbleby is superlative, whether delivering lines, offering off-the-cuff insights or interviewing old friends. <em>The Sun King</em> is a proper yarn, told well, where we meet a journalist who hacked so many phones that his thumb could dial numbers from muscle memory, a TV news man who regarded Murdoch as Mephistopheles, and a printer who\u2019s never forgiven him for moving to Wapping. \u201cI was hoping,\u201d the man says fervently, \u201cthat Jerry Hall would shag him to death.\u201d</p> <h2>Three podcasts about TV shows</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/6kCE4iyT5cIwievxKklfSN\" title=\"\">His Darker Materials</a></strong><br>Spotify\u2019s podcast, hosted by Dave Corkery and Helen O\u2019Hara, comes out weekly to talk about the latest episode of the BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s trilogy.

There\u2019s also a fascinating episode on the elusive Ghislaine Maxwell, in which we hear her giving a hilariously BS-ful speech about her ability to harness social media to save the oceans; as well as another that features in-depth interviews with two young women whom Epstein brought under his control. The first was not sexually attacked by him, the second says she was. Both were definitely groomed and then abruptly discarded. What makes this podcast better than others is the lack of salaciousness. There is interesting detail, given by people who have been involved with Epstein, or journalists who have been on the story for years, but the tone is right. You don\u2019t feel mucky when you listen. Unfortunately, Epstein: Devil in the Darkness is more lip-smacking, though it features revealing interviews with his former school mates. And the more recent The Mysterious Mr Epstein has a faintly ludicrous feel, with presenter Lindsay Graham hamming up his presentation and not changing his intonation when reading out adverts for other podcasts, so you end up occasionally wondering whether Epstein was an ex-sportsman who inner-tubed down a river. It does mention Andrew, though, in the Second Chances episode. For something a little more cheeringly frou-frou, why not try a taste of Madame Bertaux, a half-hour Between the Ears confection centred on Michele Wade, who runs the Maison Bertaux patisserie cafe in London\u2019s Soho. Wade is a Soho institution (as is her sister Tania, not mentioned in the programme). She talks of fancy cakes \u2013 her first employer, Madame Vignaud, told her that cakes were like babies, more robust than they look \u2013 as well as local life, past and present. I know Wade, and this programme is a tribute to her character: a combination of playful, loving and boho, with real strength underneath. Sounds flit in and out, weaving around the ooh-la-la music and friendly chat, the chink of a spoon in a cup. Another lovely production from Falling Tree: a sensual treat, just like Maison Bertaux itself. And finally, The Sun King, about Rupert Murdoch, presented by David Dimbleby, is a classy affair. Dimbleby is superlative, whether delivering lines, offering off-the-cuff insights or interviewing old friends. The Sun King is a proper yarn, told well, where we meet a journalist who hacked so many phones that his thumb could dial numbers from muscle memory, a TV news man who regarded Murdoch as Mephistopheles, and a printer who\u2019s never forgiven him for moving to Wapping. \u201cI was hoping,\u201d the man says fervently, \u201cthat Jerry Hall would shag him to death.\u201d Three podcasts about TV shows His Darker Materials Spotify\u2019s podcast, hosted by Dave Corkery and Helen O\u2019Hara, comes out weekly to talk about the latest episode of the BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s trilogy. This week\u2019s guest is Dakota Blue Richards, who played Lyra in 2007\u2019s The Golden Compass film, when Richards was 12. Much serious talk about daemons, as well as how the series\u2019 deviations from the books add or take away from the story (eg Ma Costa rather than John Faa delivering the news to Lyra about her mother). A nicely paced 45-minute-long podcast that takes the show as seriously as fans require.

Joe Sugg (YouTuber and Strictly veteran) and producer Kim Winston talk in mad detail about the dances, the dancers, the judges and the \u201ctraditions\u201d (Blackpool, Halloween) of Strictly. You meet the people behind the scenes \u2013 prop masters, makeup artists et al \u2013 as well as those who have been or are actually still in the show. God knows where they find the time, but presumably it\u2019s part of the contract. For Ed Balls fans, he makes a return in show eight.

That ambition both explains the quality of the dancing and the two new commissions on this mixed bill \u2013 the second he has brought to Sadler\u2019s Wells \u2013 which will <a href=\"https://www.danceconsortium.com/touring/acosta-danza-evolution/tour-dates-and-venues/\" title=\"\">tour the UK early next year</a>.</p> <p>The first, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXaAirZEOPw\" title=\"\">Satori</a></em>, by company dancer <a href=\"http://www.acostadanza.com/en/staff/raul_reinoso\" title=\"\">Ra\u00fal Reinoso</a>, feels very much like an early work by someone trying to find their style. Set to a striking score by Cuban composer Pepe Gavilondo, it seems to be about the stages of enlightenment on the way to the discovery of truth. It makes striking use of the height and balletic talent of <a href=\"http://www.acostadanza.com/en/staff/zeleidy_crespo\" title=\"\">Zeleidy Crespo</a>, who towers over the other dancers, like a mother tending her brood, and also of a piece of floating blue silk that serves as both costume and backdrop.</p> <p>There are interesting, inventive moments, but there\u2019s something effortful about it, and it\u2019s outshone by the second new commission, by the more experienced Swedish choreographer <a href=\"https://www.lidberg.se/pontus/about/\" title=\"\">Pontus Lidberg</a>. <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvXbk7QoKEg\" title=\"\">Paysage, Soudain, la nuit</a></em> takes its Cuban inflection from a stunningly attractive rumba-flecked score by Leo Brouwer and Stefan Levin, and a set of beautiful simplicity by the artist Elizabet Cervi\u00f1o, which sets the dancers wandering against a strip of glistening white corn. The lighting, by Patrik Bog\u00e5rdh, conjures the states of twilight and dawn in which the youngsters meet.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lqk0KQGGuo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8lqk0KQGGuo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lqk0KQGGuo\">Watch a trailer for Evolution by Acosta Danza.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The movement is relaxed and limber, with little flicks of the feet and whirs of the arms, rising in light, quick jumps, falling to the stage in controlled slo-mo. It finds texture and shape by giving the dancers skittering entrances and exits; the shapes of the stage grouping are always changing, and there\u2019s a sense of a mysterious, suppressed narrative in which a pensive lone girl (lovely <a href=\"http://www.acostadanza.com/en/staff/marta_ortega\" title=\"\">Marta Ortega</a>) seems to find and lose her love.</p> <p>What\u2019s impressive is the way that all the dancers move fluently from street moves to contemporary to ballet; they are forging a style that has hints of them all, and they look confident and vital. That is vividly shown in the programme\u2019s two other works. In Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui\u2019s <em>Faun</em>, Zeleidy Crespo and Carlos Luis Blanco turn the sensual, writhing steps into a powerful evocation of attraction and desire. In Christopher Bruce\u2019s popular, entertaining <em>Rooster</em>, to the songs of the Rolling Stones, the entire company give it their all.</p> <p>They are literally led by Acosta, smiling with broad delight at the wild applause that greeted his first appearance on the stage, and revealing that even at 46 he has lost none of the flair, timing and attack that made him such a great dancer in the first place.</p> <p>In a different genre, the American <a href=\"http://www.michelledorrance.com/\" title=\"\">Michelle Dorrance</a> is easily his equal, a dancer who makes the intricacies of tap into the most poetic, compelling music.

      "bodyText": "Both Acosta Danza and Dorrance Dance are companies formed by supremely talented dancers with a point to prove. Perhaps that is why, in addition to technical excellence, they share a warm sense of being heartfelt, of making the case that dance matters to its participants and viewers. In the case of Carlos Acosta, his aim in founding a company based in his native Havana was a way of offering something back to his homeland at the end of his glittering international career \u2013 and a means of promoting and supporting the talent that exists there. That ambition both explains the quality of the dancing and the two new commissions on this mixed bill \u2013 the second he has brought to Sadler\u2019s Wells \u2013 which will tour the UK early next year. The first, Satori, by company dancer Ra\u00fal Reinoso, feels very much like an early work by someone trying to find their style. Set to a striking score by Cuban composer Pepe Gavilondo, it seems to be about the stages of enlightenment on the way to the discovery of truth. It makes striking use of the height and balletic talent of Zeleidy Crespo, who towers over the other dancers, like a mother tending her brood, and also of a piece of floating blue silk that serves as both costume and backdrop. There are interesting, inventive moments, but there\u2019s something effortful about it, and it\u2019s outshone by the second new commission, by the more experienced Swedish choreographer Pontus Lidberg. Paysage, Soudain, la nuit takes its Cuban inflection from a stunningly attractive rumba-flecked score by Leo Brouwer and Stefan Levin, and a set of beautiful simplicity by the artist Elizabet Cervi\u00f1o, which sets the dancers wandering against a strip of glistening white corn. The lighting, by Patrik Bog\u00e5rdh, conjures the states of twilight and dawn in which the youngsters meet. The movement is relaxed and limber, with little flicks of the feet and whirs of the arms, rising in light, quick jumps, falling to the stage in controlled slo-mo. It finds texture and shape by giving the dancers skittering entrances and exits; the shapes of the stage grouping are always changing, and there\u2019s a sense of a mysterious, suppressed narrative in which a pensive lone girl (lovely Marta Ortega) seems to find and lose her love. What\u2019s impressive is the way that all the dancers move fluently from street moves to contemporary to ballet; they are forging a style that has hints of them all, and they look confident and vital. That is vividly shown in the programme\u2019s two other works. In Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui\u2019s Faun, Zeleidy Crespo and Carlos Luis Blanco turn the sensual, writhing steps into a powerful evocation of attraction and desire. In Christopher Bruce\u2019s popular, entertaining Rooster, to the songs of the Rolling Stones, the entire company give it their all. They are literally led by Acosta, smiling with broad delight at the wild applause that greeted his first appearance on the stage, and revealing that even at 46 he has lost none of the flair, timing and attack that made him such a great dancer in the first place. In a different genre, the American Michelle Dorrance is easily his equal, a dancer who makes the intricacies of tap into the most poetic, compelling music. Her company, Dorrance Dance, is devoted to developing and preserving tap dance not just as entertainment but as art form, and the hour-long programme Myelination and other works perfectly fulfilled that brief. It opens with a nine-minute blast of Jungle Blues, the most traditional of the works on display, in which the dancers break from a chorus line to perform gentle variations of incredible skill. Three to One, which contrasts Dorrance\u2019s easy tap with the softer style of street dance, is only intermittently interesting. The final piece, the immensely complex Myelination, offers tap as a percussive force, some routines so fast they seem like punctuation in sentences you haven\u2019t understood, some slower and emphatically emotional. It is utterly transfixing and entirely wonderful. I could have watched it over and over again and still not have grasped all the richness on display.

With his sweet, powerful tone and technical precision, Kavakos treats the performance as conversation rather than combat, decorating and accompanying as much as leading the musical argument: until, that is, you reach the huge, dazzling cadenza of the first movement, Kavakos\u2019s own transcription of a piano cadenza left by Beethoven. It\u2019s full of hair-raising technical wizardry and requires a bizarre, unearthly exchange with the timpani. He makes the slow movement one long, tender song, the rondo finale lithe and witty. It\u2019s paired with Beethoven\u2019s Septet, Op 20 and and, with Enrico Pace on piano, five Variations on Folk Songs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoAkqEf9K3k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GoAkqEf9K3k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoAkqEf9K3k&amp;feature=emb_title\">Watch Leonidas Kavakos perform Beethoven\u2019s Violin Concerto.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u2022 Catch on iPlayer: <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bh0v\" title=\"\">America\u2019s Greatest Opera House: The Story of the Met</a> </strong>(BBC Four) marks the 50th anniversary of the Metropolitan Opera, New York \u2013 full of archive, interviews and performance.

      "bodyText": "\u2022 Violinists who specialise in baroque music don\u2019t tend to get the same limelight as those playing big romantic concertos, but their virtuosity deserves equal recognition. Kati Debretzeni, born in Transylvania, based in London, has led the English Baroque Soloists since 2000. She is also a leader of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and has directed numerous ensembles around the world. Debretzeni is soloist, scholar and inspiration in Bach Violin Concertos (SDG), with the English Baroque Soloists conducted by John Eliot Gardiner. In addition to the well-known concertos in A minor, BMV 1041, and E major, BWV 1042, she has explored two others, the disputed D minor, BMV 1052 and, in her own arrangement, the D major concerto, after BMV 1053 (a reworking of the second harpsichord concerto). Debretzeni\u2019s joyful, spirited playing, precise but free, gives endless pleasure. \u2022 The Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos, one of the most exciting soloists on the concert platform, conducts as well as plays Beethoven\u2019s Violin Concerto (Sony, 2CDs) with the large forces of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra \u2013 no easy task for a work on this scale but the results are flexible and beautifully integrated. With his sweet, powerful tone and technical precision, Kavakos treats the performance as conversation rather than combat, decorating and accompanying as much as leading the musical argument: until, that is, you reach the huge, dazzling cadenza of the first movement, Kavakos\u2019s own transcription of a piano cadenza left by Beethoven. It\u2019s full of hair-raising technical wizardry and requires a bizarre, unearthly exchange with the timpani. He makes the slow movement one long, tender song, the rondo finale lithe and witty. It\u2019s paired with Beethoven\u2019s Septet, Op 20 and and, with Enrico Pace on piano, five Variations on Folk Songs. \u2022 Catch on iPlayer: America\u2019s Greatest Opera House: The Story of the Met (BBC Four) marks the 50th anniversary of the Metropolitan Opera, New York \u2013 full of archive, interviews and performance. It also traces the razing of a slum neighbourhood in the early 1960s to make room for the Lincoln Center, home of the Met.",

The ceremony in Taipei on Saturday night was boycotted by China after a Taiwanese director called for the island\u2019s independence in an acceptance speech at last year\u2019s event. The acclaimed Hong Kong director Johnnie To resigned as head of the jury, citing contractual obligations, as several Hong Kong films reportedly also dropped out under pressure from Beijing. In another move likely to annoy Beijing, Taiwanese composer Lu Luming voiced support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy protests at this year\u2019s ceremony, dedicating his best original film song award to \u201cHong Kongers who insist on ideals, and may you live safely and freely\u201d. The Golden Horse festival\u2019s chairman, Oscar-winning director Ang Lee, said the absence of Chinese talent was \u201ca loss\u201d. \u201cThis is not easy to comment on, everyone knows that,\u201d said Lee, who is Taiwanese. \u201cOf course it is a loss, which can be seen on the red carpet or in the works participating in the film festival. \u201cWe of course feel regret due to fewer (movies and participants) this year but our arms are opened forever, as long as you are a Chinese-speaking movie director we are welcoming you.\u201d The night\u2019s biggest winner was A Sun, directed by Taiwan\u2019s Chung Mong-hong.

Singapore-based Malaysian Yeo Yann-Yann was crowned best actress for playing a married teacher struggling with family and work woes who develops a forbidden relationship with a male pupil in the Singaporean drama Wet Season. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy going down the path in the entertainment (industry) in Singapore and Malaysia ... but I will continue walking the path,\u201d she said at the ceremony in Taipei\u2019s Sun Yat-sen memorial hall. China considers democratic Taiwan as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary, even though the two sides have been governed separately for the last seven decades. Beijing has been ramping up military, diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan ever since president Tsai Ing-wen was elected in 2016, because her party refuses to recognise that the island is part of \u201cone China\u201d. Pressure is building once more as Taiwan heads towards new elections in January, with Tsai seeking to defeat an opponent who favours much warmer ties with China.",

In May it was revealed Australia had accepted two men as refugees for resettlement in November 2018, Leonidas Bimenyimana and Gregoire Nyaminani, and they were living in Australia. The men are former members of the Hutu rebel group Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, an offshoot of Rwandan armed forces and paramilitary groups largely responsible for the 1994 genocide. The two, with a third, Francois Karake, had been brought to the US in 2003 to face trial for the murder of two US victims who were part of a tourist group of eight murdered while on a gorilla-watching trip in the Ugandan rainforests in 1999. But a judge ruled the men had been tortured in Rwanda when their confessions were made, and the case was dropped. The men claimed they could not be returned to Rwanda because they would be persecuted. All three remained in detention in the US until two were brought to Australia. Politico reported on Sunday that Karake, 55, had been released from detention in Miami last Tuesday and arrived in Australia on Thursday. Guardian Australia had not confirmed the report at the time of publishing and had sought comment from the home affairs department. Home affairs told Politico that it did not comment on individual cases but that \u201call applicants undergo health, character and security screening\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Pope Francis has condemned the \u201cunspeakable horror\u201d of nuclear weapons during a visit to Nagasaki, one of two Japanese cities destroyed by American atomic bombs towards the end of the second world war. Speaking on the second day of the first papal visit to Japan for 38 years, Francis urged world leaders to end the stockpiling of nuclear weapons, saying it offered their nations a false sense of security. \u201cConvinced as I am that a world without nuclear weapons is possible and necessary, I ask political leaders not to forget that these weapons cannot protect us from current threats to national and international security,\u201d he told hundreds of people at the city\u2019s rain-drenched atomic bomb hypocenter park on Sunday. Earlier, Francis had placed a wreath and prayed at the foot of a memorial to the 74,000 people who died instantly and in the months after the US dropped a nuclear bomb on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, three days after it had carried out a nuclear attack on Hiroshima, in which 140,000 people died by the end of the year. \u201cThis place makes us deeply aware of the pain and horror that we human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another,\u201d Francis said, standing next to a large photograph of a young boy carrying his dead baby brother on his back at a crematorium in the aftermath of the attack on Nagasaki. Francis was given the photograph several years ago and has since distributed tens of thousands of copies. He was due to meet the widow and son of Joe O\u2019Donnell, the American military photographer who took it. The 82-year-old pontiff, who will visit Hiroshima later Sunday, has long been a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons. The Holy See was among the first countries to sign and ratify a 2017 nuclear prohibition treaty. But nuclear powers, and countries such as Japan that fall under the US nuclear umbrella, have refused to sign it. \u201cIn a world where millions of children and families live in inhumane conditions, the money that is squandered and the fortunes made through the manufacture, upgrading, maintenance and sale of ever more destructive weapons, are an affront crying out to heaven,\u201d Francis said. He urged world leaders to recommit to arms control efforts and the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons. \u201cWe need to ponder the catastrophic impact of their deployment, especially from a humanitarian and environmental standpoint, and reject heightening a climate of fear, mistrust and hostility fomented by nuclear doctrines.\u201d A survivor of the Nagasaki bombing said he hoped the pope\u2019s words would make nuclear powers think seriously about disarmament.

In Hiroshima, Francis was due to meet ageing survivors of the atomic bombings \u2013 the hibakusha \u2013 at the city\u2019s peace memorial park. The symbolism of his visit to Nagasaki extends beyond its tragic place in wartime history. Francis was scheduled to pay tribute at a site in the city devoted to martyrs among Japan\u2019s earliest Christians, whose religion was banned by the country\u2019s shogun rulers in the early 1600s. Suspected believers were forced to renounce their faith or be tortured to death. Many continued to worship in secret, as \u201chidden Christians\u201d until the ban was lifted in the late 1800s. Francis is the first pope to visit Japan \u2013 where there are fewer than half a million Catholics \u2013 since 1981, when John Paul II traveled to Nagasaki and Hiroshima to call for the abolition of nuclear weapons amid cold war tensions between the US and the Soviet Union. On Monday, Francis will meet survivors of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, as well as Japan\u2019s new emperor, Naruhito, and the prime minister, Shinzo Abe.",

The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Morrison had been \u201cdetermined\u201d to bring Houston to the White House, with several rounds of discussions between Canberra and Washington before the idea was vetoed by the White House.

The royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse heard that in 1999, Houston\u2019s father, Frank, had confessed to him when confronted that he had abused a child in the 1970s.

PM: Because David I\u2019m not going to go into the habit of just because one journalist somewhere in the world talks to someone who won\u2019t put their name to it, and all of a sudden apparently we got to play 20 questions. That\u2019s just not how I\u2019m going operate. If people have an established source who\u2019s prepared to put their names to things well that\u2019s a different matter. When Labor raised the story in question time in mid-October, Morrison accused Labor of casting aspersions on Houston. \u201cIf they are suggesting anything serious, or casting any aspersions on the individual which is the subject of the question, then perhaps I suggest they go and attend that church and they explain their concerns directly to their parishioners,\u201d Morrison said. In Senate estimates the following week the department of prime minister and cabinet took all questions about the invite list on notice, despite the issue having been in the news for long enough for the department to have prepared a response. Departmental officials would not answer whether the prime minister\u2019s office had compiled a list of potential invitees, or whether Houston was on that list. Officials at the time suggested even mentioning whether a list was put together, let alone whether Houston was on the list, could harm international relations with the United States. Nevertheless, the questions were taken on notice, with the government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, stating he would see if the prime minister had any information to add. The government has yet to respond to these questions. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning At the same time as officials were speaking about the matter, eight freedom of information requests to the department, filed by a number of media organisations and people, including Guardian Australia, were due for a response. The department tried, and failed, to get an extension of time to respond to those requests. But the department took close to another month to respond to those requests. At 6.20pm AEDT on Friday night, commonly referred to as the \u201ctake out the garbage\u201d time of the news cycle, the department issued its decisions to refuse the requests. In the decision provided to Guardian Australia, the assistant secretary for protocol and international visits in the department, Alison Green, said even acknowledging the existence of documents related to whether Houston was on the list would \u201cdiminish the confidence which the United States would have in Australia\u201d as a recipient of confidential information. This is despite the fact that Australia, in this instance, is the sender of the apparent confidential information \u2013 a list of potential attendees. Green acknowledged that the document for the list of potential invitees exists, because the department of foreign affairs had already acknowledged it exists, but then won\u2019t confirm its existence in relation to whether Houston\u2019s name is on that list. \u201cGiven the reference in the FOI request to a particular individual (in this case, Mr Brian Houston), mere identification of the existence of a document meeting the terms of the FOI request, if such a document existed, would in itself disclose the content of the confidential communication.\u201d There will be appeals to the decision to the information commissioner, which can take up to a year to complete, meaning the issue will drag well into 2020, as the government continues to avoid answering the question. Why the secrecy? It is no state secret that Morrison has had a close relationship with the Hillsong founder \u2013 Houston is mentioned in Morrison\u2019s first speech in parliament. In July, Morrison and his wife, Jenny, appeared on stage with Houston at a Hillsong conference and asked the attendees to pray for rain. It\u2019s unclear why, then, the government just won\u2019t answer the question. Houston himself has been asked whether he was invited and said he wasn\u2019t aware of it, because he, at the time of the last interview, hadn\u2019t spoken to the prime minister about it. After the news of the potential invite became public, it threw the spotlight back onto Houston\u2019s response to his father\u2019s child sex abuse, and led to reports that the NSW police investigation into Houston\u2019s failure to report the confession to police was still active. Guardian Australia also revealed that Houston refused to be interviewed by NSW police on the matter in 2016, and the police almost closed the investigation after that.",
