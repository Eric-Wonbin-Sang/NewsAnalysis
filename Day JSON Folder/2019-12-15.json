      "bodyText": "National election campaigns \u2013 by definition a team effort \u2013 are somewhat unfairly often credited to the performance of a single person. But thanks to a sharp, focused campaign that produced a large majority for Boris Johnson after a period of unprecedented political instability there was just one name being sung out at Conservative headquarters on Thursday: Isaac Levido. A protege of veteran Australian political strategist Lynton Crosby, Levido is not a household name in his home country, despite playing a senior role in the upset re-election of Scott Morrison\u2019s government in May. He is just 36, but former Liberal Victorian state director Simon Frost says Levido has \u201cexperience beyond his age\u201d. No stranger to the UK, Levido worked on the 2015 and 2017 general election campaigns before setting up Crosby-Textor\u2019s Washington DC office and returning to Australia to serve as Liberal party deputy director from January 2018 to mid-2019. After a change of prime minister in August 2018 plunged the Liberal-National Coalition government into minority, they faced a seemingly impossible task of picking up seats from Labor to stay in power despite three years of polling deficits. Levido had responsibilities spanning the party\u2019s research and polling, through to day-to-day operations setting up headquarters in Brisbane, and organising the ground game with state directors. Frost says Levido was \u201ccool and calm under pressure\u201d as he assembled the nuts and bolts of a Liberal party campaign run with a ruthless focus on the leftwing economic policies and personal unpopularity of Labor leader, Bill Shorten. In Australia, Levido worked with Michael Brooks, a pollster from Crosby\u2019s British company CTF Partners, and digital content experts Sean Topham and Ben Guerin from New Zealand \u2013 a team that was later transplanted to run Johnson\u2019s campaign. While the British Labour party took a leaf from Australian Labor\u2019s formidable 2016 campaign \u2013 both claimed the conservatives would privatise public health services \u2013 Levido and his team capitalised on Brexit fatigue with the winning pitch that a majority Johnson government would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. Andrew Bragg, a Liberal senator and former acting party director, is a life-long friend of Levido from their time at college at the Australian National University. Bragg describes Levido as \u201ca country guy from Port Macquarie\u201d and \u201cnot a wanker\u201d \u2013 echoing the personal reflections of other colleagues who say he is quiet, unassuming hard worker who doesn\u2019t self-promote, is not too serious and can have a laugh at himself. New South Wales Liberal president, Philip Ruddock, has a glimmer of pride when he describes Levido as \u201cour young man we sent to London\u201d but stresses at the Australian election in May he was \u201cpart of a very professional team\u201d led by the \u201cvery able\u201d federal Liberal party director, Andrew Hirst. Hirst describes Levido as \u201ca consummate political professional\u201d. \u201cHe did a great job for the Liberal party, and he has clearly done an outstanding job for Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party.\u201d Even Labor MP and shadow agriculture minister Joel Fitzgibbon paid tribute to Levido\u2019s achievement: Ruddock thinks the Liberal party had the edge in Australia because of a team with \u201cproven skills\u201d harvesting the right data \u201cto make judgments about [which voters] it\u2019s possible to move\u201d. \u201cYou need people who have a capacity to look at all of the data, to bring it together, draw conclusions about your own tactics and the way in which you\u2019re going to deal with the issues.\u201d Bragg says Levido has \u201cbeen able to get to the top of his game really quickly\u201d. \u201cIf I were federal director, he\u2019d be the one I\u2019d want running the campaign,\u201d Bragg says, echoing a sentiment that Australian conservatives hope they can call on Levido\u2019s skills again \u2013 if he is not lost to the UK for good. \u201cHe understands politics, polling and \u2026 modern campaign infrastructure. He\u2019s an earthy machine man.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Labor has savaged the government\u2019s economic credentials after the latest budget update showed Australia\u2019s economic growth, wages, investment and household spending have all slumped since the April budget. As the Coalition slashed $21bn from forecast budget surpluses over the forward estimates, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the weak result was a reflection of the Coalition\u2019s poor economic management. \u201cGrowth downgraded, unemployment higher, wages growth weaker, business investment dismal, the government\u2019s economic credibility destroyed \u2013 that\u2019s the mid year budget update in a nutshell,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cThe economy is much weaker and the government has no idea and no plan to turn things around.\u201d While the Morrison government still remains on track to deliver the first budget surplus in 12 years, Monday\u2019s midyear budget update shows $2.1bn has been wiped from the surplus for the 2019-20 year, downgraded to $5bn, while next year\u2019s surplus has been downgraded from $11bn to an estimated $6.1bn. Over the forward estimates, the cumulative surpluses will now total $23.5bn, almost half the amount projected in April. Facing a shortfall of revenue of $32.6bn over the four-year forward estimates, the government has pegged the lower than expected balance on downgrades to superannuation taxes and GST receipts, along with other non-tax revenues. Household consumption has been slashed a full percentage point since the budget, down from a forecast 2.75% to just 1.75%, with the drop in consumer spending attributed to falls in house prices and continued softness in wages. GST receipts \u2013 a reflection of consumer spending \u2013 are down $1.8bn this year compared with the forecast, a reduction of 2.7%, and are down almost $10bn over the forward estimates. While the budget update claims the economy continues to display \u201cresilience\u201d in the face of weak momentum in the global economy, the revised figures show real GDP \u2013 the indicator for economic growth \u2013 has fallen to 2.25% in the current financial year, down from an estimated 2.75%. Growth is forecast to return to 2.75% next year and 3% annually by 2021-22, which the government says will be driven by this year\u2019s personal income tax cuts and investment in productive infrastructure. The midyear economic and fiscal outlook document says the ongoing drought, which has hit farm GDP, will continue to have an impact on the overall economy this year and next, but the budget is assuming a \u201creturn to average seasonal conditions\u201d in 2020-21, leading to a recovery in farm production and exports. Wage growth, which was forecast at 2.75% in the April budget, has also come in at a weaker 2.5% for the next two years, with the government not forecasting a return to 3% growth until 2022-23. The Reserve Bank of Australia said last month that wage growth of between 2 and 3 % was the \u201cnew normal\u201d, despite healthy employment growth and a boost in participation rates. Business investment is also dramatically lower than forecast, dropping from an estimated 5% in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook to just 1.5%. After falling almost 10% in 2018-19, mining investment is forecast to grow 1% this year, down from a projected 4%. Non-mining investment growth has fallen from 5.5% to 2%. The unemployment rate is up to 5.25% compared with the forecast 5%, which the government has flagged will now be achieved in 2021-22. While the government had planned to eliminate debt by the end of the decade, the update shows net debt will still be 1.8% of GDP by 2029-30, down from the 19.5% of GDP in 2019-20, amounting to $392.3bn. The government said that amid the weaker conditions, it had kept spending \u201cunder control\u201d, with annual real growth in spending running at 1.3% and payments as a share of GDP at 24.5%. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said despite the global headwinds, the \u201cdevastating\u201d drought and weaker domestic conditions, the government had still been able to record a surplus. \u201cDespite these challenges, Myefo demonstrates that the Australian economy continues to grow, with the budget returning to surplus for the first time in 12 years,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cIn our 29th year of economic growth, Australians can be confident about their economic future.\u201d Frydenberg said the result was a $53.5bn turnaround on the deficit the Coalition had inherited from Labor when it came to government in 2013, with the country\u2019s growth rate above the OECD average of 1.6%. Since the election, the government has announced an extra $4.2bn on road and rail projects, $1.3bn on drought assistance and $624m on aged care, helping to lift public final demand from 3.25% to 4.75%. Key savings include $196.4m over four years through combatting illegal phoenix activity and a public service efficiency dividend to save $1.5 billion over four years to 2022-23. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, defended the government\u2019s wage growth forecasts, saying wages were still tracking above inflation, and the government\u2019s tax cuts had resulted in workers keeping more of \u201ctheir own money\u201d. \u201cLet me be very clear on this. Real wages growth under our government is stronger than it was when Labor lost government,\u201d Cormann said. \u201c[And] if Labor had been successful in the election in May, people would have had lower disposable income, whereas now they are benefitting from the highest increase in disposable income in more than a decade.\u201d Chalmers said the government\u2019s failure to boost economic growth showed that current policy settings were a \u201chandbrake on the economy\u201d, calling for more spending on infrastructure, the bringing forward of tax cuts, a boost to Newstart and business tax breaks. But he said the extra stimulus could be achieved without jeopardising the budget surpluses. \u201cWe have been saying that for some time now and not just us, the Reserve Bank, the business community, credible economists and others, peak industry groups, have been calling for the government to do more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that the government in quite a pig-headed way has refused to do more is one of the reasons that we have these very disappointing numbers in the MYEFO today.\u201d Australian Council of Trade Union secretary Sally McManus said the government had \u201cfailed the Australian people for years on wage growth.\u201d \u201cAustralian workers are now heading into their seventh year of record-low wage growth.

The senior minister became the first in Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet to repeat that pledge after the election, saying transitional arrangements would definitely stop at the end of December 2020. He said discussions on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU \u201cwill be concluded next year\u201d. Despite his confidence, EU leaders are considering a move to take the initiative and request an extension to the transition period, keeping the UK under Brussels regulations beyond 2020. The move is being mooted by EU officials as a way out of the problem posed by the short time available to negotiate a new relationship and the prime minister\u2019s insistence that he will not seek an extension beyond 11 months. During the election campaign, Johnson and his ministers repeatedly insisted that there would be no extension to transitional arrangements, raising the prospect of an exit on World Trade Organization terms if no trade deal can be struck by then. However, Gove, who has been tipped for a bigger trade talks role under Johnson, dismissed the idea that it will take longer, insisting that it was almost ready to go. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, he said: \u201cQuite a lot of the details that we need to negotiate is already laid out in the political declaration, so a lot of work has been done. \u201cAnd as a number of people have pointed out, there are areas where the European Union\u2019s interests and the United Kingdom\u2019s interests are already closely aligned, so I\u2019m confident that we will be able not just to leave the EU on 31 January but also to conclude all the details of a new relationship in short order.\u201d Asked whether this would be yet another broken promise, like Johnson\u2019s pledge to take the UK out of the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d, Gove simply said: \u201cNope.\u201d Despite Gove\u2019s confidence, a new report from the Institute for Government warned that Whitehall is not \u201cmatch fit\u201d for the next phase of Brexit negotiations. Raoul Ruparel, a former adviser to Theresa May and David Davis, who was credited with coming up with the Northern Ireland solution which helped Boris Johnson seal a Brexit deal with the EU, said lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of May\u2019s government. \u201cThere is a huge amount of work to be done to flesh out the detail of what the UK wants from its future relationship with the EU, and Whitehall is not yet ready to negotiate such a complex and wide-ranging agreement, nor implement it,\u201d he said.",

Nigel Pearson saw it a little differently, bemoaning the fact that after more than half an hour of doughty defending his Watford side were undone by a breakaway from one of their own set pieces, though even by that stage the visitors had created more scoring opportunities than the team now leading the league by a double-figure margin.</p> <p>The cliched consensus was that no one would ever have guessed the two sides were separated by the entire length of the league, such was the tightness of the contest and open nature of the game until Salah scored his second in the final minute, and although Pearson needs points rather than praise that can only reflect well on his brief contribution to the Watford cause.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c24837b9837ba64e68f5feaaf74cfa342a7905b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c24837b9837ba64e68f5feaaf74cfa342a7905b3/0_119_2834_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watford\u2019s Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 is distraught after missing an easy chance against Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watford\u2019s Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 is distraught after missing an easy chance against Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Vieira/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it was not hard to spot precisely why the two sides are where they are in the table. Liverpool created few chances yet took the ones that did arrive with some aplomb, Salah\u2019s first goal in particular being an object lesson in how to make the most of the merest glimmer of an opening.</p> <p>Watford, by contrast, had glorious opportunities either side of Salah\u2019s opening goal, and missed them both embarrassingly. All Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 could manage was an air shot when a good combination between Isma\u00efla Sarr and \u00c9tienne Capoue left him with a clear sight of goal from close to the penalty spot, and it was from the corner Liverpool conceded that an improvised but effective Roberto Firmino pass allowed the home side to break away and score, Salah cutting in from the left to make space for a measured right-foot finish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/dec/15/flamengo-liverpool-club-world-cup\">The December day when the rising sons of Flamengo outshone Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is the sort of luck you get when you are top and bottom of the league respectively, but just minutes later when Sarr made an even bigger mess of a Gerard Deulofeu cross palmed straight to him by Alisson in the Liverpool goal it was clear the Watford manager was struggling to keep his deadpan expression under control. The natural reaction would have been a roll of the eyes or an open-mouthed stare of disbelief, but the man charged with restoring Watford\u2019s battered self-esteem is aware he is treading on eggshells.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to further dent my players\u2019 confidence by being over-critical,\u201d Pearson said afterwards. \u201cBut clearly we might have got a better reward had we been able to take the chances we created.\u201d</p> <p>In the circumstances it might be inappropriate for Anfield to go overboard celebrating its first clean sheet of the campaign. Watford found space down both flanks with surprising ease, and with any sort of composure in front of goal might have produced one of the shocks of the season.</p> <p>Until Salah made sure right at the end, scoring with a nonchalant flick of the heel after finding himself on the end of Divock Origi\u2019s wayward shot, Liverpool supporters were practically biting their nails for the first time in months.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68171f29ca39a056fa96d03a4d7a8315eddd2ee2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68171f29ca39a056fa96d03a4d7a8315eddd2ee2/0_90_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool\u2019s manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp admitted: \u2018It was not an off day, it was just a difficult game.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liverpool\u2019s manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp admitted: \u2018It was not an off day, it was just a difficult game.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Galloway/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It really was that close, though in fairness it might not have been had not VAR intervened to rule out a handsome Sadio Man\u00e9 goal at the start of the second half for the usual microscopic reasons.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not an off day, it was just a difficult game,\u201d Klopp said, skating over the obvious fact that it would have been a lot more difficult had Watford not been afflicted with an aversion to putting the ball in the net. That is something for Pearson to be working on while Klopp and his players are out in Qatar.</p> <p>When Liverpool return from the Club World Cup they face Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Boxing Day, a fixture that the league table would suggest might be the toughest of the festive period. Klopp\u2019s defenders will need to sharpen up, because Jamie Vardy and the Foxes are unlikely to be anywhere near as forgiving as the hapless Hornets.</p>",

      "bodyText": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp paid tribute to Mohamed Salah\u2019s finishing ability and Joe Gomez\u2019s renewed partnership with Virgil van Dijk as Liverpool pushed further ahead of the chasing pack in their last Premier League game before Christmas, before paying an inadvertent but deserved compliment to the fighting spirit shown by the club at the bottom of the table. \u201cYou would not expect in a game against Watford with the set-up that we have that we score both our goals on the counterattack,\u201d the Liverpool manager said, fairly enough. Nigel Pearson saw it a little differently, bemoaning the fact that after more than half an hour of doughty defending his Watford side were undone by a breakaway from one of their own set pieces, though even by that stage the visitors had created more scoring opportunities than the team now leading the league by a double-figure margin. The cliched consensus was that no one would ever have guessed the two sides were separated by the entire length of the league, such was the tightness of the contest and open nature of the game until Salah scored his second in the final minute, and although Pearson needs points rather than praise that can only reflect well on his brief contribution to the Watford cause. Yet it was not hard to spot precisely why the two sides are where they are in the table. Liverpool created few chances yet took the ones that did arrive with some aplomb, Salah\u2019s first goal in particular being an object lesson in how to make the most of the merest glimmer of an opening. Watford, by contrast, had glorious opportunities either side of Salah\u2019s opening goal, and missed them both embarrassingly. All Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 could manage was an air shot when a good combination between Isma\u00efla Sarr and \u00c9tienne Capoue left him with a clear sight of goal from close to the penalty spot, and it was from the corner Liverpool conceded that an improvised but effective Roberto Firmino pass allowed the home side to break away and score, Salah cutting in from the left to make space for a measured right-foot finish. That is the sort of luck you get when you are top and bottom of the league respectively, but just minutes later when Sarr made an even bigger mess of a Gerard Deulofeu cross palmed straight to him by Alisson in the Liverpool goal it was clear the Watford manager was struggling to keep his deadpan expression under control. The natural reaction would have been a roll of the eyes or an open-mouthed stare of disbelief, but the man charged with restoring Watford\u2019s battered self-esteem is aware he is treading on eggshells. \u201cI don\u2019t want to further dent my players\u2019 confidence by being over-critical,\u201d Pearson said afterwards. \u201cBut clearly we might have got a better reward had we been able to take the chances we created.\u201d In the circumstances it might be inappropriate for Anfield to go overboard celebrating its first clean sheet of the campaign. Watford found space down both flanks with surprising ease, and with any sort of composure in front of goal might have produced one of the shocks of the season. Until Salah made sure right at the end, scoring with a nonchalant flick of the heel after finding himself on the end of Divock Origi\u2019s wayward shot, Liverpool supporters were practically biting their nails for the first time in months. It really was that close, though in fairness it might not have been had not VAR intervened to rule out a handsome Sadio Man\u00e9 goal at the start of the second half for the usual microscopic reasons. \u201cIt was not an off day, it was just a difficult game,\u201d Klopp said, skating over the obvious fact that it would have been a lot more difficult had Watford not been afflicted with an aversion to putting the ball in the net. That is something for Pearson to be working on while Klopp and his players are out in Qatar. When Liverpool return from the Club World Cup they face Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Boxing Day, a fixture that the league table would suggest might be the toughest of the festive period. Klopp\u2019s defenders will need to sharpen up, because Jamie Vardy and the Foxes are unlikely to be anywhere near as forgiving as the hapless Hornets.",

      "bodyText": "The government is not \u201cmatch fit\u201d for the next phase of Brexit negotiations, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser on exiting the EU has said. Raoul Ruparel, who was credited with coming up with the Northern Ireland solution which helped Boris Johnson seal a Brexit deal with the EU, says lessons need to be learned from the mistakes of May\u2019s government. \u201cAs it stands, the UK does not yet appear \u2018match-fit\u2019 for the next phase of negotiations,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a huge amount of work to be done to flesh out the detail of what the UK wants from its future relationship with the EU, and Whitehall is not yet ready to negotiate such a complex and wide-ranging agreement, nor implement it.\u201d May\u2019s former adviser says that contrary to what many believe \u201cit is possible to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of next year\u201d. But he warns that it could only be \u201cnarrow\u201d in scope. In a report for the Institute for Government, Ruparel is scathing about the UK\u2019s approach to negotiations in the first phase. The \u201creal error was the UK never properly considered what approach and structure would suit its own goals best or put forward an alternative\u201d while the EU was constantly on the front foot, with policy decisions translated into legal text before the UK had worked out its own position. He also says much of the work done under the May government in Whitehall will now be irrelevant. His words echo advice from many trade deal experts who say the UK has to learn from its mistakes and set out its wishlists and red lines clearly and publicly as is the convention in international negotiations. The EU has already indicated its red lines before the new government has even got to work on precisely who, or what government department, will lead its negotiations. Talks in February will open with an EU demand of alignment with union rules. EU leaders warned on Friday that the price of a quick deal including tariff-free access to the single market would be agreeing to the level playing field on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. Ruparel says one of the main decisions facing Johnson is whether he wants an overarching ambitious deal, known as a \u201cmixed agreement\u201d, covering the entire gamut of the future political relationship, including security, data, aviation, science and education. That would take years to negotiate. The alternative is a deal that \u201conly engages with EU exclusive competence\u201d, one that would only require approval of the commission and the parliament and not individual governments which, for example, took a year to ratify the EU-Canada deal. The latter would \u201climit the scope of any agreement, resulting in what might be termed a shallow and narrow future relationship\u201d, he warns. At the moment Whitehall is not set up for a wide-ranging and complex negotiation, he says. There has been speculation that the Department for Exiting the EU could fold, and Ruparel says it is likely that the department will have to be wound down. \u201cSince its inception, the department has suffered from a poorly defined role,\u201d he says. Ruparel says there are three options for negotiations: run a narrow central unit out of No 10 or the Cabinet Office with expert advice feeding in from across Whitehall; set up a larger unit within the Cabinet Office with sufficient expertise to challenge other Whitehall departments; or revamp the Department for International Trade. Given the limited time to build the team and seal a comprehensive deal with the EU, one option would be to pursue a phased deal. This would mean a targeted narrow Brexit deal by the end of 2020, as the building blocks for \u201ca more ambitious and comprehensive relationship\u201d over time. This, Ruparel warns, would not be supported by businesses, who would favour just one change to their supply chains and operations.",

      "body": "<p>At the end of a joyful and often inspirational process marked by honesty, humility, a roster of outstanding candidates and the willingness of all parties to submit to multiple interviews, a public vote resulted in a richly deserved winner. Ben Stokes, who well before polling opened had made his first appearance on the programme as one of three England cricketers introduced by Gary Lineker as \u201cWorld Cup run-out hero Jason Roy, captain Eoin Morgan and main award winner Ben Stokes\u201d was indeed presented with the main award. Lineker\u2019s faux pas was swiftly corrected, and surely a slip of the tongue rather than evidence of outlandish vote-rigging, with Stokes already the bookmakers\u2019 runaway favourite and England\u2019s cricketers also providing the team and moment of the year.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/dec/15/bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-2019-live\">Ben Stokes wins BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2019 \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So concluded a broadcast that had started some four hours earlier, with the BBC so excited by the stars\u2019 arrival that they broadcast it twice.

      "bodyText": "At the end of a joyful and often inspirational process marked by honesty, humility, a roster of outstanding candidates and the willingness of all parties to submit to multiple interviews, a public vote resulted in a richly deserved winner. Ben Stokes, who well before polling opened had made his first appearance on the programme as one of three England cricketers introduced by Gary Lineker as \u201cWorld Cup run-out hero Jason Roy, captain Eoin Morgan and main award winner Ben Stokes\u201d was indeed presented with the main award. Lineker\u2019s faux pas was swiftly corrected, and surely a slip of the tongue rather than evidence of outlandish vote-rigging, with Stokes already the bookmakers\u2019 runaway favourite and England\u2019s cricketers also providing the team and moment of the year. So concluded a broadcast that had started some four hours earlier, with the BBC so excited by the stars\u2019 arrival that they broadcast it twice. Radzi Chinyanganya and Amy Irons helmed a vaguely serious main programme while Reece Parkinson and the singer and Fulham forward Chelcee Grimes did a more chaotic youth-culture version, both simultaneously broadcast on the red button (the colour of which is precisely the kind of completely invented pro-Labour bias the new government is so angry about, and the content of which is precisely the kind of completely unnecessary fluff that the BBC will have to can as a result). This meant that for much of the time a majority of the people on the red carpet were being employed to interview people on the red carpet, and that they often had little option but to simply interview each other. \u201cWhat are you looking forward to after the show? Last year there was this mad cheese fondue,\u201d asked Grimes of Parkinson. \u201cWhat is it that you want to ask Dina Asher-Smith?\u201d asked Parkinson of Grimes \u2013 one of the key themes of this period was interviewers interviewing other interviewers about the prospect of interviewing someone who wasn\u2019t an interviewer \u2013 and also: \u201cAre we really going to ask Ben Stokes to put his hand inside the sack?\u201d This sack was a Christmas stocking stuffed with random questions written on little slips of paper.

      "bodyText": "Which I guess means you and I are finished too. Thanks for your company, and enjoy what\u2019s left of the weekend. And that\u2019s goodbye, apparently. Well done Ben Stokes, well done everyone. Stokes congratulates the others nominees - I\u2019d guess he\u2019s prepared, because no way he couldn\u2019t win. So now he thanks his team-mates and says how special it is sharing the moments with them, management and backroom staff - he wouldn\u2019t be where he is without them. Two years ago he says he went through a tough time, thanks Harvey Fairbrother, his agent - \u201can incredible man, don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve put up with Andrew Flintoff then me.\u201d He moves onto his parents who live on the other side of the world so don\u2019t get to do nights like this, but thanks them for all they\u2019ve done for him and all the sacrifices. He thanks his wife and says his family are more important to him than what he does for a living, tells his kids he loves them, then comes back to his missus - \u201cI\u2019m so proud to call you my wife ... I guess I have to end on that.\u201d I love Ben Stokes. Of course it is! He kisses his wife, waits for a second kiss, doesn\u2019t get one, so off he marches to the stage. We are privileged to be living in his time, we really are. He already has his trophy on holiday. Up she comes... Here come Princess Anne and Denis Law - the son of a fisherman from Aberdeen - to present the trophy. We recap our challengers. I predict: 1. Stokes 2. Asher-Smith 3. Johnson-Thompson Here comes Gareth Thomas with the trophy - he\u2019s peddled a four-wheeled contraption 500 miles. Eyes down for the final award! Jason Roy says it was amazing to walk past so man smiling people, and it was amazing to inspire so many people. People have been voting the greatest sporting moment of the year: 1. Kompany\u2019s goal v Leicester 2. Liverpool\u2019s fourth goal v Barca 3. Lucy Bronze\u2019s goal in the World Cup quarter final 4. The put that won the Solheim Cup 5. Stokes\u2019 winning four at Headingley 6. England winning the World Cup He says it\u2019s amazing to be a part of such a great night, and the support they\u2019ve had over four years has been great - he\u2019s very grateful. Here\u2019s Eoin Morgan to collect the award! Nicola Adams and Lizzie Yarnold now join us to present the team of the year award. I can\u2019t see how this doesn\u2019t go to England men cricketers, but you never know. We see a bit of Joshua, then pay homage to the amazing Nicola Adams and Josh Warrington. Here\u2019s KSI to talk us through the boxing year... Tim Sanders emails with this soul-warming anecdote: \u201cA friend of mine has just posted this: \u2018Dina is lovely - my daughter was back from uni and went back to the local track to train with her old group, Dina was there and as ever chatted and treated them just like other club athletes, no diva but a phenomenal athlete\u201d. Gordon Banks, Billy McNeill, Stevie Chalmers, Harrison Dillard, Gordon Brand Jnr, Justin Edinburgh, Fernando Ricksen and Jordan Dawes are among them. We move onto those who\u2019ve passed this year; Lewis Capaldi is back. What a performance that was by England against New Zealand, and what a performance by South Africa against England. You know what? I think sport is quite good. Right, rugby world cup time. Lucy Bronze says she thinks that Team GB will win Olympic gold. Emile Sande now sings while freestylers who are also dancers do their thing. \u201cFor a brief moment it\u2019s enough ... you\u2019ve earned the right to celebrate,\u201d says Rapinoe. \u201cBut is it enough? No!\u201d If I\u2019m honest, I still find this slightly nauseating; a better, more qualified manager and I reckon England beat USA. Time for a women\u2019s football world cup section, narrated by Megan Rapinoe. We watch a Champions League recap - what a ridiculous knockout stages we had, even if the final was a bust. Oh goodo: we appear to have a section on VAR. I think Mike Riley is going to be given a special award. She wipes a tear from her eye, and says she never thought, when growing up in Wales, that she\u2019d be where she is now. She tried loads of sports growing up and wanted to play rugby, but eventually found one she was good at. She thanks all those who\u2019ve helped her, stresses the importance of young people staying active and playing sport, then notes how far parasport has come since she went to Seoul. We\u2019re told just how amazing Grey-Thompson is. She won at sprinting, then went and won at the marathon, and now she works in house of Lords to improve the lots of other disabled people. Those Seoul 1988 British tracksuits were the absolute bomb. Onto to our parasports slot now, which leads into Tanni Grey-Thompson\u2019s lifetime achievement award. Some skateboarding takes place. It\u2019s Sky Brown, who is set to become Britain\u2019s youngest-ever Olympian and won a bronze at the world champs. She is absolutely loving this, and says skateboarding has taught her never to give up. I just voted for Benjamin Andrew Stokes; I\u2019d happily have voted for Dina Asher-Smith, though. That\u2019s all six of our contenders enumerated - those of you wanting to vote can vote ... now. Can\u2019t argue with that one. He\u2019s been with her since she was eight, and tells all the volunteer coaches to set their sights high, because this is what you can do. He says Dina is a pleasure to coach, and is the first one to finish but at the media line is the last one there. She says that he gives the same attention to all his athletes, and sh cried when she heard he\u2019d won. We see the footage of her and her mum after she won in Doha, and she thanks her parents for all the sacrifices they\u2019ve made for her. She wants to keep getting better, keep finding small things to improve, and is negotiating for Christmas Day off. She is amazing, basically: phenomenally talented and equally joyful and pleasant. My days what a run that was in the final. An absolute destruction of the field. Were onto the wonderful Dina Asher-Smith now. She says she started for fun, and never expected athletics to be her life. Her coach says she\u2019s got a bit bigger but has never changed. He\u2019s asked about next year - when he\u2019ll be trying to equal Michael Schumacher\u2019s seven titles - and says he doesn\u2019t think about record, just that when he was a kid growing up, he watched Schumacher and is honoured to be mentioned in the same sentence as him. He hopes he can inspire others. Hamilton now does an interview, away with his family. He thanks his team, says that he\u2019s the second-oldest driver now, but is still learning, and says it was special to win for Nikki Lauda, who died this year - \u201cit was nice to have his spirit around\u201d. Billy Monger, who does the VT, says he\u2019s the greatest sportsman of all time. Hmmm. Onto F1 now \u2013 it\u2019s Hamilton time. Now we have an appeal to sport relief - Thomas explains how talking about his personal issues saved his life. Hands in pockets time, people. Gareth Thomas is now with Kelly Holmes and Graeme Swann; he giveth and he taketh awat. Now a quick bit on Le Tour, and what a race that was. It webbed me up this year, I must say. Now we parse the Saracens situation, Man City winning the women\u2019s FA Cup, Lyon winning the Champions League, the French Open tennis and other bits. Thomson thanks his mum - \u201cshe\u2019s been with me from the start\u201d - I guess she has - and he thanks those who work with him, his young leaders, the young people who come to his sessions. And he thanks the parents who bring their kids to his sessions. Thirteen years ago he got beaten up coming home from a house party, so now he helps kids avoid going down the wrong path like those who attacked him. He seems an absolute boss. Here\u2019s why. \u201cIn this world there is a lot of beautiful things,\u201d Kipchoge says. Preach, my man. Here comes Eliud Kipchoge to present the award. I cant get my head around him either. Right, unsung hero award time. Catriona Matthew is with Clare Balding, talking about the brilliant Solheim Cup win. She\u2019s looking forward to Inverness, Ohio in 2021. \u201cI always believed I could do it,\u201d he says, but then he panicked when it got to single figures because he\u2019d come so far. He talks about his time away from home, and that his family and friends keep him going. I can\u2019t get my head around how good he is. Now we move onto the miracle of Headingley. What an absolute hero. \u201cPeople say this is an amazing year for Ben Stokes ... just trying to do my job,\u201d he says. \u201cYou got to whatever length you have to,\u201d he says of winning the world cup. His wife says having kids made him see a world outside sport, and that\u2019s helped with his performances. Morgan says he was calm during the denouement, but Roy was going wild. Stokes says it was \u201cone of the best days he\u2019s ever had on a cricket pitch\u201d. One of them! Here\u2019s something to read on all that. Here come Morgan, Roy and Stokes ... and the trophy. Thirty-three years of my life in there. \u201cThe eeriest thing\u201d says Jason Roy of the silence as he went to field the final delivery and hurl it in. \u201cIt\u2019s the only time the emotion of winning has ever got too much,\u201d says Stokes. \u201cI cried ... yeah it was cool.\u201d It really, really was. \u201cIf it went right and we won, it wold justify every single thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Jos Buttler. \u201cBut if we didn\u2019t win ... I really struggled with the other side of that.\u201d You and me both, Joseph. In fact we\u2019re onto cricket now, and there\u2019s not a chance I can possibly hold it together as we recap the world cup final, Jason Roy and Eoin Morgan doing the talking. I\u2019d like to say it does one of the greatest finals ever justice, but I cannot. Right, now onto Wimbledon. He thanks everyone and says that as a Scottish rugby player in the 90s, this is the closest he ever got to a trophy. He dedicates the award to everyone who\u2019s supported his foundation over the last three years, and says he\u2019s raised nearly \u00a35m trying to beat MND. Rugby and life have taught him to enjoy life, and I think he suggests there might be some thirst-slaking later on. He then thanks his wife in terrific style and now my eyeballs are definitely sweating. She says that it\u2019s a pleasure to see Doddie and talks about how much pleasure and pride he\u2019s given people. She\u2019s been patron of the Scottish motor neurone disease for 30 years, and knows what an impact he\u2019s had. The Princess Royal now arrives to present the award. Weir\u2019s wife, kids and ex-team-mates take to the stage, and now so does he. I think my eyeballs might be sweating. He tells us about motor neurone disease, and how muscles waste away until it\u2019s not possible to walk, eat, drink and such. He\u2019s trying to fight the disease and find a cure - \u201cthe best is coming out in him,\u201d says Telfer, and we learn that he\u2019s raised \u00a34m to help others. Jim Telfer says he was first struck by his athleticism and long levers; his wife says there\u2019s never a dull moment and he\u2019s a colourful character. What a man. We also learnt that before every game, he told Warren Gatland \u201cThank you for the opportunity\u201d. He says he was well aware of what he represented - I think he means Wales, not the bald denial community - and he thanks all those who\u2019ve supported him. He\u2019s told that he can equal Richie McCaw\u2019s caps record next year, notes that McCaw has two world cups, and that it\u2019s not a numbers game. Alun Wyn Jones is up now, and we\u2019re told that he was very big as a kid, understood the game well, and delivered brilliant speeches. We also learn that he was at the centre of training-ground scuffles because he liked winning. We move onto Tiger Woods, whose spectacular win at Augusta was one of the greatest moments of the year. I was rather hoping we were going to get a recap of the Masters, but instead we get some bloke in a deep voice attempting profundity. \u201cShameful that this year\u2019s shortlist for Sports Personality doesn\u2019t contain a single Para-athlete,\u201d emails Chris Page. \u201cIt\u2019s as though Disabled sportspeople have been \u2018cancelled\u2019. The shortlist should be restored to the same number of candidates as last year. And Lineker calling Man City \u201cThe Sky Blues (that\u2019s actually Coventry City) is unforgivable!\u201d Yes, ahgreed on both counts. She namechecks Denise Lewis as an inspiration and says she was ready to chuck the sport in, thinking her chucking wasn\u2019t good enough and her body couldn\u2019t take the rigours, but Lewis reassured her. Out she comes, following a Liverpool and Scouse-based VT, confessing she\u2019s feeling emotional and had a bit of a cry backstage. I say that, but thinking about it I remember a row years ago when snooker was categorised with \u201cminor sports\u201d, and also that we\u2019re no longer reviewing the sporting year but feting the sporting personalities. Now, we\u2019re onto the wonderful Katarina Johnson-Thompson. Also awarded barely any time: one of the greatest final performances of all-time in any sport, namely Judd Trump in the world snooker. I don\u2019t know, i really don\u2019t \u2013 BBC even have the rights. Darts is awarded precisely 1.29 seconds of time, likewise the Superbowl and various other bits and pieces. We now have an interview with Sterling, who who tells us he\u2019s driven on by winnings. He says he spoke out because he\u2019d had enough of unfair headlines about him and how those sentiments had moved into grounds with people hating him for no apparent reason. Indeed. Walker then says he\u2019s a top bloke and good enough to be the best in the world. As for the importance of Pep Guardiola\u2019s opinion on the matter, given how he responded to the Bernardo Silva tweet \u2013 well, I\u2019ll leave that one for you to figure out. \u201cI call him Martin Luther King,\u201d laughs Kyle Walker. Straight into Raheem Sterling now, and his work in fighting racism; what a hero. No we have Vincent Kompany reading out some extremely average copy about the Premier League season, then we see that goal he scored against Leicester. Decent, you have to say. \u201cMake mine a treble,\u201d less so. We start the review with James McAvoy saying nothing about Celtic\u2019s treble treble, and see a few goals from weird angles. It\u2019s exceedingly whatever. It\u2019s a while since I watched this show, I must confess: do they still have a spot where Airdrie\u2019s reserve goalie participates in some kind of strange fairground activity or whatever? The \u201ciconic trophy\u201d isn\u2019t yet here because Gareth Thomas is proving, yet again, how hard and brilliant he is, schlepping it o hither and yon in order to raise money for sport relief. Our hosts come out: Gabby Logan, Clare Balding, Gary Lineker. Do we think \u201cLewis\u201d is an omen? Or are we now getting spots from artists known as Katarina, Ben, Dina, Alun and Raheem. Oh I hope so. \u201cLewis Capaldi\u201d is now singing a song, I\u2019m not sure why. He looks not unlike a slightly older and scruffier Paul Merton. Naturally, we begin with sportsfolk reading prepared lines about the profound nature of things, which I guess is slightly better than the bad pietry I was expecting. Right, we\u2019re away! Angelic! And, er, hirsute. Oh my days, I could do this all night. Two more absolute legends, and what a coat from Colin! I had the intense honour of interviewing this absolute hero a few months ago. He is every bit the man you hope that he is. Doddie Weir \u2013 who is suffering with motor neurone disease \u2013 will receive the Helen Rollason award tonight, \u201cfor outstanding achievement in the face of adversity\u201d. Well done him, and well done also for this suit, which is an absolute jazzer. Who isn\u2019t amped to celebrate the unrivalled, unremitting glory of this country? Oh yes. Go us! I\u2019m choking up here. On the shortlist for tonight\u2019s gong are: 1. Dina Asher-Smith 2. Lewis Hamilton 3. Katarina Johnson-Thompson 4. Alun Wyn Jones 5. Raheem Sterling 6. Benjamin Andrew Stokes Stokes is the overwhelming favourite and it\u2019s hard to look beyond him for the moments of collective, eyeball-sweating ecstasy that he inspired. But all of these have done incredible things \u2013 some of them off the pitch as well as on it \u2013 and all of these deserve celebrating. So let\u2019s give it a go \u2013 we can be ok when we put effort in. Start: 7pm GMT",

Doddie Weir was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2016. The much-loved Scottish rugby international lock forward has since raised \u00a35m for MND research. Weir received his award from the Princess Royal, who is both president of the Scottish Rugby Union and royal patron of MND Scotland. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see Doddie here. The reception indicates you are pretty well recognised,\u201d she said. Getting a large laugh from the crowd after observing that \u201cas a Scottish rugby player from the 90s this is as close as I\u2019ve got to a trophy\u201d, Weir went on to thank his family and the public for supporting his new cause. \u201cMy passion is to find a cure for MND,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say to enjoy the day because you don\u2019t know what will happen tomorrow. So tonight will be a special day.\u201d The world sport star of the year was Eliud Kipchoge, the Kenyan long-distance runner who this year became the first man in history to run the marathon distance in under two hours. Kipchoge attended the award ceremony and in turn announced Keiren Thompson as the winner of the unsung hero award. The 31-year-old runs Helping Kids Achieve, an organisation which provides sporting clinics for children in a deprived area of Nottingham. Coach of the year was John Blackie for his role in coaching Asher-Smith since she joined Blackheath and Bromley Athletics club at the age of eight.",

One obvious outlet here: get the ball to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Real life outcome: Aubameyang touched the ball eight times in the first half, three of which were kick-offs. Otherwise, this was simply an occasion to admire in miniature that central performance, to find the right way to praise De Bruyne. This is a player so good he makes the game look silly or soft at times; and around whom the next five months will surely revolve if City are to transform their own enduring midfield brilliance into trophies.",

He released a video on Sunday in an apparent attempt to defend his policies and cement his legacy.</p> \n<p>\u201cMake no mistake, Labour is the greatest force for progressive change this country has ever known. And though this wasn\u2019t our moment, our time will come,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last four years we have built a new movement which isn\u2019t going away.

Harriet Harman, the former deputy leader who stood in when Ed Miliband lost in 2015, said Corbyn should go and had shown \u201cno willingness to understand why \u2066[Labour] suffered this catastrophic defeat\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is understood some potential leadership candidates want a timetable that gives them longer to put their cases to the public, but there are also concerns on the non-Corbynite wing that the central party could design the contest to help favoured candidates.</p> \n<p>The current rulebook suggests people will be able to sign up as members with leadership voting rights until two weeks after the timetable for the contest has been set. This raises the prospect of a race among all candidates to get new supporters to sign up in order to back them, as happened in the 2015 and 2016 leadership contests that Corbyn won.</p> \n<p>No candidate has formally declared, but Nandy, a former shadow cabinet minister for Miliband on the soft left, said on Sunday that she was \u201cseriously thinking\u201d about a run. Nandy said there was a \u201cvery, very hard road\u201d to regain the trust of Labour voters in towns across the north of England, and she called on the party to move its headquarters and conference outside of big cities.</p> \n<p>The Fabian Society, the socialist society and thinktank, warned that to win a majority at the next election Labour needs to gain 123 seats, almost twice as many as it required at the 2019 election.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://fabians.org.uk/another-mountain-to-climb/\">It highlighted the scale of the challenge facing the new leader</a>, saying that to secure the \u201cwinning post\u201d marginal seat Labour now needs an electoral swing of 10.3 percentage points, almost three times more than the swing it needed to win the 2019 election.</p> \n<p>It said 63% of the seats Labour needs to win are in the north, the Midlands and Wales, while 104 of the 123 seats Labour needs are in towns not cities.</p> \n<p>Andrew Harrop, the Fabian Society\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe detailed numbers show that Thursday\u2019s result was even worse than it appeared on the night. Our analysis shows that Labour will need to make huge strides in this parliament to have a hope of winning power even in 10 years\u2019 time. A decisive change in direction is therefore needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe party\u2019s top priority must be to win support in towns and small cities in Wales, the north and the Midlands. There is no other route to winning back power. The party must choose its new leadership wisely, by asking who can earn the trust of potential voters in these areas, while not alienating existing supporters in big cities.\u201d</p> \n<p>After a weekend of reflection, Labour MPs and other figures have begun to give their verdicts on what went wrong. Burgon, who is considering running to be Long-Bailey\u2019s deputy, admitted that the party\u2019s position on holding another EU referendum \u201cdid fail\u201d but he also blamed attacks on Corbyn by the rightwing media.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/qa-how-will-the-labour-party-choose-its-next-leader\">Q&amp;A: How will the Labour party choose its next leader?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Andy Burnham, who won 63% of the vote to become Greater Manchester\u2019s first elected mayor in 2017, said he had been sidelined from the election campaign along with Labour\u2019s other mayors and local council leaders.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asked to do anything by the national party and I think I do have something to offer. I\u2019m not offended by it, but I think it reflects the disconnect which has led us to this pretty dark place,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Burnham said the national party did not seem proud of policies that had not been dreamt up in the London HQ. \u201cI would like them to be a bit prouder of what Labour figures outside of Westminster are doing to protect people from the worst of the Tory government,\u201d he said, adding that initiatives such as his Bed Every Night scheme, which offers all rough sleepers in Greater Manchester a place to sleep indoors, were \u201cutterly invisible\u201d in the campaign.</p> \n<p>Other MPs said it was necessary not to blame solely the leadership or Brexit but to acknowledge that the party\u2019s hold over its northern heartlands had been weakening for some time.</p> \n<p>Louise Haigh, a shadow minister, said: \u201cWe have to be honest about how we got here.

Labour confirmed on Sunday night that Corbyn had asked for a leadership process to elect his successor by the end of March, meaning he will carry on in post and opposing Boris Johnson across the dispatch box for more than three months. The party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, wrote to the national executive committee to say a full timetable for the leadership contest would be agreed, with a recommended start date of 7 January. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, threw their weight behind their long-term ally Rebecca Long-Bailey for the top job while blaming Brexit for the party losing support across the north and Midlands. With endorsement from the Corbynite wing of the party, Long-Bailey is now the favourite for the job even though she has not formally declared her candidacy. But a large field of mostly female contenders \u2013 including Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Angela Rayner, Yvette Cooper and Emily Thornberry \u2013 are also mulling whether to throw their hats into the ring, with wildly different assessments of what went wrong for the party. Diane Abbott, another leading Labour woman, ruled herself out of the race, telling the Guardian it was important that whoever was the new leader was able to stand up to \u201call the attacks that will come from Johnson and Donald Trump\u201d. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has long been considered another favourite but many MPs are keen to see a woman lead the party for the first time in its history. Both Starmer and Thornberry played a key role in pushing Labour towards a second referendum position on Brexit and both represent north London seats, and some MPs are already arguing against either getting the job for those reasons.

Let\u2019s take it on the chin. I own this disaster, so I apologise. I apologise to all those wonderful Labour MPs that lost their seats, who worked so hard. I apologise to all our campaigners. But most of all, I apologise to those people who desperately need a Labour government. And, yes, you know, if anyone\u2019s to blame it is me, full stop.\u201d Corbyn has not apologised for the election defeat but he has said he is \u201cvery sad\u201d about the result. He released a video on Sunday in an apparent attempt to defend his policies and cement his legacy. \u201cMake no mistake, Labour is the greatest force for progressive change this country has ever known. And though this wasn\u2019t our moment, our time will come,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the last four years we have built a new movement which isn\u2019t going away. For those that feel disheartened and feel like giving up, I say stay and fight for a better society.\u201d Corbyn made no reference to his intention to step down but McDonnell confirmed they would both leave their posts within the next eight to 10 weeks. There is pressure from some Labour figures for Corbyn to leave sooner. Harriet Harman, the former deputy leader who stood in when Ed Miliband lost in 2015, said Corbyn should go and had shown \u201cno willingness to understand why \u2066[Labour] suffered this catastrophic defeat\u201d. It is understood some potential leadership candidates want a timetable that gives them longer to put their cases to the public, but there are also concerns on the non-Corbynite wing that the central party could design the contest to help favoured candidates. The current rulebook suggests people will be able to sign up as members with leadership voting rights until two weeks after the timetable for the contest has been set. This raises the prospect of a race among all candidates to get new supporters to sign up in order to back them, as happened in the 2015 and 2016 leadership contests that Corbyn won. No candidate has formally declared, but Nandy, a former shadow cabinet minister for Miliband on the soft left, said on Sunday that she was \u201cseriously thinking\u201d about a run. Nandy said there was a \u201cvery, very hard road\u201d to regain the trust of Labour voters in towns across the north of England, and she called on the party to move its headquarters and conference outside of big cities. The Fabian Society, the socialist society and thinktank, warned that to win a majority at the next election Labour needs to gain 123 seats, almost twice as many as it required at the 2019 election. It highlighted the scale of the challenge facing the new leader, saying that to secure the \u201cwinning post\u201d marginal seat Labour now needs an electoral swing of 10.3 percentage points, almost three times more than the swing it needed to win the 2019 election. It said 63% of the seats Labour needs to win are in the north, the Midlands and Wales, while 104 of the 123 seats Labour needs are in towns not cities. Andrew Harrop, the Fabian Society\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cThe detailed numbers show that Thursday\u2019s result was even worse than it appeared on the night. Our analysis shows that Labour will need to make huge strides in this parliament to have a hope of winning power even in 10 years\u2019 time. A decisive change in direction is therefore needed. \u201cThe party\u2019s top priority must be to win support in towns and small cities in Wales, the north and the Midlands. There is no other route to winning back power. The party must choose its new leadership wisely, by asking who can earn the trust of potential voters in these areas, while not alienating existing supporters in big cities.\u201d After a weekend of reflection, Labour MPs and other figures have begun to give their verdicts on what went wrong. Burgon, who is considering running to be Long-Bailey\u2019s deputy, admitted that the party\u2019s position on holding another EU referendum \u201cdid fail\u201d but he also blamed attacks on Corbyn by the rightwing media. Andy Burnham, who won 63% of the vote to become Greater Manchester\u2019s first elected mayor in 2017, said he had been sidelined from the election campaign along with Labour\u2019s other mayors and local council leaders. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asked to do anything by the national party and I think I do have something to offer. I\u2019m not offended by it, but I think it reflects the disconnect which has led us to this pretty dark place,\u201d he said. Burnham said the national party did not seem proud of policies that had not been dreamt up in the London HQ. \u201cI would like them to be a bit prouder of what Labour figures outside of Westminster are doing to protect people from the worst of the Tory government,\u201d he said, adding that initiatives such as his Bed Every Night scheme, which offers all rough sleepers in Greater Manchester a place to sleep indoors, were \u201cutterly invisible\u201d in the campaign. Other MPs said it was necessary not to blame solely the leadership or Brexit but to acknowledge that the party\u2019s hold over its northern heartlands had been weakening for some time. Louise Haigh, a shadow minister, said: \u201cWe have to be honest about how we got here. The leadership was of course a factor, but so too were the years of bitter infighting and the party\u2019s neglect, both perceived and real, of areas of the UK over many years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Dave Hytner\u2019s match report from the Emirates. Thanks for your company - goodnight! Peep peep! Manchester City beat Arsenal for the sixth match in a row, and they barely needed to break sweat. Kevin De Bruyne, playing as a No10, scored two majestic goals, with Raheem Sterling getting the other. It could have been a lot worse for an Arsenal team who looked excruciatingly low on confidence and purpose. 90 min Sterling misses a good chance, driving just wide with his left foot after another penetrative pass from De Bruyne. This could have been worse for Arsenal. 89 min Arsenal are desperate for the referee Paul Tierney to put them out of their misery. It\u2019s been a pretty chastening day. 87 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cTo be fair, Jamie Carragher\u2019s 54th-minute assessment of the Arsenal defence could be applied to a fair number of other people and organisations that I could think of. Present company excluded, of course.\u201d You misspelt \u2018being the ultimate example\u2019. 86 min Sterling plays in Mahrez, whose close-range shot is blocked by Leno. He\u2019s had a decent day in the Arsenal goal, believe it or not. 85 min Benjamin Mendy is replaced by Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Emirates is emptying apace. 84 min \u201cStruggling to see how Arsenal are going to get a new manager that is any good,\u201d says Alexander Scrutton. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to play with them in FIFA career mode anymore.\u201d I\u2019ll do it if nobody else wants it. I\u2019ve got passion, I\u2019ve got ideas, I\u2019ve got a revolutionary 4-3-(1)-2 system. 81 min Arsenal\u2019s final change: Joe Willock replaces Lucas Torreira. 79 min The second half has been a non-event. 77 min City have kept the ball with greater ease in this half, and Arsenal have struggled to get a kick in the last 10 minutes. 75 min Sterling moves into space and drills a low shot that is blocked by Chambers. Manchester City have been able to run through midfield at will all day. 73 min Torreira drives a long ball forward to Aubameyang, whose speculative first-time shot from the left edge of the area bobbles well wide of the far post. 72 min Sokratis is booked for leaving one on Gabriel Jesus. 72 min \u201cAccording to Gary Neville, tactical fouls are in the opposition half,\u201d says Alex Sargent. \u201cMendy just fouled him.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with that. A particular type of tactical foul, possibly the most insidious, takes place in the opposition half but they can happen in either half in my humble one. 70 min Another City change. Ilkay Gundogan is replaced by Riyad Mahrez. 68 min \u201cOn the American feed, the moments of absolute silence are allowing numerous F-bombs and other salty insults to be picked up by the mikes,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cI would advise the Arsenal players to wait a few hours before they leave the stadium. Your loyal fans are rightfully outraged.\u201d I feel a bit sorry for them. Their attitude hasn\u2019t been particularly bad today; they just aren\u2019t good enough, especially not when their confidence is so low. 67 min City enjoy a long spell of possession. The atmosphere at the Emirates is not exactly Bundesligan. 65 min \u201cI\u2019m starting to think that my memory must be playing tricks with me,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI\u2019m certain that Ozil used to be one of my favourite players to watch. He definitely used to do some beautiful, skilful, impudent things with a football. He used to, y\u2019know, affect games and do things. Didn\u2019t he? DIDN\u2019T HE? I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve Beautiful Mind-ed my way to an invented reality.\u201d He did. He\u2019s a genius, really, but his heart hasn\u2019t been in it for a few years now. 63 min Mendy is booked for another tactical foul, on Pepe I think. 62 min A bad mistake from Chambers allows Jesus to run through on goal. His shot is superbly blocked by Leno, flying from his line, and Chambers puts a bit of credit back in the bank by blocking Sterling\u2019s follow-up. 61 min Gundogan is booked for a tactical foul on Smith Rowe. 59 min Another change for Arsenal: Mesut Ozil is replaced by Emile Smith Rowe. Ozil strolls off the field and then volleys his gloves away. Even his displays of anger are half-arsed. 56 min Phil Foden is replaced by Bernardo Silva. Pep knows, I don\u2019t. 54 min De Bruyne picks up the ball in the centre circle, surges to the edge of the area without being challenged and hits a low left-footed drive that is blocked by Chambers. \u201cThey haven\u2019t got a clue what they\u2019re doing,\u201d says Jamie Carragher of the Arsenal defence. 52 min Gabriel Jesus sweeps a first-time curler over the bar at the end of an excellent City counter-attack. That was a decent chance. 51 min \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting to see just how bad Arsenal are,\u201d says Kim Smith. \u201cWhat manger will want to take on this job and what players will want to come here? They are a disgrace. I have supported this team for over 40 years, and at this time I am unhappy to let people know I support them.\u201d Your secret\u2019s safe with both our readers. 50 min Ozil plays an inviting pass to tee up Torreira, who blooters it into the crowd from 25 yards. 48 min That\u2019s better from Arsenal. After a nice passing move, Maitland-Niles\u2019s cross is headed wide by the under-pressure Aubameyang. In fact, I think it came off the back of his neck as he was challenged by Otamendi. 47 min \u201cArsenal Foundation are sponsoring Arsenal\u2019s shirts today,\u201d says Padraig Stapleton, lovingly lining up the irresistible punchline. \u201cTheir defence are no strangers to act of charity anyway.\u201d 46 min Peep peep! Arsenal begin the second half. Half-time reading \u201cThe phrase \u2018tactical foul\u2019 is further evidence that football analysis has jumped the shark,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cTrying to imply some sort of Machiavellian intent overlooks the reality - it\u2019s a frigging foul, end of.\u201d Did you see Claude Makelele play? Peep peep! Manchester City are cruising to their semiannual victory over Arsenal, who are booed off at the break. Kevin De Bruyne, playing in a relatively unusual No10 role, made one, scored two beautiful goals and would have had a hat-trick but for a flying save from Bernd Leno. See you in 10 minutes for more KDB porn. 45 min Three minutes of added time. Phil Foden, who was anonymous for 35 minutes, has been a huge threat since moving to the right. 43 min: Leno denies De Bruyne a hat-trick with a stunning save! Foden came infield from the right, beat a couple of players and then left the ball to De Bruyne, who ran onto it and slammed a first-time curler towards goal from 25 yards. It looked certain to go in the corner of the net, but Leno flew to his left to fingertip it onto the post! 41 min Kolasanic, who was off the field when the third goal was scored, is replaced by Bukayo Saka. The move started when Foden, who had just switched from left to right, came infield and played a short pass to De Bruyne. He rolled Guendouzi, moved to the edge of the D and swept an emphatic curler into the bottom corner with his left foot. It was another brilliant goal. He used the backpedalling Chambers as a screen and shaped it beautifully into the corner with his weaker (sic) foot. Brilliant. Utterly, gloriously, irresistibly brilliant. 38 min Kolasinac is struggling. He twisted his ankle when he landed after being fouled by Rodri a few minutes ago, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to continue. 35 min Rodri is booked for a tactical foul on Kolasinac. 33 min Arsenal are having more of the ball, as they have throughout the game. It\u2019s been an unusual performance from City, who have been happy to let Arsenal have the ball and then kill them on the counter-attack. 31 min More from Charles Antaki, a world-renowned expert on accentuating the positive. \u201cAubameyang almost touched the ball just now.\u201d 30 min \u201cRob, your and Mary Waltz\u2019s predictions will help us prepare mentally for what is sure to be an ample fulfilment (though not necessarily including the Arsenal goals),\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cMental preparation doesn\u2019t always cash out in emotional acceptance, however, and the ugliness will be hard to take.\u201d Indeed. There are unconfirmed reports of crowd trouble at the Emirates, with apparently more than one supporter making a weapon out of their elderflower panna cotta, chilli pineapple carpaccio, pistachio shortbread biscuit. 27 min Ozil\u2019s cross is headed away to the edge of the area, where Guendouzi hits a snapshot that is blocked in the six-yard box by Fernandinho. Moments later Guendouzi falls dramatically just inside the area. Paul Tierney isn\u2019t interested; nor is VAR. 24 min Martinelli is struggling a little after Kyle Walker accidentally trod on his left hand. Can you run off a hand injury? Probably. 22 min Gundogan swishes high and wide from 25 yards. 21 min Playing Kevin De Bruyne as a No10 didn\u2019t really work at Anfield, but he has been imperious today. He really is the most brilliant footballer. 20 min \u201cThis is becoming an advert for the Arsenal to hire Arteta,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cIf he\u2019ll have them.\u201d 17 min Fernandinho is booked for fouling Aubameyang. Arsenal tried to press high up the field and City just passed straight through them. Rodri and Foden were involved at the start, passing their way out of trouble in their own half. Then De Bruyne played a give-and-go with Jesus and ran at Chambers on the left side of the box. He drove a low cross that took a slight deflection, which wrongfooted Kolasinac and allowed the ball to reach Sterling at the far post. He swept it into an open net from six yards. Another beautiful goal from City! 12 min A quiet period in the game. Arsenal look a threat going forward, particularly when Martinelli has the ball. 8 min More rousing play from Martinelli, who skins Walker and hits a stinging cross-shot that is palmed away by Ederson. It comes to Pepe, whose follow-up shot is blocked by Otamendi. I think it was going wide anyway. 7 min \u201cThe deluge has begun,\u201d says Mary Waltz, who predicted a 5-2 City win before the game. \u201cArsenal has zero ability to have any midfield organization and the back line is a sieve. This will be ugly.\u201d 6 min City\u2019s tactics are interesting. It\u2019s essentially 4-2-3-1, with Foden playing from the left and Sterling from the right 4 min Kevin De Bruyne is a disgusting genius. What a brilliant finish! Fernandinho moved forward from the back and slid a good, straight pass to Jesus on the left side of the area. He lost Chambers neatly and cut the ball back speculatively from the byline. It cleared everyone at the near post and reached De Bruyne at the far post, 15 yards from goal. He watched the ball bounce, adjusted his body and sidefooted a blistering shot into the roof of the net. The precision and technique were off the scale. Almost every other player in world football would have put that over the bar; most would have put it out of the ground. Manchester City take the lead with a majestic goal! 35 seconds: Ederson makes a fine save from Martinelli! Crikey, that was some start. Martinelli collected a long ball forward, wriggled away from Fernandinho on the edge of the box and hit a left-footed shot that was superbly blocked by the outrushing Ederson. 1 min Peep peep! City, in their black away kit, kick off from right to left. The Arsenal are in red and white. The teams emerge from the tunnel, all looking very serious about their work. Prediction: Arsenal 2-4 Manchester City. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Tony McPeterson. \u201cI\u2019m not usually one to stick my neck out for these sort of things, but if this game isn\u2019t a draw then I can see one of these teams taking this.\u201d You haven\u2019t factored in the apocalypse. Another email! \u201cI\u2019m very much enjoying the Martinelli &amp; Greenwood tributes to 1993-era Robbie Fowler,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cProdigious finishers papering over the cracks of massive clubs in a slump.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a footballer embody the thrill of youth quite like Fowler. I had to keep my love for him a secret for at least a decade. I\u2019m dead excited about seeing Martinelli today. As for Greenwood, I know it\u2019s early, and I don\u2019t want to get carried away, but if he continues to progress then I think he might just save the world. The 2pm games have finished. Spurs grabbed a late winner at Wolves to jump to fifth in the table, and the extraordinary Mason Greenwood denied Duncan Ferguson another victory as Everton manager. The first email of the day \u201cHi,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cClearly my message to Mesut to avoid Mark Lamarr\u2019s barber went unread.\u201d In fairness, Bill, I think he has bigger concerns than your assessment of his hair. Phil Foden starts a Premier League game for the first time this season. Arsenal (4-2-3-1) Leno; Maitland-Niles, Chambers, Sokratis, Kolasinac; Guendouzi, Torreira; Pepe, Ozil, Martinelli; Aubameyang. Substitutes: Martinez, David Luiz, Saka, Willock, Smith Rowe, Lacazette, Nelson. Manchester City (4-3-3) Ederson; Walker, Otamendi, Fernandinho, Mendy; Gundogan, Rodri, Foden; De Bruyne, Jesus, Sterling. Substitutes: Bravo, Zinchenko, Angelino, B Silva, Mahrez, Cancelo, E Garcia. Referee Paul Tierney. Pre-match reading Hello and welcome to live coverage of Arsenal v Manchester City from the Emirates Stadium. We know what to expect from this one: electric attacking, rococo defending and at least one passage of play that will have a profound impact on Graeme Souness\u2019s Christmas cheer.

      "body": "<p>To Pep Guardiola, attack has long felt like the best form of defence and when the Manchester City manager can call on Kevin De Bruyne in form such as this, it all makes perfect sense. City\u2019s title defence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/07/manchester-city-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">has foundered</a> on problems at the back but they did not have to worry about anything in defensive terms here. Those concerns belonged to Freddie Ljungberg and Arsenal, during a performance of weakness, looseness and naivety.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/dec/15/arsenal-v-manchester-city-premier-league-live\">Arsenal 0-3 Manchester City: Premier League \u2013 live reaction!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was Ljungberg\u2019s first game against an elite-level rival but, if he was auditioning for why he ought to be made the permanent managerial successor to Unai Emery, he fluffed his lines comprehensively. For years \u2013 going back to the end of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s tenure \u2013 Arsenal have been accused of having a soft underbelly; of being too easy to play against. They had no defence to the charge here.</p> \n<p>Time and again, De Bruyne ran at them, spreading panic in their ranks and the City attacking midfielder had the end product to lift his team to what was a third Premier League win in six. De Bruyne scored twice in the first half and laid on another for Raheem Sterling and the hard truth was that he and City could have had more.</p> \n<p>On the occasion of Guardiola\u2019s 200th City game, his team played some lovely football, almost of all it through De Bruyne, and the Emirates, which is always a shouty and unhappy place when results go bad, was pockmarked by empty seats long before full time. The home support had booed their team off at the interval. By the end, there were merely resigned shrugs. It is stating the obvious to say that Arsenal\u2019s problems predate Ljungberg. But can he truly claim to have changed anything for the better?</p> \n<p>It took City precisely 90 seconds to open the scoring and expose the first outbreak of passive Arsenal defending. Fernandinho stepped away from Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s non-challenge before playing a pass up the inside-left channel, where Gabriel Jesus reached the ball too easily ahead of Calum Chambers.

      "bodyText": "To Pep Guardiola, attack has long felt like the best form of defence and when the Manchester City manager can call on Kevin De Bruyne in form such as this, it all makes perfect sense. City\u2019s title defence has foundered on problems at the back but they did not have to worry about anything in defensive terms here. Those concerns belonged to Freddie Ljungberg and Arsenal, during a performance of weakness, looseness and naivety. It was Ljungberg\u2019s first game against an elite-level rival but, if he was auditioning for why he ought to be made the permanent managerial successor to Unai Emery, he fluffed his lines comprehensively. For years \u2013 going back to the end of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s tenure \u2013 Arsenal have been accused of having a soft underbelly; of being too easy to play against. They had no defence to the charge here. Time and again, De Bruyne ran at them, spreading panic in their ranks and the City attacking midfielder had the end product to lift his team to what was a third Premier League win in six. De Bruyne scored twice in the first half and laid on another for Raheem Sterling and the hard truth was that he and City could have had more. On the occasion of Guardiola\u2019s 200th City game, his team played some lovely football, almost of all it through De Bruyne, and the Emirates, which is always a shouty and unhappy place when results go bad, was pockmarked by empty seats long before full time. The home support had booed their team off at the interval. By the end, there were merely resigned shrugs. It is stating the obvious to say that Arsenal\u2019s problems predate Ljungberg. But can he truly claim to have changed anything for the better? It took City precisely 90 seconds to open the scoring and expose the first outbreak of passive Arsenal defending. Fernandinho stepped away from Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s non-challenge before playing a pass up the inside-left channel, where Gabriel Jesus reached the ball too easily ahead of Calum Chambers. What happened next, though, was all about the purity of De Bruyne\u2019s technique. Jesus\u2019s pull-back was bouncing but De Bruyne guided his first-time shot unerringly into the roof of the net from just inside the area. De Bruyne enjoyed himself throughout. There was a moment in the 20th minute where it took four Arsenal players to dispossess him but, by then, he had driven the transition that led to City\u2019s second. What a lovely move it was, starting on the edge of their own area when Rodri intercepted a pass from P\u00e9p\u00e9. Rodri found Phil Foden, who was starting in the Premier League for the first time this season and from there City played their way out to De Bruyne through Benjamin Mendy, Rodri and Foden again. De Bruyne swapped passes with Jesus and when he ran into the left of the area Arsenal\u2019s defenders were visibly unnerved. Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Chambers did not want to do the wrong thing and so they ended up doing nothing, stepping off De Bruyne, which was a very bad idea. De Bruyne\u2019s cross was deflected and Sterling tapped home at the far post. Guardiola played Foden off the left, which is not the 19-year-old\u2019s favourite position, although he still showed his ability on the ball. But City\u2019s performance was all about the cut and thrust of De Bruyne who, in a No 10 role, was freed of some of the defensive responsibilities that he would usually have as a No 8.

      "body": "<p>After the Labour party\u2019s disastrous election defeat in 1983, at the hands of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservatives, Tony Benn famously found a silver lining in the almost unbroken cloud of gloom. Writing in this newspaper, Mr Benn noted that though Labour had been routed, winning only 27.6% of the vote, millions of people had nevertheless voted for an authentically socialist manifesto. This time round, after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-2019-50768605/general-election-2019-worst-night-for-labour-since-1935\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s worst performance at a general election since 1935</a>, there is no dodging the scale of the catastrophe. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, rightly admitted that last Thursday\u2019s poll was a \u201cdisaster\u201d.</p> <p>This was a defeat like no other that Labour has suffered in its 119-year history. The party haemorrhaged seats in the Midlands and north, which have been the bedrocks of its traditional support. The morning after the election, Michael Gove (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/kind-of-blue-uk-comes-to-terms-with-tory-election-victory\" title=\"\">inaccurately</a>) boasted that, for the first time, the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala and the Notting Hill carnival would both take place in constituencies held by Conservatives. That was a gleeful swipe at Labour\u2019s very sense of itself as an institution, founded in 1900, to represent the interests of the working class in the coalfields and factory towns that drove the industrial revolution.</p> <p>But Labour\u2019s problems extend beyond places like Workington and Bishop Auckland. The party\u2019s first leader in parliament, in 1906, was Keir Hardie, a Scottish trade unionist, <a href=\"https://www.scottishlabourhistory.org.uk/\" title=\"\">reflecting its power base north of the border</a>. But Scotland, where Labour <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-50780451\" title=\"\">won just 18.5% of the vote</a> and has only one MP, is now largely hostile territory. The Scots may, during the next decade, leave the union. In England, Labour\u2019s support seems to be reconfiguring in the same way as that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/14/labour-remake-itself-resurgent-communities\" title=\"\">other social democratic parties in Europe</a>, becoming confined mostly to the big cities and university towns. The coalition between middle-class professionals, often working in the public sector, and traditional working-class communities fell apart last Thursday. Without it, the party has no route to power. The challenges that face Labour are therefore existential in nature; there is no easy or obvious quick fix.</p> <p>Brexit undoubtedly played a pivotal role in Labour\u2019s humiliation. The attempt to appeal to both remain and leave voters with a convoluted and equivocal policy turned out to be doomed, though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/john-mcdonnell-will-not-return-to-shadow-cabinet-labour\" title=\"\">Mr McDonnell is surely right</a> to say that the composition of its support placed it on \u201cthe horns of a dilemma\u201d that was all but impossible to resolve. It was not all about Brexit, though. The evidence that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity as a leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/labours-red-wall-demolished-by-tory-onslaught\" title=\"\">was a significant factor</a> in last Thursday\u2019s humiliation is incontestable. He was perceived by many to belong to a strand of the left which had little sympathy with a sense of patriotism that runs deep in leave-voting constituencies. For many Tories in remain-voting constituencies, such as Cheltenham and Guildford, fear of a Corbyn-led government appeared to trump the desire to stay in the EU.</p> <p>Labour must now take the necessary time to reflect on an epochal setback. A rush to premature conclusions should be avoided at all costs. Some of the party\u2019s policies, such as taking the railways into public ownership, were popular and should not become discredited by association with this defeat.</p> <p>As a starting point, Labour clearly needs to radically reset its relationship with the towns and rural regions of England and Wales (Scotland, for the moment, seems unlikely to be the part of any solution). To do this will require, first of all, a recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. The needs, concerns and priorities of Spennymoor in County Durham are not the same as those of the university town of Canterbury.

      "bodyText": "After the Labour party\u2019s disastrous election defeat in 1983, at the hands of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservatives, Tony Benn famously found a silver lining in the almost unbroken cloud of gloom. Writing in this newspaper, Mr Benn noted that though Labour had been routed, winning only 27.6% of the vote, millions of people had nevertheless voted for an authentically socialist manifesto. This time round, after Labour\u2019s worst performance at a general election since 1935, there is no dodging the scale of the catastrophe. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, rightly admitted that last Thursday\u2019s poll was a \u201cdisaster\u201d. This was a defeat like no other that Labour has suffered in its 119-year history. The party haemorrhaged seats in the Midlands and north, which have been the bedrocks of its traditional support. The morning after the election, Michael Gove (inaccurately) boasted that, for the first time, the Durham Miners\u2019 Gala and the Notting Hill carnival would both take place in constituencies held by Conservatives. That was a gleeful swipe at Labour\u2019s very sense of itself as an institution, founded in 1900, to represent the interests of the working class in the coalfields and factory towns that drove the industrial revolution. But Labour\u2019s problems extend beyond places like Workington and Bishop Auckland. The party\u2019s first leader in parliament, in 1906, was Keir Hardie, a Scottish trade unionist, reflecting its power base north of the border. But Scotland, where Labour won just 18.5% of the vote and has only one MP, is now largely hostile territory. The Scots may, during the next decade, leave the union. In England, Labour\u2019s support seems to be reconfiguring in the same way as that of other social democratic parties in Europe, becoming confined mostly to the big cities and university towns. The coalition between middle-class professionals, often working in the public sector, and traditional working-class communities fell apart last Thursday. Without it, the party has no route to power. The challenges that face Labour are therefore existential in nature; there is no easy or obvious quick fix. Brexit undoubtedly played a pivotal role in Labour\u2019s humiliation. The attempt to appeal to both remain and leave voters with a convoluted and equivocal policy turned out to be doomed, though Mr McDonnell is surely right to say that the composition of its support placed it on \u201cthe horns of a dilemma\u201d that was all but impossible to resolve. It was not all about Brexit, though. The evidence that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity as a leader was a significant factor in last Thursday\u2019s humiliation is incontestable. He was perceived by many to belong to a strand of the left which had little sympathy with a sense of patriotism that runs deep in leave-voting constituencies. For many Tories in remain-voting constituencies, such as Cheltenham and Guildford, fear of a Corbyn-led government appeared to trump the desire to stay in the EU. Labour must now take the necessary time to reflect on an epochal setback. A rush to premature conclusions should be avoided at all costs. Some of the party\u2019s policies, such as taking the railways into public ownership, were popular and should not become discredited by association with this defeat. As a starting point, Labour clearly needs to radically reset its relationship with the towns and rural regions of England and Wales (Scotland, for the moment, seems unlikely to be the part of any solution). To do this will require, first of all, a recognition that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work. The needs, concerns and priorities of Spennymoor in County Durham are not the same as those of the university town of Canterbury. A more subtle politics of place, in which the revival and deepening of local democracy is championed, will help Labour begin to reconnect in the years to come. In a way, this is where the party came in, in the twilight years of the 19th century. It emerged then as a civilising force for community, solidarity and self-help, run by and for the industrial working classes. The same yearning for communal renewal characterises post-industrial Britain. This was once, in every sense, Labour\u2019s natural terrain. It can be so again.",

And while print newspaper sales are collapsing and online news audiences growing, right-wing tabloids which relentlessly backed the Conservatives still sell millions of copies a day \u2013 and often indirectly help to set the agenda on television, radio, and online. Although it will be months before academic studies drill down in to the results, there remains a simple demographic divide on how people across the political spectrum get their news.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the clearest differences is that most of those on the left prefer to get news online, and most of those on the right prefer to get it offline,\u201d said Dr Richard Fletcher of the University of Oxford\u2019s Reuters Institute. \u201cThere will undoubtedly be questions about the influence of online media on the election result in the coming weeks, and we should take these questions seriously. But to correctly understand the impact of online media on the election result, we must constantly remind ourselves that the people most likely to have voted Conservative in 2019 are the least likely to have accessed news about the election online.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>The British public were more than capable of creating their own disinformation</strong></h2> \n<p>Ahead of the election there were concerns about foreign manipulation of the electoral process. Although there were some issues \u2013 the prime minister refused to let a report into Russian money be released pre-election, and Reddit suggested a Russian-linked account may have helped distribute leaked US-UK trade papers \u2013 ordinary, politicised Britons proved more than capable of creating their own fake posts.</p> \n<p>When the Tory campaign was briefly derailed by a photograph of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/12/johnson-aide-tried-to-stop-media-using-image-of-boy-on-hospital-floor\">child on the floor of Leeds General Infirmary</a>, a viral message spread among Conservative backers that the image had been faked by Labour supporters. Aided by a toxic mix of falling trust in traditional media outlets and Facebook\u2019s hands-off approach to content moderation, the hoax message was spread to millions of people aided by promotion from mainstream journalists and influencers such as former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen.</p> \n<p>Some of the behaviour of those sharing the message \u2013 often older, less tech-savvy Facebook users \u2013 was so strange that they were mistaken for coordinated \u2018bot farms\u2019. In reality it appears they were just copying and pasting the same message out of enthusiasm and a desire to believe the photo was faked for political reasons.</p> \n<h2><strong>We are becoming passive consumers of news on our phones</strong></h2> \n<p>There\u2019s nothing new about the idea of a political leader winning an election by repeating a slogan until they are blue in the face. But the experience of consuming news on a smartphone \u2013 where headlines drift into view via push alert notifications from news apps, on Facebook, and through links sent by friends \u2013 means that it\u2019s often the only way to cut through the noise. There is limited space for nuanced policy platforms and complicated offers to the electorate if people are not concentrating; it\u2019s easier to adopt a policy of \u2018endless screaming\u2019 and bombard them with the same message \u2013 such as \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d \u2013 through as many different channels as possible.</p> \n<p>While it might be a case of borrowed nostalgia to pretend that people ever really engaged with every news story they saw on television or in a print newspaper, online data makes it easier to show how widespread this behaviour has become. When the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/uncovered-reality-of-how-smartphones-turned-election-news-into-chaos\">ran an experiment to record the smartphone screens of volunteers</a> we found that some people consumed their news almost entirely through headlines, few clicked through to the full article, and those that read to the end of a piece were a rarity.</p> \n<h2><strong>Attacking the media is the new normal \u2013 but mistakes can be quickly called out</strong></h2> \n<p>The BBC is facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">a difficult post-election comedown</a> as it reckons with widespread criticism from both the Conservative government \u2013 who accuse it of anti-Brexit bias \u2013 and from some Labour supporters who feel it made a series of errors in favour of the Conservatives.</p> \n<p>Journalists at the corporation fear the damage done by some incidents, such as quoting Conservatives party sources claiming Labour supporters had assaulted a Tory aide at a hospital in Leeds when no such incident took place. Social media helped set the record straight: within an hour a full video of the alleged altercation was online, making clear that the incident was not as Tory sources had described it, killing the story in its tracks.</p> \n<h2><strong>We don\u2019t know what people were reading online and what had an impact</strong></h2> \n<p>In the past \u2013 when political news was focussed on a few broadcaster bulletins and print newspapers \u2013 it was possible to have a good idea of what people were reading, watching, and consuming. If a politician made a mistake on television programme watched by 10 million people then it clearly mattered. If a print newspaper sold 4m copies a day \u2013 as the Sun did in the 1990s \u2013 then it clearly mattered. But online audiences are so fragmented that information can reach millions of people without ever being seen by journalists or political campaigns.</p> \n<p>One Labour MP who nearly lost their Brexit-backing seat told the Guardian that on doorstep after doorstep, people brought up Corbyn\u2019s connections with the IRA after seeing memes and images on Facebook: \u201cIt was never used by the Tories in the campaign but there was a separate election going on, which was a Facebook-orientated campaign.\u201d</p> \n<p>The MP suggested constituents are increasingly overwhelmed by information and unsure what is real and what is not, assuming there is some sort of editing of what goes on Facebook. \u201cPeople have a sense that some of this stuff is probably wrong but they have no compass. They would say: \u2018But it\u2019s on Facebook \u2013 how can there be something that isn\u2019t true?\u2019 They think there are gatekeepers but there aren\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Online advertising changed</strong></h2> \n<p>The 2016 EU referendum and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election focussed minds on the idea of under-the-radar, paid-for \u2018dark ads\u2019 which manipulate small groups of people to vote a certain way. But transparency tools introduced by Facebook and Google, although flawed, made this easier to track.</p> \n<p>They suggested political advertising in the UK is drifting towards the US model, with blanket ad buys on sites such as YouTube resembling television advertising designed to carpet-bomb voters with simple messages, rather than the more laborious task of manipulating small groups below the radar.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/14/tory-online-election-campaign-russian-bots-misinformation-retweeting\">How the Tories won the online election: pick a line, ignore the facts and repeat | Alex Hern</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Conservatives took advantage of Facebook\u2019s refusal to factcheck paid-for political adverts, with <a href=\"https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/thousands-of-misleading-conservative-ads-side-step-scrutiny-thanks-to-facebook-policy/\">one study by First Draft News finding 88% of Tory ads featured questionable claims</a>. And there was a substantial rise in the number of newly-formed third party campaign groups with opaque funding structures spending large five-figure sums on pushing pro-Tory adverts reaching millions of people.</p> \n<h2><strong>Mainstream media set the agenda but its power has been hit</strong></h2> \n<p>It was the election where politicians realised they could attack the media with few downsides. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\">Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to skip a one-on-one primetime television interview with Andrew Neil</a> provoked fury from Labour, especially after they had agreed to put Corbyn up for scrutiny. But Tory strategists decided \u2013 apparently correctly \u2013 that a tough interview with Neil could be substantially more damaging than a few stories about Johnson refusing to take part in a television programme. The real concern, according to Tory campaign insiders, was about clips from the interview going viral.</p> \n<p>Television stations used to be able to set the terms of engagement because they were one of the only ways for politicians to reach a mass audience. The debacle over the Neil interview, combined with Labour and the Tories working together to keep the Lib Dems and the SNP out of the televised leaders\u2019 debates, showed the power may now lie with the politicians, with potential implications for the next election. That\u2019s if the broadcasters survive in their current form \u2013 with the new Tory government targeting both the BBC and Channel 4.</p>",

While it might be a case of borrowed nostalgia to pretend that people ever really engaged with every news story they saw on television or in a print newspaper, online data makes it easier to show how widespread this behaviour has become. When the Guardian ran an experiment to record the smartphone screens of volunteers we found that some people consumed their news almost entirely through headlines, few clicked through to the full article, and those that read to the end of a piece were a rarity. Attacking the media is the new normal \u2013 but mistakes can be quickly called out The BBC is facing a difficult post-election comedown as it reckons with widespread criticism from both the Conservative government \u2013 who accuse it of anti-Brexit bias \u2013 and from some Labour supporters who feel it made a series of errors in favour of the Conservatives. Journalists at the corporation fear the damage done by some incidents, such as quoting Conservatives party sources claiming Labour supporters had assaulted a Tory aide at a hospital in Leeds when no such incident took place. Social media helped set the record straight: within an hour a full video of the alleged altercation was online, making clear that the incident was not as Tory sources had described it, killing the story in its tracks. We don\u2019t know what people were reading online and what had an impact In the past \u2013 when political news was focussed on a few broadcaster bulletins and print newspapers \u2013 it was possible to have a good idea of what people were reading, watching, and consuming. If a politician made a mistake on television programme watched by 10 million people then it clearly mattered. If a print newspaper sold 4m copies a day \u2013 as the Sun did in the 1990s \u2013 then it clearly mattered. But online audiences are so fragmented that information can reach millions of people without ever being seen by journalists or political campaigns. One Labour MP who nearly lost their Brexit-backing seat told the Guardian that on doorstep after doorstep, people brought up Corbyn\u2019s connections with the IRA after seeing memes and images on Facebook: \u201cIt was never used by the Tories in the campaign but there was a separate election going on, which was a Facebook-orientated campaign.\u201d The MP suggested constituents are increasingly overwhelmed by information and unsure what is real and what is not, assuming there is some sort of editing of what goes on Facebook. \u201cPeople have a sense that some of this stuff is probably wrong but they have no compass. They would say: \u2018But it\u2019s on Facebook \u2013 how can there be something that isn\u2019t true?\u2019 They think there are gatekeepers but there aren\u2019t.\u201d Online advertising changed The 2016 EU referendum and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election focussed minds on the idea of under-the-radar, paid-for \u2018dark ads\u2019 which manipulate small groups of people to vote a certain way. But transparency tools introduced by Facebook and Google, although flawed, made this easier to track. They suggested political advertising in the UK is drifting towards the US model, with blanket ad buys on sites such as YouTube resembling television advertising designed to carpet-bomb voters with simple messages, rather than the more laborious task of manipulating small groups below the radar. The Conservatives took advantage of Facebook\u2019s refusal to factcheck paid-for political adverts, with one study by First Draft News finding 88% of Tory ads featured questionable claims. And there was a substantial rise in the number of newly-formed third party campaign groups with opaque funding structures spending large five-figure sums on pushing pro-Tory adverts reaching millions of people. Mainstream media set the agenda but its power has been hit It was the election where politicians realised they could attack the media with few downsides. Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to skip a one-on-one primetime television interview with Andrew Neil provoked fury from Labour, especially after they had agreed to put Corbyn up for scrutiny. But Tory strategists decided \u2013 apparently correctly \u2013 that a tough interview with Neil could be substantially more damaging than a few stories about Johnson refusing to take part in a television programme. The real concern, according to Tory campaign insiders, was about clips from the interview going viral. Television stations used to be able to set the terms of engagement because they were one of the only ways for politicians to reach a mass audience. The debacle over the Neil interview, combined with Labour and the Tories working together to keep the Lib Dems and the SNP out of the televised leaders\u2019 debates, showed the power may now lie with the politicians, with potential implications for the next election. That\u2019s if the broadcasters survive in their current form \u2013 with the new Tory government targeting both the BBC and Channel 4.",

To date, \u00a322bn has been earmarked for specific projects, such as \u00a3500m to reopen old train lines, \u00a32.2bn on a public sector decarbonisation scheme, \u00a34bn on flood defences and \u00a32bn on potholes.</p> <p>An unnamed \u201csenior Tory\u201d told the Sunday Times that the remaining money needs to \u201cshow the voters in the red wall seats that they have something to show for voting Conservative\u201d.

And sometimes these are easy pledges for politicians to make but they never come true because they are beyond the political cycle.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue is people\u2019s lives in the here and now. Clearly the north needs infrastructure but that doesn\u2019t tick the box for the north, which is the way the Westminster world is portraying it now.\u201d</p> <p>Burnham said he would like the government to commit funds now to reduce homelessness and to subsidise bus services so they are as cheap as in London.

We need rail infrastructure, we need road infrastructure,\u201d Andy Carter, the new MP for Warrington South, told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics North West show.</p> <p>Many new parliamentarians seem to believe in growing public spending rather than reducing it, reversing the party\u2019s dedication to austerity over the past decade. James Daly, who won Bury North from Labour by just 105 votes, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesDalyMP/status/1205848777497698304?s=20\">said he wanted</a> \u201cmore money for public services, more money into our brilliant schools, more money into NHS services and more police on our streets\u201d.</p> <p>Mark Jenkinson, who won the west Cumbrian seat of Workington, wants the government to build small new nuclear reactors in the region and <a href=\"https://www.mark-jenkinson.co.uk/campaigns/jobs\">has promised to lobby</a> for better road and rail links to the ports in Workington and Silloth.</p> <p>Ian Levy, whose win in the Northumberland seat of Blyth Valley gave the first indication on election night that the \u201cred wall\u201d was crumbling, wants <a href=\"https://www.northumberlandconservatives.org.uk/people/ian-levy\">the return of passenger rail services</a> to the constituency.</p> <p>Graham Stringer, the Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton in Greater Manchester, warned that an increase in Conservative MPs in the north wouldn\u2019t necessarily equal more investment. \u201cWe had more Tories in the north of England in the 1980s and that\u2019s when our infrastructure was seriously damaged,\u201d he told the BBC.</p> <p>Transport for the North, the statutory body which advises government on transport in the region, wants the government to fund its \u00a370bn plan to upgrade road and rail connections, including \u00a339bn for Northern Powerhouse Rail. \u201cNow is the time to advance that northern agenda in the national interest. The prime minister must now deliver,\u201d said chief executive Barry White.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged by promises to fully commit to Northern Powerhouse Rail, and invest in our strategic and local roads. That, and tackling the challenge of making our networks greener and more inclusive, will be critical in the coming months and years,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A source close to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said no decisions had yet been made on how to spend the \u00a378bn. \u201cBroadly what we are looking for is projects that will improve productivity, offer good value for money and make a real difference to people\u2019s lives,\u201d they said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has urged new Tory voters in the north of England to be wary of Conservative promises to invest tens of billions in the region\u2019s infrastructure. Small print in the Conservative manifesto allowed for up to \u00a3100bn in additional capital spending over the next five years, \u00a378bn of which has not yet been allocated. To date, \u00a322bn has been earmarked for specific projects, such as \u00a3500m to reopen old train lines, \u00a32.2bn on a public sector decarbonisation scheme, \u00a34bn on flood defences and \u00a32bn on potholes. An unnamed \u201csenior Tory\u201d told the Sunday Times that the remaining money needs to \u201cshow the voters in the red wall seats that they have something to show for voting Conservative\u201d. The new MPs already have an extensive shopping list of demands they promised to voters during the campaign, including rail links to remote ports, new nuclear reactors and train stations. Speaking in Tony Blair\u2019s former constituency of Sedgefield in County Durham on Saturday, Boris Johnson promised to \u201clevel up\u201d the UK by \u201cinvesting in better infrastructure, better education and fantastic modern technology\u201d across the country. He will be under pressure from northern businesses and civic leaders to spend over half of the money \u2013 \u00a339bn \u2013 on Northern Powerhouse Rail, a new TransPennine rail link from Liverpool to Hull which doesn\u2019t have stops in many Conservative constituencies. Burnham welcomed Johnson\u2019s sentiment but said such promises were easier to make than deliver. \u201cIf there is a positive to take from last week, and it\u2019s a big if, perhaps it\u2019s that the political classes are finally addressing the issues the north has long suffered from,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would warn people to be wary of glib commitments around infrastructure because they are decades off. And sometimes these are easy pledges for politicians to make but they never come true because they are beyond the political cycle. \u201cThe issue is people\u2019s lives in the here and now. Clearly the north needs infrastructure but that doesn\u2019t tick the box for the north, which is the way the Westminster world is portraying it now.\u201d Burnham said he would like the government to commit funds now to reduce homelessness and to subsidise bus services so they are as cheap as in London. Each month he donates 15% of his own salary \u2013 \u00a31,375 \u2013 to try to cut rough sleeping in Greater Manchester, and his Bed Every Night scheme was part-funded by more than \u00a3300,000 from then Manchester City player Vincent Kompany. The army of new Tory MPs in the north of England have already started to demand investment in their patches. \u201cAs a newly elected member for the north-west of England I am going to be fighting very, very hard to get funding here. We need rail infrastructure, we need road infrastructure,\u201d Andy Carter, the new MP for Warrington South, told the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics North West show. Many new parliamentarians seem to believe in growing public spending rather than reducing it, reversing the party\u2019s dedication to austerity over the past decade. James Daly, who won Bury North from Labour by just 105 votes, said he wanted \u201cmore money for public services, more money into our brilliant schools, more money into NHS services and more police on our streets\u201d. Mark Jenkinson, who won the west Cumbrian seat of Workington, wants the government to build small new nuclear reactors in the region and has promised to lobby for better road and rail links to the ports in Workington and Silloth. Ian Levy, whose win in the Northumberland seat of Blyth Valley gave the first indication on election night that the \u201cred wall\u201d was crumbling, wants the return of passenger rail services to the constituency. Graham Stringer, the Labour MP for Blackley and Broughton in Greater Manchester, warned that an increase in Conservative MPs in the north wouldn\u2019t necessarily equal more investment. \u201cWe had more Tories in the north of England in the 1980s and that\u2019s when our infrastructure was seriously damaged,\u201d he told the BBC. Transport for the North, the statutory body which advises government on transport in the region, wants the government to fund its \u00a370bn plan to upgrade road and rail connections, including \u00a339bn for Northern Powerhouse Rail. \u201cNow is the time to advance that northern agenda in the national interest. The prime minister must now deliver,\u201d said chief executive Barry White. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged by promises to fully commit to Northern Powerhouse Rail, and invest in our strategic and local roads. That, and tackling the challenge of making our networks greener and more inclusive, will be critical in the coming months and years,\u201d he said. A source close to the chancellor, Sajid Javid, said no decisions had yet been made on how to spend the \u00a378bn. \u201cBroadly what we are looking for is projects that will improve productivity, offer good value for money and make a real difference to people\u2019s lives,\u201d they said.",

Santa had it figured out this whole time!</p> <p>We tend to be more sceptical of surveillance when it comes to our kids. For instance, recent <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/face-recognition-technology-in-cla\">trials of facial recognition in Victorian schools</a> have been met with human rights concerns and academic criticism. When Mattel developed Aristotle, a digital assistant to be given to newborn children who would grow and develop alongside them, it was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/well/family/mattel-aristotle-privacy.html\">pulled from the market</a> for privacy concerns.

Law professor Julie E Cohen argues that \u201cprivacy fosters self-determination\u201d and that it is \u201cshorthand for breathing room to engage in the processes of boundary management that enable and constitute self-development\u201d. So, not only does the collection of children\u2019s data put them at risk if that data falls into the wrong hands, there\u2019s a stifling effect on children\u2019s development when they feel like they\u2019re continually being watched.</p> <p>But the Elf on the Shelf isn\u2019t <em>quite </em>analogous to China\u2019s mass surveillance.

This was the genius of the infamous Panopticon \u2013 a prison designed by British philosopher Jeremy Bentham, where a guard tower could potentially observe any prisoner at any given time, but no prisoner could see the guard tower. It was always possible that you were being observed, which meant you behaved as though you were being observed at all times.</p> <p>This logic is, of course, very creepy. It\u2019s also very common \u2013 as another philosopher, Michel Foucault, later pointed out. You can build workplaces, schools, mental health institutions and yes, nationwide mass surveillance networks on similar principles. The concept is that the possibility of observation and judgement means there\u2019s no need to force people to conform \u2013 they do it themselves. Arguably, China\u2019s social credit system is the high-water mark of the logic of the Panopticon.</p> <p>But the rhetoric \u2013 intentional or not \u2013 behind Elf on the Shelf has echoes of the Panopticon. It reads from the same playbook. The elf appears at random times and in random locations. It\u2019s always <em>possibly </em>watching. Whether that\u2019s the goal parents are trying to achieve or not, we ought to be concerned about the effects of introducing and normalising this kind of behaviour monitoring and observation to kids. As Olly Thorn, the philosopher behind Philosophy Tube <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilosophyTube/status/940142118202462208\">tweeted</a>: \u201cHe sees you when you\u2019re sleeping He knows, when you\u2019re awake, It\u2019s a subtle, calculated technology of subjection.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t necessarily a reason to ditch the tradition, but we can do away with the creepiness \u2013 especially as the myth becomes more and more like reality. It\u2019s entirely possible to have an Elf on the Shelf and not play this game. Maybe the elf is just waiting for Santa to come and deliver the presents \u2013 and helps him unload the gifts. Perhaps you don\u2019t use the elf as a tool for discipline but as a game and a story that\u2019s played together.</p> <p>Maybe <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/should-you-lie-to-your-kids-about-santa-20171218-h06fev.html\">you don\u2019t need to tell the Santa story at all</a>, but that\u2019s another matter.</p> <p>\u2022 Matt Beard is an Australian moral philosopher at The Ethics Centre and a regular writer on philosophy and ethics</p>",

      "bodyText": "Monday\u2019s mid-year budget update will be a \u201chumiliating admission\u201d from the Morrison government that economic growth will be slower, and wages growth weaker on its watch, according to Labor. The Morrison government will on Monday unveil the latest mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, delivering the last major set piece event for the political year. While the government will use the scheduled update to trumpet its economic management credentials, pointing to a forecast surplus as well as accounting for additional spending on drought relief and aged care, the shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers has declared the Coalition finishes 2019 with \u201ca big F for fail on the economy\u201d. Monday\u2019s update is expected to confirm another downgrade in wages growth. Chalmers said the average Australian full-time worker was now $2,200 a year worse off than the government said they would be \u201cbecause their wages have been so stagnant\u201d. He said low wages growth had become \u201cthe new normal\u201d. \u201cNo matter how hard people work they just can\u2019t seem to get ahead because they\u2019ve got skyrocketing costs for childcare, electricity and private health insurance and the government just doesn\u2019t seem to give a stuff about them, certainly not enough to come up with a comprehensive plan to get things moving again,\u201d Chalmers said. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, rejected Labor\u2019s arguments. \u201cReal wages growth, which is wages growth above inflation, is stronger than it was when Labor lost government\u201d. \u201cThe economy is facing some global economic headwinds, some domestic challenges in the context of the drought in particular, but our economy continues to grow, our wages continue to grow faster than inflation, and the growth in disposable income across Australia is the fastest it has been in more than a decade,\u201d Cormann said. Chalmers acknowledged that global headwinds, like the trade dispute between the United States and China, was part of the reason the domestic economy was underperforming. But he insisted \u201cthe issues in our economy are principally home grown, they are a function of a government that doesn\u2019t have a plan to turn things around\u201d. \u201cAnnual growth now is slower than what it was at the election, slower than what it was when [Scott] Morrison and [Josh] Frydenberg took over and slower than it was when Labor was in office.\u201d He said the government told voters it was adept at managing the economy \u201cwhen the facts tell a very different story, whether it\u2019s the facts about growth, wages, productivity, household debt, or public debt which has more than doubled\u201d. \u201cRight across the board this government finishes the year with a big F for fail on the economy.\u201d A debate has played out for much of the year about whether the Morrison government has done enough to stimulate the sluggish economy. While the government has insisted it has got the balance right, and has made a virtue of not launching a panicked fiscal response, in late November the prime minister confirmed it would spend an extra $3.8bn on infrastructure projects over the next four years. The decision to bring forward infrastructure investment followed calls from Labor, the International Monetary Fund and the Reserve Bank for the government to provide more fiscal stimulus amid slowing growth and record low interest rates. The government had hoped that the provision of tax cuts would trigger increased consumption. But the latest official economic growth figures suggest consumers remain reluctant to spend. The economy grew by just 0.4% in the September quarter, and 1.7% for the year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Household gross disposable income increased by 2.5% due to the tax cuts and lower mortgage repayments after three interest rate cuts this year. But households did not choose to boost spending \u2013 instead discretionary spending fell 0.3% and the savings ratio rose to 4.8%.",

      "bodyText": "Some 22 groups representing health and medical professionals in Australia have issued a joint call to act on a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d caused by smoke from the catastrophic bushfire season in New South Wales. In Sydney and others areas of NSW communities have been exposed to air pollution up to 11 times worse than \u201chazardous\u201d levels. The group has produced a joint statement calling for political leadership while repeating a call for a national strategy to combat the health impacts of climate change. Dr Kate Charlesworth, a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, which signed the statement, said: \u201cClimate-related health effects are having the most impact on our most vulnerable: babies, children, the elderly and people with pre-existing disease. There is no safe level of air pollution.\u201d \u201cTo protect health, we need to shift rapidly away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner, healthier and safer forms of energy.\u201d Among the 22 groups that signed the statement are the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine, Public Health Association of Australia, Australian College of Nursing, Australian Association of Social Workers and Lung Foundation Australia. The statement says the federal and NSW governments must \u201cprioritise action to help reduce the risks to people\u2019s health arising from hazardous air pollution\u201d. Fiona Armstrong, executive of the Climate and Health Alliance, said: \u201cThis is a public health emergency.\u201d She added: \u201cClimate change is going to get much worse and we will see more and more of these events.\u201d Dr Lai Heng Foong, of Doctors for the Environment Australia, which has also signed the statement, said: \u201cPollution from bushfire smoke remains hazardous to people, in the short term and also the long-term.\u201d Many of the groups that have signed the statement are also pushing for Australia to respond to the health impacts of climate change. Mark Brooke, CEO of Lung Foundation Australia CEO, said a national strategy was needed. \u201cClimate change and air quality significantly contribute to poor lung health, increased health and economic burden, disability and death,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want to prevent the worst air pollution from bushfire smoke, one of the best things our governments can do, aside from fuel reduction burns, is to set stronger and better standards for everyday air quality.\u201d In August, the Australian Medical Association declared that climate change was a \u201chealth emergency\u201d, citing \u201cclear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities now and into the future.\u201d The AMA called on the Morrison government to help Australia move away from fossil fuels, and to promote the health benefits of cutting greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "bodyText": "Taylor Swift will close the 2020 Glastonbury festival with a headline performance on the Pyramid stage on Sunday night. \u201cI\u2019m ecstatic to tell you that I\u2019ll be headlining Glastonbury on its 50th anniversary \u2013 See you there! \ud83d\udc8b\u201d, Swift tweeted. Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis said: \u201cI\u2019m so pleased to announce Taylor Swift will be headlining the Sunday at Glastonbury 2020. She\u2019s one of the biggest stars in the world and her songs are absolutely amazing. We\u2019re so delighted.\u201d Festival co-organiser Emily Eavis added: \u201cTaylor is one of the biggest and best artists on the planet, and we\u2019re just so pleased that she\u2019s coming here to Worthy Farm to join us for our fiftieth birthday celebrations.\u201d Swift joins Paul McCartney, who will headline on Saturday, and Diana Ross, who will play the \u201clegends\u201d slot on Sunday teatime. Swift, who turned 30 on Friday, released her seventh album Lover earlier this year. It was recently announced that it is the only album of 2019 to sell more than 1m \u201cpure\u201d copies \u2013 ie physical and digital sales, not including streams. It placed at No 27 in the Guardian\u2019s list of the best albums of 2019, hailed as a work that \u201cpaints in complex emotional shades and finds an artist known for her strict adherence to her brand trying lots of new things\u201d. It is her first album for Universal/Republic after leaving her former label, Big Machine, in late 2018. Swift has been frank about her unsuccessful fight to purchase the master recordings of the six albums she recorded for Big Machine after the label was bought by mogul Scooter Braun in June 2019. Accusing Braun \u2013 who manages Kanye West and Justin Bieber \u2013 of persistent bullying, Swift described it as \u201cmy worst case scenario\u201d. The situation has played out very publicly in subsequent months. On Thursday 12 December, Swift accepted Billboard magazine\u2019s woman of the decade award. She used her acceptance speech to criticise Braun for allegedly relying on the private equity firms 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group in addition to the Soros family in order to purchase the record label. Her cause has drawn support from congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. She also hailed a new generation of female pop peers including Lizzo, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish, and advocated for the increased presence of women in technical and professional roles in the music industry. \u201cRather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to have a chance to even be in the room,\u201d she told the Hollywood Palladium. This month, she stars as Bombalurina in the new adaptation of Cats. Her latest single, Christmas Tree Farm, is in contention for the Christmas No 1 spot. Glastonbury 2020 marks Swift\u2019s first appearance at the festival. She is the first female performer to headline since Adele in 2016 and the sixth solo female headliner in the festival\u2019s 50-year history. Festival co-organiser Emily Eavis has said that the gender split of performers at next year\u2019s festival will be \u201cas close to 50-50 as we can\u201d.

The Sisters of Mercy of the Americas called on the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which has $7tn (\u00a35.25tn) of assets, to use its clout to coax companies into moving faster to reduce emissions. The intervention, via their Mercy Investment Services fund, adds to mounting pressure on globally powerful asset owners to think more radically on climate issues. Mercy Investment Services filed a joint shareholder motion with a group of investors before BlackRock\u2019s annual meeting. \u201cWe believe it is BlackRock\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to review how climate change quantitatively impacts [\u2026] portfolio companies, evaluate how specific shareholder resolutions on climate may impact shareholder value, and vote accordingly,\u201d the group said. The motion points out that in 2019 BlackRock gave support to just six out of 52 climate-related resolutions tabled at company shareholder meetings. These included calls for more detailed disclosures about carbon emissions and the adoption of greenhouse gas reduction targets, according to the Financial Times. It said BlackRock\u2019s voting record appeared to be \u201cinconsistent with its statements about climate change\u201d, a reference to the asset manager\u2019s own research about its financial risks. A group of investors withdrew a similar motion in 2017 after engagement from the company. Other asset managers have fielded similar motions, including from members of the same group of investors. But BlackRock has been singled out over its record on climate change, including by a group of economists who said the investment group had lost an estimated $90bn over the last decade by ignoring the financial risk of fossil fuel investment.

In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/14/bbc-staff-express-fear-of-public-distrust-after-election-coverage\">email on Friday</a>, the director general, Tony Hall, wrote: \u201cIn a frenetic campaign where we\u2019ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we\u2019ve made the odd mistake and we\u2019ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don\u2019t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we\u2019re somehow biased one way or the other.\u201d</p> <p>During the election campaign, Johnson threatened to take the BBC\u2019s licence fee away as he called into question its status as a publicly funded broadcaster.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street is threatening the future of the BBC by insisting it is seriously considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, while boycotting Radio 4\u2019s Today programme over the broadcaster\u2019s supposed anti-Tory bias. No 10 pulled ministers from Saturday\u2019s edition of the Today programme and sources said it intended to \u201cwithdraw engagement\u201d from the show in future. The row is seen as an ominous sign of Boris Johnson\u2019s willingness to bypass independent scrutiny and follows criticism of the BBC\u2019s election coverage from both left and right. No 10 pointed to Andrew Neil\u2019s on-air monologue in which he lambasted Johnson for his refusal to be interviewed, and the BBC\u2019s \u201cextensive coverage\u201d of a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia forced to sleep on a hospital floor \u2013 as supposed evidence of anti-Tory, pro-remain bias at the corporation. Meanwhile, Labour backers have raised concerns about the BBC\u2019s coverage, from the editing out of laughter aimed at Johnson in a news bulletin to leading reporters uncritically repeating Conservative sources, and the prime minister escaping scrutiny after dodging the one-on-one interview with Neil. The BBC has firmly rejected such criticism. In an email on Friday, the director general, Tony Hall, wrote: \u201cIn a frenetic campaign where we\u2019ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we\u2019ve made the odd mistake and we\u2019ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don\u2019t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we\u2019re somehow biased one way or the other.\u201d During the election campaign, Johnson threatened to take the BBC\u2019s licence fee away as he called into question its status as a publicly funded broadcaster. The prime minister suggested the licence fee, which is guaranteed to continue until at least 2027, was a general tax that could no longer be justified when other media organisations had found other ways of funding themselves. Any changes to the BBC\u2019s funding model would require parliament to pass fresh legislation. Abolition would be hard, but a bigger risk for the BBC is the negotiations with the government over the cost of the licence fee between 2022 and 2027. Even more worrying for the public broadcaster are comments by chief secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak, confirming plans to look at the decriminalisation of failing to pay the TV licence, which could be set out in the next Queen\u2019s speech and would undermine the BBC\u2019s funding model. Sunak told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cThat is something the prime minister has said we will look at, and has instructed people to look at that. I think it\u2019s fair to say people find the criminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee to be something that has provoked questions in the past.\u201d A No 10 source confirmed that the licence fee was \u201cin the firing line\u201d, following reports in the Mail on Sunday that its future settlement was under discussion. A BBC spokesperson said decriminalisation would lead to \u00a3200m less to spend on programmes. \u201cThe government has already commissioned a QC to take an in-depth look at this matter and he found that \u2018the current system of criminal deterrence and prosecution should be maintained\u2019 and that it is fair and value for money to licence fee payers,\u201d they said. \u201cDecriminalisation could also mean we have at least \u00a3200m less to spend on programmes and services our audiences love.\u201d Johnson\u2019s senior adviser Dominic Cummings is known to be a strong critic of the BBC, its funding model and its output. He is particularly dismissive of the Today programme, which he argues operates in a metropolitan bubble out of touch with the rest of the country. Downing Street has also attacked Channel 4\u2019s election coverage after it replaced Johnson with an ice sculpture when he refused to take part in a leaders\u2019 debate on the climate crisis. During the election the Tories confirmed that the party would review Channel 4\u2019s public service broadcasting obligations if Johnson was returned to Downing Street. Under the proposal it will \u201clook at whether its remit should be better focused so it is serving the public in the best way possible\u201d. However, there will be voices within the Tory party who are uneasy about an all-out war with the media, particularly the BBC \u2013 both because it remains one of the most trusted institutions in the country and because of its daily influence on the news agenda.",

Not often, but sometimes. And right now is one of those times, because frankly, who doesn\u2019t wish we were back in the late 90s? Some of us who are dead were alive, many of us who are old were young, and all of us who are young were free of this revolting hell-hole of a planet. So slip on your v-neck and Vans, grab a Fuse and a bottle of Hooch, and come right in for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r v Duncan Ferguson back up in the game! </p> \n  <p>Strangely, these men are similar in an increasingly unusual way: they are uniformly loved. Petty grudge-bearing and fickle mind-changing are part of what makes football so joyous, but both Solskj\u00e6r and Ferguson sit above that, a status earned through consistent excellence, unquestioned commitment and unimpeachable integrity \u2013 whether tripping Rob \n   <strike>\n     ert \n   </strike> Lee or ragdolling Paul Ince.</p> \n  <p>Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s life has changed significantly in the last 10 days. Though much of what ailed him was not his fault and though it was clear to see how things were improving under him, had United lost to Spurs and Manchester City, the pressure might\u2019ve told. Instead, he stayed calm, got his players back, and out-tacticked two bona fide greats of the game. The test today is for his team to maintain that level of performance against an opponent less inclined to facilitate it. </p> \n  <p>Ferguson, meanwhile, spent last weekend inspiring Everton to beat Chelsea with a man of the match performance from the touchline. It is easy to characterise him as a simple pashun merchant \u2013 imagine coming back to a dressing room with him in it, having given less than 173.65% \u2013 but he was an intelligent player who had to think hard about his game once injury compromised his natural gifts, qualities which will help him as a manager. This is a huge chance for him, and he\u2019ll be eager not to waste it.</p> \n  <p>All in all, we\u2019re set for decent afternoon\u2019s, er, Premiership. After that, I\u2019ve not a clue, but in the meantime. </p> \n  <p><strong>Kick-off: 2pm GMT</strong></p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "So that\u2019s about us \u2013 thanks for your company and comments. Ta-ra. And here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report. Elsewhere: join Rob Smyth for Arsenal v Manchester City - for whom Fill Phoden starts. And about time too. United need creativity in midfield so much it\u2019s ridiculous. Pogba is meant to supply that, but who knows if he\u2019ll even play for the club again. If they find the right player - and really they need two midfielders - they could have a pretty decent season, If they stay as they are, or sign another striker, they can expect many more afternoons like this one. As for United, Solskjaer has to ask himself for how much longer he can leave out Greenwood. He\u2019s United\u2019s best finisher by a mile and has earned a spot in the team not by talent but by performance. Duncan Ferguson praises the shift put in by his players, saying that he backs his two strikers to cause teams problems. He responds to a question about the legitimacy of Everton\u2019s goal with all the disgust you\u2019d hope for \u2013 \u201cEverything\u2019s a free-kick now isn\u2019t it\u201d. He explains that he subbed Kean because he needed to make a change to waste time and had mainly strikers on the bench. \u201cNothing personal,\u201d he says. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. An excellent performance and point from Everton, who were disciplined, dogged and enterprising. United, meanwhile, were United, saved by some ridiculous quality up front but short of verve and ideas in midfield. They are overtaken by Spurs, who scored late to win 2-1 at Wolves, while Everton stay 16th. 90+3 min Bit of keep-ball from Everton, as Gary Neville announces Calvert-Lewin as his man of the match. That\u2019s fair enough, though Holgate has played well too. 90+2 min Again, United get it out to Rashford, who looks up, halucinates Ian Ormondroyd, Peter Crouch and Duncan Ferguson in the box, and tries a high cross. Pickford claims. 90+1 min Fred runs onto a pass from Rashford and twists back for Mata, who sets Rashford for a shot. He opens his body and makes a decent connection, but doesn\u2019t set it out wide enough and Pickford saves easily. 90 min There\u2019ll be four added minutes. 89 min Ey up - Ferguson brings on Niasse ... for Kean, who\u2019s not injured and only just came on. Kean looks befuddled and Ferguson doesn\u2019t even look at him; he walks straight down the tunnel. Eesh. Awkz. 88 min United have struggled since scoring but a fine reverse-ball from Wan-Bissaka sends McTominay down the line. He has a look, sees no one in the middle, cuts back a cross anyway and Everton clear. 87 min Calvert-Lewin, who\u2019s had a good afternoon, runs at McTominay who upends him. Free-kick Everton, 30 yards out, left of centre. Baines fancies it, but delivers a conversion. 86 min Mata replaces James, who\u2019s had a disappointing afternoon but whose willingness and persistence were key in creating the goal. 85 min Lovely ball from Fred, slid out to Wan-Bissaka, whose low cross is hast and easily cleared. 85 min Strangely, this corner isn\u2019t on top of De Gea and again the ball hits Lindelof, but this time United clear. 84 min Everton have been excellent since conceding, Iwobi running across McTominay and swiping and outswiger that De Gea dives to push behind. Get ready... 83 min Very nice from Richarlison, who slows down Wan-Bissaka and prepares to shoot, right as a go go Gadget let extends to confiscate possession. 82 min Canny from James, who has a phenomenal appetite for accepting violence. He puts his body between Kean and the ball, then wears a lunge. Unitecd could then get one mixahd, but instead go short for more huffing, with a side order of puffing. 81 min There are gaps everywhere now - this is gorgeously frantic. 81 min Everton aren\u2019t feeling sorry for themselves but, Davies driving to the line and clipping a cross that De Gea clutches. Well done him! 79 min I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a young player as economical and composed in front of goal as Greenwood. It style he reminds me of Solskjaer and in appearance Van Persie, but the way he plays the game is Paul Scholes: he only ever does what\u2019s on, and always picks the best option. Shut up! Greenwood sprays a lush one out to James, who burrows infield then returns possession. Greenwood, now central, takes a touch then, using the defender as a screen, shapes to go far post then drags an expert\u2019s finish through Mina\u2019s legs and inside the near, Solskjaer-style. Mason Greenwood is a superstar. It really is that simple. 77 min James and McTominay exchange passes, allowing the former to dribble a shot at Pickford. He copes. 76 min He whips one in, Martial can\u2019t reach it, and United get back on the plod. 75 min After making a fine tackle inside his own box, Wan Bissaka gets forward and darts a ball into Martial, who\u2019s fouled by Holgate. Fred will smash the free-kick into touch... 74 min \u201cUtd still have Juan Mata,\u201d says Matt Emerson. \u201cHe used to be quite good as a No 10, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Almost never for United - he gets buffeted about like a kid playing with his dad\u2019s mates - but yes, he\u2019d be an option here. 73 min Wan-Bissaka attacks Baines and gets around the back, crossing low towards Martial ... but Keane, who\u2019s been excellent gets a foot in. 72 min Fred goes short, makes absolute fred of it, and suddenly Everton have a break, Shaw doing well to chase down Iwobi - who had options. 71 min More pressure from United, Greenwood winning a corner down the right... 71 min Change for Everton, Kean replacing Bernard. He does into the middle and Richarlison will play on the left. 70 min Fred\u2019s corner is a decent one too, hard and flat, but Maguire, running across the face of goal from right to centre, can\u2019t get a touch. Lindelof picks up the loose ball though, controlling, turning, and drilling a curler just over the top. 69 min Nice from Greenwood, turning in the box to lay back for James, who\u2019s come inside; he swivels into a shot, but it\u2019s straight at Pickford. But United come again, and Shaw wins a corner... 68 min The game\u2019s getting stretched now, which should suit United, but Everton will fancy themselves to finish things on the counter. 67 min Martial runs at Baines and Mina, Baines challenges, Martial goes down, and the ref is having no such penalty. 66 min Calvert-Lewin leaps to chest down for Richarlison and Lindelof ploughs through him. He\u2019s booked, and is having an absolute day in. 66 min Greenwood replaces Lingard. He goes wide right, James goes wide left, and Rashford goes in behind. 65 min What United need, and don\u2019t really have, is a number 10. I know Lingard is playing there but it\u2019s not working for him, and I don\u2019t fully grasp why the bench requires two left-backs when it could have Angel Gomes. 63 min On the touchline, Greenwood, stripped, peruses a playbook. On the pitch, Bernard pulls wide and finds Calvert-Lewin who drags a shot wide. 62 min Shaw advances and when no one bothers to challenge he lets a decent low shot go that Pickford shoves back at James ... who lamps it directly into Lingard\u2019s coupon! Happy birthday, old mate! 61 min On the United bench, a piece of paper passes down the line. \u201cBring Mason Greenwood on\u201d is probably what is says. 60 min \u201cIs it as one-sided as the \u2018goal attempts\u2019 stats suggest, Daniel?\u201d asks Bill Hargreaves. No. Everton could just as easily score the next goal, and United have only made one decent chance: the one Lingard missed after 20 seconds. 58 min McTominay finds James again - United were too focused on the left flank in the first half - and his cross is deflected behind. Calvert-Lewin heads the corner away, but United keep up the pressure, Martial finding James. Maguire, still up, leaps ... and wins another corner, which United waste. Of course they do. 57 min Everton pump a free-kick into the box and Mina goes down under pressure from Maguire. The away fans want a penalty, but nothing doing. 55 min Davies is down after catching his lower leg underneath him in a tackle with Lingard. Everton only have one midfielder on the bench - 18 year-old Anthony Gordon. 53 min Better from United, McTominay sliding into space for James to screech past Baines and cut back a cross. But Rashford is the only man in the box, and Keane, facing his own goal, does well to shove out an intercepting foot. 52 min And actually this isn\u2019t a bad effort, hard and flat towards the back post, where Keane does just enough to thwart Maguire with Pickford rooted to his line. 52 min Nice from Martial, beating Mina on the right, attacking Baines and falling over. Free-kick apparently, for Fred to wallop past the back post. 51 min United have increased the tempo and Martial comes deep to find Rashford, who wipes his foot across the ball but sends it hectares over the bar. 49 min And there he is, leaping for Wan-Bissaka\u2019s cross. It\u2019s a decent one too, but Mina heads away and then, from a tricky height, Fred slices to Selhurst. 49 min He didn\u2019t receive much in the way of service, but Anthony Martial gave his markers too easy a half - again. I\u2019d not be surprised to see him hooked for Mason Greenwood if he doesn\u2019t step it up sharpish. 48 min Everton work it clear well and Calvert-Lewin runs Lindelof, who stays with him - just about - but can\u2019t do any more until McTominay arrives and United move forward. 47 min Lingard, who missed United\u2019s best chance of the half, forages down the left but runs into Holgate. 46 min This is a huge half for both clubs. United need to show their recent improvement wasn\u2019t simply because opponents obliged them, while Everton can solidify Ferguson\u2019s claim on the top job. 46 min We go again, as I\u2019m sure supporters of both sides will agree. Elsewhere: Spurs lead at Wolves thanks to Lucas Moura\u2019s goal. \u201cI\u2019m right behind local big personalities helping their club along,\u201d says Bill Hargreaves, but in that Ferguson-Freund photo, let\u2019s remember it\u2019s \u2018joga bonito\u2019 not \u2018jugular finito\u2019.\u201d Surely one comes under banner of t\u2019other. Breaking news: Vivianne Miedema is a player. Half-time reading: United started reasonable enough, but as we predicted, once they failed to get a lead, their ideas quickly expired and Everton asserted themselves very well. Solskjaer has work to do, while Ferguson\u2019s side look in good shape. 46+2 min Again United move down the left, Rashford twisting and turning before screwing a cross for Martial that Mina clears. 45 min There\u2019ll be two additional minutes. 44 min United try to regain momentum, Fred and Rashford combining to find McTominay, who drags a shot that\u2019s deflected wide. Naturally, the corner comes to nothing. 43 min Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin have been excellent these last 15 minutes, running the channels to get their team up the pitch. 42 min Lindelof, the goalscorer, ventures forward and clips a pass into touch. 41 min And as for David de Gea, he\u2019s never quite matured into a dominant keeper. Often, he stays at home when he needs to get out, but for the goal he came without conviction. It\u2019s hard to understand why he hasn\u2019t improved in that regard, but easy to assume he\u2019s not going to at this point of his career. 39 min Basically, we\u2019ve seen this before. 38 min That goal wasn\u2019t exactly inevitable - well it was because it happened - but besides that, Everton had started to assert themselves, winning territory and set-pieces as United became discouraged. I\u2019m not sure about this. Baines curls in a brilliant corner, Calvert-Lewin rushes De Gea who goes weakly with one arm and gets a tiny touch, the ball then hitting Lindelof and trickling in. That looks a foul on the keeper to me ... but VAR says no. I\u2019m not sure why, but I am sure that the game can do without chalking off goals for infractions of that ilk. 35 min Lindelof looks to pass out of defence but Davies intercepts well and then Shaw gives it away, the ball eventually going out to Iwobi on the right. His cross is a peach, but no one attacks the near post and Lindelof heads behind. 34 min Baines\u2019 free-kick misses everyone, but Shaw\u2019s defensive header is as you\u2019d expect, lazy and aimless. Holgate picks up the loose ball, then slices a useless shot that just about makes it over the goallines. 32 min Bernard\u2019s corner is hit towards Keane but Maguire gets in the way, then Martial sends the ball back to the taker. Eventually, Fred sees the danger away, but Everton come again and Lindelof knocks Richarlison over for no sensible reason. Free-kick Everton out on the left... 31 min Everton have passed it a bit better these last five minutes, Calvert-Lewin starting to put himself about, and here\u2019s Richarlison winning a corner off McTominay. 30 min \u201c1999 saw me in a small Czech town teaching the local youth to speak better English,\u201d says Brad Elliott. \u201cWent to the local pub - the Red 7 in Breclav - for the night of the Champions League final, with about 10 of my students. When Bayern scored early, one of said students started to goad me, knowing my fervent allegiances. After about 70 minutes or so I\u2019d had enough, so I threw a punch and a minor scuffle ensued - I had to be peeled off him by other members of his class. When Sheringham then Sunny-Boy (what it means in Norwegian apparently) won it for us I ended up kissing my erstwhile student-opponent and about four hours later was carried out of the bar singing the Solskj\u00e6r song.\u201d The teacher we all needed. 28 min \u201cI\u2019ve got that single on vinyl in the attic,\u201d tweets @foolhandy. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason why my little brother (age three at the time) has supported Everton all his life. He loved that song!\u201d The United equivalent was the first record/tape/CD I owned. 27 min Rashford hammers a shot over the wall as Pickford lean right, then flings himself left to punch clear as the ball moves in the air. It was straight at him in a sense, but he had every reason to expect it to bend away. 25 min United looking to increase the peace pace and McTominay takes the ball out of the air, sways right then Cruyffs left, away from Davies, who brings him down. The ref goes to his pocket, presumably realises Davies has already booked, and thinks better of it. Free-kick United, in, er, \u201cMarcus Rashford Territory\u201d. 25 min It takes a while, but Baines is now with us. 23 min Digne appears to be in some trouble - he\u2019s clutching his groin, and Leighton Baines, also of the late-90s and frequently known as the six member of Menswear, is going to replace him. 22 min Fred swings the corner out and directly onto Calvert-Lewin\u2019s bonce. He clears. 22 min United\u2019s attack is focusing mainly down their left, and after some slow passing Rashford injects a bit of pace, winning a corner off Iwobi. 20 min There\u2019s a nice tempo to the game, though not excesses of quality. Richarlison is still limping. 19 min James moseys over to the left in a bid to make something happen, finding Rashford, who\u2019s shot from distance clatters a defender. Meanwhile, Richarlison limps after hurting his leg in a challenge with Fr \u201cBites yer leg\u201d Ed. 17 min Martial, who\u2019s started livelily, runs at Keane and goes over. He wants a free-kick, but Keane got just enough on the ball. 15 min The Everton fans were singing this belter a few minutes ago. 14 min Nice from United, Fred popping it through to Martial, to plays a wall-pass off Rashford before Coleman steps in to get in his road. Good defending. 13 min \u201cWhile it\u2019s possible it\u2019s a tactical choice from big Dunc to go for ball-carriers in midfield,\u2019 emails Kevin Pready, \u201cI can\u2019t help but think it might be more influenced by Tom Davies being the only fit central midfielder in the first team squad. Gomes, Gbamin, Delph, Sigurdsson and Schneiderlin all out injured or ill as far as I can see.\u201d Yes, I didn\u2019t realise Sigurdsson was ill. 11 min And there it is! McTominay puts James in a race with Digne; he burns him up, and because Pickford doesn\u2019t come, he meepmeeps into the box only to drive wide. He might\u2019ve checked there, because the angle was against him and no defender was anywhere near him. Meanwhile, Digne and Coleman chastise Pickford for not coming out to clear. 10 min Lindelof drives a ball from right to left, seeking Rashford. But he\u2019s running away from goal and can\u2019t wrap his foot around the ball, wellying a shot into the near side-netting. But Everton are playing with a higher line than I expected, and it\u2019s going to get them into trouble if they\u2019re not careful. 9 min \u201c90s idiocy,\u201d begins Dave Johnson. \u201cMy folks had a pub in Camden for many years. I went out on the wallop with a pocketful of cash, in the thousands (I hadn\u2019t had a day off in two years), and had a moment of clarity a few days later. In Kiev. I still have the boarding passes and train ticket stubs from, among other places, Amsterdam, Berlin and Warsaw. Somewhere called Wroclaw? Keep meaning to go back to see how I spent a shedload of zlotys on a stew. Panicked when I saw the Rs were the wrong way round and I wasn\u2019t just slumped outside the Monarch on Chalk Farm Road. Cab to station, flight home and a furious bollocking from me ma. I still have no idea how I got the visas to get in to Poland or Ukraine. But they\u2019re there in my last passport. Ale is ace.\u201d Effort. 7 min Richarlison \u2013 who looks to me like he has all the raw materials to grow into a serious player \u2013 forages out on the right and knocks back to Holgate, who sweeps a shot directly into De Gea\u2019s midriff. 6 min McTominay drives through midfield, pokes the ball away from Davies who\u2019s already committed to the challenge, and down he goes. Davies \u2013 who i\u2019m sure would\u2019ve loved the 90s \u2013 is booked. 5 min \u201cSo many great things about that photo of Duncan Ferguson,\u201d says Tommy Marlow, \u201cnot least the captain\u2019s armband on the offending arm and the unsighted referee not two feet away. Who needs VAR. I also like the descriptions of the team formations as to their purpose, more of this.\u201d Imagine the horror of burglarising a house, only to discover that it belongs to Big Dunc. 4 min Holgate has moved into midfield, though Everton lined up as a five to begin with. Oooh, clever clever! 3 min United struggle to clear the resultant corner, then the second falls at the feet of Calvert-Lewin when Lingard fails to clear - he\u2019s having a lovely birthday so far - but someone, Lindelof I think, blocks the shot. 2 min Now hear come Everton, Holgate pumping in a cross that De Gea has to flick over the top. He looks to have hurt himself stretching, but will be fine. 1 min United nearly score in the first 20 seconds! Rashford beats Coleman in the air and Martial runs the channel - do not adjust your sets, you read that right \u2013 then finds Fred, who bursts into the box, beats one man, runs through another, and the ball squirts across to Lingard, who swivels to shoot just wide. 1 min Off we go! Here come the teams! Harrance Maguire captains United, and I\u2019d expect that to continue \u2013 I\u2019d not be surprised if he was signed partly for that reason. Personally, I\u2019m unconvinced. If he actually is the leader he\u2019s meant to be \u2013 Steve Bruce with a first touch \u2013 then he ought to have done more to protect the leads United habitually cede. \u201cHappy to see bogeyman Sigurdsson on the bench,\u201d emails Duncan Edwards. \u201cHappy for Gary Naylor to keep that goal as his greatest memory of Everton v United and happy to predict that will remain the case after today. 4-2 United.\u201d To save Gary the bother. Solskjaer tells Sky Everton pose a different challenge to City, and his young team are learning etcetera etcetera; he expects Everton to play a centre-back in midfield. Ferguson confirms that Sidibe and Sigurdsson are ill, and the formation is a consequence of that \u2013 I think he might have done well in that aspect, because the 5-3-2 will make things harder for United. What Everton need to avoid \u2013 and prepare yourselves, for this is a biggie \u2013 is not to concede early. United\u2019s confidence, though up, remains brittle, and if they fail to score in the first half-hour, they\u2019ll remember that they\u2019re meant to struggle in such circumstances and also that they lack midfield inspiration. On which point, Jesse Lingard has been really good lately, and the onus will be on him to open things up. Back to today, I imagine Ferguson has gone for ball-carriers in midfield because he wants to counter the counterers. Playing two strikers also means that the long ball is a decent option, and if Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin can hold it up, Bernard, Iwobi and the wing-backs will be in the game. Imagine this was your boss! How good was this! I imagine United will look to outrun and outfight Everton in midfield \u2013 there\u2019s not a lot of ballast in Bernard, Davies and Iwobi \u2013 then find space between centre-back and wing-back. The question is how effectively they can do that against a team sitting deep. Players you\u2019ve never seen play well: Bernard. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s playing today, and I\u2019m unsure what it is he\u2019s meant to be good at. Feel free to correct me. \u201cDuncan knows what to do when the time comes,\u201d tweets Gary Naylor. He does. Looking again at the teams, I wonder if Axel Tuanzebe might\u2019ve been a smart choice for United. Lindelof started the season poorly, and though he\u2019s been better in recent weeks, he and Maguire are too similar for my tastes. Tuanzebe is as good as Lindelof on the ball, better under the high ball, and has the recovery pace to compensate for any errors. I\u2019d guess that Ferguson sees the centre of United\u2019s defence as a weak point to exploit. So, come on then: let\u2019s have your tales of classic late-90s idiocy. I\u2019ll start: when Hooch came out, we went to Kwik Save Kentish Town, bought a load, then went back to school for afternoon lessons. It went as well as you imagine. Ferguson, meanwhile, changes formation and personnel. Aware of what United can do when offered space, his 5-3-2 will aim to restrict that, at the same time as keeping an attacking threat via the deployment of two strikers. Out go Sidibe, Schneiderlin, Walcott and Sigurdsson; in come Coleman, Mina, Davies and Bernard. So United are unchanged \u2013 replace Fred or Lingard with Pogba (stop laughing at the back) and this is Solskjaer\u2019s first team \u2013 United\u2019s 4000th straight with a homegrown product in the squad. At some point, Greenwood is going to demand inclusion \u2013 personally, I\u2019d have picked him over Martial for last weekend. But Martial was excellent in that game, so deservedly returns. Can he maintain that level of effort and performance? Manchester United (a 4-3-3 disguised as a 4-2-3-1): De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw; McTominay, Fred, Lingard; James, Martial, Rashford. Subs: Romero, Tuanzebe, Williams, Young, Pereira, Mata, Greenwood. Everton (a practical 5-3-2): Pickford; Coleman, Keane, Holgate, Mina, Digne; Bernard, Davies, Iwobi; Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison. Subs: Stekelenburg, Baines, Tosun, Keane, Niasse, Martina, Gordon. Sometimes the cosmos is kind to us. Not often, but sometimes. And right now is one of those times, because frankly, who doesn\u2019t wish we were back in the late 90s? Some of us who are dead were alive, many of us who are old were young, and all of us who are young were free of this revolting hell-hole of a planet. So slip on your v-neck and Vans, grab a Fuse and a bottle of Hooch, and come right in for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r v Duncan Ferguson back up in the game! Strangely, these men are similar in an increasingly unusual way: they are uniformly loved. Petty grudge-bearing and fickle mind-changing are part of what makes football so joyous, but both Solskj\u00e6r and Ferguson sit above that, a status earned through consistent excellence, unquestioned commitment and unimpeachable integrity \u2013 whether tripping Rob ert Lee or ragdolling Paul Ince. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s life has changed significantly in the last 10 days. Though much of what ailed him was not his fault and though it was clear to see how things were improving under him, had United lost to Spurs and Manchester City, the pressure might\u2019ve told. Instead, he stayed calm, got his players back, and out-tacticked two bona fide greats of the game. The test today is for his team to maintain that level of performance against an opponent less inclined to facilitate it. Ferguson, meanwhile, spent last weekend inspiring Everton to beat Chelsea with a man of the match performance from the touchline. It is easy to characterise him as a simple pashun merchant \u2013 imagine coming back to a dressing room with him in it, having given less than 173.65% \u2013 but he was an intelligent player who had to think hard about his game once injury compromised his natural gifts, qualities which will help him as a manager. This is a huge chance for him, and he\u2019ll be eager not to waste it. All in all, we\u2019re set for decent afternoon\u2019s, er, Premiership. After that, I\u2019ve not a clue, but in the meantime.

First Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s diagonal pass was trapped expertly by Rashford but his left-foot shot was wild.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United\u2019s attempt to claim a third consecutive Premier League win for the first time since January foundered on a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal. After the high-octane victories over Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side were sloppy and profligate. Everton came to be dogged and Duncan Ferguson\u2019s team would have won but for a cool-eyed finish by 18-year-old Mason Greenwood in the 77th minute. This was the 4,000th consecutive game in which United have named an academy player in their match-day squad so it was apt that the graduate Greenwood salvaged a point. Referring to the young striker. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cMason Greenwood is different class in and around the box. You\u2019re not surprised when he scores goals. It\u2019s fitting that it should be an academy player that scores in the 4,000th match and it makes it hard for me to leave him out. We\u2019ve always had the DNA, with added players from other top clubs, and that will always be the philosophy here.\u201d Harry Maguire also enthused about the boy from Bradford. \u201cHe is a goalscorer. He is going to score a lot of goals for this club,\u201d said United\u2019s captain. \u201cHe is a great player.\u201d The draw means that, after the team\u2019s final league game before the year anniversary of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s appointment as interim manager, United have one less point than the 26 accrued by his predecessor Jos\u00e9 Mourinho after the same number \u2013 17 \u2013 of games. Yet United are four points closer to Chelsea in fourth place than the 13 they were adrift of a Champions League berth under the Portuguese. Solskj\u00e6r named the XI triumphant in the Manchester derby, while Ferguson\u2019s side showed four changes. Yerry Mina, Bernard, Seamus Coleman and Tom Davies came in for Theo Walcott, Morgan Schneiderlin, Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and Gylfi Sigurdsson, none of whom was on the bench. United\u2019s wins over City and Spurs featured bright starts and there was another here: from the kick-off Marcus Rashford flicked on, Anthony Martial continued the move and, when Fred dribbled in Everton\u2019s area, the ball broke for Jesse Lingard, who should not have missed from seven yards. Everton\u2019s response was instant: a Mason Holgate cross-shot had to be tipped over by David de Gea before Lucas Digne took the first of two corners that were defended shakily, a foretaste of the weakness that would cost United later in the half. Before this United should have scored at least twice. First Victor Lindel\u00f6f\u2019s diagonal pass was trapped expertly by Rashford but his left-foot shot was wild. Then Daniel James moved in from the right but his effort flashed wide of Jordan Pickford\u2019s goal. Everton\u2019s 4-4-2 formation was predicated on a basic approach: Mina or one of his defensive colleagues would take the ball and punt it forward in hope. United\u2019s was the silkier play. The two styles were akin to a tractor going up against a Jaguar F-type. But United\u2019s attempts to find a higher gear were to no avail. When Rashford fired in a dipping 25-yard free-kick Pickford had to scramble to punch clear and from that point Everton took charge. In one passage of play Everton strung several passes together and this eventually led to their goal when Luke Shaw failed to clear and they won a corner. Leighton Baines delivered from the right, De Gea, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Mina in attendance, flapped and the loose ball rebounded limply off Lindel\u00f6f into the net. VAR ruled the goal legal but Solskj\u00e6r was unhappy at the decision. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t concede goals like this at set plays,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a clear and obvious foul. There\u2019s no point me complaining but his [Calvert-Lewin\u2019s] arms are over David\u2019s shoulders as he was going to punch it.\u201d Maguire agreed. \u201cIt was a clear foul,\u201d said the centre-back. \u201cPeople will say David de Gea has to be stronger but it is a clear foul. He jumps in on him and David was impeded.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s half-time talk surely consisted of some stern words and a reminder to be patient and play through Everton. Soon after the restart Aaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s cross was headed out by Holgate into Fred\u2019s path but he blazed over. So, too, did Rashford when hoping to beat Pickford from 20 yards. Everton continued to disrupt the rhythm United hoped to establish. But Shaw showed United the way with a darting run that finished with Pickford saving his shot and James\u2019s follow-up cannoning off Lingard\u2019s face. Lingard was replaced soon after by Greenwood in what became a 4-2-4 formation when United attacked. James had a shot saved and Lindel\u00f6f went close. Greenwood won a corner but Fred \u2013 again \u2013 made a hash of it as the team continued to lack incisiveness in front of goal. It took Greenwood to show them how. His calm touch and finish from outside the area beat Pickford superbly. Yet United still struggled for any real control and were as vulnerable as their visitors when being attacked. A draw felt the fair result and it delighted Ferguson, who brushed off replacing the substitute Moise Kean \u2013 who had come on for Bernard \u2013 after only 19 minutes as a time-wasting move at the end. \u201cWhat a shift the boys put in,\u201d said the caretaker manager. \u201cWe tried to change the shape a bit [towards the end] but couldn\u2019t get the information on.

One social media researcher, Leon Yin, who at the time was working at New York University studying the effects of social media and politics, noticed that a Russian troll farm, the Internet Research Agency, had shared lots of links through its networks during the 2016 election. But only a very few, Yin says, were links to fake news sites. \u201cWhat I noticed was a majority of the stories being shared were local,\u201d Yin told a conference on disinformation and elections at Columbia University in New York last week.

In the 2020 election cycle, we are already seeing a rise in hundreds of phantom \u201clocal news sites\u201d set up by political operatives to churn out automated stories that fit particular talking points.

Last week alone, I attended one conference on disinformation and the press, organised another, and failed to attend a further three. The incredibly gloomy consensus among everyone I listened to or spoke with was that not enough progress has been made in the past three years to effectively deal with the consequences of a polluted news and information environment.

But we also need regulation and legislation \u2013 and we need a totally reformed business model for platforms and tech companies. We need journalists and media organisations to realise that they too are too often part of the problem. And we need money, lots of it, taken from one set of people \u2013 advertising companies and advertisers themselves \u2013 and redirected into real public infrastructure, be it schools, news organisations or even public spaces, to rebuild what we need from the ground up.",

High-level political negotiations will start in February, and the detail of getting Britain ready for Brexit is where the devil lies.</p> \n<p>Much work has been done on the new systems that must be in place for the worst possible outcome of talks in relation to the Dover-Calais crossing and other UK-EU trade issues. No work has been done on the Great Britain to Northern Ireland routes that must now be treated as a UK-EU border under the Johnson deal. HMRC has previously said it would take five years to get what was known as a maximum facilitation customs IT arrangement in place.</p> \n<p>If tariffs on goods exported from the UK into the EU apply after 2020, a new tariff rebate system has to be bolted on to cover goods that go from Great Britain to Northern Ireland only. This would apply, for instance, to all goods going from Tesco warehouses in the UK to supermarket shelves in Belfast, Derry or Armagh.</p> \n<p>Border inspection posts will have to be built from scratch for sanitary and phytosanitary checks on all animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU has already said it would prefer them to be in ports such as Stranraer and Liverpool to prevent potential disease in animals, plants or timber pallets making its way on to the island of Ireland.</p> \n<p>The Northern Ireland office has had several meetings with business leaders on what checks will be necessary but these cannot be determined in detail until after Brexit on 31 January.</p> \n<p>Under the withdrawal agreement, specialist committees to determine this detail cannot be appointed until the withdrawal agreement is ratified. This means they could be up and running by February, leaving 11 months for preparation. But as HMRC has warned previously, IT systems take years, not months, to build. <strong>Lisa O\u2019Carroll</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Education</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b68c039c683e5c64ce6167b5bb2eac29ea531101\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b68c039c683e5c64ce6167b5bb2eac29ea531101/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils at St Ninians primary school in Stirling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils at St Ninians primary school in Stirling.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Milligan/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The new government\u2019s policies on education in England are less oven-ready and more baked in, with the bulk of policies on schools, colleges and universities having been announced before the election campaign began.</p> \n<p>In terms of reforms, the signature policies are set in place, as they have been since David Cameron: converting schools into academies and using tuition fees and student loans to fund demand for higher education. While Theresa May wanted to revise the fees and loans system, Boris Johnson has shown little appetite to do so other than trimming the interest rates charged to students.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives\u2019 slim manifesto offers more money for schools, reversing the real-terms cuts since 2009. Johnson\u2019s intention is to raise per-pupil spending to at least \u00a34,000 in primaries and \u00a35,000 in secondaries, although many schools in deprived and urban areas are already higher. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had announced plans to raise pay for newly qualified teachers to \u00a330,000, to shore up recruitment. Existing teachers, however, are unhappy at the Conservative election pledge to beef up Ofsted inspections.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/johnson-warned-majority-will-not-speed-up-brexit-talks\">Johnson is warned his big win will not speed up Brexit deal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Promises on early years education were vague, with a \u201c\u00a31bn childcare fund\u201d in England and no new funding commitments for children and young people\u2019s mental health. On post-16 education, the Conservatives had already promised \u00a3400m over the next parliament \u2013 nowhere near enough to arrest the fall in per-student funding, especially in sixth forms.</p> \n<p>With Michael Gove at the heart of government, a Johnson regime is unlikely to tinker much with school structures, although there may be legislative moves to convert all maintained schools into academies. Otherwise there are some creaking policies that need urgent repair: further eduction colleges, apprenticeships and early years provision are all likely to demand attention from Williamson or whoever succeeds him. And while vice-chancellors will be relieved that tuition fees remain, they will be anxious to know more about post-Brexit research funding. <strong>Richard Adams</strong></p> \n<h2>Law and order</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"393eae2f64e23fca51f689af61c374977747ca26\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/393eae2f64e23fca51f689af61c374977747ca26/0_0_5462_3619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks during his visit at the police in West Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaks during his visit at the police in West Yorkshire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Conservatives\u2019 hardline approach on crime and justice under Johnson became clear as soon as he took office: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/election-fact-check-will-there-really-be-20000-new-police-officers\">20,000 new police officers</a> on the streets was one of his first pledges. The recruitment is more of a restoration as the Conservative-led governments of the last nine years have cut the same number.</p> \n<p>But it set a tone for Johnson\u2019s outlook. This was cemented with plans to expand the use of stop and search powers, done by reducing the level of authorisation needed for officers to deploy a form of the tactic and lowering the degree of certainty required by the authorising officer that serious violence may occur. The government is also funding an increase in Tasers.</p> \n<p>Plans to increase sentences for some sexual and violent offenders were frequently promoted by Johnson and his team during the election campaign, particularly around the London Bridge terrorist attack, a move that drew criticism from the family of one of the victims.</p> \n<p>At the Tory party conference in September, the justice secretary announced that offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison will be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence, as opposed to the midway point.</p> \n<p>During the campaign they pledged to give all child murderers a \u201cwhole life order\u201d, condemning them to die in jail without release. In reality this would apply to very few cases and was dismissed by critics as populist electioneering.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/09/rise-in-violent-not-due-to-police-cuts-alone-figures-show\">serious violent crime strategy</a> acknowledges that violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d. There was very little mention in the Conservative manifesto about tackling these more complex issues behind crime. <strong>Jamie Grierson</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Media</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54562de6de469ce814976cfd2a3429cbc01b3c1b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54562de6de469ce814976cfd2a3429cbc01b3c1b/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson was interviewed by Andrew Neil during his Tory leadership campaign in July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson was interviewed by Andrew Neil during his Tory leadership campaign in July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>During the campaign the Conservatives thumbed their noses at the BBC by refusing to let the prime minister do an interview with Andrew Neil, raised questions over the future of the licence fee, and threatened the future of Channel 4.</p> \n<p>What\u2019s less clear is which bits were bellicose briefing from Conservative press aides keen to change an on-the-day narrative and which were real policies for the future of the media. Johnson\u2019s rumination that it is time to look at whether the licence fee charged on households owning a particular device is sustainable in the current environment \u2013 made in response to a question at a campaign event rather than as a pre-planned intervention \u2013 was telling.</p> \n<p>Abolition would be hard and would require legislation, since the BBC\u2019s royal charter guarantees the licence fee\u2019s existence until 2027. A bigger risk factor for the BBC is negotiations over the cost of the licence fee for the 2022-27 period. This gives the corporation two years to make the case that the licence fee should keep rising, with the alternative being accepting cuts in the year of the organisation\u2019s 100th anniversary. </p> \n<p>Even more worrying for the public broadcaster are comments by the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, that the party is seriously looking at decriminalisation of failure to pay the TV licence, which could undermine the BBC\u2019s revenue collection process.</p> \n<p>Channel 4\u2019s future will be up for debate towards the end of the parliamentary session in 2024.

HMRC has previously said it would take five years to get what was known as a maximum facilitation customs IT arrangement in place. If tariffs on goods exported from the UK into the EU apply after 2020, a new tariff rebate system has to be bolted on to cover goods that go from Great Britain to Northern Ireland only. This would apply, for instance, to all goods going from Tesco warehouses in the UK to supermarket shelves in Belfast, Derry or Armagh. Border inspection posts will have to be built from scratch for sanitary and phytosanitary checks on all animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU has already said it would prefer them to be in ports such as Stranraer and Liverpool to prevent potential disease in animals, plants or timber pallets making its way on to the island of Ireland. The Northern Ireland office has had several meetings with business leaders on what checks will be necessary but these cannot be determined in detail until after Brexit on 31 January. Under the withdrawal agreement, specialist committees to determine this detail cannot be appointed until the withdrawal agreement is ratified. This means they could be up and running by February, leaving 11 months for preparation. But as HMRC has warned previously, IT systems take years, not months, to build. Lisa O\u2019Carroll Education The new government\u2019s policies on education in England are less oven-ready and more baked in, with the bulk of policies on schools, colleges and universities having been announced before the election campaign began. In terms of reforms, the signature policies are set in place, as they have been since David Cameron: converting schools into academies and using tuition fees and student loans to fund demand for higher education. While Theresa May wanted to revise the fees and loans system, Boris Johnson has shown little appetite to do so other than trimming the interest rates charged to students. The Conservatives\u2019 slim manifesto offers more money for schools, reversing the real-terms cuts since 2009. Johnson\u2019s intention is to raise per-pupil spending to at least \u00a34,000 in primaries and \u00a35,000 in secondaries, although many schools in deprived and urban areas are already higher. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, had announced plans to raise pay for newly qualified teachers to \u00a330,000, to shore up recruitment. Existing teachers, however, are unhappy at the Conservative election pledge to beef up Ofsted inspections. Promises on early years education were vague, with a \u201c\u00a31bn childcare fund\u201d in England and no new funding commitments for children and young people\u2019s mental health. On post-16 education, the Conservatives had already promised \u00a3400m over the next parliament \u2013 nowhere near enough to arrest the fall in per-student funding, especially in sixth forms. With Michael Gove at the heart of government, a Johnson regime is unlikely to tinker much with school structures, although there may be legislative moves to convert all maintained schools into academies. Otherwise there are some creaking policies that need urgent repair: further eduction colleges, apprenticeships and early years provision are all likely to demand attention from Williamson or whoever succeeds him. And while vice-chancellors will be relieved that tuition fees remain, they will be anxious to know more about post-Brexit research funding. Richard Adams Law and order The Conservatives\u2019 hardline approach on crime and justice under Johnson became clear as soon as he took office: 20,000 new police officers on the streets was one of his first pledges. The recruitment is more of a restoration as the Conservative-led governments of the last nine years have cut the same number. But it set a tone for Johnson\u2019s outlook. This was cemented with plans to expand the use of stop and search powers, done by reducing the level of authorisation needed for officers to deploy a form of the tactic and lowering the degree of certainty required by the authorising officer that serious violence may occur. The government is also funding an increase in Tasers. Plans to increase sentences for some sexual and violent offenders were frequently promoted by Johnson and his team during the election campaign, particularly around the London Bridge terrorist attack, a move that drew criticism from the family of one of the victims. At the Tory party conference in September, the justice secretary announced that offenders guilty of violent and sexual crimes that carry a maximum sentence of life and who are sentenced to at least four years in prison will be required to serve two-thirds of the sentence in prison before being released on licence, as opposed to the midway point. During the campaign they pledged to give all child murderers a \u201cwhole life order\u201d, condemning them to die in jail without release. In reality this would apply to very few cases and was dismissed by critics as populist electioneering. The government\u2019s own serious violent crime strategy acknowledges that violent crime has a clear link to \u201cpoor life outcomes\u201d. There was very little mention in the Conservative manifesto about tackling these more complex issues behind crime. Jamie Grierson Media During the campaign the Conservatives thumbed their noses at the BBC by refusing to let the prime minister do an interview with Andrew Neil, raised questions over the future of the licence fee, and threatened the future of Channel 4. What\u2019s less clear is which bits were bellicose briefing from Conservative press aides keen to change an on-the-day narrative and which were real policies for the future of the media. Johnson\u2019s rumination that it is time to look at whether the licence fee charged on households owning a particular device is sustainable in the current environment \u2013 made in response to a question at a campaign event rather than as a pre-planned intervention \u2013 was telling. Abolition would be hard and would require legislation, since the BBC\u2019s royal charter guarantees the licence fee\u2019s existence until 2027. A bigger risk factor for the BBC is negotiations over the cost of the licence fee for the 2022-27 period. This gives the corporation two years to make the case that the licence fee should keep rising, with the alternative being accepting cuts in the year of the organisation\u2019s 100th anniversary. Even more worrying for the public broadcaster are comments by the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, that the party is seriously looking at decriminalisation of failure to pay the TV licence, which could undermine the BBC\u2019s revenue collection process. Channel 4\u2019s future will be up for debate towards the end of the parliamentary session in 2024. Conservative aides already exasperated with the channel\u2019s output have been watching clips of the its overnight election coverage featuring an audience booing the exit poll. A new culture secretary will have to decide on how to regulate the internet to reduce online harms, including whether to found a new regulator to take on the task, although the Conservative manifesto was characteristically vague on detail. With Labour blaming rightwing newspapers for its defeat, the British media industry is facing a tough period with reduced public support at a time when many traditional outlets were already struggling. Jim Waterson Constitution Opaque pledges in the Conservative manifesto to overhaul \u201cthe relationship between the government, parliament and the courts\u201d have raised fears that the independence of the judiciary and the Human Rights Act could come under attack. One inevitable casualty will be the little-loved Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Only a page in the manifesto is dedicated to constitutional issues. While lack of detail may veil radical intentions, it could also disguise a lack of worked-through policies. The rapid turnover of justice secretaries and the distraction of Brexit have prevented passage of legislation even with cross-party support, such as the divorce, dissolution and separation bill introducing no-fault divorce and the domestic abuse bill, which bans cross-examination of victims by abusive ex-partners. Repeated promises to protect members of the armed forces against \u201cvexatious legal claims\u201d have run into disputes between the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry of Defence over the extent of immunity offered in historical cases. That constitutional revolution is not a day one priority is acknowledged by statements that \u201cafter Brexit\u201d and \u201cin our first year we will set up a constitution, democracy &amp; rights commission that will examine these issues in depth\u201d. Similarly, a commitment to update the Human Rights Act to ensure \u201ca proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government\u201d is vague. It is less explicit than May\u2019s promise to leave the European court of human rights, announced in 2016. There has, however, been a ferment in Conservative-inclined thinktanks suggesting, in the wake of successive government defeats in the supreme court, there could be political appointments of senior judges. Others such as Martin Howe QC have proposed replacing the supreme court with a \u201clower-key and less activist\u201d set of judges. Could a manifesto reference to \u201caccess to justice for ordinary people\u201d hint at one-nation conservatism? Lawyers are desperate for a crumbling justice system stripped of legal aid to be better funded: the Ministry of Justice has had a 40% budget cut since 2010, the worst in Whitehall. One Tory manifesto pledge, repeatedly made but never delivered, might, ironically, have defeated the 2016 Brexit referendum. Abolishing the 15-year limit on Britons abroad voting in parliamentary elections would enfranchise nearly a million pro-EU voters. Whether it will be enacted belatedly by Johnson may indicate how far he feels bound by manifesto commitments. Owen Bowcott",

He had a constant desire to learn and was always very interested in what was new, what young people were doing, how he could be close to the creative centre of things. It\u2019s no coincidence that he looked and behaved a lot younger than he actually was.</p> <p>Joe was the kind of guy who left no footprints in the sand.

Gus is director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art in Washington DC [soon to become director of V&amp;A East]. His sister, Margaret, is chair of the board at the Globe theatre. Seeing them all having a conversation together was like watching the downtime of a very high-powered board meeting. In fashion, Joe was quietly influential, always doing things differently, never really following trends. His practice was pretty discreet. Obviously, he\u2019s been a massive influence on Charlie, his son, a menswear designer. Maria, Joe\u2019s wife, still works with Charlie today. I didn\u2019t see Joe a lot after I moved to Trinidad in 2005, though I\u2019d bump into him from time to time. The last time we met was in east London a few years ago. It was like we\u2019d seen each other just the day before. I remember Joe as somebody who was extremely calm but very determined. He had a constant desire to learn and was always very interested in what was new, what young people were doing, how he could be close to the creative centre of things. It\u2019s no coincidence that he looked and behaved a lot younger than he actually was. Joe was the kind of guy who left no footprints in the sand. At the same time he was very, very funny and had a really infectious laugh. I feel extremely fortunate that I spent private time with him.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for all your comments. It\u2019s been a pretty quiet day after the initial flurry of activity on the political chat shows. Here\u2019s a summary of the main developments this afternoon. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has denied referring to voters as \u201cfools\u201d after Caroline Flint made the claim on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. Flint, who lost her seat as Labour MP on Thursday, quoted Thornberry, a potential leadership candidate to replace Jeremy Corbyn as saying: \u201cI\u2019m glad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours.\u201d In response., Thornberry said it was \u201ca total and utter lie\u201d. Flint said the likes of Thornberry, Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper had helped bring about the loss of 59 Labour seats by advocating for remain. Concerns have been raised about reports that Boris Johnson is planning to abolish the Department for International Development (DFID) and merge its aid functions into the Foreign Office. Save the Children chief executive Kevin Watkins warned it would be a \u201cdeeply damaging move\u201d. The former international secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell MP, said any changes must not damage what is \u201ca huge soft power asset\u201d for Britain. The chief executive of Save the Children has voiced concerns at a Sunday Times report that Boris Johnson is planning to merge the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. Kevin Watkins said: If today\u2019s reports of a potential merger of the FCO and Dfid are true this is a deeply damaging move that risks endangering the impact big-hearted Britons can have around the world. Dfid multiplies the impact of British kindness, whether by ensuring we get value for money from every pound spent or guaranteeing our brave aid workers support from a government department that cares only for their safety and success. The former head of Ukip in Scotland has been blocked in his bid to join the Scottish Conservatives. David Coburn, a former Ukip MEP, told the BBC on Saturday that he had joined the Tories in order to help the prime minister \u201csave the Union\u201d in the event of a second independence referendum. However Jackson Carlaw, the leader of the Scots Tories, appears to have effectively rejected his application in a tweet posted on Sunday . He said: I understand David Coburn has applied to join the Scottish Conservatives. As leader I have to make it clear that past public comments by him are incompatible with membership and I cannot and will not support his application. Coburn, a former MEP, has previously been forced to apologise after making an Islamophobic slur against SNP minister Humza Yousaf, comparing him to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza. He was also banned from Wikipedia indefinitely after trying to alter an article about himself 69 times in the space of six days. Reports this morning suggested that Boris Johnson is preparing a huge shakeup of Whitehall, including abolishing the Department for International Development (DFID) and merging its aid functions into the Foreign Office. Responding to the stories, the former international secretary of state for international development, Andrew Mitchell MP, said any changes must be well thought out: DFID is the most effective and respected engine of development anywhere in the world, and a huge soft power asset for Britain. Any machinery of government changes in Whitehall should obviously respect Britain\u2019s international development in the poorest and most unstable parts of the world. Tackling insecurity and building prosperity directly affects our well being in the UK. British leadership in this area is a core part of global Britain. Emily Thornberry has maintained that she did not call voters \u201cstupid\u201d, as former Labour MP Caroline Flint claimed earlier she did (see 9.05am). John McDonnell has said if anyone is to blame for Labour\u2019s election defeat it is him. But he also criticised media vilification of Jeremy Corbyn. The shadow chancellor told BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr show he and Corbyn would be gone within 8 to 10 weeks, early in the New Year, and they were in no way trying to ensure the successor would be someone they approved of. The Wigan MP, Lisa Nandy, said she is \u201cseriously considering\u201d running for the Labour leadership. She told Marr that Corbyn was a major problem during the election but not the only one. Nandy said Labour\u2019s HQ should be moved out of London and party conferences should be held in towns rather than cities. Richard Burgon said he backed Rebecca Long-Bailey for the leadership, although she has not declared her intention to stand. The shadow justice secretary told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he was considering running to be deputy. McDonnell said Long-Bailey is \u201cbrilliant\u201d and also mentioned Angela Rayner and Dawn Butler as contenders. Michael Gove has categorically promised the UK will have a trade deal with the EU by the end of next year, ignoring reservations in Brussels about whether that is viable. He told Ridge the centrepiece of Thursday\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech would be legislation to enshrine extra funding for the NHS in law and measures to spread \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d across the country. Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that Scotland cannot be \u201cimprisoned in the UK against its will\u201d, warning Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to grant a second referendum will only increase support for Scottish independence. Gove ruled out another referendum on Scotland in the next five years, insisting that the first was described as settling the issue \u201cfor a generation\u201d. With attention turning, within Labour, to who will be the next leader, here is a useful guide from the Institute for Government as to how she or he will be elected. It also includes results from past contests and shows how the mechanics of the contest have changed over time. Emily Thornberry has denied the claim by Caroline Flint that she told one of Flint\u2019s colleagues: \u201cI\u2019m glad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours,\u201d (see 9.05am), says the Mirror\u2019s online editor. John McDonnell says he was not ignoring Lisa Nandy as a potential candidate to succeed Corbyn when questioned about candidates this morning. Andrew Marr mentioned the Wigan MP\u2019s name twice but McDonnell did not respond. The former Labour home secretary, Alan Johnson, has written a scathing assessment of Jeremy Corbyn in the Mail in Sunday, urging the party to rid itself of the \u201ccult\u201d of Momentum. He says: Labour tried to fool the public into thinking that money was no object, which made the manifesto look like the wish-list of a pressure group rather than a serious plan for a potential party of government. But the main problem at this election wasn\u2019t the manifesto; the main problem was Corbyn. A weak, self-regarding, pious man incapable of leadership. Indeed, most of his Momentum supporters despise the very concept of leadership. All decisions must be made by the rank-and-file, which effectively means a clique of activists and Len McCluskey. The working classes looked at Corbyn and saw somebody who was unpatriotic to the extent that the country\u2019s enemies were his friends. They hated his pacifism, his simplistic division of the world between evil oppressors and their victims, his disdain of aspiration. Most of all, they didn\u2019t recognise themselves in Corbyn\u2019s depiction of working-class people as having no individual identity, only a collective role as part of the downtrodden masses. They decided well before this election and irrespective of Brexit that they would never let him cross the threshold of 10 Downing Street. HuffPost\u2019s executive editor for politics, Paul Waugh, says John McDonnell\u2019s refusal to include Lisa Nandy in his list of preferred Labour leadership candidates (Marr prompted him twice but McDonnell did not respond see 9.46) is significant The treasury minister, Rishi Sunak, was asked by Andrew Marr this morning about reports in the Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph that the government plans to make sweeping changes to reform the civil service. He replied: I think we want to make sure that government works effectively to deliver for the British people. Pressed on the matter, Sunak did not answer directly. He was also asked if non-payment of the BBC licence fee should be decriminalised (the Sunday Telegraph reported that Boris Johnson is planning to do just that), Sunak said: That is something the prime minister has said we will look at and has instructed people to look at that. He was also asked about the delayed report on Russian interference in British politics. I missed the beginning of the John McDonnell interview on Marr as I was tuned into Sophy Ridge on Sky but he apologised for his role in the election defeat. It\u2019s on me, let\u2019s take it on the chin, I own this disaster so I apologise to all those wonderful Labour MPs who have lost their seats and who worked so hard. I apologise to all our campaigners, but most of all I apologise to those people who desperately need a Labour government. Yes, if anyone\u2019s to blame it\u2019s me, full stop. Nicola Sturgeon insisted on the Andrew Marr show that Boris Johnson\u2019s position on continuing to deny the SNP a second independence referendum is wholly undemocratic. Describing it as a \u201csubversion of democracy\u201d that the Tories were \u201craging against the reality\u201d of the election result in Scotland, which saw the SNP win 48 out of 59 seats while the Scottish Tories\u2019 MPs were reduced by half, she said: It really is such a subversion of democracy that we\u2019re sitting here the Sunday after an election and you\u2019re talking to the leader of the party that overwhelmingly won the election and I\u2019m under pressure to say what I\u2019m doing because the mandate that I won is not going to be honoured by the party that got roundly defeated in Scotland. It is just such perversion and subservion of democracy that it will not hold. Asked what she intended to do if Johnson continued to refuse to granT the s30 order to hold a legal referendum, she repeated her pledge that she would not want to hold an illegal Catalan-style vote, but added: I said to him on the phone on Friday night, If he thinks saying no is the end of the matter he\u2019s going to find himself completely and utterly wrong You cannot hold Scotland in the union against its will. You cannot just lock us in a cupboard and turn the key and hope everything goes away. If the United Kingdom is to continue then it can only be by consent. If Boris Johnson is confident in the case for the union then he should be confident enough to make that case and allow the people to decide. Corbyn was undoubtedly part of the problem but it is too simplistic to say it was all about one man or one issue, says Nandy. She says many people liked what they put forward in the manifesto. I think it\u2019s about trust ...we\u2019ve got to rediscover how we can earn people\u2019s trust. Marr asks Nandy if she will vote for the withdrawal bill. She says she will vote for it on the basis that Boris Johnson and his team are willing to consider a customs union at the committee stage. But Nandy says she doubts that will be the case and thinks the election campaign suggests the Tories will go for a hard Brexit. If that\u2019s the case, Nandy will not vote for it, she says. Here\u2019s Labour MP for Wigan Lisa Nandy talking to Marr now. She is asked straightaway if she will stand as leader. I\u2019m seriously thinking about it. She adds that the party needs to take a look at how to take that long, hard path to power. Nandy says regional and constituency offices have very little power with the HQ in London. The trouble is unless we tackle structural problems we won\u2019t be able to hear what people are saying outside London and address their concerns. She says there is no reason for the party HQ being in London. Our headquarters should be moved outside London. She also says party conferences should be held in towns and not just cities. Marr asks McDonnell when Corbyn will be gone by. He replies 8-10 weeks, sometime in the New Year. We\u2019ll have a new generation of leaders coming in. Are you and Corbyn hanging on to ensure your choice - Rebecca Long-Bailey - gets in, Marr asks? McDonnell insists they\u2019re not able to do that but adds: \u201cBecky is brilliant.\u201d He also name checks Angela Rayner. Could he stomach Jess Phillips, an ardent critic of Corbyn, as leader? I\u2019d prefer others. A couple of times, Marr suggests Lisa Nandy, who fits McDonnell\u2019s profile as a non-Metropolitan, northern, woman, but McDonnell does not directly reply. Over on BBC One, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell is speaking to Andrew Marr. Marr says Corbyn went down very, very badly on the doorstep. McDonnell tells Marr: \u201cIf anyone is to blame it is me, full stop.\u201d He also says it was Brexit that did it but also that \u201cthe media did a job on Jeremy for four years\u201d. He says that when Corbyn had the opportunities on broadcast media he was seen as the most trustworthy leader. Marr says his leadership poll ratings were \u201ccatastrophic\u201d. McDonnell says Boris Johnson is a \u201cproven liar\u201d, while Corbyn is know for his honesty and principles. We need to examine the nature of our politics. He refers to a study which found that 88% of Tory ads were misleading compared with 0% of Labour\u2019s. McDonnell says Corbyn was targeted as is anyone who challenges the establishment. He says he does take responsibility for the defeat and one of the things he takes responsibility for is underestimating the extent of the media attack. Iain McNicol, former Labour general secretary, tells Sophy Ridge, that not enough resources were put into holding onto Labour seats. Too much of the resources ...was going into Chingford, Uxbridge, seats we were never going to win. He also says Jeremy Corbyn was a negative factor on the doorstep. The biggest issue ...was Jeremy and [people doubting] his ability to become prime minister. McNicol says Corbyn should stand down now and there should be a caretaker leader such as Harriet Harman, Hilary Benn or Yvette Cooper. McNicol is asked if he takes any responsibility for the failure to tackle antisemitism as John McDonnell said it dated back to his stewardship. McNicol says he does but ultimately Corbyn was leader and it \u201cstarted and rose under Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. If you refresh this page, you will see that I have added some video clips from some of this morning\u2019s interviews. Please also note that comments are now open. Ridge asks Burgon what the biggest mistake was? He says time is need to analyse that but it was perhaps underestimating the desire of people who vote to leave to exit the EU. Ridge says Jeremy Corbyn came up over and over on the doorstep (in a negative way). Burgon says people repeated headlines the Sun and the Daily Mail published. He says that when he campaigned on the doorstep for Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband, concerns were also raised on the doorstep. Burgon says on the doorstep people said Corbyn was racist and a terrorist sympathiser but says these were lies that were the product of right wing newspapers. Ridge suggests he is treating voters as stupid, implying they are unable to think for themselves. Will Burgon run for the leadership? He says he would like to see Rebecca Long-Bailey as leader because she understands Northern seats and could help win back seats Labour has lost. Burgon says he is considering running as deputy leader. But he says the focus for now should be the people \u201cmissing out\u201d because we haven\u2019t got a Labour government. Its shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, next. He is confronted with Flint\u2019s comments and says: \u201cWe must listen.\u201d He says the fact that Labour won in his - leave-voting - constituency, Leeds East, shows the party could win in such seats and that the picture is \u201ccomplicated\u201d. Asked about what went wrong, Burgon says Brexit overshadowed everything, much as Corbyn has said. Burgon says Brexit won\u2019t be an issue at the next election but insists austerity will be. Ridge asks him whether it was wrong to have a second referendum. Burgon says it was right to try to bring the country together on that basis but ultimately it failed. Flint says Corbyn\u2019s acolytes refused to look at the underlying problems that were out there in 2017 because they treated it as a success even though Labour lost. We win elections when we\u2019ve got a leader people can trust and believe in. Referring to Labour\u2019s spending promises, she says \u201cit was all free\u201d and working class people are wise to that. Flint\u2019s says the only two candidates worth looking at to replace Corbyn at present are Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy. Caroline Flint, the former Labour MP who lost her seat on Thursday is on now. She says Jeremy Corbyn came up as an issue on all doorsteps, people didn\u2019t trust him. She says a lot of armed forces families didn\u2019t like him and she had people saying if we vote for you, will you guarantee that he won\u2019t be prime minister. She says: It was Jeremy ... But it was also in our leave-voting seats that Brexit was instrumental. Flint says Labour didn\u2019t heed the warning signs in 2017 when Labour lost constituencies in the likes of Mansfield. There were also signs in 2010 and 2015. In the pursuit of remain, the likes of Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Yvette Cooper brought about the result, says Flint. Sarcastically, she says: They have contributed to sacrificing 59 seats, but don\u2019t worry we\u2019ve got Putney and Canterbury. She says Starmer \u201cled us down the path of a second referendum\u201d. She claims Thornberry said to one of her colleagues: \u201cI\u2019m glad my constituents aren\u2019t as stupid as yours.\u201d Was the biggest mistake backing the election in the first place, asks Ridge? Davey says there was a fear the withdrawal agreement would go through parliament. It was a real difficult judgment to make. Do you feel sorry for Jo Swinson, Ridge asks? Absolutely, says Davey. In slightly strange language reminiscent of paying tribute to someone has died, he sends thoughts to her and her family and says the Lib Dems will work on securing her legacy. Finally, asked about Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s celebration when Swinson lost her seat, Davey says. Not very dignified. Davey is asked what he would have done differently from Jo Swinson, who stood down as leader after the election. He says there were \u201cmistakes\u201d without identifying any and then goes back to criticising Jeremy Corbyn for creating the fear factor on the doorstep. Pushed by Ridge, he says: We didn\u2019t get past the stop Brexit message. He says the Lib Dems have \u201cmany other attractive policies\u201d, mentioning climate change. Asked about the policy to revoke article 50 without a second referendum he says the polling he has seen shows some people were attracted by that and others were put off. The Lib Dems co-leader Ed Davey is next on Sophy Ridge on Sunday. He starts by declining to say whether he will stand again to be permanent leader. Davey says the timetable for the leadership election will be set by the party\u2019s board in January. He says it is too early to rule himself in or out. He says it is difficult for the Lib Dems to make progress when there is a hard left Labour leader because the Tories play on the \u201cfear factor\u201d - vote Lib Dems, get Labour. Isn\u2019t it an opportunity to occupy the central space, asks Ridge? Davey says liberal Conservatives were more scared by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour than Brexit. Gove is asked about Sally-Ann Hart being investigated for saying George Soros controls the EU, and comments about the billionaire Jewish financier by another newly elected Tory MP, Lee Anderson. Gove says they are under investigation and won\u2019t say whether they will have the Tory whip while the investigations into antisemitism are ongoing. He then - predictably - turns the issue to antisemitism within Labour. Ridge asks Gove who he would like to see as the next Labour leader? The best person would be Caroline Flint, says Gove, but, as he points out, she lost her seat on Thursday. Gove says the Queen\u2019s speech will include recognition that the NHS is the number one domestic priority. There will be legislation putting in place an NHS funding guarantee. He also refers to the need to make sure opportunity and productivity is more evenly spread across the country, alluding to investment in infrastructure in the north. The Tories will not grant another Scottish independence referendum, says Gove. Scotland is stronger in the United Kingdom Is the union weaker as a result of the emphasis on Brexit, Ridge asks. Gove says the \u201crebuff\u201d Sinn Fein received is an indication that there \u201cextremism\u201d is on the wane. Here\u2019s cabinet office minister Michael Gove on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. He says the withdrawal agreement bill will be brought forward to ensure the UK leaves the EU on 31 January. He says there will be a chance to vote on it \u201cin short order\u201d but won\u2019t confirm whether this will be before Christmas. Trade negotiations with the EU will be concluded by the end of next year, Gove promises. He talks about other people who made promises they couldn\u2019t keep being found out in the election but Ridge points out that Johnson broke his promise to leave the EU on 31 October. Good morning, welcome to Politics Live. After criticism over his initial failure to do so, Jeremy Corbyn has said he takes his share of responsibility for the disastrous election result for Labour. He has written mea culpas of sort in both the Observer and the Mirror. Meanwhile, the Tory supporting papers are full of Boris Johnson\u2019s plans for a \u201crevolution\u201d. The Sunday Times says the prime minister is planning to sack up to a third of the government after the scheduled Brexit date, abolish Whitehall departments and replace civil servants with external experts. The Sunday Telegraph also splashes on a \u201crevolution\u201d in Whitehall. I\u2019ll be helping you keep abreast of all the latest political developments as the Conservatives and SNP plan how to consolidate their successes and Labour and the Lib Dems lick their wounds. They\u2019ll undoubtedly be plenty to report from the political chat shows this morning. First up is Sophy Ridge on Sunday, who welcomes the following guests in an extended 90 minute edition: Michael Gove Richard Burgon, shadow justice secretary Iain McNicol, former Labour general secretary Caroline Flint, the former Labour MP who lost her seat on Thursday Ed Davey, acting co-leader of the Lib Dems Ian Blackford, Westminster leader of the SNP Then it\u2019s Andrew Marr on BBC One: If you want to get my attention, the best way is via Twitter @Haroon_Siddique",

Current targets would put the world on track for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/nov/03/miami-shanghai-3c-warming-cities-underwater\">3C of warming</a>, which scientists say would ravage coastal cities and destroy agriculture over swathes of the globe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/14/un-climate-talks-drag-on-as-rifts-scupper-hopes-of-breakthrough\">UN climate talks end with limited progress on emissions targets</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Few countries came up with new targets at these talks, and the hope is that next year there will be more. Strong public and political pressure will be needed, participants acknowledged, as these talks were characterised by squabbling over technical details. Brazil, Australia, the US, China and other major emitters were all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/13/richer-nations-accused-of-stalling-progress-on-climate-crisis\">accused of holding up progress</a>.</p> \n<p>The snail\u2019s pace and low ambition of the talks stood in stark contrast to pleas from activists, who staged a 500,000-strong march through the Spanish capital. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish school striker, said the last year of protests had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/06/greta-thunberg-says-school-strikes-have-achieved-nothing\">\u201cachieved nothing\u201d</a> as countries were still failing to bring forward the measures needed.</p> \n<p>Chema Vera, the interim executive director of Oxfam International, said: \u201cThe world is screaming out for action but this summit responded with a whisper. The poorest nations are in a sprint for survival, yet many governments have barely moved from the starting blocks. Instead of committing to more ambitious cuts in emissions, countries have argued over technicalities.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c25e9c31-7f5e-4b74-bf4a-fc48742ba010\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zYJWw2LQlhg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Helen Mountford, a vice-president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said: \u201cThese talks reflect how disconnected country leaders are from the urgency of the science and the demands of their citizens in the street. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations\">can-do spirit that birthed the Paris agreement</a> feels like a distant memory today. Instead of leading the charge for greater ambition, most major emitters have been missing in action.\u201d</p> \n<p>During the talks, governments were reminded continually that the world is far off meeting the pledge made in Paris to hold global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded by scientists as the outer limit of safety.</p> \n<p>Small island states repeatedly stressed that the climate crisis was happening now, with sea level rises, fiercer storms, floods and droughts already causing devastation. Bushfires in Australia and extreme weather around the world in recent months have added to the signals of a growing emergency.</p> \n<p>Research published during the two weeks of talks showed that greenhouse gas emissions have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\">risen 4%</a> since the Paris accord was signed in 2015, and the world will need to cut carbon by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/united-nations-global-effort-cut-emissions-stop-climate-chaos-2030\">more than 7% a year</a> in the next decade to heed scientific advice.</p> \n<p>This conference was not expected to produce a major breakthrough on new emissions targets, but it was hoped that a spirit of cooperation and a resolution to act would set the stage for higher ambition next year.</p> \n<p>Instead, even minor issues such as the role of carbon markets \u2013 mechanisms by which countries can sell carbon credits, based on their emissions-cutting efforts \u2013 and the financial assistance needed for poor countries to cope with the impacts of climate chaos were all put off until next year after consensus proved elusive.</p> \n<p>Those questions will return to encumber next year\u2019s talks, where the decks were supposed to have been cleared to focus on emissions cuts. Some countries \u2013 chiefly Brazil, but also including China, India and the US \u2013 were blamed for using these technicalities to hold up wider progress, in a sign of how difficult next year\u2019s talks will be.</p> \n<p>The EU came up with the strongest new plan, finally agreeing a bloc-wide goal of reaching net-zero carbon by 2050. Scores of smaller countries agreed similar long-term targets, but other major emitters held back.</p> \n<p>There was widespread recognition that long-term targets are not enough, and the pressure is now on to forge a short-term climate plan for the next 10 years. The UK will play a leading role as host of a November 2020 conference in Glasgow, but with the US set on withdrawal from the Paris accord and many major economies seemingly unwilling to show much ambition, it will face an uphill struggle.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe UK now has a gargantuan task of overseeing a successful climate summit in Glasgow next year,\u201d said Katherine Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid. \u201cThat meeting is supposed to be the moment the world responds to the climate crisis by strengthening the pledges made in the Paris agreement. To avoid failure, the UK will need to put its own house in order, in creating and implementing policies to rapidly reduce its own emissions.\u201d</p> \n<h2>What was the conference?</h2> \n<p>Governments met under the UN for two weeks of talks in Madrid aimed at forging a new response to the climate crisis. More than 190 nations and blocs, from the US, China and the EU to the smallest island states, were represented.</p> \n<h2>What did they hope to achieve?</h2> \n<p>Ambitions for this conference were limited because many countries were focused on narrow technical details such as the workings of the global carbon markets, by which countries can buy and sell carbon credits based on their emissions-cutting efforts. It was hoped that countries would resolve to work on more ambitious carbon targets needed to fulfil the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement.</p> \n<h2>Did they do it?</h2> \n<p>No. Most of the technical details were carried over to be discussed again next year. There was a recognition that tougher carbon targets are needed globally, but few countries came up with any and the resolve to come back next year with more ambitious plans was worded too weakly to satisfy most campaigners.</p> \n<h2>What happens next?</h2> \n<p>The UK will host a conference in Glasgow next November aimed at strengthening countries\u2019 climate plans in line with the Paris agreement. But based on the squabbling and blocking tactics used by many countries at COP25, it will face an uphill struggle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Governments at the UN climate talks in Madrid responded to the growing urgency of the crisis with a partial admission that carbon-cutting targets are too weak, but few concrete plans to strengthen them in line with the Paris agreement. Two weeks of talks ended on Sunday afternoon with a formal recognition of the need to bridge the gap between greenhouse gas targets set in 2015 in Paris and scientific advice that says much deeper cuts are needed. Current targets would put the world on track for 3C of warming, which scientists say would ravage coastal cities and destroy agriculture over swathes of the globe. Few countries came up with new targets at these talks, and the hope is that next year there will be more. Strong public and political pressure will be needed, participants acknowledged, as these talks were characterised by squabbling over technical details. Brazil, Australia, the US, China and other major emitters were all accused of holding up progress. The snail\u2019s pace and low ambition of the talks stood in stark contrast to pleas from activists, who staged a 500,000-strong march through the Spanish capital. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish school striker, said the last year of protests had \u201cachieved nothing\u201d as countries were still failing to bring forward the measures needed. Chema Vera, the interim executive director of Oxfam International, said: \u201cThe world is screaming out for action but this summit responded with a whisper. The poorest nations are in a sprint for survival, yet many governments have barely moved from the starting blocks. Instead of committing to more ambitious cuts in emissions, countries have argued over technicalities.\u201d Helen Mountford, a vice-president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute, said: \u201cThese talks reflect how disconnected country leaders are from the urgency of the science and the demands of their citizens in the street. The can-do spirit that birthed the Paris agreement feels like a distant memory today. Instead of leading the charge for greater ambition, most major emitters have been missing in action.\u201d During the talks, governments were reminded continually that the world is far off meeting the pledge made in Paris to hold global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded by scientists as the outer limit of safety. Small island states repeatedly stressed that the climate crisis was happening now, with sea level rises, fiercer storms, floods and droughts already causing devastation. Bushfires in Australia and extreme weather around the world in recent months have added to the signals of a growing emergency. Research published during the two weeks of talks showed that greenhouse gas emissions have risen 4% since the Paris accord was signed in 2015, and the world will need to cut carbon by more than 7% a year in the next decade to heed scientific advice. This conference was not expected to produce a major breakthrough on new emissions targets, but it was hoped that a spirit of cooperation and a resolution to act would set the stage for higher ambition next year. Instead, even minor issues such as the role of carbon markets \u2013 mechanisms by which countries can sell carbon credits, based on their emissions-cutting efforts \u2013 and the financial assistance needed for poor countries to cope with the impacts of climate chaos were all put off until next year after consensus proved elusive. Those questions will return to encumber next year\u2019s talks, where the decks were supposed to have been cleared to focus on emissions cuts. Some countries \u2013 chiefly Brazil, but also including China, India and the US \u2013 were blamed for using these technicalities to hold up wider progress, in a sign of how difficult next year\u2019s talks will be. The EU came up with the strongest new plan, finally agreeing a bloc-wide goal of reaching net-zero carbon by 2050. Scores of smaller countries agreed similar long-term targets, but other major emitters held back. There was widespread recognition that long-term targets are not enough, and the pressure is now on to forge a short-term climate plan for the next 10 years. The UK will play a leading role as host of a November 2020 conference in Glasgow, but with the US set on withdrawal from the Paris accord and many major economies seemingly unwilling to show much ambition, it will face an uphill struggle. \u201cThe UK now has a gargantuan task of overseeing a successful climate summit in Glasgow next year,\u201d said Katherine Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid. \u201cThat meeting is supposed to be the moment the world responds to the climate crisis by strengthening the pledges made in the Paris agreement. To avoid failure, the UK will need to put its own house in order, in creating and implementing policies to rapidly reduce its own emissions.\u201d What was the conference? Governments met under the UN for two weeks of talks in Madrid aimed at forging a new response to the climate crisis. More than 190 nations and blocs, from the US, China and the EU to the smallest island states, were represented. What did they hope to achieve? Ambitions for this conference were limited because many countries were focused on narrow technical details such as the workings of the global carbon markets, by which countries can buy and sell carbon credits based on their emissions-cutting efforts. It was hoped that countries would resolve to work on more ambitious carbon targets needed to fulfil the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement. Did they do it? No. Most of the technical details were carried over to be discussed again next year. There was a recognition that tougher carbon targets are needed globally, but few countries came up with any and the resolve to come back next year with more ambitious plans was worded too weakly to satisfy most campaigners. What happens next? The UK will host a conference in Glasgow next November aimed at strengthening countries\u2019 climate plans in line with the Paris agreement. But based on the squabbling and blocking tactics used by many countries at COP25, it will face an uphill struggle.",

Whatever the truth behind Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, they have inspired artists from ancient Greek vase painters to Cranach and Caro.

We see him wandering the streets, asking what it means to be a black American, a gay man, a writer stalled in Istanbul, where he lived, on and off, for about a decade from 1961. This intimate portrait, the truest and most memorable work in the biennial, was brought here by Ligon, another African-American gay man, who has had Turkish subtitles added to Pakay\u2019s film. He presents it along with his own neon and light works, and two further films he shot himself, following Baldwin\u2019s footsteps around the city. \u201cI am a kind of witness, I suppose,\u201d says Baldwin.

Luciano Castelli\u2019s self-portraits created in the early 1970s are the visual equivalent of Bowie and Lou Reed. Even earlier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/25/pioneer-of-perversity-pierre-molinier-extreme-exposures\">Pierre Molinier</a> shot fantastical self-images in sensual black and white.

An array of enlarged selfies taken in the insomniac depths of loneliness proved exactly how honest her art is. But what she loves is to paint and mould clay.

Jan Gossaert\u2019s Christ, stripped, awaits his fate, sitting on the cold stone, and wracked with palpable terror. Several Saint Sebastians stand about, pin-up boys oblivious to the arrows that pierce them. A procession of flagellants in a Netherlandish Book of Hours prepare themselves for their hooded tormentors in a scene as erotic as it is devotional. Focusing on 1400-1530, and with works from France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, this exhibition showed us multiple approaches to the naked human body, bodies as various as the artists who depicted them. In extremis, in flagrante, inflammatory, indecent, idealised, implausible, pagan, mythological, Christian, humanist and abject, this was a jolt to the system. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/28/royal-academy-renaissance-nude-review-a-sexy-sacred-riot-of-flesh\">Read the full review</a>. <strong>JJ</strong></p> <h2><strong>12</strong></h2> <h2>Leonardo: A Life in Drawing, various venues</h2> <p>The Royal Collection put on the year\u2019s most democratic blockbuster, starting as a national festival before its home gig and providing a perfectly chosen banquet of the Queen\u2019s unique array of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s drawings of the dissected human body, designs for battles, studies of galloping horses, landscapes, caricatures, deluges ... just an unbeatable survey of the most mind-boggling genius in the story of art.

A chapter-by-chapter retelling of her development opened up in the downstairs spaces at the Barbican where huge canvases, wild scrabblings, flexings and flurries, spatterings and spirallings and draggings upped the ante. Krasner destroyed as much as she made along the way. It was tough to be a woman artist amid the first generation of abstract expressionists, especially one suspicious of a signature style.

Allusions and references abound in this work that\u2019s topped by Venus, throwing her head back and spurting water from her nipples and slashed throat. JMW Turner\u2019s abolitionist 1840 painting The Slave Ship, rendered as a bath-toy frigate, nods to Damien Hirst\u2019s shark in formaldehyde.

The heavy emphasis on the Viennese artist\u2019s life was inevitable, given the degree to which personal relationships and collaborations were at the heart of his work. Lumps of polystyrene, old flip-flops, a pile of hats, even his childhood bed and his mother\u2019s old washing machine, which he remade into a kind of love-seat, punctuated this uproarious show. Sometimes his sculptures leant against the wall like drunks, or stood on plinths devised for the exhibition by West\u2019s friend Sarah Lucas, whose contribution enlivened the show no end. West had a real feel for shape, for the lump, for the eccentric. Filled with jokes, visual slapstick, alarming twists and absurd confrontations, this was a show that was as celebratory as it was bleak. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/feb/19/franz-west-review-dirty-drawings-slapstick-sculpture-tate-modern\">Read the full review</a>. <strong>AS</strong></p> <h2><strong>6</strong></h2> <h2>Tutankhamun, Saatchi Gallery, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93f109a0edead9dd02eaaf73ac92d75fd28cf825\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f109a0edead9dd02eaaf73ac92d75fd28cf825/0_418_7087_4685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wooden Guardian Statue of the Ka of the King from Tutankhamun at the Saatchi Gallery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wooden Guardian Statue of the Ka of the King from Tutankhamun at the Saatchi Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IMG</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This exhibition has haunted my dreams \u2013 it is almost beyond belief to see so many of the wonders from Tutankhamun\u2019s unspoiled tomb in London, from his wooden picnic boxes for afterlife eating to an array of amulets that protected his mummified body.

Hogarth\u2019s Bedlam inspired Goya\u2019s paintings of madhouses and, in this gathering of every single one of his narrative cycles, it\u2019s powerfully clear how modern, uneasy and pointed Hogarth\u2019s vision is. Let this great satirist and social observer take you through the streets of London, and show you something that\u2019ll make you change your mind. On until 5 January. Read the full review. JJ 19 Frank Bowling, Tate Britain, London It\u2019s taken this brilliant painter until the age of 85 to get the recognition he deserves, but there was no hint of bitterness in his epic retrospective. On the contrary, it glowed with the sheer pleasure and freedom of a life messing about with paint. Electrifying, acidic splurges and stains of unlikely, jarring colours \u2013 orange and magenta, crimson and emerald \u2013 blaze in his abstract walls of pigment. Yet the vibrancy is shadowed in his 1970s paintings by maps of global injustice. Read the full review. JJ 18 Troy, British Museum, London Cy Twombly\u2019s vision of the doomed hero Achilles as a smear of red blood on a white plain greets you in this rollicking journey through artistic visions of the first war in history to be preserved in literature. Whatever the truth behind Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey, they have inspired artists from ancient Greek vase painters to Cranach and Caro. Highlights include frescoes from Pompeii that show tender moments in the tale, but it\u2019s the grandeur of a story shared across time that makes this a powerful experience. On until 8 March. Read the full review. JJ 17 Julie Mehretu, Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge Abstract expressionism lives. This American art of the free painted mark has for a long time now been slighted as macho or even imperialist \u2013 but Ethopia-born Mehretu makes it new and makes it urgent. It\u2019s time we saw one of her really big paintings in the Tate Turbine Hall but, meanwhile, this powerful display of intensely knotted and spiralling monoprints was a moving evocation of modern history\u2019s violence and tragedy. A great artist of this century. Read the full review. JJ 16 Glenn Ligon, Istanbul Biennial This installation hosted Istanbul born film-maker Sedat Pakay\u2019s 1970 documentary From Another Place, which followed US writer James Baldwin. We see him wandering the streets, asking what it means to be a black American, a gay man, a writer stalled in Istanbul, where he lived, on and off, for about a decade from 1961. This intimate portrait, the truest and most memorable work in the biennial, was brought here by Ligon, another African-American gay man, who has had Turkish subtitles added to Pakay\u2019s film. He presents it along with his own neon and light works, and two further films he shot himself, following Baldwin\u2019s footsteps around the city. \u201cI am a kind of witness, I suppose,\u201d says Baldwin. At their best, that is what artists are too, however fanciful their inventions. Read the full Biennial review. AS 15 Kiss My Genders, Hayward Gallery, London From Candy Darling on her deathbed to the portraits of Catherine Opie, this exhibition was full of moving and subversive images that revealed the history and importance of transgender art. Luciano Castelli\u2019s self-portraits created in the early 1970s are the visual equivalent of Bowie and Lou Reed. Even earlier, Pierre Molinier shot fantastical self-images in sensual black and white. Their legacy is electric today in video, photography, painting and installation. Art, this proved, is all about ch-ch-changes. Read the full review. JJ 14 Tracey Emin: A Fortnight of Tears, White Cube Bermondsey, London Ghosts walked the echoing spaces of White Cube in Emin\u2019s moving farewell to her mother that mushroomed into a bravura artistic performance. An array of enlarged selfies taken in the insomniac depths of loneliness proved exactly how honest her art is. But what she loves is to paint and mould clay. This show blazed with the power and originality of her gory canvases and colossal bronze bodies enlarged from figures shaped in her hands, their flesh pockmarked with gigantic thumb-marks. Read the full review. JJ 13 The Renaissance Nude, Royal Academy, London Christian martyrs are impaled on trees. Jan Gossaert\u2019s Christ, stripped, awaits his fate, sitting on the cold stone, and wracked with palpable terror. Several Saint Sebastians stand about, pin-up boys oblivious to the arrows that pierce them. A procession of flagellants in a Netherlandish Book of Hours prepare themselves for their hooded tormentors in a scene as erotic as it is devotional. Focusing on 1400-1530, and with works from France, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, this exhibition showed us multiple approaches to the naked human body, bodies as various as the artists who depicted them. In extremis, in flagrante, inflammatory, indecent, idealised, implausible, pagan, mythological, Christian, humanist and abject, this was a jolt to the system. Read the full review. JJ 12 Leonardo: A Life in Drawing, various venues The Royal Collection put on the year\u2019s most democratic blockbuster, starting as a national festival before its home gig and providing a perfectly chosen banquet of the Queen\u2019s unique array of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s drawings of the dissected human body, designs for battles, studies of galloping horses, landscapes, caricatures, deluges ... just an unbeatable survey of the most mind-boggling genius in the story of art. Leonardo has never looked more mysterious, complex and sublime. At Queen\u2019s Galleries at Buckingham Palace and Holyroodhouse (until 15 March), and 10 regional museums. Read the full review. JJ 11 Lee Krasner, Barbican, London This retrospective took us from Krasner\u2019s earliest, highly accomplished student works to the very end, in an elegantly designed exhibition that was filled with surprises and troubles. A chapter-by-chapter retelling of her development opened up in the downstairs spaces at the Barbican where huge canvases, wild scrabblings, flexings and flurries, spatterings and spirallings and draggings upped the ante. Krasner destroyed as much as she made along the way. It was tough to be a woman artist amid the first generation of abstract expressionists, especially one suspicious of a signature style. Krasner kept going, still finding her way, in this exhilarating, indomitable show. Read the full review. AS 10 George Shaw, Holburne Museum, Bath Britain is a run-down estate on the edge of a litter-bin forest in Shaw\u2019s exquisitely melancholic art. Yet his paintings are arrestingly beautiful, perhaps because they feel so true. The watery skies, dark windows and spring buds he records with modeller\u2019s paints have lethal emotional weight. It is always a sad Sunday afternoon in this empty land. He is the unique offspring of Thomas Gainsborough and Giorgio de Chirico. Read the full review. JJ 9 Paula Rego, Milton Keynes Gallery Throughout her career, Rego hasdrawn from her own life, becoming a storyteller and chronicler in paint, pastel, etching needle and words. Her art is filled with coded messages, jealousies and affairs, adulteries and betrayals, longings and losses. Here\u2019s Rego dancing, not once but many times. Here are tragic men and knowing women. Here is repression, here is freedom, the stupid and the unafraid. The women in her art always know more. Her work is all an exorcism. Life, ours as well as hers, courses through it. Read the full review. AS 8 Kara Walker, Tate Modern, London A miserable monument to the slave trade and colonialism, Walker\u2019s Fons Americanus is a 13-metre-high mock-Victorian fountain. Installed in Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall, its subject is imperial ambition, the profiting from misery at the heart of empire, and Walker has filled it with figures and sea creatures, as well as sharks sporting in the spume. Allusions and references abound in this work that\u2019s topped by Venus, throwing her head back and spurting water from her nipples and slashed throat. JMW Turner\u2019s abolitionist 1840 painting The Slave Ship, rendered as a bath-toy frigate, nods to Damien Hirst\u2019s shark in formaldehyde. Fons Americanus is the best Turbine Hall commission in years. Until April. Read the full review. AS 7 Franz West, Tate Modern, London This retrospective took us from dirty drawings rife with sexual encounters to room after room of sculptures, posters, installations and collaborative works West made with friends and accomplices. The heavy emphasis on the Viennese artist\u2019s life was inevitable, given the degree to which personal relationships and collaborations were at the heart of his work. Lumps of polystyrene, old flip-flops, a pile of hats, even his childhood bed and his mother\u2019s old washing machine, which he remade into a kind of love-seat, punctuated this uproarious show. Sometimes his sculptures leant against the wall like drunks, or stood on plinths devised for the exhibition by West\u2019s friend Sarah Lucas, whose contribution enlivened the show no end. West had a real feel for shape, for the lump, for the eccentric. Filled with jokes, visual slapstick, alarming twists and absurd confrontations, this was a show that was as celebratory as it was bleak. Read the full review. AS 6 Tutankhamun, Saatchi Gallery, London This exhibition has haunted my dreams \u2013 it is almost beyond belief to see so many of the wonders from Tutankhamun\u2019s unspoiled tomb in London, from his wooden picnic boxes for afterlife eating to an array of amulets that protected his mummified body. The glitter of gold is just part of their wonder \u2013 along with the blue sheen of faience and the translucent whiteness of calcite. These are finely wrought artistic masterpieces of amazing delicacy and tenderness. You leave not so much awed by the boy king as loving him. On until 3 May. Read the full review. JJ 5 Danh Vo, South London Gallery Accidents of history, chance encounters and collaborations all played their part in the largest UK exhibition to date by the Vietnam-born Danish artist. The relationships Vo developed with the family of Robert McNamara (US Secretary of Defense in the lead up to the Vietnam War) and with photographs surreptitiously shot by Dr Joseph M Carrier (an American counter-insurgency specialist in Vietnam) all play their part. There are lines taken from William Friedkin\u2019s 1973 demonic possession movie The Exorcist, as well as the last letter of a Jesuit missionary written on the day of his execution in Vietnam in 1861. It all contributes to the feeling that there is an ongoing narrative at work. What an engaging, disarming and thoughtful artist Vo is. Read the full review. AS 4 Edvard Munch, British Museum, London The images that Munch dredged from his heart are symbols that lodge themselves deep. This exhibition of his prints plumbed his suffering. It made it horribly clear how his memories were haunted by the deaths of his mother and sister when he was a child and how fraught his relationships with women were \u2013 but above all it surrounded you with his penetrating crystallisations of feeling from vampires and jealous lovers to drowning, mourning, and the great Scream convulsing nature. Read the full review. JJ 3 Bridget Riley, Hayward, London The largest retrospective of her work to be held to date, this still-running exhibition is full of surprises as well as familiar works. Riley\u2019s art is as often dazzling and disorientating as it is spectacular. Some of her paintings are stately in their visual rhythms, while others quiver and flicker as though electrified. The experience of a Riley is never static. All this with a few repeated intervals of black and white, some circles or stripes or blocks and arcs of colour. Travelling to the Hayward from the National Galleries of Scotland, and spanning the artist\u2019s entire career, from drawings she made as a schoolgirl at Cheltenham Ladies College in the 1940s to works completed this year, this is a wonder. Until 26 January. Read the full review. AS 2 Sun &amp; Sea (Marina), Lithuanian Pavilion, Venice Biennale This was the big surprise at Venice and it rightly won a Golden Lion. We looked down from a minstrel\u2019s gallery in an old naval warehouse in the Arsenale on to an indoor beach where kids built sandcastles, tourists sunned themselves, while couples argued and failed to relax. Threat slowly seeps in, like suntan oil, during this almost hour-long opera \u2013 the work of theatre director Rugil\u0117 Barzd\u017eiukait\u0117, playwright Vaiva Grainyt\u0117, and composer Lina Lapelyt\u0117. Beautifully sung by the lounging tourists, this was a lament to the eclipse of the world, as the sky and sea change colour, the reefs bleach and nature dies. Read the full Biennale review. AS 1 Nan Goldin, Marian Goodman Gallery, London This, the first large show of Goldin\u2019s work in the UK in almost two decades, might have been accused of going over old ground.

The British bomb, uncovered by construction workers on 2 November during refurbishment works at a cinema, is believed to have been dropped on the port city in 1941. The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera described the operation as \u201cthe biggest peacetime evacuation in the country\u201d as more than 54,000 inhabitants were forced to leave their homes for several hours on Sunday morning, within a radius of 1,617 metres from where the bomb was found. As part of the operation, the city\u2019s airport, train station, two hospitals and a prison were shut down. More than 200 inmates were moved to the prison in Lecce, 38km away. At about 1pm, authorities confirmed that experts had successfully defused the explosive, which is 1 metre long and contains 40kg of dynamite. Authorities said that on Monday they will take the bomb to a remote location for a controlled explosion. On 1 December, more than 10,000 residents of Turin were evacuated for the defusal of another British bomb from the second world war, dropped on the city more than 70 years ago. Previously, on 19 October, authorities ordered about 4,000 people living near Piazza Verdi in the northern city of Bolzano to leave their homes for several hours after a second world war explosive was discovered in the city centre. Unexploded ordnances are still a problem throughout Italy, especially near the border with Austria, where most of the undiscovered ones are believed to be. In July, the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano reported that at least 10 unexploded bombs dropped by the Allies are still hidden within the foundations of the archaeological site of Pompeii. In August 1943, Allied air forces dropped 165 bombs on Pompeii, in nine different air raids.

For no reason at all, for the sheer subversive mischief and fun of it, and partly also because they are a little bored (arguably the motivation for everything else as well), they do an extraordinarily insouciant dance together in the middle of a caf\u00e9.</p> <p>It\u2019s a dance that naturally challenges the expectations of realism because it looks like what it is: a choreographed number that the three actors have clearly been rehearsing all day, and which they amusingly still haven\u2019t got completely right, but in which they look entirely and cheerfully at ease. Nobody is facing each other, partly in order to preserve the ambiguity of where among them the romantic or sexual connection is to be found. Godard characteristically shoots it from one camera position, with no changes when the three dancers turn their backs to us. But what is easy to forget is that the two men finally wander off, leaving Anna Karina\u2019s Odile dancing on her own, almost childlike, and she finally beams a beguiling and bewitching smile at us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d882fe262f757fdc2ebf9e38760c6463b3398d33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d882fe262f757fdc2ebf9e38760c6463b3398d33/0_240_3744_2246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Karina in Alphaville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Karina in Alphaville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Famously, Godard first noticed Karina when she was a model doing a Palmolive ad, in a bath with soap bubbles all the way up to her shoulders, but her first film with him was the moment his obsession with her began. In Le Petit Soldat (released in 1963) she plays Veronica, a model who entrances Bruno, a French photographer in Geneva during the Algerian war who is doing dirty \u201cblack ops\u201d work for an anti-Algerian government group and who winds up getting tortured and beaten by both sides. The action is suspended for a very Godardian dialogue scenes between this man (Michel Subor) and Karina: she is tellingly compared to a character by the dramatist Jean Giradoux, whose great theme was woman as an unattainable ideal. (It is to Veronica that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y2tb9E9LJk\">Subor utters the famous line</a> about cinema being truth 24 times a second.)</p> <p>The contrast between supposed male intellectualism and female beauty couldn\u2019t be clearer, with Bruno being given a voiceover in which he is allowed to ruminate about culture, politics and society \u2013 and yet now in 2019 it is Karina who looks calmer, clearer and more natural. Perhaps it is actually Godard\u2019s essential incomprehension of Karina, and of women in general, which paradoxically gives her that presence which radiates from the screen. To be fair, Godard did not habitually fetishise Karina\u2019s body as such, in the way he ironically did with Bardot in Le M\u00e9pris. Another famous phrase attributed to Godard is the one about all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun. In human, practical terms Godard was probably utterly naive about both girls and guns, but Karina could survive his naivety and transcend it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdc4c4b751d900e98ed69d80e113abc5812ee6ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdc4c4b751d900e98ed69d80e113abc5812ee6ba/0_176_2495_1496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karina with Marcello Mastroianni in The Stranger, directed by Luchino Visconti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karina with Marcello Mastroianni in The Stranger, directed by Luchino Visconti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/PARAMOUNT/Sportsphoto Ltd.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This idea is amplified, in a way to fascinate and exasperate posterity still further, with Godard\u2019s Une Femme Est une Femme (AKA A Woman Is a Woman), his colour movie in the lighter vein of musical comedy, which places Karina at the centre of an <em>\u00e0 trois</em> romantic set-up which was to be a feature of the New Wave in films such as Bande \u00e0 Part and Truffaut\u2019s Jules et Jim.

There has to be that same element of satire and absurdity in Godard\u2019s 1965 sci-fi conceit Alphaville when Karina\u2019s eerily detached and affectless woman has a relationship with her ostensible lover, Lemmy Caution (played by Eddie Constantine), a meeting of minds (if not of hearts) represented by a eerie prose-poem of words and images in which Karina\u2019s voice and face are a potent ingredient.</p> <p>Some of the films in Karina\u2019s later career perhaps caricatured the stylish and sexy persona she created in this early work with Godard: she was the unstable lover of the expatriate Englishman played by Michael Caine in The Magus in 1968, and was Margot, the younger woman who bewitches Nicol Williamson\u2019s middle-aged man in Laughter in the Dark (1969), directed by Tony Richardson.

Filled with a passion to \u201csave Hong Kong\u201d, many say they are willing to give up their lives to fight for democracy and freedoms in the Chinese-ruled city, where Beijing has been increasingly asserting its political and economic influence.</p> <p>Recent weeks have seen the most violent incidents so far, with thousands more arrested after clashing with police around university campuses after protesters blocked roads and threw molotov cocktails. On Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/15/hong-kong-violence-breaks-out-again-in-shopping-centres\">police made arrests</a> \u2013 including a secondary school girl and a 16-year-old boy \u2013 as small groups of pro-democracy activists targeted some of the city\u2019s shopping centres.</p> <p>Officials said as of 5 December, of the 5,980 people arrested since the movement started in June, 2,383 or 40% were students and 367 of them have been charged. Among them, 939 were under 18, with the youngest being only 11, and 106 have been charged. Suspects have been arrested for a range of offences including rioting, unlawful assembly, assaulting police officers and possessing offensive weapons.</p> <p>Legal experts say Hong Kong law\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal assembly\u201d and \u201crioting\u201d \u2013 defined as an unlawful assembly of three or more people where any person \u201ccommits a breach of the peace\u201d \u2013 is vague and ill-defined.</p> <p>If the authorities hoped arresting young protesters would deter them, it is having the opposite effect.

They were arrested in a protest shortly after others had thrown molotov cocktails \u2013 a scene that would be defined as a \u201criot\u201d under Hong Kong law.</p> <p>They said an incident on 21 July when thugs indiscriminately attacked passengers at the out-of-town metro station while police were nowhere to be seen had led to a breakdown of their trust in the authorities. After that, they went to the frontline of the protests, braving teargas and confrontations with police.</p> <p>The teenagers said the police\u2019s escalating use of force \u2013 including more than 16,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/04/nowhere-is-safe-hong-kong-residents-fearful-of-teargas-poisoning\">canisters of teargas</a>, water cannon, 10,000 rubber bullets and live rounds \u2013 and the authorities\u2019 refusal to investigate police\u2019s abuse of power were what prompted them to take part in the increasingly violent protests. They see protesters\u2019 attacks on riot police as justified because they can no longer trust the police to deliver justice.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t attack unless we\u2019re attacked,\u201d James said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just stand there and not do a thing.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/27/as-hong-kongs-suffers-china-risks-losing-its-financial-window-on-the-world\">As Hong Kong suffers, China risks losing its financial window on the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both boys carried wills when they went out to protest. \u201cI was always scared \u2013 whether I would get shot, get arrested or even lose my life.

      "bodyText": "Twelve-year-old Samuel was arrested one summer evening while trying to flee from riot police at a protest. He was tackled to the ground, sat on and handcuffed by officers and accused of taking part in an illegal assembly. During the arrest, an officer stepped on his hand. In custody, Samuel was terrified. Police found in his bag a gas mask, helmet, spray paint and gloves. Officers shouted at him and called him a \u201cjunior cockroach\u201d, a name used to put down protesters. \u201cI was so frightened and thought they might beat me to death,\u201d he said. It was nearly midnight, several hours after his arrest, when police notified his parents and sent him to a hospital for his injuries. Samuel* is one of tens of thousands of youths who have taken part in Hong Kong\u2019s anti-government movement, now in its sixth month. Filled with a passion to \u201csave Hong Kong\u201d, many say they are willing to give up their lives to fight for democracy and freedoms in the Chinese-ruled city, where Beijing has been increasingly asserting its political and economic influence. Recent weeks have seen the most violent incidents so far, with thousands more arrested after clashing with police around university campuses after protesters blocked roads and threw molotov cocktails. On Sunday police made arrests \u2013 including a secondary school girl and a 16-year-old boy \u2013 as small groups of pro-democracy activists targeted some of the city\u2019s shopping centres. Officials said as of 5 December, of the 5,980 people arrested since the movement started in June, 2,383 or 40% were students and 367 of them have been charged. Among them, 939 were under 18, with the youngest being only 11, and 106 have been charged. Suspects have been arrested for a range of offences including rioting, unlawful assembly, assaulting police officers and possessing offensive weapons. Legal experts say Hong Kong law\u2019s definition of \u201cillegal assembly\u201d and \u201crioting\u201d \u2013 defined as an unlawful assembly of three or more people where any person \u201ccommits a breach of the peace\u201d \u2013 is vague and ill-defined. If the authorities hoped arresting young protesters would deter them, it is having the opposite effect. Samuel, who was released on bail, said his hatred for the police had deepened since his detention. He said he had not participated in violent acts himself but he endorsed other protesters\u2019 actions, including attacks on police officers. \u201cThe police beat protesters like mad. They deserve it,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t hassle me and I don\u2019t hassle you.\u201d Samuel acknowledged that taking part in the increasingly violent movement was risky but insisted he was driven by his love for his home.\u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to do something for Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been scared once already. What else is there to be scared of?\u201d \u2018I want to give all I have to Hong Kong\u2019 Samuel\u2019s sentiments are echoed by other young protesters. James, 13, and Roderick, 16, from elite schools and middle-class families, are among the youngest people to have been charged over the protests. They were arrested in a protest shortly after others had thrown molotov cocktails \u2013 a scene that would be defined as a \u201criot\u201d under Hong Kong law. They said an incident on 21 July when thugs indiscriminately attacked passengers at the out-of-town metro station while police were nowhere to be seen had led to a breakdown of their trust in the authorities. After that, they went to the frontline of the protests, braving teargas and confrontations with police. The teenagers said the police\u2019s escalating use of force \u2013 including more than 16,000 canisters of teargas, water cannon, 10,000 rubber bullets and live rounds \u2013 and the authorities\u2019 refusal to investigate police\u2019s abuse of power were what prompted them to take part in the increasingly violent protests. They see protesters\u2019 attacks on riot police as justified because they can no longer trust the police to deliver justice. \u201cWe don\u2019t attack unless we\u2019re attacked,\u201d James said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just stand there and not do a thing.\u201d Both boys carried wills when they went out to protest. \u201cI was always scared \u2013 whether I would get shot, get arrested or even lose my life. But if we don\u2019t come out because we\u2019re afraid, there would be even fewer people out there,\u201d James said. \u201cI really want to give all I have to Hong Kong,\u201d the 13-year-old said, his eyes welling up in tears. \u201cWhen you pursue freedom, sacrifices are unavoidable. \u201cWe are halfway into the gate of hell. We\u2019ve put our future and career on a line, but it is worth it.\u201d If convicted, James is unlikely to be jailed because of his age, but he risks being sent to a children\u2019s home and having a criminal record. Roderick said the solidarity, unity and mutual support he had experienced were the key attractions of the movement. \u201cTo see young people working towards the same ideal and same goal \u2013 that\u2019s the most beautiful picture I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d At 16, Roderick also faces an uncertain future, but said he would not give up on the goal of democracy for Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s a gamble, but if we don\u2019t even try, we would lose for sure,\u201d he said. Dr Jeffrey Murer, an expert on youth mobilisation at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, said it was often young people\u2019s overwhelming desire to change the world for the better and their profound lack of trust in institutions that prompted them to gamble on their future. \u201cThe social contract has broken down and people feel obligated to defend their rights and identity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese young people have taken on a strong Hong Kong identity and feel the institution is not defending them.\u201d He said the political crisis had also shaken their sense of stability. Their feeling of \u201cno future\u201d and the profound threat to their identity had prompted them to take risks to defend themselves. Stephen Chiu, a sociology professor at the Hong Kong Education University, said ideology and mutual emotional support among young people had sustained their high-risk and high-cost social actions. When they perceived \u201cso much absurdity on the government\u2019s part and the other side is acting excessively, they question why they have to be constrained by their normal moral standards,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a war situation \u2013 they are willing to die for their homeland. There are many examples in history. Whether you agree or not, there is a higher call and the protesters have a set of values some feel it\u2019s worth dying for.\u201d *All of the youths\u2019 names in this article have been changed to protect their identities",

I was still at Leicester and he was at Stoke and I sent him a message saying how sorry I was. If it hadn\u2019t been for the accident he\u2019d have been in the England team for a few more years. He certainly wasn\u2019t past his best. Unfortunately that gave me my England chance a bit earlier than I thought. But Gordon was a fella who got on with things and he went over to the States and, even though he couldn\u2019t see properly out of his bad eye, he could see enough to play at a good level. I think the \u201966 lads got a bit of extra money for winning the World Cup but it was nothing like if they won it now. In the 1960s, and even the 70s and 80s, there was none of the promotional income or anything like that. And all of the \u201966 lads were from that era. But I think football crowds in general were very appreciative \u2013 and quite rightly so \u2013 of what Gordon did, and not just of his football exploits, but of the person he was as well.",

It really was like something out of <em>Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg</em>. I was the editor of the pretentious student magazine <em>Granta</em>, and he\u2019d got a sheaf of papers in his hand which he thrust at me: not aggressively, but certainly not with the timidity that most of us would feel if we offered our poems for publication. In fact, if anyone was timid it was me. Clive was five years older and physically imposing, even though he wasn\u2019t tall.</p> <p>I said I\u2019d read them later. \u201cNo, have a look now.\u201d The top one was called Together, Sleeping Sideways and it started:</p> <p><em>Together, sleeping sideways,</em><br><em>There\u2019s not much they demand:</em><br><em>A knee between </em><em>her knees,</em><br><em>A place to put </em><em>his hand.</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve never seen the discomforts of young sexuality expressed better or more gently; and nowadays I\u2019m prouder of publishing Clive\u2019s writing than of almost anything else I did at university. \u201cAre you going to try to get a job teaching here?\u201d I asked him in our last term. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a waiter, passing round other people\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p> <p>He was wonderfully, dangerously funny. Who was it that said you shouldn\u2019t read his stuff with a hot drink in your hand?

It really was like something out of Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. I was the editor of the pretentious student magazine Granta, and he\u2019d got a sheaf of papers in his hand which he thrust at me: not aggressively, but certainly not with the timidity that most of us would feel if we offered our poems for publication. In fact, if anyone was timid it was me. Clive was five years older and physically imposing, even though he wasn\u2019t tall. I said I\u2019d read them later. \u201cNo, have a look now.\u201d The top one was called Together, Sleeping Sideways and it started: Together, sleeping sideways, There\u2019s not much they demand: A knee between her knees, A place to put his hand. I\u2019ve never seen the discomforts of young sexuality expressed better or more gently; and nowadays I\u2019m prouder of publishing Clive\u2019s writing than of almost anything else I did at university. \u201cAre you going to try to get a job teaching here?\u201d I asked him in our last term. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a waiter, passing round other people\u2019s cooking.\u201d He was wonderfully, dangerously funny. Who was it that said you shouldn\u2019t read his stuff with a hot drink in your hand? Scared and desolate, I went to cover the insanely dangerous civil war in Lebanon only a day after I\u2019d been dumped by a girl I loved.

The roleplaying game she spies on between her parents and a Craigslist Saint Nick involves blackmail, choking and murder but it all works in the end, as she learns \u201cwe all each have our thing \u2026 my kink\u2019s to be watching people\u2019s private lives.\u201d Horan returns and performs the ballad Put a Little Love on Me, then Yang and Johansson play \u201cthe people from the choking poster\u201d \u2013 that is, the couple who served as models for the ubiquitous choking/Heimlich maneuver poster that adorns the wall of seemingly every restaurant bar in the country. Out for dinner, they quickly set upon by a mob of star struck service industry pros. It\u2019s a funny idea, but one that never rises above its premise. Closing out the night, a scattered sketch about a mind-reading device for pets. An adorable pug reveals himself to be a cynical Trump supporter, much to the chagrin of his owner and her co-workers. A retread of the cold open, it peters out pretty quickly even as it drags to a close. The dog is certainly cute, as is a baby pig that pops up at the end, but the reliance on cute animals feels increasingly desperate. This was a solid showing for Johansson, who felt right at home as host. Most of the sketches were funnier in concept than execution but the episode as a whole remained breezy and fun, with a number of solid musical spots and some particularly impressive special effects.",

He\u2019s also thrilled with how the quicks got it done with Hazlewood. A technical change has helped him a lot this year working with Andre Adams at NSW, which has got him into a better head space as well. Will be enjoying a few days off before getting ready for the MCG Boxing Day Test. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df621cb8f085eda5c107fb8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T12:07:38.178Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tim Paine speaks. </strong>Batted well in the first innings to set it up, batting to tea until day to enable bowling under lights. Proud of bowling attack who took 20 wickets with just two seamers and Lyon with part-timers chipping in. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df621878f08c3972263a9e1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T12:06:29.086Z\">12.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kane Williamson speaks. </strong>Challenging against Australia in the heat who were tactically outstanding and made the most of the new ball under lights. They were a long way ahead from there. It\u2019s important we reflect and don\u2019t get too carried away and look for little improvements before the MCG Test. A drastic difference from the Hamilton surface against England but that\u2019s no excuse. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df621028f087e8308e5e68d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T12:05:01.743Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It was a great performance with the ball. </strong>Remember, Hazlewood only bowled eight deliveries in the Test before breaking down. Starc finishes with nine for the mach, Lyon six. It\u2019s a crime that Cummins only collected three - he was equally brilliant. Starc should be player of the match as a result but Labuschagne will probably get the nod. We\u2019ll see. The presentations are coming up shortly. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df61fcf8f08c3972263a9d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T11:59:45.933Z\">11.59am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nathan Lyon speaks. </strong>Clinical performance after losing Hazlewood. Couldn\u2019t ask for a better bowling performance. New Zealand are the number two team in the world so they will bounce back in Melbourne on Boxing Day. \u201cPretty lucky\u201d to get Williamson first ball. Had no idea he was on a hat-trick until Cummins told him. Starc has been working for a long time and is getting the rewards now. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df61f2b8f08c3972263a9c8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T11:56:30.107Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">AUSTRALIA WIN BY 296 RUNS!

Lyon\u2019s turn for a fourth.<br></p> <p>9,334 at the Casino Stadium tonight. That means the most recent Test at the WACA outdrew this on each day (1-4).

Southee takes an agricultural single to pop him straight down the danger end against Cummins. It\u2019s not a nice over to have to play out from around the wicket on one leg. A bit odd they have sent him out to bat? He has a slog at the last ball and misses, but he\u2019s through it. Starc now has a chance at five.<strong> <br></strong></p> <p>I missed this when Wagner was in, but this is quite good.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewFaulkner9/status/1206177242411192322\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Crowd&#39;s chanting `we want Wade&#39;.

They are very happy to have Wagner out there under lights with the game now very much lost for the Black Caps. Of course, Wade was hit many times by Wagner in his gutsy innings. He\u2019s immediately into the Kiwi bowler here as Cummins completes his second successful over on the trot. Oh, and by getting hrough that Wagner is off his King Pair, I should note. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df619a18f08c3972263a9b2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T11:35:54.932Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

He continues to stay the course until the final ball, where he has a wee waft at something well wide of off stump. Leave those alone, Colin. And with that, <strong>they take a drink. </strong>Australia have picked up just one wicket in the two hours I\u2019ve been on the tools.

There won\u2019t be a second new ball tonight but that usually isn\u2019t a problem for Starc with the pink missile, which he usually gets moving. As Mike Hussey points out on TV, there are fielders spread all over the place behind square to de Grandhomme when he gets on strike, Starc banging it in and making life tough but he makes it through.

Once they got on a roll, they\u2019ve dominated Australia really with the ball.

No chance of a left-hander being lbw to a left-armer bowling around the wicket, everything is pitching well outside leg stump. But finally Wagner pitches up and Wade plays a shot, a single away behind square. That brings Cummins on strike, and probably Wagner doesn\u2019t adjust his line to the right-hander well enough, but it gets him a wicket.

And haven\u2019t we had a couple of eventful evening sessions. The Kiwis were knocked over by Australia on the second night of this match, then Australia crashed on the third. The difference is that by that point, Australia were well ahead in the match, so they\u2019re not in much trouble as a result. But it was another top-order collapse, and another low score for Steve Smith.</p> <p>Australia will resume batting this afternoon six wickets down for 167, which sounds bad except they had a 250-run lead on the first innings. So they\u2019re actually 417 ahead already, and the world record run chase is 418, so safe to say New Zealand won\u2019t be running down whatever the nominal target ends up being.</p> <p>The main objective for New Zealand today is to make sure Australia can\u2019t hold out with the bat for two sessions. The Kiwis will want to be at the batting crease for a couple of hours before evening comes, so they have set batsman who can get through that more difficult session. But maybe they don\u2019t want to bowl out Australia <em>too</em> quickly, because that leaves more overs for NZ to face. Hmm, dilemmas. Maybe the ideal for NZ is to bowl really tightly, concede nothing much, but not take the final wicket until right on the lunch break.</p> <p>For Australia, they\u2019ll want to bat past lunch to take daytime overs away from New Zealand. But with only Matthew Wade and the bowlers to bat, that might be a bridge too far. Still, it\u2019s been a nice surface to bat on during the day. Although the cracks are starting to open up.</p> <p>Realistically, New Zealand\u2019s chances of drawing this Test are not much better than their chances of winning it, but they\u2019re a team that refuses to go away. <br></p> </div>   </div>",

Until then, have a happy and safe Christmas. Bye for now! Mitch Starc speaks. He is the player of the match for his match figures of 9/97. He\u2019s also thrilled with how the quicks got it done with Hazlewood. A technical change has helped him a lot this year working with Andre Adams at NSW, which has got him into a better head space as well. Will be enjoying a few days off before getting ready for the MCG Boxing Day Test. Tim Paine speaks. Batted well in the first innings to set it up, batting to tea until day to enable bowling under lights. Proud of bowling attack who took 20 wickets with just two seamers and Lyon with part-timers chipping in. Kane Williamson speaks. Challenging against Australia in the heat who were tactically outstanding and made the most of the new ball under lights. They were a long way ahead from there. It\u2019s important we reflect and don\u2019t get too carried away and look for little improvements before the MCG Test. A drastic difference from the Hamilton surface against England but that\u2019s no excuse. It was a great performance with the ball. Remember, Hazlewood only bowled eight deliveries in the Test before breaking down. Starc finishes with nine for the mach, Lyon six. It\u2019s a crime that Cummins only collected three - he was equally brilliant. Starc should be player of the match as a result but Labuschagne will probably get the nod. We\u2019ll see. The presentations are coming up shortly. Nathan Lyon speaks. Clinical performance after losing Hazlewood. Couldn\u2019t ask for a better bowling performance. New Zealand are the number two team in the world so they will bounce back in Melbourne on Boxing Day. \u201cPretty lucky\u201d to get Williamson first ball. Had no idea he was on a hat-trick until Cummins told him. Starc has been working for a long time and is getting the rewards now. There it is! Around the wicket, Southee edges gently into the hands of Smith at slip. Lyon finishes with 4/63. Australia go one-nil up. 65th over: New Zealand 171-9 (Southee 4, Ferguson 1) Starc to Southee from around the wicket and he adds four to the Kiwi total, albeit off his pads for leg byes. The next is a yorker, turned away out of the blockhole. Ferguson\u2019s turn with three to face. Better still: he gets off the mark with one to point, Southee keeping the strike with a single of his own in that direction. Lyon\u2019s turn for a fourth. 9,334 at the Casino Stadium tonight. That means the most recent Test at the WACA outdrew this on each day (1-4). Not good. 64th over: New Zealand 164-9 (Southee 2, Ferguson 0) Ferguson is batting despite the fact that he has a calf injury, which ruled him out of bowling from the first afternoon. Southee takes an agricultural single to pop him straight down the danger end against Cummins. It\u2019s not a nice over to have to play out from around the wicket on one leg. A bit odd they have sent him out to bat? He has a slog at the last ball and misses, but he\u2019s through it. Starc now has a chance at five. I missed this when Wagner was in, but this is quite good. One to go! Wagner\u2019s stay was an entertaining one, somehow managing to get a leading edge over third man for six. But Starc had the last laugh, winning a conventional outside edge from around the wicket, safely into the gloves of Paine. He has 4/42. 63rd over: New Zealand 163-9 (Southee 1) 62nd over: New Zealand 154-8 (Southee 0, Wagner 0) Matthew Wade is enjoying being, well, Matthew Wade. They are very happy to have Wagner out there under lights with the game now very much lost for the Black Caps. Of course, Wade was hit many times by Wagner in his gutsy innings. He\u2019s immediately into the Kiwi bowler here as Cummins completes his second successful over on the trot. Oh, and by getting hrough that Wagner is off his King Pair, I should note. Cummins gets another! 20 wickets now in the Test have now fallen to the short ball and what a short ball this is. Santner had little no chance of getting out of the way, such was the brutal bounce. With both feet off the air, he deflected to Travis Head under the lid. PAINE REVIEWS CORRECTLY! There\u2019s a mark on the hotspot and a spike on the snicko. Watling deserved a half-century but falls ten runs short. Starc has three. Australia should win this tonight. 61st over: New Zealand 154-7 (Santner 0) PAINE GOES UPSTAIRS! Starc was appealing for caught behind down the legside - did Watling glove it? Umpire Llong says no. We\u2019ll see. 60th over: New Zealand 154-6 (Watling 40, Santner 0) How will Santner go here? He usually plays his shots, might that be the best way for him to get the Black Caps to the close? Gee, he can\u2019t have a dip at the short one to finish - it\u2019s a brute of a thing that smashes into his shoulder. Ouch. The end of an outstanding Cummins over. Cummins is back into the attack and strikes third ball of his spell! It\u2019s a super bit of bowling from around the wicket, winning the edge of de Grandhomme with a ball he had to play at. Smith does the rest, claiming a sharp catch low to the turf. Four to go. He earned that. 59th over: New Zealand 152-5 (Watling 39, de Grandhomme 33) Starc again to CDG, a match-up they like. But he isn\u2019t taking the bouncer on, getting underneath it instead. He leaves the next one up there too - good batting. He continues to stay the course until the final ball, where he has a wee waft at something well wide of off stump. Leave those alone, Colin. And with that, they take a drink. Australia have picked up just one wicket in the two hours I\u2019ve been on the tools. They have 16 overs left to bowl tonight. \u201cIt will be hard work to get it done tonight,\u201d agrees Wade, interviewed on TV during the break. 58th over: New Zealand 152-5 (Watling 39, de Grandhomme 33) Oooh, another edge from around the wicket for Lyon, Watling deflecting the ball to where second slip would be if one were in position. As they note on commentary, is there anything lost by having a second catcher there given he\u2019s coming from that angle? 57th over: New Zealand 148-5 (Watling 36, de Grandhomme 32) The crowd give Starc a big cheer as he returns to the attack. It\u2019s been two hours since he last bowled, so he should be fresh for this stint. There won\u2019t be a second new ball tonight but that usually isn\u2019t a problem for Starc with the pink missile, which he usually gets moving. As Mike Hussey points out on TV, there are fielders spread all over the place behind square to de Grandhomme when he gets on strike, Starc banging it in and making life tough but he makes it through. These two have now put on 50. There are 18 overs left tonight. 56th over: New Zealand 146-5 (Watling 36, de Grandhomme 31) Lyon\u2019s biggest weapon right now is bounce rather than turn. He gets one to lift big, Paine just getting his gloves up in time. Other than that, Watling has a plan and he\u2019s sticking to it - using the crease well. 55th over: New Zealand 144-5 (Watling 34, de Grandhomme 31) Shot. de Grandhomme jumps across his stumps to work Head with the spin down to the fine leg rope. A shot that is harder than it looks, especially with men around the bat catching. He defends the rest. 54th over: New Zealand 140-5 (Watling 34, de Grandhomme 27) It\u2019s not drifting - they\u2019re both giving it a rip and creating. When de Grandhomme is beaten here it prompts a shout for lbw. But, on the whole, the relatively set New Zealand pair are handling this well. 53rd over: New Zealand 138-5 (Watling 33, de Grandhomme 26) Head to replace Labuschagne, which isn\u2019t a bad shout given how much turn he was generating before the tea interval. He\u2019s certainly giving it a rip, so de Grandhomme plays him watchfully. 52nd over: New Zealand 136-5 (Watling 32, de Grandhomme 25) Around the wicket, Lyon finds two outside edges in a row... the second dropped by Smith at slip! It went quick to his left off Watling\u2019s bat but you don\u2019t expect to see a catcher of his ability put anything down. The other mitigating factor, as Mark Waugh notes, is that he would have seen it late from that angle due to Paine\u2019s gloves. I should note that earlier in the over, Neser put in a superb dive, stop and throw. Before this summer is over, he must have a baggy green. 51st over: New Zealand 132-5 (Watling 28, de Grandhomme 25) I do like Labuschagne\u2019s style, racing through his overs like Ravi Jadeja. 50th over: New Zealand 130-5 (Watling 28, de Grandhomme 23) \u201cA classic in-out field,\u201d says Michael Hussey of the plan to de Grandhomme with Lyon in operation: four catchers in close, three boundary-riders waiting for another hoick. But there\u2019s nothing for anyone here despite how well the off-spinner is landing them. On Aleem Dar, I have a note from Greg Mason. \u201cSurely there should be a maximum number of successful reviews before the umpire is sent off and swapped for better one?\u201d Enormous respect for his long and committed service. But it\u2019s probably time that Aleem was replaced on the elite panel. 49th over: New Zealand 129-5 (Watling 28, de Grandhomme 22) Labuschagne replaces Cummins, who needs a breather. Quite right. de Grandhomme collects three first up from a half-tracker but the spinner is right on the mark with his topspinners to Watling, bringing those cracks into play more than the footmarks. 48th over: New Zealand 126-5 (Watling 28, de Grandhomme 19) It\u2019s such a bad decision from Aleem Dar. Paine barely appealed; his finger went up with him. de Grandhomme gets off strike with one into the on side after the reprieve, so to speak. Watling does the rest. ALEEM DAR HAS GIVEN DE GRANDHOMME OUT. It isn\u2019t out. He reviews right away. A massive gap; I can\u2019t believe he gave it. 47th over: New Zealand 125-5 (Watling 28, de Grandhomme 18) Cummins searching for those cracks, doing it at pace. Watling in response doing as he has thoughout, defending with soft hands and getting out the way whenever he can. Cummins 16-5-28-0. 46th over: New Zealand 123-5 (Watling 27, de Grandhomme 17) de Grandhomme has showed plenty of patience against Lyon since hitting his second ball for six... that is, until, he finishes this over with a one-handed smash over square leg. It\u2019s safe and four but deserves to be neither on aesthetic grounds. He\u2019s still there! 45th over: New Zealand 119-5 (Watling 27, de Grandhomme 13) Some chaos to begin, de Grandhomme losing the ball after dealing with a biting short one. Leaving his ground, Wade races in and tries to back-heel the ball onto the stumps. Fair to say it was no Mo Salah from yesterday... what a ridiculous goal that was. They both were. 44th over: New Zealand 117-5 (Watling 27, de Grandhomme 12) It was Smith\u2019s fault that they didn\u2019t review the caught behind off Lyon in the previous over, insistent that it was pad not bat, the stump mic reveals. Watling is far more assured against him this time around, blunting the spin time and again off the front foot. 43rd over: New Zealand 116-5 (Watling 27, de Grandhomme 11) How is it possible that Cummins has one wicket in this match? In a way, I wish he had none so it could beat McGrath\u2019s effort at Melbourne in 2000, which I have previously written of as being the best pair of none-fas in Test Cricket. This time around he smacks CDG on the thigh pad early in the over before nearly hitting him in the helmet with an accurate short one. The big boy keeps his cool though, steering a square drive out to deep point for three. In doing so, he brings up his 1000th run in Test cricket. With a batting average above 40 and a bowling mark under 30, he\u2019s a legitimate Test all-rounder. 42nd over: New Zealand 113-5 (Watling 27, de Grandhomme 8) For once, Paine doesn\u2019t review... on a delivery that found the edge and was out! A lovely piece of bowling from Lyon who had Watling on the front foot, lunging. Paine took it expertly and appealed. But when the decision didn\u2019t go his way, he didn\u2019t send it upstairs. Dear me. 41st over: New Zealand 108-5 (Watling 23, de Grandhomme 7) Cummins hasn\u2019t picked up a wicket today but could easily run through this New Zealand lower order. He gets an early look at de Grandhomme and beats his inside edge, before finding it with his next delivery. Watling does well to clip a couple to finish. It\u2019s on. 40th over: New Zealand 104-5 (Watling 20, de Grandhomme 6) And second ball, de Grandhomme HITS LYON FOR SIX! As you do. Dance, swing, connect. Over long-on, have that. The players are back on the field. There are 35.2 overs left on this fourth day, which will take Australia the full 150 minutes. Then an extra half an hour at their disposal to finish the match tonight, which can be taken by the umpires if they see fit. Lyon to de Grandhomme, the new man, to complete his successful over. PLAY! Interesting. Tidy take. That\u2019s out. Nicholls was a long way forward and ball did hit his pad, but it flicked the back of his bat too before looping to Head. The South Australian did really well to get his right hand under it at silly point. A classic off-spinners\u2019 wicket. Lyon has three. And that\u2019s tea. NICHOLLS GIVEN OUT CAUGHT AT SILLY POINT! He\u2019s reviewing it. 39th over: New Zealand 97-4 (Nicholls 21, Watling 19) Labuschagne around the wicket to Nicholls, as wide of the crease is is legal. Paine and co continue to work him over for not generating much spin but he might not need to if he can land it in the footmarks there for him courtesy of at Pat Cummins. Not so on this occasion, the left-hander taking a couple to cover then two more off his pads. One over to go. 38th over: New Zealand 93-4 (Nicholls 17, Watling 19) Nathan Lyon is back for a brief burst before tea and it\u2019s a lovely over too, Watling having to deal with tons of turn then one that doesn\u2019t spin - possibly hitting a crack? - beating his outside edge with a lot of bounce. When Lyon has his tail up late in a Test match he\u2019s such a different bowler. 37th over: New Zealand 93-4 (Nicholls 17, Watling 19) This pair have done well to calm things down across this fourth hour. As Ian Smith says on telly, the job is to now get this to a fifth day. They are going to lose, sure, but if they can make Cummins and Starc work tomorrow in the heat instead of resting, that\u2019s not completely for nothing. 36th over: New Zealand 92-4 (Nicholls 17, Watling 18) Paine is having a lot of fun out there, comparing Labuschagne\u2019s over to Kerry O\u2019Keeffe on the basis of how little legspin he was generating. Now they have turned the stump mics up to head his commentary on Head\u2019s fresh over. Nicholls shows a bit more purpose at him this time, coming down the track to clip - albeit not that convincingly - through midwicket for a couple. That\u2019s the second time they\u2019ve had an over of stump mics only without the captain saying an awful lot. 35th over: New Zealand 89-4 (Nicholls 15, Watling 17) Marnus to join Head as the other part-time spin option Paine has at his disposal. As Hussey says on commentary, it\u2019s clever captaincy as it gives his two fast bowlers a chance to get a longer rest before they are called upon in the final session for what will be a 150-minute shift. A good over, too; Labuschagne\u2019s leggies are dealt with respectfully by Watling. 34th over: New Zealand 86-4 (Nicholls 14, Watling 15) \u201cOoh! Tim May!\u201d Paine likes Head\u2019s turn an awful lot, comparing him to the fine South Australian offie. Fair enough too when beating Nicholls\u2019 bat a couple of times this over with deliveries that rip a long way. Like it. 33rd over: New Zealand 86-4 (Nicholls 14, Watling 15) Watling\u2019s turn for the Cummins interrogation and he\u2019s up to the task, ducking when he can, playing with soft hands when he must. Fine batting. Surely, in the Perth heat, this spell won\u2019t last that many more overs? 32nd over: New Zealand 86-4 (Nicholls 14, Watling 15) Head on for his first bowl this Test summer. Speaking of nicknames: \u201cGet us one here, Empty.\u201d Good work from the captain. Not a bad over either from the part-timer who was probably a bit more than a part-timer a few years ago when he was a regular in the ODI team, finding his length by the end of the over and skidding onto Nicholls pad from around the wicket with his final ball. There\u2019s a big shout - and it is going on to hit the stumps - but there\u2019s a big inside edge, too. 31st over: New Zealand 82-4 (Nicholls 11, Watling 14) More of the same, Cummins hammering in wide of the crease, making life tough every ball. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better than this,\u201d says Vaughan of the big quick when they break his action into a slow-motion video. 30th over: New Zealand 81-4 (Nicholls 10, Watling 14) Well, that backfired on the host broadcaster. They decided to turn the stump mics up for the Lyon over and go silent on commentary. But after the first ball was driven off the back foot for four - a lovely shot by Watling - the Australians didn\u2019t say anything for the duration. 29th over: New Zealand 77-4 (Nicholls 10, Watling 10) It\u2019s a crime that Cummins hasn\u2019t a wicket to his name in this session. He\u2019s been magnificent. Much as it was that afternoon in Manchester when he could not have bowled any better, his colleagues cleaning Englnd up at the other end. This time around, he does find Nicholls edge - a genuine one too - but due to the pitch, it doesn\u2019t carry. Mark Waugh is still very grumpy that Starc didn\u2019t play more in the Ashes. \u201cHe woulda knocked over Jack Leach.\u201d Everyone seen this? 28th over: New Zealand 75-4 (Nicholls 8, Watling 10) Lyon is very close to Nicholls\u2019 off-stump first up with one that goes straight on and misses everything. Quality cat and mouse contest between these two, the spinner mixing up his pace but on the same good length. 27th over: New Zealand 74-4 (Nicholls 7, Watling 10) As we see so often after a blow to the head with the next delivery, it directed outside the off-stump and wafted at. To be fair, it did plenty. There\u2019s a lot going on out there now. Watling does well to defend the last couple with a nice, straight blade. Gutsy batting. \u201cMorning all.\u201d Morning, David Kalucy. \u201cLoving the contest and the day night element. Though it may not be traditional it is definitely a Test and that\u2019s the point really, plus the poor cousins in Europe get to \u201cwatch\u201d in real time.\u201d I must admit, there couldn\u2019t be a better week for me to get used to watching/OBOing this Australian team from London than a Perth day-nighter. Most civilised. Less so when we get to the MCG and Sydney Tests, as I broke to my very-pregnant girlfriend last night. Oh, and not traditional, you say? \u2018Tis the season... Phwoooooar! Off a length and off a crack, Cummins seams back into the grille of Watling\u2019s helmet. He\u2019s fine, immediately giving the thumbs up. But that\u2019s brutal. We saw last year at the Casino Stadium that this pitch can really go up and down later and it certainly is here. Nothing strictly wrong with that, by the way. \u201cHe\u2019ll fight,\u201d Vaughan says of Watling, as they bring out a new helmet for him. There is a long delay as the doctors go through their assessments. 26th over: New Zealand 70-4 (Nicholls 7, Watling 6) Lyon is too short to Nicholls early and the left-hander makes no mistake, crunching a pull shot into the gap. He\u2019s right back on it after that, bringing the batsman forward with ample flight. For what little it is worth, the requirement for New Zealand is now under 400. Did I hear a new nickname for Starc before drinks, by the way? Let\u2019s keep on that. Six to go. A pretty simple equation for Australia after yet another productive hour. If you go back to the first innings at Adelaide, Lyon was having a tough time of it. Now, after a couple of excellent spells, both to finish the Pakistan series and here against New Zealand, he looks every chance to do a lot of damage here. He\u2019s a Confidence Man, make no mistake. You know the drill: let\u2019s chat. 25th over: New Zealand 66-4 (Nicholls 3, Watling 6) Starc\u2019s up-down bowling continues: twice he bowls too far onto the pads. Nicholls flicks him for three, Watling for four. Then an over-correction lets Watling drive through cover for two. Nine from the over. I don\u2019t think Australia will be sweating it much. Drinks break. I\u2019m out, Adam Collins will be driving you home. If The Cars were wondering. 24th over: New Zealand 57-4 (Nicholls 0, Watling 0) A wicket-maiden for Lyon, with Watling now joining Nicholls. This match could be over today. New Zealand still trail by 411 runs. Lyon to Latham, and keeps tying him in knots. Latham hangs on the back foot while trying to play across the line. Lyon doesn\u2019t turn that one much, and it angles in from around the wicket and hits Latham on the back leg. Latham knows he\u2019s in trouble, looking up at Aleem Dar, who says not out. It\u2019s not a bad call, because that ball could be angling down leg. The Australians aren\u2019t convinced and take a long time to review. But eventually with a shrug Tim Paine decides to have a look, and the tracking shows full impact on leg stump. Latham\u2019s trial is over. 23rd over: New Zealand 57-3 (Latham 18, Nicholls 0) Starc is up to seven wickets in the match. Henry Nicholls the next in, who\u2019s been in good touch recently in Test cricket. The short ball plan! It worked for New Zealand, now it\u2019s working for Australia. Mitchell Starc again, he\u2019s unstoppable in this match. Starc telegraphs his mode of attack with his field. Taylor wants to take him on. Nails a pull shot that deserves four but Wade fields it brilliantly at midwicket to stop any run. Then Taylor tries again, premeditated, against a ball that doesn\u2019t get up and is angling across him, and can only nick it outside his off stump. Poor shot, good plan. 22nd over: New Zealand 57-2 (Latham 18, Taylor 22) Lyon is due for a wicket before long. Latham tries a huge swat at him, just gets a bottom edge into his pads. Lyon gets another ball to leap, and Latham fends it away for a single behind point. Then Ross Taylor tries a reverse sweep, with a slip in position, and bottom-edges it into the ground. 21st over: New Zealand 55-2 (Latham 17, Taylor 21) Mitchell Starc on to replace Cummins. This is the peril of the three-man bowling attack. New Zealand have survived Cummins\u2019 brilliant spell, though it was short. They\u2019ll have one from Starc, then perhaps another few Cummins overs. After that, Australia will have to go to Labuschagne or Wade or even David Warner to partner Lyon. From there, life becomes more possible for NZ. Starc can\u2019t do what Cummins did though: he gets too full to Taylor, who clouts a bottom-handed cover drive for four, then a more controlled one for three. Then the wrong line to Latham, who can work a brace and then a single off the pads. 20th over: New Zealand 49-2 (Latham 14, Taylor 18) Latham is suddenly a cat on a hot tin roof against Lyon. Comes down to try to get to the pitch and nearly gets stumped, having to half fall over to kick the ball away. Nearly endures a raucous appeal for leg before but Latham got an edge on it. Then Lyon bowls a gimme, short and wide, and Latham isn\u2019t clear enough in his mind to hit it properly, only limping it away to point for a dot ball. Watch this space. 19th over: New Zealand 49-2 (Latham 14, Taylor 18) Cummins won\u2019t quit. Gets a full over at Taylor, seven balls in fact with a bouncer wided for height. Taylor scores two with a leg-side push, but aside from that Cummins is around his outside edge non-stop. 18th over: New Zealand 46-2 (Latham 14, Taylor 16) Is Paine calling Lyon by \u2018Gareth\u2019 now? Can\u2019t keep up. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t gonna play that Gazza,\u201d trills Paine as Ross Taylor lunges late to smother a ball outside off. Taylor responds by taking a knee to wallop Lyon through square leg for four. Deep backward square goes in front of square in the deep. Taylor reaches well outside off stump to drag a sweep shot to that man for a single. 17th over: New Zealand 41-2 (Latham 14, Taylor 11) Cummins keeps asking questions, targeting Latham\u2019s inside edge to force defence to the on side, then outside edge to defend to gully. A bouncer makes Latham dip under it, a full ball takes an inside edge into pad. Then back to his natural length and it just beats the outside edge! What a spell this is. 16th over: New Zealand 41-2 (Latham 14, Taylor 11) Lyon getting the ball to jump and turn into Taylor as it did to dismiss Williamson. It is truly impressive just how many nicknames Tim Paine can get through for Lyon in a single over. Goat, Gazza, Garry, Nath, Goaty, Gaz, Gazbo, Lyno. Ever encouraging, and even when Taylor clouts a one-bounce four into a vacant midwicket, Paine says \u201cOh yes, love that Gaz!\u201d 15th over: New Zealand 35-2 (Latham 13, Taylor 6) Cummins bowled a perfect over last time, and this one\u2019s pretty good as well. Moving the ball just a little bit both ways, never far from the stumps. Tries Taylor with a shorter one, and gets a glove on the pull, but it lands safely for a run. 14th over: New Zealand 34-2 (Latham 13, Taylor 5) Latham may get away from Cummins for three balls, but now he has Lyon for six. The off-spinner has a ball skipping on nicely with the arm from around the wicket to the lefty, just past off stump. Latham defends most of the over, then cuts two when Lyon gets too short. 13th over: New Zealand 32-2 (Latham 11, Taylor 5) Cummins with the ball after the break, and he wastes no time against Latham. First beats the outside edge and flicks a bit of trouser fabric on the way through. An umpire could easily mishear that and pull the trigger, but Nigel Llong gets it right. Then again, as Cummins cuts the ball sharply back into Latham and hits him in front of middle, but going over with the bounce. Not out. Latham manages to escape the examination with an inside edge to midwicket. The result from here should be a formality, it\u2019s just a question of how hard New Zealand can fight. With Australia a bowler down the batsmen are still a chance of making life difficult for the Aussies, but they haven\u2019t done it yet. Two NZ wickets fell in that session after three Australians were dismissed and the home team declared at nine down. A full session of daylight batting is yet to come, and Latham and Taylor have to make the most of it to bed themselves in. 12th over: New Zealand 31-2 (Latham 10, Taylor 5) Lyon with the last over before lunch. Taylor drives inside-out between mid-off and cover, through for a run. Left-hander on strike. Slip, short leg, midwicket is open. Deep square leg out there. Lyon drops short though and Latham cuts for two, splitting the field. Latham gets a run to mid-on, then Taylor dances outside his off stump to kick away the last ball of the session. 11th over: New Zealand 27-2 (Latham 7, Taylor 4) Lots of field switching. Starc is bowling left-arm around the wicket to the left-handed Latham, presumably looking to create a really sharp angle across him, but is coming over the wicket to the right-handed Taylor. Midwicket, deep square, short leg, leg slip, fine leg. Very much the leg theory field. Pull up to my bumper, baby. Taylor spars at a ball on his hip but misses and gets a leg bye off the thigh pad. 10th over: New Zealand 25-2 (Latham 6, Taylor 4) Well, what a bonus. Paine will have to conserve Starc and Cummins, so he would have been bringing on Lyon early to get his fast bowlers operating at the other end for a while before having to turn to a part-timer. Getting the wicket of Kane Williamson first ball of that Lyon over is a lottery-win bonus. Ross Taylor survives the hat-trick ball, then thwacks Lyon away through third man for four. It\u2019s Nathan Lyon time! First ball of the innings for him and he picks up the biggest wicket of all! Kane Williamson is gone, gloving to short leg. Lyon lands his first ball perfectly, in a footmark outside off stump. It spits, bounces, turns, and Williamson is initally looking to turn it away but only ends up flinching, trying to control it somehow, and can\u2019t do it. Simple catch for Wade. Lyon is on a hat-trick, having taken the last wicket of the first innings. 9th over: New Zealand 21-1 (Latham 6, Williamson 14) Swing for Starc, beating Latham\u2019s edge outside off. The cordon all go up, but Starc just points to his ear and says he didn\u2019t hear anything. Quite so, there\u2019s daylight between bat and ball. Latham quietly sees out the over. He\u2019s 6 from 26 balls. 8th over: New Zealand 21-1 (Latham 6, Williamson 14) Latham manages to scrap another run, off the pads against Cummins. They\u2019re hard won today for Latham. But Williamson, as if to rub it in, flows into a square drive against Cummins for four! Three boundaries already. 7th over: New Zealand 16-1 (Latham 5, Williamson 10) The New Zealand captain starts with a bang! Well, more a caress really, as Williamson eases away back-to-back boundaries to deep backward square from Starc\u2019s full and straight deliveries. Then reaches out for a brace behind point. After the way his teammates have struggled through half a dozen overs. Different player, different pitch, different gravy. That\u2019s what Starc\u2019s bounce can do. A miserable Test for Raval comes to an end, as the bowler gets lift and it takes the shoulder of the bat and flies out to point where Lyon is waiting. Pace and bounce. At least Raval has batted for a few overs this time, but his score matches what he made in the first innings. 6th over: New Zealand 6-0 (Raval 1, Latham 5) Cummins to Latham, another maiden, though there\u2019s a moment of interest when Latham flicks a ball that hits Travis Head on the shins at short leg. No time for the fielder to react there. 5th over: New Zealand 6-0 (Raval 1, Latham 5) There\u2019s a run at last, as Latham stabs off his pads against Starc. A short leg waits for a catch, along with three slips and a gully. Raval opens the face nicely against Starc on the off stump, playing the ball on the bounce, but just too fine to get past third slip. Starc is left-arm over the wicket to these left-handers, and chanelling it nicely just outside the off stump. Plenty of chat from Matthew Wade spurring his teammates on, you can hear his voice ringing around the ground almost every ball. Five more scoreless deliveries for Raval. 4th over: New Zealand 5-0 (Raval 1, Latham 4) Cummins comes around the wicket with a left-handed pair at the crease, and gets a whole over at Raval. The bowler does the disciplined thing, working away at off stump, but Raval defends and leaves competently. NZ haven\u2019t scored since the first over. 3rd over: New Zealand 5-0 (Raval 1, Latham 4) Starc hits a crack and the ball flies laterally! It jags sharply away from Latham\u2019s edge, beats the bat by a mile. Very little risk of hitting those, plenty of risk if the ball is at the stumps, like the one that got Dawid Malan at the WACA in 2017. Latham faces out a maiden. 2nd over: New Zealand 5-0 (Raval 1, Latham 4) A big appeal as Cummins hits Raval on the thigh pad and it lobs to slip. There was no bat on that, says the umpire, and the Australians belatedly agree. Raval leaves most of the over, though plays at one that\u2019s too close to the edge for comfort. Still, even getting through the first couple of overs might feel like a win for a batsman under siege like him. Time to breathe, regroup, face the next. 1st over: New Zealand 5-0 (Raval 1, Latham 4) Mitchell Starc to start, and he has the pink ball swinging straight away, into the left-handed Raval. This opening pair made one run between them in the first innings. Raval equals that by stabbing a ball off his pads behind square leg and shouting \u201cYes, Tom!\u201d Through they come. Tom Latham gets off the mark in rather more authoritative fashion, on-driving straight of the diving fielder. Lovely. New Zealand trail by 463. Or two days to bat for a draw. Neither a very likely task. With Starc and his boundary-hitting one, Australia decide not to risk Josh Hazlewood with the bat, and Lyon runs off alongside Starc after the wicket falls. Five and a half sessions left in the Test match. Australia are obviously likely to win, because even if Starc and Cummins tire they\u2019ll have Lyon to bowl on a wicket that did plenty for him at his first attempt. But even if New Zealand lose here, they\u2019ll get some encouragement out of how they\u2019ve bowled in the second innings here. Once they got on a roll, they\u2019ve dominated Australia really with the ball. A similar story to 2015: they\u2019ve started to compete after being blown out of the water early, and that disparity may be the decisive one in this series result. Wagner ends with 3-59 to go with his 4-92 in the first innings. He\u2019s bowled an incredible 60 overs, most of it short and hostile, in Perth\u2019s heat. He should be on a drip until Boxing Day. Southee followed 4-93 in the first innings with 5-69 in the second, bowling 51 overs. And Colin de Grandhomme bowled 39 overs while picking up two wickets and going at well under three runs per over. It\u2019s been a commendable performance from a group of bowlers who lost a teammate to injury on the first day. Australia will be on to bowl without Josh Hazlewood in just a minute. Starc goes down swinging, as is his way. Outside off from Southee, back of a length, a big top edge to almost a short third man position where Ross Taylor is waiting. Simple catch. Five wickets for Southee at a cost of 69 runs. 69th over: Australia 217-8 (Starc 23, Lyon 0) 68th over: Australia 211-8 (Starc 18, Lyon 0) Well, Starc has his go at Southee with the ball as well as verbally now, slamming a shot back that hits the bowler in his follow-through. Hit Southee on the leg but it probably saved four runs, so he may not be too unhappy. Starc slams another one, he\u2019s really lining up the fielders at the moment, and cover can only make a half stop as that ball whistled towards him. One run from the spillover, the only score from the set. 67th over: Australia 210-8 (Starc 17, Lyon 0) Wagner to Starc makes it easy for him first up, a full toss that Starc can swing down the ground for four. Wagner gets back to his usual length, but Starc shows his teammates how it\u2019s done and powers a pull shot away for another! Then a glance off the pads for one, in the air but safe behind square, and Lyon uses his thigh pad in lieu of a bat to deflect a ball to the fine leg fence. \u201cHas he played a shot?\u201d asks Wagner incredulously of Umpire Lalalalallong. Starc meanwhile at the non-striker\u2019s end is in the umpire\u2019s ear complaining about Tim Southee for something or other. 66th over: Australia 197-8 (Starc 8, Lyon 0) Change in the bowling, Tim Southee for the first time today. Starc only knows one way, so he drives Southee aerially straight down the ground for a one-bounce four. 65th over: Australia 192-8 (Starc 3, Lyon 0) Vision from the dressing room shows Josh Hazlewood padded up, so he will bat despite his hamstring twinge. Australia must want to go as late in the day as possible, even if that only means a couple more overs. JH has played a few long supporting innings in his time. Starc versus Wagner is only going to have one approach, lots of short stuff with two bat-pads either side of the wicket, a yorker slipped in amongst it to test him, and eventually an attempted pull shot that limps away for a triplet of runs. 64th over: Australia 189-8 (Starc 0, Lyon 0) Nathan Lyon comes out to join Mitchell Starc, and survives the last ball of de Grandhomme\u2019s over. Another catch off the pull shot! After all that time being tenderised by Wagner, facing de Grandhomme must have felt like a holiday. Wade nails a cover drive for four, carves a wider ball over backward point off the top edge for another, then goes to the well once too often when he gets a half-short ball and spins around for a slap at it. Raval is two-third of the way to the fence and he catches the ball low down while running in. A strange old dismissal, to refuse the shot against Wagner so assiduously and then play it near the end of an already productive over against someone else. 63rd over: Australia 180-7 (Wade 9) Wade is setting up so defensively in his mindset that when Wagner slips and bowls him a high full toss, Wade can only pat it back to the bowler. Wagner tries a knuckle ball and Wade ducks and lets it hit him on the thigh. No chance of a left-hander being lbw to a left-armer bowling around the wicket, everything is pitching well outside leg stump. But finally Wagner pitches up and Wade plays a shot, a single away behind square. That brings Cummins on strike, and probably Wagner doesn\u2019t adjust his line to the right-hander well enough, but it gets him a wicket. Short down the leg side and Cummins gloves his attempted glance through to the keeper. Must be a solid blow to the hand because he\u2019s looking a bit ginger with his right hand as he comes off. 62nd over: Australia 179-6 (Wade 8, Cummins 13) But while Wade is pursuing his austerity project, Cummins does the scoring at the other end. First he glances de Grandhomme to the fine leg fence, then cuts him through cover for four more! Two bad balls from Colin, who must be aching and creaking after a big bowling workload through the last four days. He\u2019s bowled on each of them. 61st over: Australia 171-6 (Wade 8, Cummins 5) The meat-tenderiser approach continues, Wagner bowling short and Wade taking the hits rather than using the bat. Ricky Ponting is hopping into him on the telly, asking why he isn\u2019t trying to score from these short balls to protect his body. Which seems a touch unfair: once you\u2019ve watched four or five teammates get out doing exactly that, it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion that you should stop playing cross-bat shots. 60th over: Australia 171-6 (Wade 8, Cummins 5) A good battle shaping between Cummins and de Grandhomme. First ball, hits the pad and the bowler appeals but there\u2019s an inside edge. Second ball, looking for the pads again and Cummins drives gloriously through wide mid-on for two! Just timing, that is a top quality shot, though it gets hauled back. Third ball, squares him up and beats the outside edge. 59th over: Australia 169-6 (Wade 8, Cummins 3) Wagner to Wade, who is hit on the glove and that hurts! Wade is a tough character, he stood there and took half a dozen hits on the body last night when the Kiwis were bouncing him and he wanted to preserve his wicket. But this ball has him hopping and yelping reflexively as it crashes into his hand, probably the thumb by the look of things. Wagner is bowling left-arm around the wicket to the left-hander, into the body, and Wade wears another one on the body this morning rather than pulling. A lot of wickets fell to the short ball last night, so he\u2019s just trying to be disciplined. He\u2019s wearing a small forearm guard, covering about half the forearm, and he\u2019s hit there and then around the hip. It\u2019s a maiden, aggressive stuff from Wagner. 58th over: Australia 169-6 (Wade 8, Cummins 3) It\u2019s Colin de Grandhomme to start the day with the ball at medium pace. Pat Cummins to face. The over is accurate, on or around the off stump aside from the last ball, that Cummins can glance fine for two runs. Australia lead by 419. Day four! And haven\u2019t we had a couple of eventful evening sessions. The Kiwis were knocked over by Australia on the second night of this match, then Australia crashed on the third. The difference is that by that point, Australia were well ahead in the match, so they\u2019re not in much trouble as a result. But it was another top-order collapse, and another low score for Steve Smith. Australia will resume batting this afternoon six wickets down for 167, which sounds bad except they had a 250-run lead on the first innings. So they\u2019re actually 417 ahead already, and the world record run chase is 418, so safe to say New Zealand won\u2019t be running down whatever the nominal target ends up being. The main objective for New Zealand today is to make sure Australia can\u2019t hold out with the bat for two sessions. The Kiwis will want to be at the batting crease for a couple of hours before evening comes, so they have set batsman who can get through that more difficult session. But maybe they don\u2019t want to bowl out Australia too quickly, because that leaves more overs for NZ to face. Hmm, dilemmas. Maybe the ideal for NZ is to bowl really tightly, concede nothing much, but not take the final wicket until right on the lunch break. For Australia, they\u2019ll want to bat past lunch to take daytime overs away from New Zealand. But with only Matthew Wade and the bowlers to bat, that might be a bridge too far. Still, it\u2019s been a nice surface to bat on during the day. Although the cracks are starting to open up. Realistically, New Zealand\u2019s chances of drawing this Test are not much better than their chances of winning it, but they\u2019re a team that refuses to go away.",

Six people have died, more than 2m hectares of land have been scorched and more than 700 homes destroyed. Overwhelmingly, those on the frontline fighting the fires are not paid professionals. Volunteers from the state\u2019s Rural Fire Service (RFS) carry emergency pagers and rush from their work at offices, hospitals and factories to pull on their yellow and navy firefighting uniforms. Volunteer firefighting has a long and proud history in Australia. But with exhaustion setting in and the hottest months of summer still ahead, there are concerns about how firefighters can go on unpaid, leaving their families, homes, workplaces and summer holidays behind. Alastair Breingan, a volunteer and retired IT worker, fought fires on the mid-north coast with his brigade for 10-day stretches during October and November, sometimes putting in 12-hour shifts and falling into bed at 4am. In mid-November he saw a fire roaring towards his bushland property near the village of Upper Lansdowne and stayed behind to protect his house. \u201cIt was just a huge plume of smoke, very, very dark smoke,\u201d Breingan said. \u201cIt was burning quite fiercely.

Ken Thompson, a former deputy urban fire chief and representative of the Australian Firefighters Climate Alliance, said NSW firefighters were already \u201cshattered\u201d. \u201cI just fundamentally believe the entire system is not designed for this type of situation \u2013 much longer fire seasons than we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d he said.

When asked whether volunteer crews needed to be paid, Morrison rejected suggestions that the RFS should be professionalised. \u201cThe volunteer effort is a big part of our natural disaster response and it is a big part of how Australia has always dealt with these issues,\u201d he said.

A century on, the RFS is a modern, highly organised version of those early local brigades, made up of more than 70,000 volunteers and 1,000 paid staff, equipped with 4,000 tankers, and assisted by water bombing aircraft. Their efforts are bolstered by smaller numbers of paid firefighters from the urban Fire and Rescue NSW squads, national parks and forestry workers and, occasionally, the army. Breingan said the volunteer model worked because it would not be possible to pay many thousands of people to be on call every day. He said community involvement and knowledge was highly valuable and potential volunteers may be put off by added bureaucracy. \u201cWe had young lads with utes [utility vehicles] and water tanks going around putting out spot fires, and they probably saved a house or two given that we didn\u2019t have enough people on the ground to get to a lot of them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to keep that community closer than we have been.\u201d But he knows all too well the exhaustion that comes from long, hot, smokey days with limited backup. \u201cThere will be people in active fires who have been going for a week or 10 days and they will be feeling \u2018this is our backyard, we have to keep going\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be pushing themselves. \u201cThey want to be there because they feel it\u2019s their backyard to protect, but if they had somebody to take over they\u2019d say yes please and thank you.\u201d Many RFS crews say the devastating fire conditions, that have created a lingering haze over Sydney and other cities and towns, have only encouraged more people to sign up.

Over the past couple of decades, the quality \u2013 and range \u2013 of rums available here has at last caught up with the likes of whisky and brandy. Where to start with a constantly evolving, heritage-rich scene? Guest editor and rum aficionado Stormzy gave us a couple of suggestions. First, one with an intriguing back-story, Equiano. Named for the Nigerian-born 18th-century writer, freed slave and abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, it\u2019s a blend of molasses rums from two tropical islands in two continents, Mauritius and Barbados, making it the first-ever Afro-Caribbean rum. Aged for eight years and finished in ex-bourbon casks, it has a gorgeous honeyed mellowness, with soft vanilla and rich fruitcake flavours that, for this correspondent, are better suited to fireside curling-up than clubbing.</p> <p><strong>Las Olas Spiced Rum, Barbados and Jamaica (\u00a335, <a href=\"https://lasolasrumclub.com/\">lasolasrumclub.com</a>) </strong>Stormzy\u2019s second choice, Las Olas, takes us into the realms of spiced rum. That\u2019s a style that can get up purists\u2019 noses \u2013 as if it were a form of cheating, somehow, that at least some of the flavour comes from adding spices, roots or fruits into the barrel, rather than it being, as with conventional rum, a reflection of the pure distillate or its slow interaction with a barrel over years. As with gin and vermouth, however, the keys to making the sort of quality spiced rums that have emerged in recent years lie in the skill of the blender and the quality of the raw ingredients \u2013 two factors that the three Londoners behind Las Olas seem to have got right with their spanking new release. A blend of rums from Barbados and Jamaica, it is refreshing and zingy where Equiano is smooth and relaxed, with a seasonal whiff of mince pie and a big hit of bright cherry on the palate.</p> <p><strong>Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva Rum, Venezuela (from \u00a337, <a href=\"https://www.waitrosecellar.com/spirits/spirit-type/diplomatico-reserva-exclusiva-rum-516422\" title=\"\">waitrosecellar.com</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/4475/diplomatico-reserva-exclusiva-rum\" title=\"\">whiskyexchange.com</a>) </strong>What would I recommend Stormzy in return?

With a base of Windward Islands rum, it\u2019s infused with a range of flavourings from cinnamon to nutmeg and ginger that give it a properly complex, gingery warming kick that seems, again, to be very much in keeping with the season.

This makes her victories nuanced, rather than empowered air-punches. She treats her friends as window-dressing to her own issues. Her articles may be hits, but if I insisted on publishing my pieces without the involvement of an editor, I would get the sack.

In each book, the Italian author and illustrator combines inky black and white with a single pop of colour (blue for Yves Klein, egg-yolk yellow for Pollock), while his bug-eyed, zany artists recall the Minions from <em>Despicable Me</em> but with art history degrees and sharp suits.</p> <p>The books may end with an example of artwork and a more traditional biography but they\u2019re not solely for art-loving children and families; they celebrate individuality and creative self-expression.</p> <p>\u201cBe proud of your mad ideas, kids!\u201d, Gilberti seems to say, as he imagines Pollock splashing paint while doing somersaults or cycling. \u201cWhen he painted,\u201d Gilberti writes, \u201chis heart would beat like a drum and he could not stay still.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"394b7d5cbb72fb1dce7301531a10329add39f10c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/394b7d5cbb72fb1dce7301531a10329add39f10c/0_0_4908_2452/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Wild spirit\u2019: Fausto Gilberti\u2019s Yves Klein Painted Everything Blue and Wasn\u2019t Sorry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wild spirit\u2019: Fausto Gilberti\u2019s Yves Klein Painted Everything Blue and Wasn\u2019t Sorry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Fausto Gilberti</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picasso said: \u201cEvery child is an artist.

Radeva trained as a molecular biologist before quitting to study illustration, and her acclaimed debut combines these two worlds. Her retelling of Darwin\u2019s seminal study doesn\u2019t shy away from the complexity of his research, often quoting him directly; but her beautiful drawings, which seem to crawl and canter out of the book\u2019s spine, are so colourful and expressive that pre-schoolers as well as juniors should find it enriching.</p> <p>Picture books about the climate crisis were everywhere this year, and while some struck the right tone (inspiring rather than panicking the very young) it was Oliver Jeffers\u2019s exquisite fable <strong><a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008357917/the-fate-of-fausto/\" title=\"\">The Fate of Fausto</a></strong> (Harper Collins), sparked by a visit to the wild north coast of Antrim, that felt like the greatest hymn to nature.

This extended picture book features a \u201cword-mangling\u201d seven-year-old called Phoebe, who longs to escape the orphanage of the Trunchbull-esque Griselda Bone. When her snowman transforms into a snow dragon that takes her on a Christmas Eve journey, it\u2019s reminiscent of Raymond Briggs\u2019s <em>The Snowman</em>.</p> <p>Woodcock uses blown-ink to create snow-dusted, dreamlike images that give this sweet, uplifting tale a unique look.</p> <p>Little hands that love opening letters will also enjoy two of the year\u2019s wittiest interactive books.

Rundell flexed her historical thriller muscle in <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-good-thieves-9781408854891.html\" title=\"\">The Good Thieves </a></strong>(Bloomsbury), which pitted a young British girl and an unlikely alliance of streetwise youngsters and circus performers against New York gangsters and crooked politicians: justice was served with relish.</p> <p>Relative newcomer Sophie Anderson segued seamlessly from her previous hit, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-house-with-chicken-legs-9781474940665.html\" title=\"\">The House With Chicken Legs</a></em>, into another book inspired by Russian folk tales, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-girl-who-speaks-bear-9781474940672.html\" title=\"\">The Girl Who Speaks Bear</a></strong> (Usborne), and remained at the forefront of the zeitgeist for frosty, Russia-themed books.

In this universe of armed fairies and inquisitorial nuns, tech and magic are the same thing, but you are never more than a few paragraphs away from a belly laugh.</p> <p>The doyenne of British children\u2019s fiction, Jacqueline Wilson, never disappoints. <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/we-are-the-beaker-girls-9780857535870.html\" title=\"\">We Are the Beaker Girls</a></strong> (Doubleday) was the second instalment in the new lives of the grownup Tracy Beaker and her daughter, Jess, a story about new beginnings and unexpected challenges.</p> <p>If those names are familiar, more deserve to be. A continuing success this year was 2018\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-boy-at-the-back-of-the-class-9781510105010.html\" title=\"\">The Boy at the Back of the Class</a></em><strong> </strong>(Hachette) by Onjali Q Ra\u00faf, which won the Waterstones children\u2019s book prize.

Newcomer Darren Simpson\u2019s debut, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/scavengers-9781474956024.html\" title=\"\">Scavengers</a> </strong>(Usborne), seems set in a different world with its own language and customs. But the reader\u2019s realisation dawns \u2013 alongside that of Simpson\u2019s protagonist, a youngster called Landfill \u2013 that Hinterland, the only home he knows, is not what it seems. Things are not exactly as he\u2019s been told by Babagoo, his strict but affectionate protector, either, a cantankerous soul given to expletives such as \u201cflaming brownberries!\u201d The discovery of where puppies come from throws young Landfill for a loop. Parents, though, will smile at a \u201cwoofler\u201d called Orwell and a \u201cmowler\u201d called Atwood.</p> <p>Simpson skilfully avoids hammering any point home, but this emotive coming-of-age tale queries love and loyalty, our throwaway society, and what exactly it is that walls keep out and in. That\u2019s a lot to pack into what is, at heart, a hard-to-put-down tale of tweenage derring-do.</p> <h2>The best poetry books, chosen by Kate Kellaway</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd3ed00c01b93f200c5d8151418228836b02148d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd3ed00c01b93f200c5d8151418228836b02148d/0_0_1019_783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moonstruck!: \u2018a gathering of accessible, unloony tunes\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"768\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moonstruck!: \u2018a gathering of accessible, unloony tunes\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Ed Boxall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/poems-to-fall-in-love-with-9781529023237.html\" title=\"\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/poems-to-fall-in-love-with-9781529023237.html\" title=\"\">Poems to Fall in Love With</a> </strong>(Macmillan), the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/video/2015/jun/09/chris-riddell-new-childrens-laureate-video\" title=\"\">former children\u2019s laureate Chris Riddell</a> lets loose: cupids cavort with hearts, roses and embracing couples. His drawings seem blown speedily across the pages as if by a spring breeze. But the pleasure and surprise is that the poems themselves are not light as candyfloss. This is a stupendously well-chosen, feelgood anthology in which even feel-bad poems feel good. The Emilys (Bront\u00eb and Dickinson), Auden, Keats and Yeats rub shoulders with \u2013 and sometimes shed tears alongside \u2013 contemporary writers and unfamiliar poems.</p> <p>I was particularly touched and taken aback by <a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/neil-gaiman\" title=\"\">novelist Neil Gaim</a><a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/neil-gaiman\" title=\"\">an\u2019s</a> Wedding Thoughts: All I Know About Love, with its insights into not knowing; affected by the embattled sorrow of Jan Dean\u2019s Tomorrow when you will not wake; and delighted by Grace Nichols\u2019s Like a Flame, a poem of flaring passion. This little book is a must-have, with poems that make you feel more alive. As Wendy Cope concludes in The Orange:</p> <p><em>I did all the jobs on my list</em><br><em>And enjoyed them and had some time over.</em><br><em>I love you. I\u2019m glad I exist.</em></p> <p>Three collections about nature deserve a warm mention: <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/poems-from-a-green-and-blue-planet-9781444951240.html\" title=\"\">Poems from a Green and Blue Planet</a> </strong>(Hodder) is a generous anthology, discerningly edited by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/19/sabrina-mahfouz-interview-noughts-and-crosses-emma-watson\" title=\"\">Sabrina Mahfouz</a> with a magpie\u2019s eye for sparkling gems new and old.

Celia Warren\u2019s Poor Old Phoebe! empathises with a \u201ctrodden upon\u201d moon that \u201cstill shines in poets lines\u201d \u2013 and the book confirms this as poets marvel from a distance or are chummily familiar.</p> <p>Joseph Coelho\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-year-of-nature-poems-9781786035820.html\" title=\"\">A Year of Nature Poems</a></strong> (Wide Eyed Editions) is a beguiling poetic calendar \u2013 meticulously written, sophisticated and novel. The best anthologies work beautifully precisely because they are not <em>for</em> children in any strict sense. Many of the poems were written for adults but have been judged understandable enough to be read by children. It is this unpatronising, flatteringly grown-up approach that cultivates, early on, a real feeling for poetry.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/shakespeare-for-every-day-of-the-year-9781509890323.html\" title=\"\">Shakespeare for Every Day of the Year</a> </strong>(Macmillan) is a more questionable idea (do we want Shakespeare in soundbites?) but it is persuasively pulled off in this daily dose of soliloquies, sonnets and snippets from plays. The book is nicely edited by Allie Esiri (like its predecessors <em>A Poem for Every Night of the Year </em>and <em>A Poem for Every Day of the Year</em>) and what distinguishes it are its fascinating, scholarly prefaces (Professor Michael Dobson should take a bow). A lucky dip for all ages and a handsome Christmas diversion.</p> <p>The Riddell family rules the poetic roost this year. The \u201ctasty\u201d poems in <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/midnight-feasts-tasty-poems-chosen-by-a-f-harrold-9781472944078.html\" title=\"\">Midnight Feasts</a></strong> (Bloomsbury Education) have been chosen by AF Harrold and illustrated by Chris Riddell\u2019s daughter Katy \u2013 a talented chip off the old block. <br>This moreish anthology \u2013 a menu of poetic snacks \u2013 is illustrated with beguiling, gentle humour. Christopher Reid\u2019s Rabbit is a perfect example of the book\u2019s charm. He maintains: \u201cPeople who say the Rabbit has no song are wrong.\u201d What rabbits celebrate is: \u201cThe Ballad of Salad\u201d. Riddell\u2019s rabbit has a priceless expression at the bottom right-hand side of the page \u2013 caught in the act \u2013 a lettuce leaf hanging from his mouth, helplessly involved in munching.</p> <h2>The best books for young adults, chosen by Fiona Noble</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1a61fdd1083cfd1dde54dcea2c00963acdf97bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1a61fdd1083cfd1dde54dcea2c00963acdf97bf/0_0_1522_2339/651.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Remarkable new voice\u2019: Pet by Akwaeke Emezi\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Remarkable new voice\u2019: Pet by Akwaeke Emezi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Hate U Give</em> made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/27/angie-thomas-the-hate-u-give-interview-famous-fans-readers\" title=\"\">Angie Thomas</a> one of the biggest names in young adult fiction. Her second novel, <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/on-the-come-up-9781406372168.html\" title=\"\">On the Come Up </a></strong>(Walker), is set in the same universe, charting 16-year-old Bri\u2019s aspiring rap career. Thomas tackles gritty topics, among them prejudice, poverty and racism, but is such a smart, funny and perceptive writer that there is no sense of her being heavy-handed. Her relationships, both familial and otherwise, feel authentic and full of humanity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/14/frances-hardinge-my-writing-day\" title=\"\">Frances Hardinge</a> is among the most original writers working today and <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/deeplight-9781509836956.html\" title=\"\">Deeplight</a></strong> (Macmillan) one of her finest books yet. Here, her dazzling imagination has conjured the Myriad archipelago, a strange world of undersea gods, lush mythology and Lovecraftian submersibles. Two very human boys, orphans turned scavengers, make a dangerous discovery that drives a thrilling and unpredictable plot. She\u2019s a writer who defies easy categorisation; this will entice older children and far beyond.</p> <p>William Sutcliffe provides some much-needed comic relief in <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-gifted-the-talented-and-me-9781408890219.html\" title=\"\">The Gifted, the Talented and Me</a></strong> (Bloomsbury), a deft satire on modern family life with shades of Adrian Mole. Happily average Sam moves to Hampstead with his newly rich family and finds himself utterly out of place at the North London Academy for the Gifted and Talented. More funny books for teenagers is high on my wishlist for 2020.</p> <p>Next, three outstanding and very different debuts to look out for. Murder mysteries were the year\u2019s big ticket in young adult fiction. Holly Jackson\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/a-good-girl-s-guide-to-murder-9781405293181.html\" title=\"\">A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder</a></strong> (Electric Monkey), set in the English town of Little Kilton, follows a sixth-former studying a notorious local crime for a school project. Not as slick as its American counterparts, perhaps, but the snappy title, addictive plotting and small-town secrets made it the bestselling debut of the year.</p> <p>Liz Hyder\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/bearmouth-9781782692423.html\" title=\"\">Bearmouth</a></strong> (Pushkin) is both bold and ambitious, written in an unusual first-person, phonetic dialect. The book takes place in the dark claustrophobia of Bearmouth mine, where workers are cowed by hard labour and religious indoctrination. In this nightmarish world, naive protagonist Newt is unsettled by a newcomer\u2019s talk of \u201crevolushun\u201d. Hyder is a writer of considerable potential.</p> <p>Another remarkable new voice is Akwaeke Emezi, already acclaimed for their (the personal pronoun Emezi prefers to use) adult novel <em>Freshwater</em>. <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/pet-9780571355112.html\" title=\"\">Pet</a> </strong>(Faber) is set in the American town of Lucille, in a world almost like ours. Here, the revolution has been and gone and with it a purging of evil and corruption. Or so it seems, until the day a creature of horns and claws emerges from a painting and tells 15-year-old Jam that he is there to hunt a monster. A timely, nuanced book about the monsters living in plain sight.</p> <p>Finally, a winter classic to savour over the darkest days of the year. Susan Cooper\u2019s famous <strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-dark-is-rising-9780241377093.html\" title=\"\">The Dark Is Rising</a></strong> (Puffin), first published in the 1970s, has been reissued with a new introduction by Robert Macfarlane. On midwinter\u2019s day, Will awakes to an ancient winter landscape and learns that he is one of the \u201cOld Ones\u201d, tasked with holding back the Dark at the potent time around the winter solstice.</p> <p>In his introduction, Macfarlane recalls first reading the book as a teenager in the 1980s, gripped by fear of nuclear apocalypse. Today\u2019s fears, he writes, may be different but \u201cthe dark is always rising and the work of the greatest stories is to hold it back\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A decade ago, it seemed likely that children\u2019s books would fall victim to the digital age, paperbacks cast aside for Kindles, picture books swiped on iPads. A recent survey of 1,000 parents by charity BookTrust revealed that 26% were subcontracting bedtime stories to Alexa or other home assistants. But the same study showed that 83% preferred \u201creal\u201d books and the sustained boom in the children\u2019s book market is testament to this. David Walliams may have dominated the charts again \u2013 he is likely to have the year\u2019s three bestselling children\u2019s books \u2013 but, as our reviewers\u2019 choices reveal, look deeper and range, quality and innovation abound. Children\u2019s books have never been more relevant, echoing the big issues of the day. Titles about mental health and emotions are everywhere, from Sam Copeland and illustrator Sarah Horne\u2019s funny Charlie Changes Into a Chicken (Puffin) and Rebecca Westcott\u2019s Can You See Me? (Scholastic) \u2013 whose co-author is 11-year-old Libby Scott, a girl with autism \u2013 to Bryony Gordon\u2019s teenage self-help guide You Got This (Wren &amp; Rook). Michael Morpurgo and Onjali Q Rauf were among those addressing the refugee crisis in Boy Giant (HarperColllins) and The Boy at the Back of the Class (Orion) respectively, while Malorie Blackman\u2019s return to the world of Noughts &amp; Crosses in Crossfire (Penguin) combined taut thriller with themes of racism, division and media bias. For a generation growing up with Greta Thunberg and climate strikes, saving the planet will be 2020\u2019s lead story in children\u2019s books, foreshadowed this year by Greta and the Giants (Frances Lincoln), written by Zoe Tucker and illustrated by Zoe Persico, Neal Layton\u2019s A Planet Full of Plastic (Wren &amp; Rook) and Lily Dyu\u2019s Earth Heroes (Nosy Crow), illustrated by Jackie Lay. In a world where news cycles and social media expose children to current events as never before, these are books that reflect reality and offer young readers, parents and teachers a place to explore. The cultural impact of children\u2019s books resonated far beyond bookshops this year. The RSC\u2019s musical adaptation of The Boy in the Dress by David Walliams is a smash hit, and after a decade of Christmas Day BBC animations, Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler are a veritable festive tradition (this year it\u2019s The Snail and the Whale). Meanwhile, Jack Thorne\u2019s eagerly anticipated adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials debuted to rapturous reviews. In July, How to Train Your Dragon author Cressida Cowell became the new children\u2019s laureate and is already proving to be a formidable advocate of literacy, pursuing with enormous energy her \u201claureate\u2019s charter\u201d to improve access to books and to make school libraries mandatory. Finally, we bid farewell to two giants of children\u2019s literature. John Burningham, who died in January, was a double Kate Greenaway medal winner, delighting readers from the 1960s onwards with the wit, warmth and imagination of works such as Borka and Mr Grumpy\u2019s Outing. Judith Kerr\u2019s debut, The Tiger Who Came to Tea, celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2018, beloved to generations of readers along with the Mog series and titles such as When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit. She died in May, just a week after she was named illustrator of the year at the British book awards. Fiona Noble The best picture books, chosen by Imogen Carter Whether focusing on faraway places or far-out people, dangerous dinosaurs or polluting plastic, nonfiction picture books for the very young have flourished in recent years, and this year\u2019s crop really had the wow factor. Fausto Gilberti has managed to bottle the wild spirit of some of the world\u2019s greatest artists in his cheekily titled biographical series comprising (to date) Jackson Pollock Splashed Paint and Wasn\u2019t Sorry and Yves Klein Painted Everything Blue and Wasn\u2019t Sorry (Phaidon). In each book, the Italian author and illustrator combines inky black and white with a single pop of colour (blue for Yves Klein, egg-yolk yellow for Pollock), while his bug-eyed, zany artists recall the Minions from Despicable Me but with art history degrees and sharp suits. The books may end with an example of artwork and a more traditional biography but they\u2019re not solely for art-loving children and families; they celebrate individuality and creative self-expression. \u201cBe proud of your mad ideas, kids!\u201d, Gilberti seems to say, as he imagines Pollock splashing paint while doing somersaults or cycling. \u201cWhen he painted,\u201d Gilberti writes, \u201chis heart would beat like a drum and he could not stay still.\u201d Picasso said: \u201cEvery child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up,\u201d and Gilberti captures perfectly the elements from the creative lives of these adults that will really tickle children. We hear how Klein dressed as a knight for his wedding, once released 1,001 balloons into the sky, and gave his gallery guests blue drinks that \u201cmade their pee blue, too!\u201d Watch out for Yayoi Kusama Covered Everything in Dots and Wasn\u2019t Sorry next year. The subject matter may be very different, but the pages of Sabina Radeva\u2019s On the Origin of Species (Puffin) also vibrate with life and feeling. Radeva trained as a molecular biologist before quitting to study illustration, and her acclaimed debut combines these two worlds. Her retelling of Darwin\u2019s seminal study doesn\u2019t shy away from the complexity of his research, often quoting him directly; but her beautiful drawings, which seem to crawl and canter out of the book\u2019s spine, are so colourful and expressive that pre-schoolers as well as juniors should find it enriching. Picture books about the climate crisis were everywhere this year, and while some struck the right tone (inspiring rather than panicking the very young) it was Oliver Jeffers\u2019s exquisite fable The Fate of Fausto (Harper Collins), sparked by a visit to the wild north coast of Antrim, that felt like the greatest hymn to nature. Made using zesty colours and traditional lithographic printmaking techniques, it\u2019s an essential buy for picture book lovers aged five to 85. It was a year full of fantastic fiction. Sophie Dahl\u2019s grandfather would have loved the adventurous girl at the heart of her debut children\u2019s book, Madame Badobedah (Walker), while there was an air of the old man himself in Abi Elphinstone and Fiona Woodcock\u2019s The Snow Dragon (Simon &amp; Schuster). This extended picture book features a \u201cword-mangling\u201d seven-year-old called Phoebe, who longs to escape the orphanage of the Trunchbull-esque Griselda Bone. When her snowman transforms into a snow dragon that takes her on a Christmas Eve journey, it\u2019s reminiscent of Raymond Briggs\u2019s The Snowman. Woodcock uses blown-ink to create snow-dusted, dreamlike images that give this sweet, uplifting tale a unique look. Little hands that love opening letters will also enjoy two of the year\u2019s wittiest interactive books. For fans of the bestselling The Day the Crayons Quit, Drew Daywalt\u2019s The Crayons\u2019 Christmas (pictures by Oliver Jeffers; Harper Collins) has festive mail from the crayons who have flown the nest (well, stationery cupboard), while Emma Yarlett\u2019s vibrant Beast Feast (Walker) features RSVPs to a monster\u2019s gruesome party. Like so many of this year\u2019s best books, it will have children giggling with delight long after their Christmas dinner. The best chapter books, chosen by Kitty Empire Children\u2019s fiction abounds with special powers and alternative worlds. Mutter an incantation, then, to magic away the top layer of bestselling children\u2019s books at this time of year \u2013 the Walliamses, the Wimpy Kids and Dork Diaries, the Christmasaurus and David Baddiel. It will reveal a rather different terrain. This is a land less formulaic and more diverse than the bestseller lists, packed with dazzling inventiveness, expert storytellers and series with resonance. You can\u2019t really describe Katherine Rundell as a rising star any more, so fixed is she in the kid-lit firmament. Rundell flexed her historical thriller muscle in The Good Thieves (Bloomsbury), which pitted a young British girl and an unlikely alliance of streetwise youngsters and circus performers against New York gangsters and crooked politicians: justice was served with relish. Relative newcomer Sophie Anderson segued seamlessly from her previous hit, The House With Chicken Legs, into another book inspired by Russian folk tales, The Girl Who Speaks Bear (Usborne), and remained at the forefront of the zeitgeist for frosty, Russia-themed books. Who you really are and where you really belong are evergreen themes she explores well. Two more maestros of children\u2019s fiction with moral compasses just as finely tuned remained surefire reads. Frank Cottrell-Boyce\u2019s latest was Runaway Robot (Macmillan), a madcap escapade starring a boy and a delusional bot. Ross Welford\u2019s The Dog Who Saved the World (HarperCollins), meanwhile, featured a canine plague, time travel and refreshing originality. Rock solid is Eoin Colfer, whose long-awaited comeback, The Fowl Twins (HarperCollins), found the kid brothers of Artemis Fowl laying their own thrilling trail of destruction (they narrowly avoid sinking Amsterdam). In this universe of armed fairies and inquisitorial nuns, tech and magic are the same thing, but you are never more than a few paragraphs away from a belly laugh. The doyenne of British children\u2019s fiction, Jacqueline Wilson, never disappoints. We Are the Beaker Girls (Doubleday) was the second instalment in the new lives of the grownup Tracy Beaker and her daughter, Jess, a story about new beginnings and unexpected challenges. If those names are familiar, more deserve to be. A continuing success this year was 2018\u2019s The Boy at the Back of the Class (Hachette) by Onjali Q Ra\u00faf, which won the Waterstones children\u2019s book prize. Ra\u00faf\u2019s follow-up was The Star Outside My Window (Hachette), which tackled the aftermath of domestic violence with a shining innocence. Authors from BME backgrounds should not have to write solely about society\u2019s failings, however, so three cheers for Little Badman and the Invasion of the Killer Aunties (Puffin), by comedians Humza Arshad and Henry White and illustrated by Aleksei Bitskoff, and the vivid subcontinental adventure that was Asha and the Spirit Bird (Chicken House), the magic realist debut from Jasbinder Bilan. One book really stayed with me long after I finished it, however. Newcomer Darren Simpson\u2019s debut, Scavengers (Usborne), seems set in a different world with its own language and customs. But the reader\u2019s realisation dawns \u2013 alongside that of Simpson\u2019s protagonist, a youngster called Landfill \u2013 that Hinterland, the only home he knows, is not what it seems. Things are not exactly as he\u2019s been told by Babagoo, his strict but affectionate protector, either, a cantankerous soul given to expletives such as \u201cflaming brownberries!\u201d The discovery of where puppies come from throws young Landfill for a loop. Parents, though, will smile at a \u201cwoofler\u201d called Orwell and a \u201cmowler\u201d called Atwood. Simpson skilfully avoids hammering any point home, but this emotive coming-of-age tale queries love and loyalty, our throwaway society, and what exactly it is that walls keep out and in. That\u2019s a lot to pack into what is, at heart, a hard-to-put-down tale of tweenage derring-do. The best poetry books, chosen by Kate Kellaway In Poems to Fall in Love With (Macmillan), the former children\u2019s laureate Chris Riddell lets loose: cupids cavort with hearts, roses and embracing couples. His drawings seem blown speedily across the pages as if by a spring breeze. But the pleasure and surprise is that the poems themselves are not light as candyfloss. This is a stupendously well-chosen, feelgood anthology in which even feel-bad poems feel good. The Emilys (Bront\u00eb and Dickinson), Auden, Keats and Yeats rub shoulders with \u2013 and sometimes shed tears alongside \u2013 contemporary writers and unfamiliar poems. I was particularly touched and taken aback by novelist Neil Gaiman\u2019s Wedding Thoughts: All I Know About Love, with its insights into not knowing; affected by the embattled sorrow of Jan Dean\u2019s Tomorrow when you will not wake; and delighted by Grace Nichols\u2019s Like a Flame, a poem of flaring passion. This little book is a must-have, with poems that make you feel more alive. As Wendy Cope concludes in The Orange: I did all the jobs on my list And enjoyed them and had some time over. I love you. I\u2019m glad I exist. Three collections about nature deserve a warm mention: Poems from a Green and Blue Planet (Hodder) is a generous anthology, discerningly edited by Sabrina Mahfouz with a magpie\u2019s eye for sparkling gems new and old. I was thrilled to see William Blake\u2019s Eternity included. It is the most exquisite poem Blake ever wrote (although I\u2019m not precisely sure how the message about letting go relates to our planet\u2019s future). Moonstruck! (Otter-Barry) is a sweet sliver of a book (more new than full) with a gathering of accessible, unloony tunes. Celia Warren\u2019s Poor Old Phoebe! empathises with a \u201ctrodden upon\u201d moon that \u201cstill shines in poets lines\u201d \u2013 and the book confirms this as poets marvel from a distance or are chummily familiar. Joseph Coelho\u2019s A Year of Nature Poems (Wide Eyed Editions) is a beguiling poetic calendar \u2013 meticulously written, sophisticated and novel. The best anthologies work beautifully precisely because they are not for children in any strict sense. Many of the poems were written for adults but have been judged understandable enough to be read by children. It is this unpatronising, flatteringly grown-up approach that cultivates, early on, a real feeling for poetry. Shakespeare for Every Day of the Year (Macmillan) is a more questionable idea (do we want Shakespeare in soundbites?) but it is persuasively pulled off in this daily dose of soliloquies, sonnets and snippets from plays. The book is nicely edited by Allie Esiri (like its predecessors A Poem for Every Night of the Year and A Poem for Every Day of the Year) and what distinguishes it are its fascinating, scholarly prefaces (Professor Michael Dobson should take a bow). A lucky dip for all ages and a handsome Christmas diversion. The Riddell family rules the poetic roost this year. The \u201ctasty\u201d poems in Midnight Feasts (Bloomsbury Education) have been chosen by AF Harrold and illustrated by Chris Riddell\u2019s daughter Katy \u2013 a talented chip off the old block. This moreish anthology \u2013 a menu of poetic snacks \u2013 is illustrated with beguiling, gentle humour. Christopher Reid\u2019s Rabbit is a perfect example of the book\u2019s charm. He maintains: \u201cPeople who say the Rabbit has no song are wrong.\u201d What rabbits celebrate is: \u201cThe Ballad of Salad\u201d. Riddell\u2019s rabbit has a priceless expression at the bottom right-hand side of the page \u2013 caught in the act \u2013 a lettuce leaf hanging from his mouth, helplessly involved in munching. The best books for young adults, chosen by Fiona Noble The Hate U Give made Angie Thomas one of the biggest names in young adult fiction. Her second novel, On the Come Up (Walker), is set in the same universe, charting 16-year-old Bri\u2019s aspiring rap career. Thomas tackles gritty topics, among them prejudice, poverty and racism, but is such a smart, funny and perceptive writer that there is no sense of her being heavy-handed. Her relationships, both familial and otherwise, feel authentic and full of humanity. Frances Hardinge is among the most original writers working today and Deeplight (Macmillan) one of her finest books yet. Here, her dazzling imagination has conjured the Myriad archipelago, a strange world of undersea gods, lush mythology and Lovecraftian submersibles. Two very human boys, orphans turned scavengers, make a dangerous discovery that drives a thrilling and unpredictable plot. She\u2019s a writer who defies easy categorisation; this will entice older children and far beyond. William Sutcliffe provides some much-needed comic relief in The Gifted, the Talented and Me (Bloomsbury), a deft satire on modern family life with shades of Adrian Mole. Happily average Sam moves to Hampstead with his newly rich family and finds himself utterly out of place at the North London Academy for the Gifted and Talented. More funny books for teenagers is high on my wishlist for 2020. Next, three outstanding and very different debuts to look out for. Murder mysteries were the year\u2019s big ticket in young adult fiction. Holly Jackson\u2019s A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder (Electric Monkey), set in the English town of Little Kilton, follows a sixth-former studying a notorious local crime for a school project. Not as slick as its American counterparts, perhaps, but the snappy title, addictive plotting and small-town secrets made it the bestselling debut of the year. Liz Hyder\u2019s Bearmouth (Pushkin) is both bold and ambitious, written in an unusual first-person, phonetic dialect. The book takes place in the dark claustrophobia of Bearmouth mine, where workers are cowed by hard labour and religious indoctrination. In this nightmarish world, naive protagonist Newt is unsettled by a newcomer\u2019s talk of \u201crevolushun\u201d. Hyder is a writer of considerable potential. Another remarkable new voice is Akwaeke Emezi, already acclaimed for their (the personal pronoun Emezi prefers to use) adult novel Freshwater. Pet (Faber) is set in the American town of Lucille, in a world almost like ours. Here, the revolution has been and gone and with it a purging of evil and corruption. Or so it seems, until the day a creature of horns and claws emerges from a painting and tells 15-year-old Jam that he is there to hunt a monster. A timely, nuanced book about the monsters living in plain sight. Finally, a winter classic to savour over the darkest days of the year. Susan Cooper\u2019s famous The Dark Is Rising (Puffin), first published in the 1970s, has been reissued with a new introduction by Robert Macfarlane. On midwinter\u2019s day, Will awakes to an ancient winter landscape and learns that he is one of the \u201cOld Ones\u201d, tasked with holding back the Dark at the potent time around the winter solstice. In his introduction, Macfarlane recalls first reading the book as a teenager in the 1980s, gripped by fear of nuclear apocalypse. Today\u2019s fears, he writes, may be different but \u201cthe dark is always rising and the work of the greatest stories is to hold it back\u201d. \u2022 To order any of these books for a special price, click on the titles or go to guardianbookshop.com",

      "body": "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that Scotland cannot be \u201cimprisoned in the UK against its will\u201d and warned that Boris Johnson\u2019s continued refusal to grant her the powers to hold a second referendum can only increase support for Scottish independence.</p> \n<p>Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, the SNP leader and Scotland\u2019s first minster said: \u201cIt really is such a subversion of democracy that you\u2019re talking to the leader of the party that overwhelmingly won the election [in Scotland], and I\u2019m under pressure to say what I\u2019m doing because the mandate that I won is not going to be honoured by the party that got roundly defeated in Scotland. It is just such perversion and subversion of democracy that it will not hold.\u201d</p> \n<p>She told Marr that Scottish voters had \u201crejected the Tories, said no to Brexit and made clear we want our future in our own hands\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t presume everyone who voted SNP on Thursday is yet prepared to back independence, but it\u2019s not for me to decide that question, it\u2019s not for Boris Johnson to decide, it\u2019s for the people of Scotland.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Scotland, the SNP increased its share of the vote to 45%, winning a greater proportion of the votes there than the Tories did across the UK, and also increased its number of MPs at Westminster to 47. In contrast, the Tories \u2013 whose campaign in Scotland was focused on opposition to a second independence referendum \u2013 lost more than half their Scottish MPs, dropping from 13 to six.</p> \n<p>Accusing the Tories of \u201craging against the reality\u201d of the markedly different election result in Scotland, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe risk for the Conservatives here is that the more they try to block the will of the Scottish people, the more utter contempt they show for Scottish democracy, the more they are going to increase support for independence.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring to Conservative opposition in the late 80s and early 90s to the establishment of a Scottish parliament, Sturgeon said: \u201cRecent history tells us that this dictatorial attitude of a Conservative government saying they will determine the future of Scotland, not the people of Scotland, doesn\u2019t hold\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I\u2019m sounding reasonably relaxed about this its because I know that the momentum and mandate is on the side of those of us who want Scotland to be able to choose our own future\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked what she intended to do if Johnson continued to refuse to grant the section 30 order necessary for Holyrood to stage a legal referendum, Sturgeon said she would set out this week \u201cthe detailed democratic case for the transfer of power\u201d, and she repeated her pledge not to hold an Catalan-style illegal vote.</p> \n<p>But she added: \u201cI said to [Johnson] on the phone on Friday night, if he thinks saying no is the end of the matter he\u2019s going to find himself completely and utterly wrong.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou cannot hold Scotland in the union against its will. You cannot just lock us in a cupboard and turn the key and hope everything goes away. If the United Kingdom is to continue then it can only be by consent. If Boris Johnson is confident in the case for the union then he should be confident enough to make that case and allow the people to decide. Scotland cannot be imprisoned in the UK against its will.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since the election there have been numerous media reports of Johnson\u2019s plans to \u201clovebomb\u201d Scotland in the coming months, as he switches his focus from Brexit to the strengthening of the union.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Scottish Mail on Sunday, the former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson challenged Johnson to ensure that the rhetoric of his one-nation vision should become a reality. </p> \n<p>She urged Johnson to keep his promises on Brexit to Scotland\u2019s fishing industry and on support for farmers, consider Scotland\u2019s specific immigration needs and make extra infrastructure and research investment north of the border. </p> \n<p>Davidson said Johnson had a \u201cresponsibility to reach out to Scotland, despite SNP attacks and grievance, to ensure no part of the UK feels left behind during his premiership.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that Scotland cannot be \u201cimprisoned in the UK against its will\u201d and warned that Boris Johnson\u2019s continued refusal to grant her the powers to hold a second referendum can only increase support for Scottish independence. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, the SNP leader and Scotland\u2019s first minster said: \u201cIt really is such a subversion of democracy that you\u2019re talking to the leader of the party that overwhelmingly won the election [in Scotland], and I\u2019m under pressure to say what I\u2019m doing because the mandate that I won is not going to be honoured by the party that got roundly defeated in Scotland. It is just such perversion and subversion of democracy that it will not hold.\u201d She told Marr that Scottish voters had \u201crejected the Tories, said no to Brexit and made clear we want our future in our own hands\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t presume everyone who voted SNP on Thursday is yet prepared to back independence, but it\u2019s not for me to decide that question, it\u2019s not for Boris Johnson to decide, it\u2019s for the people of Scotland.\u201d In Scotland, the SNP increased its share of the vote to 45%, winning a greater proportion of the votes there than the Tories did across the UK, and also increased its number of MPs at Westminster to 47. In contrast, the Tories \u2013 whose campaign in Scotland was focused on opposition to a second independence referendum \u2013 lost more than half their Scottish MPs, dropping from 13 to six. Accusing the Tories of \u201craging against the reality\u201d of the markedly different election result in Scotland, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe risk for the Conservatives here is that the more they try to block the will of the Scottish people, the more utter contempt they show for Scottish democracy, the more they are going to increase support for independence.\u201d Referring to Conservative opposition in the late 80s and early 90s to the establishment of a Scottish parliament, Sturgeon said: \u201cRecent history tells us that this dictatorial attitude of a Conservative government saying they will determine the future of Scotland, not the people of Scotland, doesn\u2019t hold\u201d. \u201cIf I\u2019m sounding reasonably relaxed about this its because I know that the momentum and mandate is on the side of those of us who want Scotland to be able to choose our own future\u201d. Asked what she intended to do if Johnson continued to refuse to grant the section 30 order necessary for Holyrood to stage a legal referendum, Sturgeon said she would set out this week \u201cthe detailed democratic case for the transfer of power\u201d, and she repeated her pledge not to hold an Catalan-style illegal vote. But she added: \u201cI said to [Johnson] on the phone on Friday night, if he thinks saying no is the end of the matter he\u2019s going to find himself completely and utterly wrong. \u201cYou cannot hold Scotland in the union against its will. You cannot just lock us in a cupboard and turn the key and hope everything goes away. If the United Kingdom is to continue then it can only be by consent. If Boris Johnson is confident in the case for the union then he should be confident enough to make that case and allow the people to decide. Scotland cannot be imprisoned in the UK against its will.\u201d Since the election there have been numerous media reports of Johnson\u2019s plans to \u201clovebomb\u201d Scotland in the coming months, as he switches his focus from Brexit to the strengthening of the union. Writing in the Scottish Mail on Sunday, the former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson challenged Johnson to ensure that the rhetoric of his one-nation vision should become a reality. She urged Johnson to keep his promises on Brexit to Scotland\u2019s fishing industry and on support for farmers, consider Scotland\u2019s specific immigration needs and make extra infrastructure and research investment north of the border. Davidson said Johnson had a \u201cresponsibility to reach out to Scotland, despite SNP attacks and grievance, to ensure no part of the UK feels left behind during his premiership.\u201d",

Aluko, who has won 102 caps for England, is in little doubt. She encourages us to examine the current social climate. \u201cLook at Trump, Brexit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/aug/09/how-matteo-salvini-pulled-italy-to-the-far-right\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a>,\u201d she says. Salvini, the prominent Italian politician who until September this year was deputy prime minister, has gained popularity for his embrace of far-right rhetoric. His rise, notes Aluko, has been accompanied by \u201ca lack of interest\u201d from the authorities in holding clubs to account for racist chants at their games or social media companies for racist messages online. For Aluko, this disinterest is a symptom of the acceptance of prejudice in wider society. A prejudice that surges online.</p> <p>Deeney encourages us to look even further back in time. \u201cBrexit has brought racism to the surface,\u201d he says. \u201cBut look back in history. For some people\u2019s parents and grandparents, racism was normal. And they\u2019re going to teach their children that it\u2019s acceptable.\u201d Deeney rejects the argument that the abuse he receives, which has often been difficult to bear for his friends and family, is just light-hearted fun. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s getting to me at the moment,\u201d he says, \u201cis that people say it\u2019s banter, but banter is meant to be a jokey term of endearment. If you\u2019re insulting someone because of the colour of their skin, their beliefs, their sexuality, how is that banter?\u201d</p> <p>Professor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-carrington\" title=\"\">Ben Carrington</a>, a British sociologist and expert on the often fraught relationship between race and football, contends that a significant segment of the white public has a long tradition of condemning outspoken black athletes. In his view, social media is merely the modern version of that. \u201cThe online abuse is a form of social sanctioning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a formal disciplining of black footballers, and it also sends a warning to the other black public figures that if you want to speak out on certain issues around racism and politics, then there\u2019s a cost.\u201d</p> <p>He cites the example of the famously brash <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/26/boxing-day-belting-the-fight-that-stirred-the-racial-convictions-of-the-nation\" title=\"\">Jack Johnson</a>, a champion American boxer of the early 1900s, whose behaviour \u2013 no more wayward than that of his white counterparts \u2013 attracted furious criticism from large sections of the white audience and commentariat. He notes that Johnson\u2019s true sin, in the words of the great historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\">W</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\">E</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\">B</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\">Du Bois</a>, was his \u201cunforgivable blackness\u201d.</p> <p>In the modern context, a grim image arises: that, in the hands of a bigoted football fan, social media is a form of digital whip with which the user can lash the backs of unruly black footballers. \u201cWhat is unique to these black players is the manifestation of that abuse,\u201d says Carrington, \u201cand even sometimes the level of the abuse. It\u2019s designed to keep black people in their place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12b60049991cc22b8413c6c390a4d661a7d30ed7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12b60049991cc22b8413c6c390a4d661a7d30ed7/1607_28_1603_2003/800.jpg\" alt=\"Got your back: England Manager Gareth Southgate with Trent Alexander-Arnold.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Got your back: England Manager Gareth Southgate with Trent Alexander-Arnold.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action Plus Sports/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That immediately raises the question of what such a place might be. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing your place within the racial order,\u201d Carrington explains. \u201cOne of the problems is with the language. We\u2019re happy to talk about diversity and about race relations, but these are euphemisms for talking about white supremacy, a founding ideology of the west. A hierarchy of races with white Europeans at the top, and invariably with black Africans at the bottom.\u201d Aluko knows about this all too well. And, to illustrate this, she tells a story about what happened when she returned to Italy every time she visited her family in London. \u201cTurin is not a big airport\u201d, she says, \u201cso they know me, they see me coming through there all the time with Juventus. And every time I come through, they stop me and search my bags. And each time I say, \u2018But you\u2019ve seen me here so many times.\u2019\u201d Each time, she says, they say they are just doing their jobs, but she points out that it is more than that. \u201cIt\u2019s their way of telling you that no matter how well you do, this is your place.\u201d</p> <p>Carrington refers to white supremacy as \u201c18th and 19th-century race science, which has filtered into culture and into politics,\u201d and, as Deeney can attest, into football. Deeney is primarily targeted on Twitter, followed by Instagram. Every day, his account is populated with racial epithets and images of monkeys. While he has grown used to it \u2013 \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he says \u2013 he remains concerned about the effect the abuse is having on his family, who are not so used to the often grim nature of life in the public eye. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit old-school and I think the man of the house is supposed to protect the family, not put them in danger. But by me going out to provide for my family, I genuinely put them in danger of online abuse.\u201d</p> <p>When asked what the social media companies are doing about it, he is unequivocal. \u201cThe powers that be genuinely don\u2019t care,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Iffy Onuora \u2013 a former player and international manager and now a regional coach and equalities executive at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/pfa\" title=\"\">Professional Footballers\u2019 Association</a> \u2013 agrees with Deeney\u2019s bleak assessment. \u201cWe\u2019re being strung along,\u201d he says of the social media companies\u2019 reactions. \u201cThey say all the right things at the right times, but they\u2019re not serious... Ultimately it\u2019s a business model that involves as much traffic as possible, and they\u2019ll do anything that will hold that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95710984bb0f977b772dd897dc31e6ae61dc26de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95710984bb0f977b772dd897dc31e6ae61dc26de/0_0_914_1171/781.jpg\" alt=\"Handwritten pullquote: \u2018It\u2019s unfair to be mocked and victimised for something we can\u2019t control\u2019 \u2013 Trent Alexander-Arnold\" width=\"781\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trent Alexander-Arnold</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: The Observer Design Team</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twitter was routinely identified by players as the platform where they received the most persistent abuse. The site has also come under criticism for its handling of racism in a political context, most notably its reported reluctance to ban the accounts of white supremacists. Twitter itself has defended its position, noting the difficulty of the task and that it is putting less of a burden on users to report abuse. It states that over 50% of potentially abusive content is now proactively flagged for review by its teams. When contacted for comment, Twitter UK reiterated its firm commitment to working with a range of partners to address this issue. The chairman of one of those partners, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/12/sanjay-bhandari-kick-it-out-football-racism\" title=\"\">Sanjay Bhandari</a> of Kick It Out, is cautiously optimistic. \u201cThere are no silver bullets,\u201d he says, \u201cso there isn\u2019t one single initiative or plan\u2026 but there is one single mindset and that is about collaborating more\u201d \u2013 with social media companies and football\u2019s governing bodies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/shireen-ahmed\" title=\"\">Shireen Ahmed</a>, the writer, activist and co-host of the feminist sports podcast <a href=\"http://www.shireenahmed.com/burn-it-all-down\" title=\"\">Burn It All Down</a>, identifies a key reason for what she sees as a lack of urgency by social media companies to address online racism. \u201cThe head of the organisations that make the decisions are white men, and they will never empathise fully because they simply cannot,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can never, ever fully understand what\u2019s happening. And I\u2019ve learned this about my work on anti-oppression in sports, be it with Muslim women, or with women of colour. If the people at the decision-making table are not affected by this, then they\u2019re less likely to care. And that\u2019s a fact. Because they will never be moved in the way we need them to be.\u201d Ahmed points to organisations such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/aug/10/black-list-voice-football\" title=\"\">Footie Black List</a>, which celebrates African and Caribbean achievement in British football. \u201cWe find people of colour again helping and healing their own communities, because no one else will do it.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmed\u2019s concerns echo those of others \u2013 that it is black people who, despite being the victims of racism, are constantly expected to solve the problems that racism presents. What is more, the player is often more judged for the dignity and maturity of their response to abuse \u2013 how elegantly they conduct themselves, how well they play through the pain \u2013 than the person racially abusing them.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>What is too rarely discussed is the devastating impact that racist abuse, whether online or offline, can have on footballers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/may/21/smalltalk.sportinterviews\" title=\"\">Roberto Carlos</a>, a World Cup winner with Brazil, heard all manner of insults in the course of his career, yet it was racism that affected him most. When playing in Russia for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/anzhi-makhachkala\" title=\"\">Anzhi Makhachkala</a>, he had a banana thrown at him by a fan of a rival team, an action that reportedly reduced him to tears in the dressing room afterwards.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/trent-alexander-arnold-extra-burden-liverpool-jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">Trent Alexander-Arnold, of</a> Liverpool and England, notes that there is a significant difference between racist abuse and other types of derogatory comments that he receives from the stands. \u201cRacist abuse is more personal,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously we can\u2019t control what colour skin we are, so it\u2019s unfair to be mocked and to be victimised for something we can\u2019t control\u2026 You get used to the hostile environment at Old Trafford and European away games, and in big stadiums and finals, but it\u2019s a whole different feeling when there\u2019s a racial feel about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3717ac6ca2f40c596ab09cc044d3997d3c59ce07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3717ac6ca2f40c596ab09cc044d3997d3c59ce07/0_30_2523_1513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pointing the way: (from left) Juventus star Eniola Aluko.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pointing the way: Juventus star Eniola Aluko.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthias Schr\u00e4der/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexander-Arnold has thankfully received very little online racist abuse. He was there with Mings and Rashford during the game against Bulgaria, a fixture that was nearly called off due to bigoted chants and Nazi salutes from a section of the crowd. Gareth Southgate, England\u2019s manager, emerges with particular credit. \u201cHe was asking the players if they felt comfortable to carry on or not, even though he knew it wasn\u2019t directly his decision to make,\u201d says Alexander-Arnold. \u201cFor him to make those kinds of decisions under that pressure, to handle that situation, was obviously massive.\u201d</p> <p>The recurring theme seems to be that white executives \u2013 be they on the boards of football clubs or social media companies \u2013 need to do more to bring about progress in this area. They can do that both by hiring more non-white colleagues and by being more outspoken about it themselves. Southgate has been applauded for his efforts precisely because \u2013 despite stating that \u201cI\u2019m a middle-aged white guy speaking about racism, I find it a difficult subject to broach\u201d \u2013 he still persists in broaching it. The England manager is in the minority in that when racist incidents do occur, often the most striking thing is the silence of senior white figures within the game.</p> <p>Their loud and swift condemnation of this abuse, and their equally swift action, are essential if we are to move forward. The internet may be relatively new, but racism is a system that is centuries old.</p> <p>Still, when the PFA\u2019s Onuora looks at the united front that England players, both white and black, produced against Bulgaria, he sees room for optimism. At its core, he says, \u201cfootball is a meritocracy... On the pitch is the purest form of engagement, comradeship, competitiveness, togetherness. The great thing about England against Bulgaria was the solidarity. I played in an era where, if I got racially abused, people would not even mention it after the game. And these people \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/harry-kane\" title=\"\">Harry Kane</a>s \u2013 they mentioned it before the game.\u201d</p> <p>Though aware of the significant work to be done, Onuora remains hopeful. \u201cIf we can extrapolate that spirit out into politics, into wider society, that togetherness from a group of people who have more in common than they will ever have apart, then we could do wonders.\u201d</p>",

Deeney encourages us to look even further back in time. \u201cBrexit has brought racism to the surface,\u201d he says. \u201cBut look back in history. For some people\u2019s parents and grandparents, racism was normal. And they\u2019re going to teach their children that it\u2019s acceptable.\u201d Deeney rejects the argument that the abuse he receives, which has often been difficult to bear for his friends and family, is just light-hearted fun. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s getting to me at the moment,\u201d he says, \u201cis that people say it\u2019s banter, but banter is meant to be a jokey term of endearment. If you\u2019re insulting someone because of the colour of their skin, their beliefs, their sexuality, how is that banter?\u201d Professor Ben Carrington, a British sociologist and expert on the often fraught relationship between race and football, contends that a significant segment of the white public has a long tradition of condemning outspoken black athletes. In his view, social media is merely the modern version of that. \u201cThe online abuse is a form of social sanctioning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a formal disciplining of black footballers, and it also sends a warning to the other black public figures that if you want to speak out on certain issues around racism and politics, then there\u2019s a cost.\u201d He cites the example of the famously brash Jack Johnson, a champion American boxer of the early 1900s, whose behaviour \u2013 no more wayward than that of his white counterparts \u2013 attracted furious criticism from large sections of the white audience and commentariat. He notes that Johnson\u2019s true sin, in the words of the great historian WEB Du Bois, was his \u201cunforgivable blackness\u201d. In the modern context, a grim image arises: that, in the hands of a bigoted football fan, social media is a form of digital whip with which the user can lash the backs of unruly black footballers. \u201cWhat is unique to these black players is the manifestation of that abuse,\u201d says Carrington, \u201cand even sometimes the level of the abuse. It\u2019s designed to keep black people in their place.\u201d That immediately raises the question of what such a place might be. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing your place within the racial order,\u201d Carrington explains. \u201cOne of the problems is with the language. We\u2019re happy to talk about diversity and about race relations, but these are euphemisms for talking about white supremacy, a founding ideology of the west. A hierarchy of races with white Europeans at the top, and invariably with black Africans at the bottom.\u201d Aluko knows about this all too well. And, to illustrate this, she tells a story about what happened when she returned to Italy every time she visited her family in London. \u201cTurin is not a big airport\u201d, she says, \u201cso they know me, they see me coming through there all the time with Juventus. And every time I come through, they stop me and search my bags. And each time I say, \u2018But you\u2019ve seen me here so many times.\u2019\u201d Each time, she says, they say they are just doing their jobs, but she points out that it is more than that. \u201cIt\u2019s their way of telling you that no matter how well you do, this is your place.\u201d Carrington refers to white supremacy as \u201c18th and 19th-century race science, which has filtered into culture and into politics,\u201d and, as Deeney can attest, into football. Deeney is primarily targeted on Twitter, followed by Instagram. Every day, his account is populated with racial epithets and images of monkeys. While he has grown used to it \u2013 \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he says \u2013 he remains concerned about the effect the abuse is having on his family, who are not so used to the often grim nature of life in the public eye. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit old-school and I think the man of the house is supposed to protect the family, not put them in danger. But by me going out to provide for my family, I genuinely put them in danger of online abuse.\u201d When asked what the social media companies are doing about it, he is unequivocal. \u201cThe powers that be genuinely don\u2019t care,\u201d he says. Iffy Onuora \u2013 a former player and international manager and now a regional coach and equalities executive at the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association \u2013 agrees with Deeney\u2019s bleak assessment. \u201cWe\u2019re being strung along,\u201d he says of the social media companies\u2019 reactions. \u201cThey say all the right things at the right times, but they\u2019re not serious... Ultimately it\u2019s a business model that involves as much traffic as possible, and they\u2019ll do anything that will hold that.\u201d Twitter was routinely identified by players as the platform where they received the most persistent abuse. The site has also come under criticism for its handling of racism in a political context, most notably its reported reluctance to ban the accounts of white supremacists. Twitter itself has defended its position, noting the difficulty of the task and that it is putting less of a burden on users to report abuse. It states that over 50% of potentially abusive content is now proactively flagged for review by its teams. When contacted for comment, Twitter UK reiterated its firm commitment to working with a range of partners to address this issue. The chairman of one of those partners, Sanjay Bhandari of Kick It Out, is cautiously optimistic. \u201cThere are no silver bullets,\u201d he says, \u201cso there isn\u2019t one single initiative or plan\u2026 but there is one single mindset and that is about collaborating more\u201d \u2013 with social media companies and football\u2019s governing bodies. Shireen Ahmed, the writer, activist and co-host of the feminist sports podcast Burn It All Down, identifies a key reason for what she sees as a lack of urgency by social media companies to address online racism. \u201cThe head of the organisations that make the decisions are white men, and they will never empathise fully because they simply cannot,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can never, ever fully understand what\u2019s happening. And I\u2019ve learned this about my work on anti-oppression in sports, be it with Muslim women, or with women of colour. If the people at the decision-making table are not affected by this, then they\u2019re less likely to care. And that\u2019s a fact. Because they will never be moved in the way we need them to be.\u201d Ahmed points to organisations such as the Footie Black List, which celebrates African and Caribbean achievement in British football. \u201cWe find people of colour again helping and healing their own communities, because no one else will do it.\u201d Ahmed\u2019s concerns echo those of others \u2013 that it is black people who, despite being the victims of racism, are constantly expected to solve the problems that racism presents. What is more, the player is often more judged for the dignity and maturity of their response to abuse \u2013 how elegantly they conduct themselves, how well they play through the pain \u2013 than the person racially abusing them. * * * What is too rarely discussed is the devastating impact that racist abuse, whether online or offline, can have on footballers. Roberto Carlos, a World Cup winner with Brazil, heard all manner of insults in the course of his career, yet it was racism that affected him most. When playing in Russia for Anzhi Makhachkala, he had a banana thrown at him by a fan of a rival team, an action that reportedly reduced him to tears in the dressing room afterwards. Trent Alexander-Arnold, of Liverpool and England, notes that there is a significant difference between racist abuse and other types of derogatory comments that he receives from the stands. \u201cRacist abuse is more personal,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously we can\u2019t control what colour skin we are, so it\u2019s unfair to be mocked and to be victimised for something we can\u2019t control\u2026 You get used to the hostile environment at Old Trafford and European away games, and in big stadiums and finals, but it\u2019s a whole different feeling when there\u2019s a racial feel about it.\u201d Alexander-Arnold has thankfully received very little online racist abuse. He was there with Mings and Rashford during the game against Bulgaria, a fixture that was nearly called off due to bigoted chants and Nazi salutes from a section of the crowd. Gareth Southgate, England\u2019s manager, emerges with particular credit. \u201cHe was asking the players if they felt comfortable to carry on or not, even though he knew it wasn\u2019t directly his decision to make,\u201d says Alexander-Arnold. \u201cFor him to make those kinds of decisions under that pressure, to handle that situation, was obviously massive.\u201d The recurring theme seems to be that white executives \u2013 be they on the boards of football clubs or social media companies \u2013 need to do more to bring about progress in this area. They can do that both by hiring more non-white colleagues and by being more outspoken about it themselves. Southgate has been applauded for his efforts precisely because \u2013 despite stating that \u201cI\u2019m a middle-aged white guy speaking about racism, I find it a difficult subject to broach\u201d \u2013 he still persists in broaching it. The England manager is in the minority in that when racist incidents do occur, often the most striking thing is the silence of senior white figures within the game. Their loud and swift condemnation of this abuse, and their equally swift action, are essential if we are to move forward. The internet may be relatively new, but racism is a system that is centuries old. Still, when the PFA\u2019s Onuora looks at the united front that England players, both white and black, produced against Bulgaria, he sees room for optimism. At its core, he says, \u201cfootball is a meritocracy... On the pitch is the purest form of engagement, comradeship, competitiveness, togetherness. The great thing about England against Bulgaria was the solidarity. I played in an era where, if I got racially abused, people would not even mention it after the game. And these people \u2013 the Harry Kanes \u2013 they mentioned it before the game.\u201d Though aware of the significant work to be done, Onuora remains hopeful. \u201cIf we can extrapolate that spirit out into politics, into wider society, that togetherness from a group of people who have more in common than they will ever have apart, then we could do wonders.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>What a radiant week for fresh twists on familiar plays. The show-off dangers of radical adaptations are obvious, but a seizing-by-the-scruff-of-the-neck version can take you deep into the heart of the original.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theplayhousetheatre.co.uk/cyrano-bergerac\" title=\"\">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></strong> is newly ventriloquised in Martin Crimp\u2019s capering couplets, dazzlingly staged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/23/jamie-lloyd-theatre-director-interview-cyrano-betrayal-pinter-james-mcavoy\" title=\"\">Jamie Lloyd</a>. Edmond Rostand\u2019s play, written in 1897 but set in 1640, is rapped into the 21st century. Yet every fibre vibrates to Edmond Rostand\u2019s ideas about outward illusion, inner voices \u2013 and the spellbinding power of speech. It has a star at its centre \u2013 James McAvoy firecrackers across the stage \u2013 but its plea is for the importance not of celebrity but of art. You don\u2019t hear that very often these days.</p> <p>Rostand\u2019s plot \u2013 silver-tongued hero woos the woman he loves for his dull-witted chum \u2013 is truly rendered but stripped of most trad attributes. No hat-doffing, no arms akimbo, no bandy-legged swordfights. No outsize nose. McAvoy\u2019s Cyrano is propelled by a dynamic combination of confident display and unexplained self-doubt. He is a verbal volcano and a commanding presence, bunched up in black like a battery pack.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/23/jamie-lloyd-theatre-director-interview-cyrano-betrayal-pinter-james-mcavoy\">Jamie Lloyd: \u2018The reason Cyrano has endured is that we all have an insecurity\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fighting takes the form of poetry slams: combatants see each other off with great jousts of words. There is hardly any manly running around; there is often stillness; Soutra Gilmour\u2019s design \u2013 plywood walls and orange stackable chairs \u2013 is aggressively non-plumey and plain. Yet the stage is vibrant. Audience and actors are clinched together in \u2013 I can hardly believe it \u2013 rhyme: like two halves of a couplet. There is an excited, concentrated listening to Crimp\u2019s escalating rhyme feats: \u201cattitude\u201d swims into \u201clatitude\u201c then sends itself up with \u201cplatitude\u201d. You can get high on this stuff.</p> <p>Not least because Vaneeka Dadhria\u2019s magnificent beatboxing \u2013 gulping, pulsing, hissing, ticking \u2013 continuously gees up the rhythm. Beatbox (given another life I would try to make it my profession) is a rising theatrical force: brought to the National by the wonderful <a href=\"https://gracesavageofficial.com/\" title=\"\">Grace Savage</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/06/home-review-grace-savage-kingston-14-goldie-arcadia\" title=\"\">five years ago</a> and gloriously incarnated in BAC\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/01/the-inheritance-young-vic-frankenstein-battersea-arts-centre-review\" title=\"\">Frankenstein</a></em>. It is the ur-stage sound: made on the spot by human beings; both internal and explosive. And perfect as part of the landscape in a play about sound and words. These characters are their voices: when soldiers die they take off their mics.</p> <p>Anita-Joy Uwajeh is a wonderfully poised and edgy Roxane; Michele Austin a gorgeous, punchy presence, who puts the poetry into patisserie, as a gourmet maker of both lemon tarts and tart verses. Tom Edden also shines, delivering his rap with a gimlet sneer. This is the first of a new Jamie Lloyd season. It makes me agog for more.</p> <p><a href=\"https://directorsprogram.youngvic.org/member/956\" title=\"\">Rebecca Frecknall</a> is proving an exceptional reimaginer of familiar and neglected works. Last year her strung-out production of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/11/summer-and-smoke-patsy-ferran-macbeth-rory-kinnear-review\" title=\"\">Summer and Smoke</a> </em>shivered Tennessee Williams to his core. In tackling John Webster\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://almeida.co.uk/whats-on/the-duchess-of-malfi/2-dec-2019-18-jan-2020\" title=\"\">The Duchess of Malfi</a></strong>, she goes some way to remaking the playwright Bernard Shaw called \u201cthe Tussaud laureate\u201d.</p> <p>Frecknall finds \u2013 at least before the plot goes really bonkers gory in the second half \u2013 an unexpected stealth and stillness, and reveals a celebration of settled love before the expected riot of violence. Who would have thought the scenes between the Duch and her lover could be so delicate and so assured in their eroticism. Khalid Abdalla and Lydia Wilson, the knockout performances of the evening, meet for the first time in a lingering \u2013 so lingering it tingles with embarrassment \u2013 silence. She is intent, he is palpitating with nerves; they uncoil and wind around each other first with gestures and eventually with words. In this stripped-back text, clusters of phrases sing out new. This is a vital Webster paradox: in a brutal world \u2013 murdered children, taunting fake killings, splenetic, grotesquely strutting chaps \u2013 the manoeuvres of the brain trace ingenious and intricate verbal patterns.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12ce22e388907e0350c4187a128eaf40ed7f7361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12ce22e388907e0350c4187a128eaf40ed7f7361/0_0_5548_3699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lydia Wilson and Khalid Abdalla in The Duchess of Malfi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Stealth and stillness\u2019: Lydia Wilson and Khalid Abdalla in The Duchess of Malfi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chloe Lamford\u2019s design \u2013 using what is becoming an almost routine Almeida glass box \u2013 does not always live up to this intricacy. It makes its points: everyone is caged; everyone is on display; no one wants to be a Damien Hirst stuffed sheep, and people get a chance to claw against a glass wall. Why though \u2013 apart from the chill effect \u2013 is half the action apparently set in a latrine? Amid so much that is thought anew, some things are on automatic pilot, including some of the minor characters. Not though Leo Bill, who is an increasingly interesting, splutteringly truthful and doomed Bosola. Just when you think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jan/19/the-duchess-of-malfi-not-i-footfalls-rockaby-review\" title=\"\">Webster</a> is all torture and teasing he, as Frecknall shows, comes up with a subtle swerve.</p> <p>Inua Ellams\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/11/barber-shop-chronicles-dorfman-london-review-cut-above-the-rest\" title=\"\">Barber Shop Chronicles</a></em> has been one of the eye-opening wonders of the past few years. Whirling around the country until last week, it was powered into the National by the innovative <a href=\"https://fueltheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Fuel</a> theatre company. As is Ellams\u2019s new version of <strong><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/three-sisters\" title=\"\">Three Sisters</a></strong>, which transplants Chekhov\u2019s play to the Biafran war of the 1960s. His sisters long to return not to Moscow but to Lagos; their despair is projected not as lassitude but as frustrated power.</p> <p>Ellams\u2019s analysis of this crucial, seldom discussed war is rigorous: he exposes filthy work by the British and reveals extraordinary activism by Biafran women. The class division in Chekhov between old and new orders \u2013 skeweringly focused when the sisters sneer at their future sister-in-law\u2019s dress \u2013 becomes more violent and overt when seen as a clash between women belonging to different warring factions. What is gained is dramatic reverberation. What is lost is the sad twist at the centre of Chekhov, that being discriminating fades into discrimination: the exercises of taste entail snobbery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f5d7c324a5897a362e05f3daa4b157800e7d37f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5d7c324a5897a362e05f3daa4b157800e7d37f/0_66_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Niles (Lolo), Racheal Ofori (Udo) and Natalie Simpson (Nne Chukwu) in Three Sisters at the National.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Niles (Lolo), Racheal Ofori (Udo) and Natalie Simpson (Nne Chukwu) in Three Sisters at the National.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Davenport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has been one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/creativity-private-schools-uk-creative-industries-state\" title=\"\">Rufus Norris</a>\u2019s founding tenets as artistic director to make the National Theatre open to different voices and spectators. He succeeded on this press night: the subject was not geographically timid; the audience was not mostly white and middle-aged. Nor was it silent: Chekhov was repunctuated as the Lyttelton groaned and sighed at snubs and snogs.</p> <p>Vibrancy is in the air \u2013 but not always on the stage. Katrina Lindsay\u2019s set includes a fiercely glowing African bush and knockout costumes: buttercup yellow curvy, lime-green tent, marvellous snap-up handbag. Natalie Simpson is serpentine sardonic as the middle sister. But too much of the acting drags its feet: the audience respond before the performers react to each other. The dialogue is often swamped in explanation. There is a skinnier, swifter drama calling to be let out of this fascinating but over-deliberate play.

Cyrano de Bergerac is newly ventriloquised in Martin Crimp\u2019s capering couplets, dazzlingly staged by Jamie Lloyd. Edmond Rostand\u2019s play, written in 1897 but set in 1640, is rapped into the 21st century. Yet every fibre vibrates to Edmond Rostand\u2019s ideas about outward illusion, inner voices \u2013 and the spellbinding power of speech. It has a star at its centre \u2013 James McAvoy firecrackers across the stage \u2013 but its plea is for the importance not of celebrity but of art. You don\u2019t hear that very often these days. Rostand\u2019s plot \u2013 silver-tongued hero woos the woman he loves for his dull-witted chum \u2013 is truly rendered but stripped of most trad attributes. No hat-doffing, no arms akimbo, no bandy-legged swordfights. No outsize nose. McAvoy\u2019s Cyrano is propelled by a dynamic combination of confident display and unexplained self-doubt. He is a verbal volcano and a commanding presence, bunched up in black like a battery pack. Fighting takes the form of poetry slams: combatants see each other off with great jousts of words. There is hardly any manly running around; there is often stillness; Soutra Gilmour\u2019s design \u2013 plywood walls and orange stackable chairs \u2013 is aggressively non-plumey and plain. Yet the stage is vibrant. Audience and actors are clinched together in \u2013 I can hardly believe it \u2013 rhyme: like two halves of a couplet. There is an excited, concentrated listening to Crimp\u2019s escalating rhyme feats: \u201cattitude\u201d swims into \u201clatitude\u201c then sends itself up with \u201cplatitude\u201d. You can get high on this stuff. Not least because Vaneeka Dadhria\u2019s magnificent beatboxing \u2013 gulping, pulsing, hissing, ticking \u2013 continuously gees up the rhythm. Beatbox (given another life I would try to make it my profession) is a rising theatrical force: brought to the National by the wonderful Grace Savage five years ago and gloriously incarnated in BAC\u2019s Frankenstein. It is the ur-stage sound: made on the spot by human beings; both internal and explosive. And perfect as part of the landscape in a play about sound and words. These characters are their voices: when soldiers die they take off their mics. Anita-Joy Uwajeh is a wonderfully poised and edgy Roxane; Michele Austin a gorgeous, punchy presence, who puts the poetry into patisserie, as a gourmet maker of both lemon tarts and tart verses. Tom Edden also shines, delivering his rap with a gimlet sneer. This is the first of a new Jamie Lloyd season. It makes me agog for more. Rebecca Frecknall is proving an exceptional reimaginer of familiar and neglected works. Last year her strung-out production of Summer and Smoke shivered Tennessee Williams to his core. In tackling John Webster\u2019s The Duchess of Malfi, she goes some way to remaking the playwright Bernard Shaw called \u201cthe Tussaud laureate\u201d. Frecknall finds \u2013 at least before the plot goes really bonkers gory in the second half \u2013 an unexpected stealth and stillness, and reveals a celebration of settled love before the expected riot of violence. Who would have thought the scenes between the Duch and her lover could be so delicate and so assured in their eroticism. Khalid Abdalla and Lydia Wilson, the knockout performances of the evening, meet for the first time in a lingering \u2013 so lingering it tingles with embarrassment \u2013 silence. She is intent, he is palpitating with nerves; they uncoil and wind around each other first with gestures and eventually with words. In this stripped-back text, clusters of phrases sing out new. This is a vital Webster paradox: in a brutal world \u2013 murdered children, taunting fake killings, splenetic, grotesquely strutting chaps \u2013 the manoeuvres of the brain trace ingenious and intricate verbal patterns. Chloe Lamford\u2019s design \u2013 using what is becoming an almost routine Almeida glass box \u2013 does not always live up to this intricacy. It makes its points: everyone is caged; everyone is on display; no one wants to be a Damien Hirst stuffed sheep, and people get a chance to claw against a glass wall. Why though \u2013 apart from the chill effect \u2013 is half the action apparently set in a latrine? Amid so much that is thought anew, some things are on automatic pilot, including some of the minor characters. Not though Leo Bill, who is an increasingly interesting, splutteringly truthful and doomed Bosola. Just when you think Webster is all torture and teasing he, as Frecknall shows, comes up with a subtle swerve. Inua Ellams\u2019s Barber Shop Chronicles has been one of the eye-opening wonders of the past few years. Whirling around the country until last week, it was powered into the National by the innovative Fuel theatre company. As is Ellams\u2019s new version of Three Sisters, which transplants Chekhov\u2019s play to the Biafran war of the 1960s. His sisters long to return not to Moscow but to Lagos; their despair is projected not as lassitude but as frustrated power. Ellams\u2019s analysis of this crucial, seldom discussed war is rigorous: he exposes filthy work by the British and reveals extraordinary activism by Biafran women. The class division in Chekhov between old and new orders \u2013 skeweringly focused when the sisters sneer at their future sister-in-law\u2019s dress \u2013 becomes more violent and overt when seen as a clash between women belonging to different warring factions. What is gained is dramatic reverberation. What is lost is the sad twist at the centre of Chekhov, that being discriminating fades into discrimination: the exercises of taste entail snobbery. It has been one of Rufus Norris\u2019s founding tenets as artistic director to make the National Theatre open to different voices and spectators. He succeeded on this press night: the subject was not geographically timid; the audience was not mostly white and middle-aged. Nor was it silent: Chekhov was repunctuated as the Lyttelton groaned and sighed at snubs and snogs. Vibrancy is in the air \u2013 but not always on the stage. Katrina Lindsay\u2019s set includes a fiercely glowing African bush and knockout costumes: buttercup yellow curvy, lime-green tent, marvellous snap-up handbag. Natalie Simpson is serpentine sardonic as the middle sister. But too much of the acting drags its feet: the audience respond before the performers react to each other. The dialogue is often swamped in explanation. There is a skinnier, swifter drama calling to be let out of this fascinating but over-deliberate play. Sometimes adaptations need another adaptation.

We don\u2019t realise the profound effects it\u2019s having, putting up light domes over small farms or villages \u2013 places that had no light dome before \u2013 and transforming the night-time scene from something quite beautiful into something numbingly banal.\u201d</p> <p>The national park authority\u2019s plan is to do a \u201clighting audit\u201d of farms, pubs, campsites and other premises to improve the darkest areas, says Mike Hawtin, a senior park officer. It will potentially offer grants of up to \u00a32,500 \u2013 funded by Sirius Minerals, a local mining company \u2013 if it decides lighting needs to be replaced or shielded.</p> <p>Why is darkness so important? Stargazing is a vital human activity, according to Darn, and listening to him talk makes it hard not to share his enthusiasm for watching shooting stars and the expanse of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/01/most-detailed-ever-3d-map-of-milky-way-shows-warped-shape-cepheid\" title=\"\">Milky Way</a>, or knowing where to find the Andromeda galaxy.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we live in space is as profound as where you live in the country or Europe or the globe,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see miraculous things, and you start to think of how long the light\u2019s been travelling to get to your eye. And if you weren\u2019t out there, if you weren\u2019t somewhere dark, you wouldn\u2019t see them.\u201d</p> <p>But the soothing effect of watching the heavens is not the only reason why dark skies are being embraced by the national parks of the North York Moors, Northumberland, the South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales. There is growing evidence that lighting up the night is affecting biodiversity and the welfare of creatures both nocturnal and diurnal, while also leading to insomnia and other health issues for humans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0018f8a91422a3b1f9b5cb9278558f8e028da875\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0018f8a91422a3b1f9b5cb9278558f8e028da875/0_1677_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young Ralph\u2019s Cross, North York Moors national park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young Ralph\u2019s Cross, North York Moors national park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Bell/NYMNPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t trivial shifts \u2013 these are similar kinds of scales of shift as climate change produces,\u201d says Kevin Gaston, a professor of biodiversity and conservation, who runs the Ecolight project at Exeter University\u2019s Environment and Sustainability Institute.</p> <p>Huge numbers of species use daylight information as a clock, Gaston says. So birds may decide to migrate or lay eggs at a particular time of year, based on how much light there is. If they arrive too soon, before insect populations have boomed, they risk starvation. \u201cThe cues you might be using to decide when to lay your eggs and for nestings to emerge may be increasingly disconnected from when the food that you want to feed those chicks is actually available,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just birds. <a href=\"https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_580597_en.html\" title=\"\">Turtle hatchlings</a> can be disoriented by skyglow and move away from the sea. Insects attracted to light are easier prey, which <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_210332_en.html\" title=\"\">unbalances ecosystems</a>. The International Dark-Sky Association lists more than 2,600 studies on the impacts of artificial light on clownfish, mice, worms, bats, coral reefs, katydids and tree sparrows.</p> <p>Even short periods of light can have an impact. Memorial light beams at the site of the World Trade Center in New York are shone on one day a year, 11 September, but they lure as many as 160,000 migratory birds off course, circling the beams. Now they are switched off periodically to let the birds disperse. There\u2019s also evidence that the brighter, bluer street lights that replaced the orange glow of low-sodium lighting of the 1970s and 80s are having an impact on humans. A <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.7490\" title=\"\">study in South Korea</a> last year found an association between artificial light at night and the prescription of sleeping pills. There is already provision for local authorities to tackle light pollution, but they often lack the resources to do much about it, according to Emma Marrington of CPRE, the countryside charity. \u201cLighting can be a statutory nuisance in the same way that noise is,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you can complain if you\u2019ve got a real issue with the neighbours\u2019 security light, for example. The environmental health team should support you in monitoring the lighting and then mediating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"697b242d4684e6cd9c84d19b684a40b73d64bcd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/697b242d4684e6cd9c84d19b684a40b73d64bcd8/0_115_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star trails above Whitby pier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star trails above Whitby pier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Bulmer/Ebor Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>CPRE runs an <a href=\"https://takeaction.cpre.org.uk/page/48309/data/1?ea.tracking.id=lixloyan\" title=\"\">annual star count</a>, encouraging people to check light pollution in their area by asking how many of Orion\u2019s stars they can see. \u201cIf you can see fewer than 10, you\u2019re under severe light pollution but if it\u2019s more than 30 you\u2019ve got pristine night skies,\u201d Marrington says.</p> <p>Yet even people in cities can still find decent conditions to see events such as the annual Geminids meteor shower, which peaked is due to peak on the night of 14-15 December this year. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to travel thousands of miles to see the Milky Way or shooting stars,\u201d Darn says. \u201cSometimes just taking a walk in your local wood at night gives you an improvement straight away.

We don\u2019t realise the profound effects it\u2019s having, putting up light domes over small farms or villages \u2013 places that had no light dome before \u2013 and transforming the night-time scene from something quite beautiful into something numbingly banal.\u201d The national park authority\u2019s plan is to do a \u201clighting audit\u201d of farms, pubs, campsites and other premises to improve the darkest areas, says Mike Hawtin, a senior park officer. It will potentially offer grants of up to \u00a32,500 \u2013 funded by Sirius Minerals, a local mining company \u2013 if it decides lighting needs to be replaced or shielded. Why is darkness so important? Stargazing is a vital human activity, according to Darn, and listening to him talk makes it hard not to share his enthusiasm for watching shooting stars and the expanse of the Milky Way, or knowing where to find the Andromeda galaxy. \u201cWhere we live in space is as profound as where you live in the country or Europe or the globe,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see miraculous things, and you start to think of how long the light\u2019s been travelling to get to your eye. And if you weren\u2019t out there, if you weren\u2019t somewhere dark, you wouldn\u2019t see them.\u201d But the soothing effect of watching the heavens is not the only reason why dark skies are being embraced by the national parks of the North York Moors, Northumberland, the South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales. There is growing evidence that lighting up the night is affecting biodiversity and the welfare of creatures both nocturnal and diurnal, while also leading to insomnia and other health issues for humans. \u201cThese aren\u2019t trivial shifts \u2013 these are similar kinds of scales of shift as climate change produces,\u201d says Kevin Gaston, a professor of biodiversity and conservation, who runs the Ecolight project at Exeter University\u2019s Environment and Sustainability Institute. Huge numbers of species use daylight information as a clock, Gaston says. So birds may decide to migrate or lay eggs at a particular time of year, based on how much light there is. If they arrive too soon, before insect populations have boomed, they risk starvation. \u201cThe cues you might be using to decide when to lay your eggs and for nestings to emerge may be increasingly disconnected from when the food that you want to feed those chicks is actually available,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not just birds. Turtle hatchlings can be disoriented by skyglow and move away from the sea. Insects attracted to light are easier prey, which unbalances ecosystems. The International Dark-Sky Association lists more than 2,600 studies on the impacts of artificial light on clownfish, mice, worms, bats, coral reefs, katydids and tree sparrows. Even short periods of light can have an impact. Memorial light beams at the site of the World Trade Center in New York are shone on one day a year, 11 September, but they lure as many as 160,000 migratory birds off course, circling the beams. Now they are switched off periodically to let the birds disperse. There\u2019s also evidence that the brighter, bluer street lights that replaced the orange glow of low-sodium lighting of the 1970s and 80s are having an impact on humans. A study in South Korea last year found an association between artificial light at night and the prescription of sleeping pills. There is already provision for local authorities to tackle light pollution, but they often lack the resources to do much about it, according to Emma Marrington of CPRE, the countryside charity. \u201cLighting can be a statutory nuisance in the same way that noise is,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you can complain if you\u2019ve got a real issue with the neighbours\u2019 security light, for example. The environmental health team should support you in monitoring the lighting and then mediating.\u201d CPRE runs an annual star count, encouraging people to check light pollution in their area by asking how many of Orion\u2019s stars they can see. \u201cIf you can see fewer than 10, you\u2019re under severe light pollution but if it\u2019s more than 30 you\u2019ve got pristine night skies,\u201d Marrington says. Yet even people in cities can still find decent conditions to see events such as the annual Geminids meteor shower, which peaked is due to peak on the night of 14-15 December this year. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to travel thousands of miles to see the Milky Way or shooting stars,\u201d Darn says. \u201cSometimes just taking a walk in your local wood at night gives you an improvement straight away. You might not have a pristine dark sky, but you can have a night sky that\u2019s really aesthetically beautiful.\u201d",

If you\u2019re looking for an excuse to delay the Christmas shopping for yet another day, I\u2019m your man. Try this Santa suit on for size: <strong>day four of the first Test </strong>between Australia and New Zealand, the <strong>Presidents Cup</strong> reaches its denouement at Royal Melbourne (though, somewhat sadly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/14/patrick-reeds-caddie-in-physical-altercation-with-fan-at-presidents-cup\">without the involvement of Patrick Reed\u2019s caddie</a>), Newcastle take on Sydney FC in the <strong>W-League</strong>, Newcastle (same club, different players) are then in action again against Melbourne City in the <strong>A-League</strong>, and the <strong>Track Cycling World Cup</strong> round in Brisbane winds up today. And like any dodgy Father Christmas impersonator worth his salt, I might even have more in my stocking for you. So send the in-laws home, fill the fridge full of Kombucha and settle in for an afternoon and evening of sport, glorious sport. The shopping can wait.

      "bodyText": "So, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave proceedings. A terrific finish to round out round 10 of the A-League with Melbourne City putting on a masterclass. A bitter pill to swallow for home side Newcastle Jets who pulled out all stops in putting on a terrific home-game initiative with their teddy bear toss pre-game, but any pre-Christmas good cheer quickly dissipated for home fans. A good win the W-League too for Sydney FC, who put their own disappointing loss to City last week behind them, to keep the gap to just one-point at the top of the table. Remy Siemsen with a brace there to secure the points. A huge result in the Presidents Cup with a Tiger-led turnaround to win it or Team USA. Big news too from the UFC where Australia has its newest champion in Alex Volkanovski. And plenty more from plentywhere else (that sounds cromulent). Thanks for your company - we\u2019ll see you again next week on Sportwatch! Some interesting news out of the WBBL as well, where after the successful end to the fifth season there\u2019s now some talk of a potential expanded finals tournament for next year. Given some of the quality in the league (to think - no Ellyse Perry-led Sixers even making the top four) it\u2019s surely a decent shout - although the purists might suggest it devalues the top four? A quick update from Perth, where there\u2019s a review to see whether or not the visitors New Zealand are five-for. And this time it\u2019s Nathan Lyon doing the damage. Adam Collins has picked up the reins from Geoff Lemon, in the West: So - to flick round some sporting news from elsewhere: A big win in the WNBL, where it was the top-of-the-table showdown between the Southside Flyers (n\u00e9e Dandenong Rangers) and the Canberra Capitals. AAP\u2019s Daniel Gilhooly picks up the action from that one: The Southside Flyers have blasted through the Canberra Capitals\u2019 home fortress to win their table-topping WNBL clash 70-65 and extend their competition lead. Unbeaten at home for 16-straight games, the Capitals couldn\u2019t halt a late charge from the Victorian visitors, who won the final quarter 23-15. In a first visit to Canberra in their short history, the Flyers proved they will be hard to catch in the regular season after improving to 12-1 while Canberra slipped to 8-3 but clung on to second place. Guard Rebecca Cole scored a game-high 21 points for the winners, supported by Mercedes Russell\u2019s 17 points and 10 rebounds. Russell edged a titanic struggle with opposition centre Marianna Tolo, who was influential for Canberra, top-scoring with 16 points before fouling out. Hard to pick the top performers out there for Melbourne - the two Uruguayans, Luna and Cabrera both having hands down their best games in a City shirt. Replacement \u2018keeper Tom Glover had a near-faultless performance between the sticks, and not a bad performer in sky blue. They pin Sydney FC\u2019s lead back to five atop the table. Hard to see too many teams reeling them in this season, but on this showing - if anyone can, it\u2019s City. Circle December 29 in your diary therefore, as those two table toppers go head to head. A grim post-match interview for the 300-game warrior, Nikolai Topor Stanley, wearing the Newcastle Jets armband. \u201cWere you guys totally off, or were they totally on?\u201d \u201cOh probably a bit of both. They were in complete cruise control - we couldn\u2019t get near them - we didn\u2019t stick to our defensive plan, and you get punished against good teams.\u201d Ouch. 90 + 1 min: Just the three minutes added on, perhaps to the relief of home fans. A disappointing day out for the fine folk of the Hunter. The area is beset with horrific bushfires, and this game won\u2019t have done much to lift their collective spirits, alas. And there is the final whistle. It was a red-hot City side, catching a luke-warm Jets outfit stone cold, and the result from there looked inevitable. 88 min: Ooph! What a strike from fellow replacement Atkinson. They backed off the young right back, so he sized it up and curled an intelligent effort - but it cannons back off the post! A let off for the Jets - and he\u2019s denied a first-ever A-League goal, the long-time understudy to Ritchie de Laet. 84 min: It\u2019s Maclaren through on goal - that\u2019s the last thing home fans want to see - but the defensive line scrambles and manage to effect a block. That was a rare bit of uncertainty from the single-minded striker. Meanwhile, Wales completely fluffs his lines after a superb looping throughball from Brillante. It\u2019s an airswing from the Olyroo who just refuses to score (on the field) in 2019/20. He\u2019s had nine appearance and almost 500 minutes. De nada. Two thrillers from the NBL played out today - where Adelaide 36ers have shaded the Breakers at home in Auckland 96-99, and South East Melbourne Phoenix have overcome the Cairns Taipan in overtime 112-105. Here\u2019s the write up from the AAP: A freakish shooting display from John Roberson has inspired South East Melbourne Phoenix to a thrilling 112-105 overtime victory over Cairns Taipans. The Taipans fought back from 10 points down to lead by six in the closing stages of regulation at Melbourne Arena on Sunday before Roberson caught fire to earn the Phoenix a much-needed win. The import guard drilled two long-range bombs in the final 11 seconds to send the game into overtime then scored 15 points in the extra period to finish with 32, including 8-of-14 from three-point range. Mitch Creek tallied 25 points and nine rebounds while veteran guard Adam Gibson drilled five three-pointers in his 25-point haul as South East Melbourne improved their win-loss record to 7-7. A great result for the new club - the type that really build character. Can they build from this? 76 min: Good initiative from the youngster Langlois, who twists and turns and fashions a good shot inside the box, that\u2019s forced behind for a corner. Not bad for a replacement centre half. City defend their lines though, and Mombaerts makes his third and final change as Noone trots off and Atkinson join Wales and Berenguer as the fresh faces for Melbourne. A first showing of Berenguer for the season, it should be noted. The French import enduring an injury-ravaged start to his campaign - the minutes could do him the world of good here. 71 min: Josh Brillante tries a belter from distance, but it swerves away and doesn\u2019t force a save from Moss. Some lovely build up from City ahead of that. Has this been the best performance we\u2019ve seen from them this season? He\u2019s really got them humming, Erik Mombaerts. Especially after the drudgery of the Joyce years for this talent-laden squad. 66 min: Merrick empties his bench - it\u2019s Langlois on for Thurgate, Burns for Koutroumbis, and Ridenton also trots on for his 100th A-League appearance. It\u2019s a horrid day for landmarks for the Jets players: Topor\u2019s 300th, Ugarkovic also with his 100th for the club. A day to forget. Goal! Newcastle Jets 0-4 Melbourne City (Maclaren) 58 min: And guess who! It just had to be. 10 goals in six games - the fastest ever to double figures in A-League history - and that\u2019s 20 goals in 14 games for club and country in recent months. Jamie Maclaren. He is RED. HOT. And this is turning into a Rocky Horror Show for a club that has tried so hard to engender some Christmas cheer with its superb charity initiative. 55 min: Hello. It\u2019s an indirect free-kick, just inside the City box for the Jets - what was that for? Possibly a six-second violation from the \u2018keeper, Glover? When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve seen one of those given! Petratos eyes it, and if anyone can score from here, it\u2019s him. He thumps it - but straight into a wall of bodies! Danger averted. 53 min: Glen Moss rushes off his line, as the Jets are denied a clear shooting chance, which enables City to hit in transition. It was a dangerous long ball over the top for Maclaren, but only the awareness of the NZ-born shot-stopper denied the visitors a fourth there! Goal! Newcastle Jets 0-3 Melbourne City (Cabrera) 47 min: Ay, ay, ay! If one doesn\u2019t get you, the other does. It\u2019s a horrorshow made in Uruguay for the home fans - he\u2019s rarely started both Luna and Cabrera, Erik Mombaerts. He has today - and they\u2019ve rewarded him with three goals. It\u2019s a strike of the highest quality - Jets again are caught after a break in play, and with nobody closing down the Uruguayan he decides to take on the strike, and he absolutely fizzes that past Glen Moss. Woof! What a hit that was. Second half! Newcastle Jets 0-2 Melbourne City 45 min: We\u2019re back! The Fox commentary team had a half-time chat with Ernie Merrick and no mistaking his thoughts - he gave his side a rocket. Let\u2019s see how they respond. So some news from elsewhere, where remember we do have cycling action up in Brisbane with the Track Cycling World Cup. What a story this is - one of Australia\u2019s top cyclists cruelled ahead of Tokyo 2020 with a cancer diagnosis. If you missed the context to this, here\u2019s a terrific profile from my colleague Kieran Pender. What a gutsy effort and best of luck to Matthew in his treatment. And to the trans-Tasman Test - it\u2019s another big wicket and another scalp to Starc. What a match the big quick is having over at the WACA: A-League: Newcastle Jets 0-2 Melbourne City - half-time: 45 min: Some forlorn faces from the home side as the whistle blows - they haven\u2019t necessarily been poor, the home side, but they were hit but a furious opening from a team looking to bounce back from a bad loss and maintain their chase of table-toppers Sydney FC. Ernie Merrick no doubt with some choice words over the individual defending for those two goals conceded - can the Jets fight back from the canvas? And some news just in from the UFC. He sounds like an extra from the hit series Gladiator, but Australia\u2019s Alex Volkanovski is now officially a division champion: 41 min: Petratos with a sharp shot on the spin, but Glover once again gets his whole body behind it. No surprises that it\u2019s Newcastle\u2019s No10 at the heart of their best chances. With the ongoing injury to Wes Hoolahan and the absence of Arroyo today, so much sits on his shoulders. 38 min: A lovely interchange between Cabrera and Maclaren sees the Socceroo fire off a shot, but it\u2019s well-blocked by a Jets defender, at the expense of a corner. Newcastle defend it well, and Ugarkovic clears. 35 min: A close up on the normally reserved Ernie Merrick, but he is chewing wasps on the Jets bench. Just as his side looked to be gaining the slightest of footholds in this game they were sucker-punched. A win here and they could scoot into the top six. But on the showing of this opening thirty minutes that could be a bridge too far. Goal! Newcastle Jets 0-2 Melbourne City (Luna) 28 min: It\u2019s brilliant work from the centre half, Curtis Good, who recovers an overhit corner ball, plays back to Brillante who picks out a man in the middle - and would you believe it - fast after his second-ever A-League goal, a third! It\u2019s a lovely header home from the Uruguayan, and Moss in goals, was caught in no-man\u2019s land. 22 min: Genreau becomes the first man booked - the hugely experienced Alireza Faghani takes exception to his challenge, and replays suggest rightly so. Dimi Petratos tries the acrobatic effort - it\u2019s a sweet sweeping volley, but it\u2019s straight at Glover. Are there signs of life for the Jets after weathering a pulsating first 15 from the visitors? Now - a hell of a story from international football you may have missed this week. Check out this Bayern Munich photo and tell me what\u2019s up: Recognise anyone there? (Apart from Thomas Mueller, David Alaba, Robert Lewandowski etc) That\u2019s right - it\u2019s a Bundesliga debut for former A-League graduate Sarpreet Singh. From Phoenix to Bayern Munich. What an incredible story. 14 min: An important block by Koutroumbis - there\u2019s some lovely stuff happening in the front third from City today. They\u2019ve really come to play. Cabrera curls another tempting ball into the box, and it\u2019s another late run - but Genreau loops his header wide! Dangerous this for the Jets - they\u2019ve had to weather about 6-7 shots on goal already. 11 min: Maclaren fashions a chance from a very acute angle. There was little on but he did brilliantly, the Socceroo, to muscle his opponent, cut back in and fire a shot just over. Dimi Petratos at the other end has Glover stretching for a well-jinked cross - there\u2019s a nice cut and thrust developing to this one; you don\u2019t imagine that\u2019s the last goal we\u2019ll see today. 6 min: So. In the (approximate) words of Hatchet Harry - let\u2019s see the Jets\u2019 $%^&amp;ing cards. Have they got the mettle to hit straight back? Or could this turn into \u201cone of those days\u201d? Goal! Newcastle Jets 0-1 Melbourne City (Luna) 2 min: Oh my. Like a hot knife through butter - it\u2019s a late run from midfield from Cabrera\u2019s diminutive compatriot, Adrian Luna, and he tucks home a clever throughball ahead of an outrushing Glen Moss. Poor old Jets fans - they\u2019ve hardly found their seats and BANG. He seems more an encourager than a ranter, Mombaerts, but that\u2019s the start that speaks of a team with a bee in their bonnet. Wow. Kick off! Newcastle Jets v Melbourne City 1 min: And we\u2019re away! Jets get us going, and it\u2019s the visitors with the early touches at the back. Javier Cabrera with a very handy early cross, but Maclaren, for once, wasn\u2019t haring through on it. That was a beautiful ball from the Uruguayan - that could have been some start. But - back to A-League action, where our players are just out on the pitch and kick off can\u2019t be too far along. One huge call I missed mentioning earlier made by City\u2019s French coach Erik Mombaerts - goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis has been dropped with one-time Tottenham junior and Mariner Tom Glover coming in between the sticks. Big call, big day for him. It\u2019s one of many changes, Griffiths and Metcalfe also drop out after City were shocked 3-0 last weekend by then bottom-club, Perth Glory. And talking of another animal that many thought was stuffed - how about Tiger Woods. Honestly, has any sports star been written off more times than this bloke? If you\u2019re just catching up on the Presidents Cup golf - it\u2019s been an incredible final day turnaround from Team USA: the first team in 25 years to mount a final-day, back-nine comeback. And it all started with the Tiger. You just can\u2019t write this guy off. A big day for the Jets, who as we speak have CEO Lawrie McKinna arriving in the Westpac chopper dressed as Santa. You absolutely can\u2019t fault this club for their community engagement. If you saw the former mayor of Gosford\u2019s Twitter feed during the week, there is of course a \u201cteddy bear toss\u201d happening today. I can hand on heart say I\u2019m not au fait with that tradition. The wire from the Jets is that it\u2019s to encourage folk to donate bears for local charities for kids without anything for Christmas. Hats off to McKinna and the local Jets active support crew - that\u2019s wonderful stuff. So, without further ado, here\u2019s the starting XIs for tonight\u2019s final match from round 10 of the A-League: Newcastle Melbourne City He\u2019s been a terrific servant to the league, NTS - just the third player behind Andrew Durante and Leigh Broxham to bring up 300 A-League appearances. They\u2019ll need him at his best tonight the Jets, to marshall the sharpest shooter in the game right now: Jamie \u201cnine goals in five games\u201d Maclaren. Interesting to see both Uruguayans - Luna and Cabrera - getting the nod and a welcome return for Denis Genreau; what a talent he is, the young City midfielder. Don\u2019t forget there\u2019s still that little matter of cricket over in the West - it\u2019s day four and what a key breakthrough for the Aussies there. Geoff Lemon is your man keeping tabs on that one. Nathy Lyon, hey? Thanks Scott. Given those options, its a real toss up. I hope the rest of your day goes better than namesake Adam. How bout them Team USA, huh? We\u2019ve got A-League action ahead (funny how I always find myself in an Alliance-friendly bar come U Day..), some cycling action from Brisbane and whatever else the sporting gods deign to throw at us. But shake yourself because there\u2019s no time for torpor - it\u2019s time for Topor-Stanley: it\u2019s his 300th A-League appearance today don\u2019t you know, as Newcastle host Melbourne City. A thoroughly convincing win for Sydney FC, who did their title claims no harm at all and were value for much more than the scoreline indicates. The second half was end-to-end stuff, quite entertaining, and there were plenty of chances that could have gone in but didn\u2019t. Sofia Huerta, Amy Sayer and Veronica Latsko could each have had a goal or two, but in the end it was Remy Siemsen\u2019s brace that secured the three points and sent her to the top of the goal-scoring pops. That\u2019s me done for the day. I now leave you in the unquestionably safe - or should that be safely questionable? - hands of Sir Richard Parkin. He really is a sir. I saw it on his credit card. As Rampaging Roy Slaven would say, make of this what you will. Australia\u2019s Alex Volkanovski has scored an upset to win the UFC featherweight title with a unanimous points victory over American Max Holloway in Las Vegas. One judge gave every round to Volkanovski, scoring it 50-45 and the other two had the Australian winning 48-47. The 31-year-old from Windang on the NSW South coast, who is the first Australian-born fighter to win a UFC title, landed more strikes in each round and was particularly successful with kicks to Holloway\u2019s legs. - with thanks to AAP By any measure, WBBL05 was a resounding success. And it might get even better next season. How so? I\u2019m glad you ask. New Zealand are batting in Perth. They only need 468 to win. Will they do it? If in doubt, just ask Geoff. How on earth did the Internationals lose the Presidents Cup? It\u2019s the Tiger Touch, that\u2019s what it is. Woods has had a ripper of a year when, really, it looked like he was done and dusted as a force in golf. He\u2019s a flawed genius, but don\u2019t we just love flaws in our geniuses. W-League: Goal! Newcastle 0-2 Sydney FC (Remy Siemsen, 50\u2019) Oops. It was always a case of when, not if, the second goal would come, but it was difficult to envisage it happening this. Jets keeper Claire Coelho, so busy and so good in the first half, receives a back pass and, though the intention was to pass the ball on to a teammate, basically plants it at the feet of Remy Siemsen, who after licking her chops, pinching herself and buying a lotto ticket, cooly slots it home for her third brace of the season. Who\u2019d be a goalkeeper? W-League: HT: Newcastle 0-1 Sydney FC Sydney FC remain one goal to the good at half-time but it could have been far worse for the Jets. Sydney have dominated this encounter and had three gilt-edged chances go begging after Siemsen\u2019s strike on the half-hour. The clearest of them, the last play of the half, saw Foord miss (under some pressure) from directly in front. She\u2019s probably drill it home nine time out of ten, this occasion, obviously, being the odd one out. Still, if the match continues in this manner, Sydney FC will be in front by more than one goal come the final whistle. W-League: Goal! Newcastle 0-1 Sydney FC (Remy Siemsen, 31\u2019) The Jets keeper has had plenty to do and finally the dam wall breaks. Angelique Hristodoulou whips in a dangerous cross from the right and Remy Siemsen weaves her way through a flat-footed Newcastle defence to head home for the game\u2019s first goal. And it was coming. W-League: 28 mins: Newcastle 0-0 Sydney FC Brilliant save! Teresa Polias wins a hard ball for Sydney FC, about 30 metres out from the Newcastle goal, and her full-blooded shot draws an acrobatic save from Jets keeper Claire Coelho, who tips the ball over the bar. Quality football all round. Scotty James wins halfpipe World Cup event Three-time snowboarding world champion Scotty James has started off the northern hemisphere season in much the same way as he completed the last - with a resounding win. The Melbourne halfpipe rider, who won every major event in 2018/19, took out the US Open Grand Prix in Copper Mountain, Colorado this morning. It marked consecutive wins at the event for the 25 year-old. The three-time Winter Olympian led the field with a 96 point first run in challenging snow and flat light and held that advantage for the rest of the event with a simple victory lap on his third and final run. \u201cI definitely put some added pressure on myself after last year with some big expectations\u201d said James, who recently took out the Australian Institute of Sport male athlete of the year award. \u201cI had to iron those emotions over and just come out with a clear head and approach it as a new season. The elements weren\u2019t in our favour today but everyone rode really well and I knew they were going to, so I had to bring it today.\u201d Yuto Totsuka (JPN) took silver with 94.5 and Ruka Hirano (JPN) took bronze with 89.25. James, the bronze medallist in the halfpipe at last year\u2019s Winter Olympics, will now travel to Secret Garden in China for the next FIS World Cup. - with thanks to AAP W-League: 6 mins: Newcastle 0-0 Sydney FC Players are still finding their feet at McDonald Jones Stadium. There was a bit of spice early, not to mention some nerves for Newcastle, with Claire Coelho forced into a save from Alanna Kennedy\u2019s header. Not a serious threat but a notice of intent all the same. The USA have completed a historic Presidents Cup triumph over the Internationals at Royal Melbourne. Led by inspirational playing captain Tiger Woods, the US turned a 10-8 overnight deficit into cup glory after dominating Sunday\u2019s singles session. Wins for Woods, Dustin Johnson, Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele and the maligned Patrick Reed, two halved matches plus a guaranteed half point for Matt Kuchar were enough to secure the star-studded Americans a 16-14 victory. Kuchar, who had lost all four of his previous Presidents Cup singles encounters, clinched victory with a birdie on the 17th hole to go one up against Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen had been three up at the turn before Kuchar produced a tenacious back-nine comeback as the US became the first team in the event\u2019s 25-year history to win the Cup after trailing into the final day. Woods sparked the US fightback when he downed the Internationals\u2019 previously unbeaten spearhead Abraham Ancer three-and-two in the opening singles match. In doing so, the 15-times major champion became the most prolific winner in Presidents Cup history, surpassing countryman and career-long rival Phil Mickelson\u2019s 26 victories in the matchplay competition. - with thanks to AAP What\u2019s this talk about New Zealand batting for nigh on two days to save, or even win, the first Test against Australia? Puuuuurrrrrlease! That would be something else. That said, this is sport and stranger things have happened. Day four is about to get under way in Perth. Geoff Lemon is the man in the central commentary position. Enjoy! Presidents Cup update - Tiger\u2019s on fire, here come the USA The USA are closing in on a historic Presidents Cup comeback win over the Internationals at Royal Melbourne. Victories in Sunday\u2019s deciding singles matches for inspirational playing captain Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and the maligned Patrick Reed turned the Americans\u2019 10-8 overnight deficit into a one-point lead. But the 11-10 advantage was significantly more as the star-studded US team controlled several other matches. Woods became the most prolific winner in Presidents Cup history in downing the Internationals\u2019 previously unbeaten spearhead Abraham Ancer three and two in the opening singles match. Woods\u2019 seven birdies saw him complete the week with a perfect three-from-three record. The 15-time major champion\u2019s 27th President Cup match win also eclipsed fellow American Phil Mickelson\u2019s 26. Johnson was never threatened in a four-and-three victory over Cup rookie Haotong Li that locked the scores up at 10-all. Defeat for Li earned the Chinese youngster a dubious place in the history books as the only International player not to contribute even half a point at the 2019 edition. - with thanks to AAP Speaking of the cricket, how about this: Peter Siddle a bolter to play for Australia in the Boxing Day Test? Hmmm. That is a surprise. I know he\u2019s only 35 but it seems like he\u2019s been playing professional cricket that long. I\u2019ll eat my baggy green if he nudges in front of James Pattinson but I\u2019ve been wrong before. Regardless, I\u2019m sure Pete is finding room for an extra banana or two a day just in case he gets the call. Did I say I had more for you or did I not say I had more for you? Terence Crawford and Egidijus Kavaliauskas are right now punching each other\u2019s lights out at Madison Square Garden. Well, what are you doing here? Off you go (but please come back). Happy Sunday, sports fans. If you\u2019re looking for an excuse to delay the Christmas shopping for yet another day, I\u2019m your man. Try this Santa suit on for size: day four of the first Test between Australia and New Zealand, the Presidents Cup reaches its denouement at Royal Melbourne (though, somewhat sadly, without the involvement of Patrick Reed\u2019s caddie), Newcastle take on Sydney FC in the W-League, Newcastle (same club, different players) are then in action again against Melbourne City in the A-League, and the Track Cycling World Cup round in Brisbane winds up today. And like any dodgy Father Christmas impersonator worth his salt, I might even have more in my stocking for you. So send the in-laws home, fill the fridge full of Kombucha and settle in for an afternoon and evening of sport, glorious sport. The shopping can wait. If you\u2019d like to get in touch, send me an email or a tweet.",

      "body": "<p>I love being the hunter. The one in pursuit. In training, I\u2019ll latch on to the boys and chase them down. Even when I was younger, I tended to race girls who were older than me \u2013 at 17 I was racing 30-year-olds. It\u2019s where I\u2019m comfortable. But the hunter can go on to become the hunted. And this summer at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-athletics-championships\" title=\"\">World Athletics Championships</a> in Doha, Qatar, I won gold in the 200m. At 23, I became the first British woman to win a world championship sprinting title.</p> <p>I had no idea there was so much excitement back in the UK after my win. Growing up in Orpington, southeast London, and training for years with the <a href=\"http://www.bandbhac.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Blackheath &amp; Bromley Harriers</a>, I never once imagined the fuss that would come as a result of running fast. It\u2019s a change I\u2019ve had to mentally adjust to. The morning after the race, I was in the media tent and someone told me that I\u2019d been mentioned in parliament and while that was, of course, lovely and exciting, I was so surprised. But I often have to separate myself from all the noise to keep focused on what\u2019s most important to me.</p> <p>Track and field is a mental game. It\u2019s about continuing to work and work when nobody\u2019s watching. It can get repetitive and insular. You\u2019re in your own little world, competing to be the person who can run the fastest in a straight line. My job is to take my body to a place where I think it can\u2019t do any more and then keep going. To do that, I need to intimately know my strengths and weaknesses, and be willing to get better at the things I know I\u2019m crap at. For me, I never used to be physically strong. I could run fast, but would wobble like a worm if I tried to do a push-up. In elite sport, even if you start to think you\u2019re as good as you can be, you look for areas to improve.</p> <p>People get caught up in embarrassment or shame when they\u2019re not good at something, but I just don\u2019t have that in me. I do have a voice in my head that tells me if I\u2019m not good at things, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel negative about myself. I use it to identify where I can improve and then I just keep going to training every day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I go into my own world for four weeks before a major race</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Leading into a major championship, I go into my own world for the four weeks beforehand. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned through sprinting. When you know everything\u2019s riding on 11 seconds, whatever\u2019s distracting you \u2013 whether it\u2019s some boy not texting you back (not that that\u2019s something I think about often!) or a friend being angry with you \u2013 you clear your mind of it until an appropriate time. As a race is about to start, all I\u2019m thinking about is winning and the things I can control. Thoughts like, \u201cOh, that headwind is hard,\u201d are legitimate, but if I can\u2019t change it, worrying about it won\u2019t help me. We have a saying, \u201cControl the controllable.\u201d</p> <p>I live for the moment just before a race in a big stadium. When we\u2019re all standing on the line, I feel the pressure and I\u2019m all over it. Even when I\u2019m watching football, my favourite bit is the penalties. In those seconds, you get to see what people are made of. For spectators, sprinting is one of the most intense sports events because the margins are so small. For us competitors, there\u2019s really nowhere to hide from the work you haven\u2019t done. If you haven\u2019t been eating right or if you\u2019ve had a hole in your training, when the gun goes, it shows. And that benefits me because I work so hard.</p> <p>A lot of my confidence comes from my relationship with my parents. I\u2019ve also inherited personality traits from both of them that help me in my career. My mum is excitable and when I\u2019m on the track, I have her fire \u2013 wanting to go for everything. I always know when I finish a race that I can turn around and find her in the front row, jumping up and down. My dad is more reserved. He has a cool exterior and that\u2019s useful for me when I need composure. I know to look for him a few rows behind my mum.</p> <p>Growing up, I was the only child in the house (I have a half-brother who didn\u2019t live with us) and the three of us were tight knit. They saw that I enjoyed sport and I was fortunate that around their full-time jobs, they gave me opportunities to try whatever I was interested in. When I wanted to try golf, my dad bought me cut-down clubs and had me attempting to putt balls in the back garden. My mum used to play hockey with me outside the house. They took me to so many clubs and classes. I don\u2019t live with them now, but we speak every day and I see them at least three times a week.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I separate my dreams from other people\u2019s as they rarely align</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I started training with my coach, John Blackie, in my mid-teens. We met when I was eight as he ran the kids\u2019 academy at my running club. Along with my parents, the three of them always emphasised that they just wanted me to be happy. They never pushed me too early or for their own egos. And, as I\u2019ve got older, I\u2019ve realised that\u2019s unique. When running became serious, I knew that if it all stopped being fun for me, I could stop doing it. They put Dina the person before Dina the runner.</p> <p>As my career\u2019s progressed, making difficult decisions has helped me understand myself better. I broke my foot in February 2018, five months before the World Championships were due to take place in London. I knew that the rehab should take six to 12 months, but I also knew that I really wanted to run in front of a home crowd. I spoke to my team about doing the rehab in two to three months. I was risking causing career damage to my foot. But I knew my body healed quickly and my doctor told me that while it would be physically and emotionally hard, he thought I could do it. I meticulously calculated my decision and although the cons outweighed the pros, I felt adamant that with support and being careful, we could get it right. It paid off.</p> <p>Being as prepared as I can be is crucial as it keeps me calm and able to deliver in the moment. When I was studying history at uni I\u2019d choose exams over coursework because I knew I could put the work in and perform under pressure. My degree also helped me keep what I\u2019m doing in perspective. I was studying heavy things every day, like people facing prejudice because of their skin tone or sexuality, or women sacrificing their lives for others to have the right to vote. It made me realise how lucky I am that the thing that gets me most frustrated is somebody beating me on the track. While, yes, I make sacrifices \u2013 some easy, such as not drinking and going out, and some harder, like restricting the food that I eat \u2013 ultimately, what I do is entertainment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I make sure I take time for myself. That means relaxing with facemasks and binge-watching Netflix</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While I take what I do very seriously, if it doesn\u2019t go well, I don\u2019t take it personally. What really matters to me isn\u2019t going to change. Yes, the public might be disappointed and the newspapers might have a pop, but my parents and friends are still going to love me, and my coach is still going to be there. That knowledge allows me to stay relaxed under pressure.</p> <p>Nobody goes into sport as a career for the fame, it\u2019s too hard. Especially track. I do it because I love it and want to be the best. I never once thought I\u2019d get on a train and be recognised by people and be asked to sign tickets. It\u2019s lovely and I get to have a nice chat, but sometimes it can be overwhelming. So I make sure I take time for myself. I live on my own and for a day or two I\u2019ll just do me. That means relaxing with facemasks and binge-watching Netflix.

      "bodyText": "I love being the hunter. The one in pursuit. In training, I\u2019ll latch on to the boys and chase them down. Even when I was younger, I tended to race girls who were older than me \u2013 at 17 I was racing 30-year-olds. It\u2019s where I\u2019m comfortable. But the hunter can go on to become the hunted. And this summer at the World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, I won gold in the 200m. At 23, I became the first British woman to win a world championship sprinting title. I had no idea there was so much excitement back in the UK after my win. Growing up in Orpington, southeast London, and training for years with the Blackheath &amp; Bromley Harriers, I never once imagined the fuss that would come as a result of running fast. It\u2019s a change I\u2019ve had to mentally adjust to. The morning after the race, I was in the media tent and someone told me that I\u2019d been mentioned in parliament and while that was, of course, lovely and exciting, I was so surprised. But I often have to separate myself from all the noise to keep focused on what\u2019s most important to me. Track and field is a mental game. It\u2019s about continuing to work and work when nobody\u2019s watching. It can get repetitive and insular. You\u2019re in your own little world, competing to be the person who can run the fastest in a straight line. My job is to take my body to a place where I think it can\u2019t do any more and then keep going. To do that, I need to intimately know my strengths and weaknesses, and be willing to get better at the things I know I\u2019m crap at. For me, I never used to be physically strong. I could run fast, but would wobble like a worm if I tried to do a push-up. In elite sport, even if you start to think you\u2019re as good as you can be, you look for areas to improve. People get caught up in embarrassment or shame when they\u2019re not good at something, but I just don\u2019t have that in me. I do have a voice in my head that tells me if I\u2019m not good at things, but it doesn\u2019t make me feel negative about myself. I use it to identify where I can improve and then I just keep going to training every day. Leading into a major championship, I go into my own world for the four weeks beforehand. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned through sprinting. When you know everything\u2019s riding on 11 seconds, whatever\u2019s distracting you \u2013 whether it\u2019s some boy not texting you back (not that that\u2019s something I think about often!) or a friend being angry with you \u2013 you clear your mind of it until an appropriate time. As a race is about to start, all I\u2019m thinking about is winning and the things I can control. Thoughts like, \u201cOh, that headwind is hard,\u201d are legitimate, but if I can\u2019t change it, worrying about it won\u2019t help me. We have a saying, \u201cControl the controllable.\u201d I live for the moment just before a race in a big stadium. When we\u2019re all standing on the line, I feel the pressure and I\u2019m all over it. Even when I\u2019m watching football, my favourite bit is the penalties. In those seconds, you get to see what people are made of. For spectators, sprinting is one of the most intense sports events because the margins are so small. For us competitors, there\u2019s really nowhere to hide from the work you haven\u2019t done. If you haven\u2019t been eating right or if you\u2019ve had a hole in your training, when the gun goes, it shows. And that benefits me because I work so hard. A lot of my confidence comes from my relationship with my parents. I\u2019ve also inherited personality traits from both of them that help me in my career. My mum is excitable and when I\u2019m on the track, I have her fire \u2013 wanting to go for everything. I always know when I finish a race that I can turn around and find her in the front row, jumping up and down. My dad is more reserved. He has a cool exterior and that\u2019s useful for me when I need composure. I know to look for him a few rows behind my mum. Growing up, I was the only child in the house (I have a half-brother who didn\u2019t live with us) and the three of us were tight knit. They saw that I enjoyed sport and I was fortunate that around their full-time jobs, they gave me opportunities to try whatever I was interested in. When I wanted to try golf, my dad bought me cut-down clubs and had me attempting to putt balls in the back garden. My mum used to play hockey with me outside the house. They took me to so many clubs and classes. I don\u2019t live with them now, but we speak every day and I see them at least three times a week. I started training with my coach, John Blackie, in my mid-teens. We met when I was eight as he ran the kids\u2019 academy at my running club. Along with my parents, the three of them always emphasised that they just wanted me to be happy. They never pushed me too early or for their own egos. And, as I\u2019ve got older, I\u2019ve realised that\u2019s unique. When running became serious, I knew that if it all stopped being fun for me, I could stop doing it. They put Dina the person before Dina the runner. As my career\u2019s progressed, making difficult decisions has helped me understand myself better. I broke my foot in February 2018, five months before the World Championships were due to take place in London. I knew that the rehab should take six to 12 months, but I also knew that I really wanted to run in front of a home crowd. I spoke to my team about doing the rehab in two to three months. I was risking causing career damage to my foot. But I knew my body healed quickly and my doctor told me that while it would be physically and emotionally hard, he thought I could do it. I meticulously calculated my decision and although the cons outweighed the pros, I felt adamant that with support and being careful, we could get it right. It paid off. Being as prepared as I can be is crucial as it keeps me calm and able to deliver in the moment. When I was studying history at uni I\u2019d choose exams over coursework because I knew I could put the work in and perform under pressure. My degree also helped me keep what I\u2019m doing in perspective. I was studying heavy things every day, like people facing prejudice because of their skin tone or sexuality, or women sacrificing their lives for others to have the right to vote. It made me realise how lucky I am that the thing that gets me most frustrated is somebody beating me on the track. While, yes, I make sacrifices \u2013 some easy, such as not drinking and going out, and some harder, like restricting the food that I eat \u2013 ultimately, what I do is entertainment. While I take what I do very seriously, if it doesn\u2019t go well, I don\u2019t take it personally. What really matters to me isn\u2019t going to change. Yes, the public might be disappointed and the newspapers might have a pop, but my parents and friends are still going to love me, and my coach is still going to be there. That knowledge allows me to stay relaxed under pressure. Nobody goes into sport as a career for the fame, it\u2019s too hard. Especially track. I do it because I love it and want to be the best. I never once thought I\u2019d get on a train and be recognised by people and be asked to sign tickets. It\u2019s lovely and I get to have a nice chat, but sometimes it can be overwhelming. So I make sure I take time for myself. I live on my own and for a day or two I\u2019ll just do me. That means relaxing with facemasks and binge-watching Netflix. I\u2019m currently watching Pose and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race (I\u2019m so into drag culture), Greenleaf (a drama about family and deceit in an American super-church), and Bake Off. I keep thinking I\u2019ll learn to meditate, but I haven\u2019t got round to it.

      "body": "<p>As any saver will tell you, these are bleak times. And it could be set to get worse next year. Last month, the prospect of another drop in interest rates increased when two members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which decides on the official rate, called for an immediate cut.</p> <p>It is now expected by sections of the financial markets that the rate will drop by 0.25% next year, even though it has been at rock-bottom levels for the last decade. So what should anyone who wants to make some money from their savings to do?</p> <h2>Stay with cash</h2> <p>Rates on the high street vary hugely \u2013 on a balance of \u00a310,000, the amount of interest that it is possible to earn goes from \u00a310 to \u00a3145. The lesson? Shop around, don\u2019t be limited by the mainstream banks, and be sure to look at those providers that may be less familiar.</p> <p>HSBC\u2019s easy-access Flexible Saver will garner just 0.15% while Goldman Sachs\u2019 online savings account will bring in 1.45%.</p> <p>However, Rachel Springall of <a href=\"https://moneyfacts.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Moneyfacts.co.uk</a>, warns savers to be vigilant. \u201c[They] need to be swift to take advantage of the most lucrative rates, as these can be withdrawn, or cut, in a short space of time. The challenger banks continue to hold prominent positions in the top-rate tables and I would imagine this remains the case in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cEven if we see no base rate changes in 2020, rates on savings can change regardless.\u201d</p> <h2>Fix for the future</h2> <p>Against this background, there could be some security in depositing money in a fixed-rate account where it can\u2019t be accessed for a set period, but the rate remains the same no matter what the Bank of England decides. But rates on these have also been dropping. One-year deals from Atom Bank or Tandem Bank were offering 2.05% last year, but the best rates have now dropped below 2%.</p> <p>Despite this, Anna Bowes of <a href=\"https://savingschampion.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Savings Champion</a> says they are still paying more than easy-access accounts, as once deposited you cannot normally withdraw your funds until maturity. \u201cThe best one-year fixed-rate bond is from Zenith Bank at 1.75%, whilst the best three-year is UBL at 2.20%,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Observers suggest hedging your bets by putting some money into easy-access accounts, in case rates go up, and the rest into fixed-rate bonds for any higher returns.</p> <p>Bowes says that notice accounts (where you have to give the bank notice that you want to withdraw money) can also be a good way of squeezing as much interest as possible on funds that you don\u2019t need immediately, but don\u2019t want to tie up for longer periods. She adds: \u201cBLME is paying 1.71% AER on its 90-Day Notice Account \u2013 so almost as much as a one-year fixed-rate bond. You can access the money with just three months\u2019 notice. Note that notice accounts are variable rate accounts, so the rates could be cut.\u201d</p> <h2>Keep it in property</h2> <p>Ongoing uncertainty about Brexit has meant a distinct slowdown in the UK property market.

      "bodyText": "As any saver will tell you, these are bleak times. And it could be set to get worse next year. Last month, the prospect of another drop in interest rates increased when two members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which decides on the official rate, called for an immediate cut. It is now expected by sections of the financial markets that the rate will drop by 0.25% next year, even though it has been at rock-bottom levels for the last decade. So what should anyone who wants to make some money from their savings to do? Stay with cash Rates on the high street vary hugely \u2013 on a balance of \u00a310,000, the amount of interest that it is possible to earn goes from \u00a310 to \u00a3145. The lesson? Shop around, don\u2019t be limited by the mainstream banks, and be sure to look at those providers that may be less familiar. HSBC\u2019s easy-access Flexible Saver will garner just 0.15% while Goldman Sachs\u2019 online savings account will bring in 1.45%. However, Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts.co.uk, warns savers to be vigilant. \u201c[They] need to be swift to take advantage of the most lucrative rates, as these can be withdrawn, or cut, in a short space of time. The challenger banks continue to hold prominent positions in the top-rate tables and I would imagine this remains the case in 2020. \u201cEven if we see no base rate changes in 2020, rates on savings can change regardless.\u201d Fix for the future Against this background, there could be some security in depositing money in a fixed-rate account where it can\u2019t be accessed for a set period, but the rate remains the same no matter what the Bank of England decides. But rates on these have also been dropping. One-year deals from Atom Bank or Tandem Bank were offering 2.05% last year, but the best rates have now dropped below 2%. Despite this, Anna Bowes of Savings Champion says they are still paying more than easy-access accounts, as once deposited you cannot normally withdraw your funds until maturity. \u201cThe best one-year fixed-rate bond is from Zenith Bank at 1.75%, whilst the best three-year is UBL at 2.20%,\u201d she says. Observers suggest hedging your bets by putting some money into easy-access accounts, in case rates go up, and the rest into fixed-rate bonds for any higher returns. Bowes says that notice accounts (where you have to give the bank notice that you want to withdraw money) can also be a good way of squeezing as much interest as possible on funds that you don\u2019t need immediately, but don\u2019t want to tie up for longer periods. She adds: \u201cBLME is paying 1.71% AER on its 90-Day Notice Account \u2013 so almost as much as a one-year fixed-rate bond. You can access the money with just three months\u2019 notice. Note that notice accounts are variable rate accounts, so the rates could be cut.\u201d Keep it in property Ongoing uncertainty about Brexit has meant a distinct slowdown in the UK property market. Fluctuations in supply and sales have resulted in more muted gains that many investors were used to before the 2016 vote. \u201cImmediately prior to the referendum, the annual growth rate of the average UK property was over 8% but, as of September 2019, fell under 1%, well below the rate of inflation. In England, in particular, the annual growth rate has steadily declined since June 2016,\u201d says Damien Fahy of Moneytothemasses.com. Any further uncertainty means that there could be a continuation of the same trend next year, he adds. A recent poll of property analysts by Reuters said house-price rises in Britain won\u2019t keep pace with already-low inflation until 2021. The Conservative majority could now result in buyers that had been hesitant to invest coming out of the shadows. As David Hollingworth of L&amp;C Mortgages, says: \u201cAs more clarity emerges in the outlook for exiting the EU it could, potentially, bring some enhanced demand from buyers that had been biding their time. For example, there may be some sitting on their hands while waiting to see if any changes to stamp duty materialise in a budget. \u201cHowever, any return of confidence is likely to be gradual, so we should probably expect to see more of the same in the coming year.\u201d Those who want to put their money into property funds should tread cautiously, warns Fahy. \u201cInvestors may be tempted by commercial property funds but beware of those investing directly into physical property, as opposed to the shares of property companies. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the M&amp;G Property Portfolio shut its doors as investors rush to withdraw money from \u2018physical\u2019 property unit trusts, as they did in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.

How had it happened? I had spent the previous evening at Fishburn Working Men\u2019s Club, a mile down the road from Tony Blair\u2019s old constituency home, asking that question. Downstairs, in the party room, there is a battle-worn miners\u2019 banner in a glass case bearing the stern face of Keir Hardie; it is brought out each year to head the Durham miners\u2019 parade. On the walls of the main bar, there are paintings of the former Fishburn colliery which once employed nearly every family in this village and, in pride of place, above the red leather seating, a solemn tableau of the \u201cpits closed by the Tories\u201d, row upon row of lost mines, each with its symbolic badge of arms.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c894a405e04657782164c88ee011cb79cef98309\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c894a405e04657782164c88ee011cb79cef98309/0_560_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Arthur Hudspeth, 91, a former miner, at the The Fishburn Social Club.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arthur Hudspeth, 91, a former miner, at the Fishburn Social Club.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Underneath this memorial, on Friday night, regulars at the club for 40 and 50 years explained to me, one after the other, how for the first time in their lives they had voted Conservative at this election.</p> \n<p>That collective shift of will in Sedgefield saw the most formidable of Labour majorities crumble to a defeat for Phil Wilson, \u201cthe heir to Blair\u201d. Blair remains an honorary member at Fishburn I\u2019m told (\u201cthough possibly lapsed\u201d); he won a majority of 25,000 in 1997. The Labour vote this time around was only 15,000 in total. When the news had come through at 3.30am, midway through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/jeremy-corbyn-very-sad-at-election-defeat-but-feels-proud-of-manifesto\" title=\"\">Corbyn\u2019s statement of defeat</a>, the Conservative campaign headquarters pumped Things Can Only Get Better through its loudspeakers.</p> \n<p>Wilson\u2019s father was a miner in the Fishburn colliery. His own speech conceding defeat to Paul Howell, a retired accountant who also grew up in the constituency, could hardly have been more direct in apportioning blame.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you are on the doorstep and one person mentions Brexit, but five people mention the leader of the Labour party for being the reason they are not going to vote for you, then things need to change. I believe that the leader of the Labour party should not be resigning today, he should have resigned a long time ago.\u201d</p> \n<p>Any Momentum diehard who doubts the truth of that sentiment up here should come and talk to the Fishburn regulars. Arthur Hudspeth is playing the fruit machine in the social club. He recently celebrated his 91st birthday. He went down the pit at 14 in 1942 and worked in mines until his retirement at 65. The only two years he missed were for his national service: \u201cfirst battalion of the Durhams\u201d he tells me, looking me in the eye. He has voted Labour without fail in every election since Attlee\u2019s victory in 1945, but not this time. He is ashamed to say he didn\u2019t vote at all, but winces at the mention of Corbyn\u2019s name and shakes his head. Why? \u201cRubbish. He\u2019s not my kind of man. Not strong enough. He doesn\u2019t understand us here.\u201d</p> \n<p>To start to unpack what Hudspeth means, you need to look in the dominoes room of the Fishburn Club. The symbolic decoration here is provided by the plaques and banners not of mines but of local regiments. It is this strand of the collective memory to which Corbyn, as Labour leader, appears to have had nothing to say.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5de171281195efb513b95c45d840fe5584072144\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5de171281195efb513b95c45d840fe5584072144/0_0_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"A display indicating all the pits closed by the Tories at the Fishburn Working Men\u2019s Club.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A display indicating all the pits closed by the Tories at the Fishburn Working Men\u2019s Club.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Talking to regulars the same allegations surface again and again. That Corbyn consorted with the IRA, that he is soft on terrorists. That he has remained silent on prosecuting veterans over the Bloody Sunday killings. The leader\u2019s shifting agnosticism on Brexit, in this context, is portrayed as yet another failure of patriotism, just as symbolic as his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/15/jeremy-corbyn-silent-during-national-anthem-battle-of-britain-service\" title=\"\">unforgivable reluctance to sing God save the Queen</a> at a Battle of Britain remembrance service.</p> \n<p>Tom Blenkinsop, the former Middlesbrough MP who stood down in 2017 after organising against Corbyn, described exactly that sentiment to me on Friday, when anger at the catastrophic result for Labour was still keeping him from sleep. Blenkinsop, now an army reservist, had been campaigning with Wilson in Sedgefield for the previous couple of days and knew what was coming.</p> \n<p>\u201cBrexit was obviously a factor, but the main issue again and again here was the leadership. It didn\u2019t matter what the message was, they didn\u2019t like the messenger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Were people not persuaded at all by the pledges on the NHS, the promise of nationalisations?</p> \n<p>\u201cYou are talking about the north-east of England. It is not just based on a strong unionised workforce, but also the armed services. There is hardly a family around here who has not had a son or a brother or a father serve. A man like Corbyn, with his history, they could not vote for him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Blenkinsop and Wilson were among those who believed that remaining in the EU could have been sold as a Labour issue and a patriotic one \u2013 by arguing that pooled sovereignty was enhanced sovereignty and that a strong economy was what made Britain great \u2013 but that argument was over before it began. Both men enthusiastically endorsed <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-12-13/alan-johnson-momentum-jeremy-corbyn-itv-news/\" title=\"\">Alan Johnson\u2019s scathing assessment of Corbyn and his \u201cMomentum cult\u201d</a> as incapable of \u201cleading the working class out of a paper bag\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb0b78f3-cc56-4e4b-843c-d9444b31351d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s7eG1kbdr0M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the absence of that leadership, other pseudo-patriotic voices have stepped in. Penny Pearson, 60, who helps to run the committee at Fishburn, tells me with some pride how the club hosted three events for a tweed-jacketed Nigel Farage and the Brexit party, down in the room with the Hardie banner. They catered for 100 each time and more came. Like many here Pearson would have voted for Farage, but went Conservative \u201cjust to make sure\u201d that Corbyn\u2019s Labour had no chance.</p> \n<p>Of all the people in the club the only one who admits voting Labour is the barman, Lewis White, who is working part-time here to help fund his way through a teacher-training course at Teesside. He is a lone fan of what is generally described as Corbyn\u2019s \u201cLondon\u201d politics. White is 28 now and has been coming here for a decade. \u201cIt was always a Labour club; it\u2019s unheard of, what\u2019s happened.\u201d He looks around the bar, \u201cEven the seats here are red,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps they will have to think about redecorating.\u201d</p>",

He doesn\u2019t understand us here.\u201d To start to unpack what Hudspeth means, you need to look in the dominoes room of the Fishburn Club. The symbolic decoration here is provided by the plaques and banners not of mines but of local regiments. It is this strand of the collective memory to which Corbyn, as Labour leader, appears to have had nothing to say. Talking to regulars the same allegations surface again and again. That Corbyn consorted with the IRA, that he is soft on terrorists. That he has remained silent on prosecuting veterans over the Bloody Sunday killings. The leader\u2019s shifting agnosticism on Brexit, in this context, is portrayed as yet another failure of patriotism, just as symbolic as his unforgivable reluctance to sing God save the Queen at a Battle of Britain remembrance service. Tom Blenkinsop, the former Middlesbrough MP who stood down in 2017 after organising against Corbyn, described exactly that sentiment to me on Friday, when anger at the catastrophic result for Labour was still keeping him from sleep. Blenkinsop, now an army reservist, had been campaigning with Wilson in Sedgefield for the previous couple of days and knew what was coming. \u201cBrexit was obviously a factor, but the main issue again and again here was the leadership. It didn\u2019t matter what the message was, they didn\u2019t like the messenger.\u201d Were people not persuaded at all by the pledges on the NHS, the promise of nationalisations? \u201cYou are talking about the north-east of England. It is not just based on a strong unionised workforce, but also the armed services. There is hardly a family around here who has not had a son or a brother or a father serve. A man like Corbyn, with his history, they could not vote for him.\u201d Blenkinsop and Wilson were among those who believed that remaining in the EU could have been sold as a Labour issue and a patriotic one \u2013 by arguing that pooled sovereignty was enhanced sovereignty and that a strong economy was what made Britain great \u2013 but that argument was over before it began. Both men enthusiastically endorsed Alan Johnson\u2019s scathing assessment of Corbyn and his \u201cMomentum cult\u201d as incapable of \u201cleading the working class out of a paper bag\u201d. In the absence of that leadership, other pseudo-patriotic voices have stepped in. Penny Pearson, 60, who helps to run the committee at Fishburn, tells me with some pride how the club hosted three events for a tweed-jacketed Nigel Farage and the Brexit party, down in the room with the Hardie banner. They catered for 100 each time and more came. Like many here Pearson would have voted for Farage, but went Conservative \u201cjust to make sure\u201d that Corbyn\u2019s Labour had no chance. Of all the people in the club the only one who admits voting Labour is the barman, Lewis White, who is working part-time here to help fund his way through a teacher-training course at Teesside. He is a lone fan of what is generally described as Corbyn\u2019s \u201cLondon\u201d politics. White is 28 now and has been coming here for a decade. \u201cIt was always a Labour club; it\u2019s unheard of, what\u2019s happened.\u201d He looks around the bar, \u201cEven the seats here are red,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps they will have to think about redecorating.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Malaga Island, tragic and mysterious, lies just off the coast of Maine in the US. It was once home to the mixed-race descendants of a freed slave named Benjamin Darling. But in 1912, they were all forcibly removed from their homes, with the state\u2019s connivance, in little more than a week.</p> <p>Some were dumped in mainland communities, which persecuted this so-called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.mixedracestudies.org/?tag=malaga-island\" title=\"\">maroon society</a>\u201d to the point of hunger and poverty. Others were arrested and illegally committed to the <a href=\"http://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Maine_School_for_Feeble_Minded\" title=\"\">Maine School </a><a href=\"http://www.asylumprojects.org/index.php?title=Maine_School_for_Feeble_Minded\" title=\"\">for the Feeble-Minded</a>, where they died with suspicious rapidity. Even the corpses were removed from the ancestral graves, to cleanse Malaga of its supposed taint.</p> <p>This harrowing tale has preoccupied American artist <a href=\"https://www.theastergates.com/\" title=\"\">Theaster Gates</a> for many years and in many different ways \u2013 which is only what you might expect from this famous polymath. For Gates (born 1973) is equally renowned as an urban planner, gospel singer, potter, sculptor, community organiser and university professor. By purchasing condemned buildings with the sales of his art, and transforming them into low-cost housing, he has invented better futures for African Americans in his native Chicago.</p> <p>All of these diverse gifts have clearly gone into the making of <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/theaster-gates-amalgam\" title=\"\">Amalgam</a>, formerly in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, now filling the entire top floor of Tate Liverpool. This is nothing less than a multi-part monument to Malaga and its lost inhabitants. Here was a community that lived outside the laws of the state, and even the nation, from the mid-19th century onwards, ignoring the prohibiting of interracial marriage and \u201cmiscegenation\u201d.</p> <p>The show opens with a massive rooftop, covered in slates, which appears to be sliding into the ground. It is a half-buried house, presumably, a home that can no longer be entered. More slates form a circle beneath a revolving sign that spells out Malaga in lime-green neon. This is an obvious nod to the tourist instincts of the developers who hoped to turn Malaga into a resort. So far, so disappointing.</p> <p>A gallery full of handmade vitrines sets forth the iconography Gates has created for his island \u2013 a kind of faux-ethnographic museum of horned <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/art/theaster-gates-palais-de-tokyo-amalgam-03-31-2019/\" title=\"\">masks</a> and curious casts, half-human and half-beast, with overtones of voodoo spirits and Benin heads. Some are white, some black, some manage to be both, with the use of clay glazes poured over the surfaces like fluid icing sugar.</p> <p>If you were not already thinking of the slave trade, its evil history is immediately invoked with what appear to be branding irons. Elsewhere, there are screws and vices and rusty instruments that might relate to ships or sugar or barbaric transportation. Some are attached to bollards very like those seen through the window on the Liverpool docks, with their own desperate connection to black history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4498632a5473c8f141c5d364c23e2dc713789fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4498632a5473c8f141c5d364c23e2dc713789fe/0_0_8256_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gates\u2019s approximation of an island featuring \u2018sculpted rock formations, sprouting seashells and sinister callipers\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gates\u2019s approximation of an island featuring \u2018sculpted rock formations, sprouting seashells and sinister callipers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark McNulty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A wall of blackboards covered in chalk writing presents a rough timeline of the Malaga disaster, and the history of Maine, along with the names of mixed-race stars such as Alicia Keys and Halle Berry. The phrases seem to belong to many voices, as if overheard, some speaking of the state\u2019s appalling dishonesty in relation to Malaga. For the island never became a resort. Its 40 acres lacked not only the mule famously promised to American families by General Sherman, but the projected hotel. For all the horrific evictions, Malaga Island remains deserted to this day.</p> <p>Gates has constructed something approximate to an island twice over in this show. A wooden stage bears a sequence of sculpted rock formations, sprouting seashells and sinister callipers. Empty glass-fronted cabinets conjure both the missing hotel and the ethnographic museum. Elsewhere, a forest of carved wooden trunks, on an island of white pine, bear many more of Gates\u2019s effigies and masks. This isle is full of voices, too, with a soundtrack of waves and songs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/03/theaster-gates-the-male-caucasian-world-as-weve-known-it-is-over\">Theaster Gates: 'The male, Caucasian world as we've known it is over'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But all of this feels conventional, obvious. Artists have been doing these island/forest installations for years. And the made-up masks go right back to Picasso. My sense is that visitors will take more from the photographs, documents and black magazines \u2013 such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/jul/06/ebony-jet-magazine-covers-classics-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Jet</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/jul/06/ebony-jet-magazine-covers-classics-in-pictures\" title=\"\"> and </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/jul/06/ebony-jet-magazine-covers-classics-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Ebony</a></em>, from Gates\u2019s vast personal archive \u2013 in the central gallery. After all, this show is partly about consciousness-raising and historical knowledge.</p> <p>But how it might have felt to be so isolated, and at the same time liberated on Malaga; what it was like to lose your home and family in such barbaric circumstances, to be disposed of with such contempt, or declared mentally infirm simply by virtue of marrying someone with a different skin colour \u2013 this is only touched upon in a single work. It is the show\u2019s centrepiece, though, and also its high point.</p> <p>Gates\u2019s film, <em>Dance of Malaga</em>, is beautiful, affecting and deeply eloquent. It has no dialogue, but a haunting score composed by his gospel band, <a href=\"https://www.theastergates.com/project-items/the-black-monks\" title=\"\">the Black Monks</a>. Black and white dancers perform a pas de deux against the island\u2019s undergrowth that is by turns loving and sorrowful, its choreography subtly intercut with film clips, news reportage, period photographs and devastating historical quotes. It is a complex meditation on a viciously particular form of racism, at a certain time and place, but also on the never-ending tragedy of forbidden love.</p> <p>\u2022 Theaster Gates: Amalgam is at <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/theaster-gates-amalgam\" title=\"\">Tate Liverpool</a> until 3 May 2020</p>",

      "bodyText": "Malaga Island, tragic and mysterious, lies just off the coast of Maine in the US. It was once home to the mixed-race descendants of a freed slave named Benjamin Darling. But in 1912, they were all forcibly removed from their homes, with the state\u2019s connivance, in little more than a week. Some were dumped in mainland communities, which persecuted this so-called \u201cmaroon society\u201d to the point of hunger and poverty. Others were arrested and illegally committed to the Maine School for the Feeble-Minded, where they died with suspicious rapidity. Even the corpses were removed from the ancestral graves, to cleanse Malaga of its supposed taint. This harrowing tale has preoccupied American artist Theaster Gates for many years and in many different ways \u2013 which is only what you might expect from this famous polymath. For Gates (born 1973) is equally renowned as an urban planner, gospel singer, potter, sculptor, community organiser and university professor. By purchasing condemned buildings with the sales of his art, and transforming them into low-cost housing, he has invented better futures for African Americans in his native Chicago. All of these diverse gifts have clearly gone into the making of Amalgam, formerly in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, now filling the entire top floor of Tate Liverpool. This is nothing less than a multi-part monument to Malaga and its lost inhabitants. Here was a community that lived outside the laws of the state, and even the nation, from the mid-19th century onwards, ignoring the prohibiting of interracial marriage and \u201cmiscegenation\u201d. The show opens with a massive rooftop, covered in slates, which appears to be sliding into the ground. It is a half-buried house, presumably, a home that can no longer be entered. More slates form a circle beneath a revolving sign that spells out Malaga in lime-green neon. This is an obvious nod to the tourist instincts of the developers who hoped to turn Malaga into a resort. So far, so disappointing. A gallery full of handmade vitrines sets forth the iconography Gates has created for his island \u2013 a kind of faux-ethnographic museum of horned masks and curious casts, half-human and half-beast, with overtones of voodoo spirits and Benin heads. Some are white, some black, some manage to be both, with the use of clay glazes poured over the surfaces like fluid icing sugar. If you were not already thinking of the slave trade, its evil history is immediately invoked with what appear to be branding irons. Elsewhere, there are screws and vices and rusty instruments that might relate to ships or sugar or barbaric transportation. Some are attached to bollards very like those seen through the window on the Liverpool docks, with their own desperate connection to black history. A wall of blackboards covered in chalk writing presents a rough timeline of the Malaga disaster, and the history of Maine, along with the names of mixed-race stars such as Alicia Keys and Halle Berry. The phrases seem to belong to many voices, as if overheard, some speaking of the state\u2019s appalling dishonesty in relation to Malaga. For the island never became a resort. Its 40 acres lacked not only the mule famously promised to American families by General Sherman, but the projected hotel. For all the horrific evictions, Malaga Island remains deserted to this day. Gates has constructed something approximate to an island twice over in this show. A wooden stage bears a sequence of sculpted rock formations, sprouting seashells and sinister callipers. Empty glass-fronted cabinets conjure both the missing hotel and the ethnographic museum. Elsewhere, a forest of carved wooden trunks, on an island of white pine, bear many more of Gates\u2019s effigies and masks. This isle is full of voices, too, with a soundtrack of waves and songs. But all of this feels conventional, obvious. Artists have been doing these island/forest installations for years. And the made-up masks go right back to Picasso. My sense is that visitors will take more from the photographs, documents and black magazines \u2013 such as Jet and Ebony, from Gates\u2019s vast personal archive \u2013 in the central gallery. After all, this show is partly about consciousness-raising and historical knowledge. But how it might have felt to be so isolated, and at the same time liberated on Malaga; what it was like to lose your home and family in such barbaric circumstances, to be disposed of with such contempt, or declared mentally infirm simply by virtue of marrying someone with a different skin colour \u2013 this is only touched upon in a single work. It is the show\u2019s centrepiece, though, and also its high point. Gates\u2019s film, Dance of Malaga, is beautiful, affecting and deeply eloquent. It has no dialogue, but a haunting score composed by his gospel band, the Black Monks. Black and white dancers perform a pas de deux against the island\u2019s undergrowth that is by turns loving and sorrowful, its choreography subtly intercut with film clips, news reportage, period photographs and devastating historical quotes. It is a complex meditation on a viciously particular form of racism, at a certain time and place, but also on the never-ending tragedy of forbidden love. \u2022 Theaster Gates: Amalgam is at Tate Liverpool until 3 May 2020",

      "body": "<p>Lyra and I met on a dating app called Plenty of Fish, the day after St Paddy\u2019s Day, 2018. We started talking and we didn\u2019t stop for a year. I didn\u2019t realise who she was until about an hour into our chat. I asked her what she did and she brushed it off by saying she worked for a Silicon Valley news site and did a bit of journalism on the side. That\u2019s when it clicked and I was, like: \u201cOh God, hold on, are you <em>that</em> Lyra McKee?\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards, we kept texting and DM-ing each other and eventually I drove up from Derry to Belfast to meet her on the Saturday before Easter weekend. I was really nervous, to tell the truth. I felt like I was in a bit over my head. I remember thinking, she has the world at her feet \u2013 a Silicon Valley job, a two-book deal with a big publisher in London \u2013 and I work in a hospital sticking needles in people.</p> <p>We hit it off right away. There\u2019s a meme about lesbian dating: let\u2019s get the small talk out of the way and you can tell me about your deepest trauma and how it still affects you. That was us, really. We talked all afternoon. We went to Clements on Botanic Avenue for coffee and later to Sakura for sushi, just talking nonstop. Then we went to the Botanic Gardens for a wander and more talking. Even by Northern Ireland standards, we did a lot of talking. We could have talked the hind legs off a donkey.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She took on other people's problems, their pain. It would spill over into her own life and she'd worry a lot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We had a lot in common. We both came from deprived Catholic areas. We both went to all-girls schools where it was terrifying to be gay. Lyra had written about coming out when she was 18, and how, to her relief, it was received quite well by her family. I came out when I was 26 and in a relationship with a man. Not ideal. I left and, initially, I made some new friends at Pride, but relationships were tricky. In Northern Ireland, when you meet someone relatively untroubled about their sexuality, it\u2019s a real joy. Lyra and I had a deep connection from the start. I wanted to see her again straight away so we arranged a date for two days later. It developed really quickly into full-on love.</p> <p>We swapped stories and, of course, hers blew my mind \u2013 the stories she was working on, what she had achieved. She didn\u2019t ever believe her own hype, which, of course, was totally deserved. She\u2019d made her mark when she was 16 or 17. People knew her from her writing about the Ceasefire Generation, but she didn\u2019t view herself as anyone special. In fact, she constantly questioned her worth, if she was worthy of all the praise, no matter what she had achieved. It made her really likable and just, well, normal.</p> <p>What struck me most was the way she had of just seeing the best in people and reaching out to them, even if their political views were diametrically opposed to hers. She cared really deeply, sometimes too deeply. She had this collection of waifs and strays. Many of them amazing, but some of them were absolute nightmares. I don\u2019t know how she put up with them. She took on other people\u2019s problems, their pain. It would spill over into her own life and she\u2019d fret and worry a lot.</p> <p>In a way, it was amazing that she achieved what she did because, underneath, she was in severe anxiety a lot of the time, a ball of nervous energy. She was like one of those ducks that seems calm and unruffled on the surface, but underneath, its legs are going like mad. The empathy and the anxiety went hand in hand.</p> <p>Lyra kept in contact with the people she wrote about. She didn\u2019t drop them once the story was done. After her death, I was overwhelmed with stories from people I\u2019d never met. At her wake, one young guy was breaking his heart telling us how she had helped him on social media when he was suicidal about being bullied. Lyra had personal experience of that. He had posted something and she had DM-ed him right away and then, afterwards, kept an eye on him. </p> <p>My da had died the year before and Lyra and I had taken some time off. I was helping Lyra with research for the book she was working on about Thomas Spence and John Rodgers, two young lads who had disappeared without trace in Belfast in the 1970s. She believed they had been murdered, but not for the usual political or sectarian reasons. I spent hours in the Newspaper Library in Belfast while she went out meeting sources and doing the difficult, potentially dangerous stuff on the ground. It\u2019s fair to say it had become a mission. That was what she was like in work mode \u2013 obsessive, single-minded. She had a thirst for knowledge about the Troubles but also for people\u2019s personal stories. It didn\u2019t matter what foot you kicked with, she wanted to hear your story. In a Northern Irish context, I think she was quite exceptional in that way.</p> <p>Lyra moved to Derry and soon after she was making contacts and speaking to ex-political prisoners about their experiences, on a quest to understand it all. She had grown up for a time on what was called the Murder Mile in Belfast, but her mum had kept her sheltered from the worst stuff. That night, 18 April, we were lying in bed in our pyjamas when we heard there was trouble up in the Creggan. Right away, she said \u201cWill we go up?\u201d, and I was, like, \u201cNah, no way.\u201d I was ambivalent but I could see she was going to go up on her own anyway so we got dressed and headed up there... In Derry, there had been a lot of rioting the previous summer and people would still go up to my friends\u2019 house in the Bogside and have tea and biscuits while the rioting was going on. You could watch it from their front door. It might seem mad to outsiders, but that\u2019s what they did.

      "body": "<p>Merseyside-born Stephen Graham, 46, discovered acting aged eight, before joining Liverpool\u2019s Everyman youth theatre in his teens. His breakthrough role was his Bafta-nominated performance as skinhead Combo in Shane Meadows\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/apr/27/drama2\" title=\"\">This Is England</a></em>. His film credits include <em>Snatch</em>, <em>Gangs of New York</em> and the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> series. He also played Al Capone in HBO drama <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>. This year, he\u2019s starred in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/15/the-virtues-review-a-harrowing-triumph-by-shane-meadows\" title=\"\">The Virtues</a></em>, <em>Line of Duty</em>, <em>Rocketman </em>and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/10/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-al-pacino-joe-pesci-netflix\" title=\"\">The Irishman</a></em>. He now plays Jacob Marley in the BBC\u2019s new adaptation of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>.</p> <p><strong>Was </strong><em><strong>A Christmas Carol </strong></em><strong>a story that already meant something to you?</strong><br>I watched the film with my nanna when I was 10 \u2013 the black-and-white one with Alastair Sim as Scrooge \u2013 and remember thinking what a brilliant, magical story this was. So when I was offered a role in this new version, I thought: \u201cReally? Me?\u201d I\u2019m the first to admit I don\u2019t speak in a thespy RSC voice and I don\u2019t look 76, but when Nick Murphy [the director] explained where he was going with it, I was in.</p> <p><strong>Marley makes quite an entrance: lying in a coffin with something unsavoury dripping in his eye. How was that?</strong><br>Yeah, that was fun to shoot \u2013 lying in a box with a big burly grip dripping water on my face from a pipette. The glamour of showbiz.</p> <p><strong>Are the story\u2019s themes still relevant today?</strong><br>Definitely. It\u2019s about greed, selfishness, materialism and inequality. Look at the crap going on today, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Scrooge feels like a modern-day mogul, exploiting warehouse workers on zero-hours contracts. Society\u2019s community spirit seems to have gone but Dickens was a great ambassador for the working classes.</p> <p><strong>You seem to have been everywhere in 2019. Does it feel like a golden year?</strong><br>It really does. Funny thing is, I haven\u2019t done all those things this year. Some took two or three years to make but they all seemed to come out in a row. As a viewer, I sometimes see actors and think: \u201cHe\u2019s in everything, that fella. He\u2019s like dogshit, he\u2019s all over the place. Is he not going to let anyone else have a job?\u201d This year, that was me. But I feel like I\u2019m on the crest of a wave at the moment. All I ever wanted to do was act. The height of my ambition was to make a living out of it, so I feel very fortunate. It\u2019s a long way from school plays to being on set with De Niro.</p> <p><strong>Which brings us to Martin Scorsese\u2019s </strong><em><strong>The Irishman</strong></em><strong>. How was it, starring alongside De Niro and Pacino?</strong><br>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite sunk in yet. It was my Champions League final. These are the people I grew up watching, revering and wanting to emulate, so for that little kid from Kirkby to be working with them was amazing. But I still took that playfulness and eagerness into the performance. We improvised so much. I slapped an ice-cream out of Al Pacino\u2019s hand, which he wasn\u2019t expecting. I threw a line at Bobby De Niro and he came straight back with the best reply. Those scenes were a joy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHXxVmeGQUc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WHXxVmeGQUc?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHXxVmeGQUc\">Watch a trailer for The Irishman</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>You\u2019ve said Scorsese and Shane Meadows work in a similar way. How so?</strong><br>Very similar. You have a script to work with, sure, but they create an atmosphere on set that\u2019s very collaborative. They make you feel comfortable enough to improvise, as long as it serves the story. It\u2019s also how they frame certain shots. They both have a beautiful vision.</p> <p><strong>Improvising on </strong><em><strong>The Virtues</strong></em><strong>, Meadows\u2019s drama about sexual abuse, must have taken lots of trust</strong><strong>\u2026</strong><br>Totally. We\u2019ve built that over 14 years of working together. I\u2019d jump off a cliff for Shane and ask no questions. I trust him implicitly, which was vital on <em>The Virtues</em> because the story was something he\u2019d experienced and so personal to him. I was honoured that he wanted me to tell his story and felt a duty to do it justice. There were lots of tears on that set. Not in a self-indulgent way. I just think it was extremely cathartic for Shane to put those demons to bed. Yet we also had so many laughs because he\u2019s a wonderfully funny man.</p> <p><strong>Are you getting recognised more since ratings hit </strong><em><strong>Line Of Duty</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>I didn\u2019t realise quite how huge it was. Something like 12 million people watched it. I was suddenly getting recognised in the Co-op the next morning, which was mad.</p> <p><strong>On </strong><em><strong>Desert Island Discs</strong></em><strong> recently you spoke about your depression and suicide attempt. What\u2019s been the reaction to sharing these experiences?</strong><br>It\u2019s been so positive. A million per cent. People have thanked me for raising awareness. I hadn\u2019t planned to talk about that. Lauren Laverne is such a wonderful interviewer that I felt at ease and it just came out.</p> <p><strong>Have you got some time off over Christmas?</strong><br>A little bit. It\u2019s going to be lovely. My ma and da are staying at ours, then we\u2019re all going to my brother-in-law\u2019s for Christmas dinner. But Boxing Day\u2019s the big one because it\u2019s Liverpool v Leicester \u2013 my team, the Reds, against our local club [Graham lives in Leicestershire]. That\u2019s massive in our house. It splits us right down the middle. We\u2019ll have everyone round, get a nice takeaway in and yell at the telly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d44b2820743ae260c83f43b81b0f6b2b5fdca3a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44b2820743ae260c83f43b81b0f6b2b5fdca3a7/0_249_4283_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Graham as John Corbett in Line of Duty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Graham as John Corbett in Line of Duty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aiden Monaghan/BBC/World Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you cook? It says on your Twitter profile you make a mean pan of scouse stew\u2026</strong><br>I do that but nothing else. My wife Hannah\u2019s a brilliant cook and she won\u2019t let me. Besides, I burnt some chicken kievs about five years ago and the kids won\u2019t let me forget it.</p> <p><strong>What else makes you happy when you\u2019re not working?</strong><br>I help coach my son Alfie\u2019s football team. I\u2019m quite vocal on the touchline! It\u2019s lovely to spend some proper quality time with my boy. My daughter Grace does dancing and singing, so I go to watch all her shows. I hang out with my dogs, Bonnie and Clyde. I\u2019m away quite a bit, so I just love being home and immersing myself in family.</p> <p><strong>You do </strong><strong>reiki</strong><strong> too. How did you get into that?</strong><br>I had a reiki massage about eight years ago which was a lovely experience, so me and Hannah went and did our Reiki master\u2019s course in Scotland. I try and meditate every day too. My job can be quite stressful with lots of rushing about, so it\u2019s nice to have that little time for myself to reflect and be mindful of how I\u2019m treating other people.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next for you?</strong><br>I\u2019ve just finished [BBC whale-hunting drama] <em>The North Water</em>. I\u2019ve also got [ITV true-crime series] <em>White House Farm</em> coming out in the new year.</p> <p><strong>Will you make any New Year\u2019s resolutions?</strong><br>Just to sack the vape at some point. But I\u2019m not putting any pressure on myself.</p> <p><em>A Christmas Carol starts on Sunday 22 December at 9pm on BBC1</em><em>. The Irishman is on Netflix now</em></p>",

It\u2019s also how they frame certain shots. They both have a beautiful vision. Improvising on The Virtues, Meadows\u2019s drama about sexual abuse, must have taken lots of trust\u2026 Totally. We\u2019ve built that over 14 years of working together. I\u2019d jump off a cliff for Shane and ask no questions. I trust him implicitly, which was vital on The Virtues because the story was something he\u2019d experienced and so personal to him. I was honoured that he wanted me to tell his story and felt a duty to do it justice. There were lots of tears on that set. Not in a self-indulgent way. I just think it was extremely cathartic for Shane to put those demons to bed. Yet we also had so many laughs because he\u2019s a wonderfully funny man. Are you getting recognised more since ratings hit Line Of Duty? I didn\u2019t realise quite how huge it was. Something like 12 million people watched it. I was suddenly getting recognised in the Co-op the next morning, which was mad. On Desert Island Discs recently you spoke about your depression and suicide attempt. What\u2019s been the reaction to sharing these experiences? It\u2019s been so positive. A million per cent. People have thanked me for raising awareness. I hadn\u2019t planned to talk about that. Lauren Laverne is such a wonderful interviewer that I felt at ease and it just came out. Have you got some time off over Christmas? A little bit. It\u2019s going to be lovely. My ma and da are staying at ours, then we\u2019re all going to my brother-in-law\u2019s for Christmas dinner. But Boxing Day\u2019s the big one because it\u2019s Liverpool v Leicester \u2013 my team, the Reds, against our local club [Graham lives in Leicestershire]. That\u2019s massive in our house. It splits us right down the middle. We\u2019ll have everyone round, get a nice takeaway in and yell at the telly. Do you cook? It says on your Twitter profile you make a mean pan of scouse stew\u2026 I do that but nothing else. My wife Hannah\u2019s a brilliant cook and she won\u2019t let me. Besides, I burnt some chicken kievs about five years ago and the kids won\u2019t let me forget it. What else makes you happy when you\u2019re not working? I help coach my son Alfie\u2019s football team. I\u2019m quite vocal on the touchline! It\u2019s lovely to spend some proper quality time with my boy. My daughter Grace does dancing and singing, so I go to watch all her shows. I hang out with my dogs, Bonnie and Clyde. I\u2019m away quite a bit, so I just love being home and immersing myself in family. You do reiki too. How did you get into that? I had a reiki massage about eight years ago which was a lovely experience, so me and Hannah went and did our Reiki master\u2019s course in Scotland. I try and meditate every day too. My job can be quite stressful with lots of rushing about, so it\u2019s nice to have that little time for myself to reflect and be mindful of how I\u2019m treating other people. What\u2019s next for you? I\u2019ve just finished [BBC whale-hunting drama] The North Water. I\u2019ve also got [ITV true-crime series] White House Farm coming out in the new year. Will you make any New Year\u2019s resolutions? Just to sack the vape at some point. But I\u2019m not putting any pressure on myself. A Christmas Carol starts on Sunday 22 December at 9pm on BBC1.

Having witnessed <a href=\"https://sussexparishchurches.org/church/chichester-st-peter-the-less/\">the demolition of St Peter the Less Church in Chichester in 1960</a>, he vowed to prevent similar acts of cultural vandalism from occurring again. Bulmer-Thomas believed that \u201can ancient and beautiful church fulfils its primary function merely by existing. It is, in itself, and irrespective of the members using it, an act of worship. Their message is delivered \u2013 not for half hours on Sundays, but every hour of every day of every year, and not merely to those who enter, but to all who pass by.\u201d</p> <p>Though Bulmer-Thomas was himself a devoted churchgoer, the mission of the Friends is not a religious one. Morley says that \u201cwe are an architectural conservation organisation\u201d, and the aim of the Friends is to preserve beautiful places of worship as public monuments. The churches are, according to Morley, our \u201cgreatest architectural and cultural legacy \u2026 equivalent to the great cultural treasures of places such as Tuscany, Istanbul and Andaluc\u00eda.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbd336b0ceec3bced83ddeb42ebe9a8e6c73f2bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbd336b0ceec3bced83ddeb42ebe9a8e6c73f2bc/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Mary of the Angels, Brownshill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>St Mary of the Angels, Gloucestershire, was bought from the diocese by local villagers in 2011 and will host a pop-up Christmas bar on 20 December</p></li> </ul> <p>The 56 churches that the Friends look after range from tiny 13th-century stone cells to cavernous modern masterpieces, with a number being added to their portfolio every year. All of the buildings cared for by the Friends are in isolated countryside. \u201cThe biggest population around one of our churches is 200 people max,\u201d says Morley. This is in part because it is easier for the Friends to keep an eye on churches away from large urban centres, but also because rural churches are the most at risk. According to a study by the Historic Religious Buildings Alliance, 9% of the 16,000 parish churches in the UK are located where just 0.33% of the population live. As rural populations age, decline and in some cases become more secular, this lack of congregation places a huge number of church buildings in jeopardy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"e48a8839c28991b3f69098e6e3732adca0cf6fd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e48a8839c28991b3f69098e6e3732adca0cf6fd0/15_0_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Llancillo, Herefordshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"227f9dc8aacbaa4b634fe4038f5677476095534a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/227f9dc8aacbaa4b634fe4038f5677476095534a/1032_0_4129_4129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Peter\u2019s, Llancillo, Herefordshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"9f0a4f837a167522d98fe73037797af774e1e4c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f0a4f837a167522d98fe73037797af774e1e4c3/1419_0_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Peter\u2019s, Llancillo, Herefordshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"b7346148aeba98446d2553a04179abcc6c3c9044\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7346148aeba98446d2553a04179abcc6c3c9044/0_0_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Peter\u2019s, Llancillo, Herefordshire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Nestled in woods at the corner of a farmer\u2019s fields, St Peter\u2019s, Llancillo, Herefordshire, boasts an 11th-century chancel and 13th-century bell</p></li> </ul> <p>The Venerable Ambrose Mason, Archdeacon of Monmouth, says: \u201cIt is the local congregation that has the responsibility for looking after the buildings, their repair and maintenance, and if something really serious crops up \u2013 a congregation of perhaps elderly people say \u2018we just can\u2019t raise a quarter of a million pounds to repair the roof\u2019,\u201d so, in many cases, the decision has to be made to \u201cwalk away from the building\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The parish churches of England and Wales contain the most important art and architecture and they are vulnerable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This often results in churches being labelled as \u201cunviable\u201d, after which alternative uses for them are sought by church authorities. Morley says: \u201cIn the 1950s, many were demolished, whereas now there are better systems in place within the church commissioners and the diocese for finding an outcome.\u201d However, this often means the buildings slip out of the \u201cshared national heritage\u201d into private ownership \u2013 converted into private dwellings or offices with little to no public access.

      "bodyText": "The Friends of Friendless Churches (FoFC) is a small charity that works to save places of worship across England and Wales, many of which face abandonment and ruin as a result of shrinking populations in rural areas. Founded in 1957 by Welsh journalist and former MP Ivor Bulmer-Thomas \u2013 a leading layman in the Church of England \u2013 the charity aims to preserve beautiful churches as public monuments that should be rightly recognised as \u201cdispersed world heritage sites\u201d and important components of our cultural legacy. The founding members included politician Roy Jenkins, artist John Piper, poet TS Eliot, and poet and conservation campaigner John Betjeman. According to Friends director Rachel Morley, through his vociferous campaigning Bulmer-Thomas \u201calmost singlehandedly changed the fate of parish churches\u201d. Having witnessed the demolition of St Peter the Less Church in Chichester in 1960, he vowed to prevent similar acts of cultural vandalism from occurring again. Bulmer-Thomas believed that \u201can ancient and beautiful church fulfils its primary function merely by existing. It is, in itself, and irrespective of the members using it, an act of worship. Their message is delivered \u2013 not for half hours on Sundays, but every hour of every day of every year, and not merely to those who enter, but to all who pass by.\u201d Though Bulmer-Thomas was himself a devoted churchgoer, the mission of the Friends is not a religious one. Morley says that \u201cwe are an architectural conservation organisation\u201d, and the aim of the Friends is to preserve beautiful places of worship as public monuments. The churches are, according to Morley, our \u201cgreatest architectural and cultural legacy \u2026 equivalent to the great cultural treasures of places such as Tuscany, Istanbul and Andaluc\u00eda.\u201d St Mary of the Angels, Gloucestershire, was bought from the diocese by local villagers in 2011 and will host a pop-up Christmas bar on 20 December The 56 churches that the Friends look after range from tiny 13th-century stone cells to cavernous modern masterpieces, with a number being added to their portfolio every year. All of the buildings cared for by the Friends are in isolated countryside. \u201cThe biggest population around one of our churches is 200 people max,\u201d says Morley. This is in part because it is easier for the Friends to keep an eye on churches away from large urban centres, but also because rural churches are the most at risk. According to a study by the Historic Religious Buildings Alliance, 9% of the 16,000 parish churches in the UK are located where just 0.33% of the population live. As rural populations age, decline and in some cases become more secular, this lack of congregation places a huge number of church buildings in jeopardy. Nestled in woods at the corner of a farmer\u2019s fields, St Peter\u2019s, Llancillo, Herefordshire, boasts an 11th-century chancel and 13th-century bell The Venerable Ambrose Mason, Archdeacon of Monmouth, says: \u201cIt is the local congregation that has the responsibility for looking after the buildings, their repair and maintenance, and if something really serious crops up \u2013 a congregation of perhaps elderly people say \u2018we just can\u2019t raise a quarter of a million pounds to repair the roof\u2019,\u201d so, in many cases, the decision has to be made to \u201cwalk away from the building\u201d. This often results in churches being labelled as \u201cunviable\u201d, after which alternative uses for them are sought by church authorities. Morley says: \u201cIn the 1950s, many were demolished, whereas now there are better systems in place within the church commissioners and the diocese for finding an outcome.\u201d However, this often means the buildings slip out of the \u201cshared national heritage\u201d into private ownership \u2013 converted into private dwellings or offices with little to no public access. Archdeacon Mason says the Friends \u201cprovide a vital role in helping to preserve the more significant local churches where the congregations have dropped to a point where they are not viable\u201d. Morley says \u201cThese buildings are beautiful and important in and of themselves. We do not need to justify their continued existence by turning them into cafes or social security offices. The parish churches of England and Wales contain the most important art and architecture and they are vulnerable.\u201d Many churches that are sold often appear cheap at point of purchase but due to the expense of conversion \u2013 few have electricity or water \u2013 fall into disrepair and are left locked and abandoned. Just feet from the Great Western Canal in mid-Devon is the former private chapel of the Ayshford family, a Grade I-listed, 15th-century building with diagonal buttresses. Volunteer Julia Pound, who lives next door, describes herself as an \u201caccidental church warden\u201d The Friends has a membership of 2,000 and relies on a network of 200 volunteers around the country to keep their eyes on the buildings.

      "body": "<p>I loathe the kind of mawkish stunts that cause human beings to cry for the camera. So when people on social media began urging me to watch a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07xn11x\" title=\"\">video</a> of a lonely pensioner from Oldham called Terrence receiving a surprise visit from local college students \u2013 a clip that was guaranteed to bring a lump to my throat \u2013 I was resistant.</p> <p>Picturing my grandparents, I thought how little they would have liked a stranger to see them weep \u2013 even if the stranger in question had been someone they knew from the telly. (The man behind the students\u2019 visit was the <em>BBC Breakfast</em> presenter, Dan Walker, to whom Terrence had previously revealed that for the past 20 years he\u2019d spent Christmas Day alone.) Frankly, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted a stranger to witness even their happier emotions \u2013 as an expert from <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> once discovered when, on a recce to Sunderland, my granny presented him with a certain unexpectedly valuable rose bowl.</p> <p>But that\u2019s another story. The clip kept appearing in my feed, and eventually I gave in and played it \u2013 and, yes, it did bring a lump to my throat, though in truth I found it chastening rather than uplifting; a lesson in brutal reality rather than in festive cheer.</p> <p>If it was desperately sad hearing Terrence explain to Walker how, before his mother died, he used to buy her \u201clittle bits all the time, like cigarettes, and parcel them all up at Christmas and take them to her\u201d \u2013 to me, all of his loneliness was held, as if in amber, in the modesty of the phrase \u201clittle bits\u201d \u2013 it was even more pitiful to see him press his face into his handkerchief in the moments after the students carried a Christmas tree into his front room. His reaction was instantaneous: as if a gate, long-locked, had been kicked wide open inside him, or the icy surface of some internal lake suddenly cracked. I realised that he wasn\u2019t embarrassed by his tears for the simple reason that there was no time for such a feeling to creep over him. Barely six seconds can have passed between the appearance of the tinsel-bearing young people \u2013 Walker\u2019s carefully staged surprise \u2013 and his first gulping sob.</p> <p>Terrence stayed with me for ages afterwards. I couldn\u2019t get past the idea that his ambitions when it comes to Christmas consist only of giving (and, perhaps, of receiving) a few \u201clittle bits\u201d. This year, as he also told Walker, he will, thanks to his involvement with the charity Age UK, be spending Christmas with a new friend, a 90-year-old woman with dementia \u2013 and I thought again and again of how happy he had sounded when he said the word \u201cfriend\u201d, her illness seemingly taking the shine off the prospect of her company not one iota. Every time I remembered his gratitude for what Walker had arranged (as well as the tree, the students sang his favourite carol, Silent Night), it made me feel something very close to shame. It was so easily won.</p> <p>Loneliness. The media talks of an \u201cepidemic\u201d, encouraged not only by the fact that GPs are reporting increasingly high numbers of patients suffering from it, but also by the news that scientists are investigating the possibility of developing drugs that may reduce its symptoms; in 2018, the government even got in on the act, when it appointed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/tracey-crouch-minister-loneliness-friends-powerful-vested-interests\" title=\"\">minister for loneliness</a>. (The remit of the minister for sport was expanded following the recommendations made by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/10/loneliness-is-a-giant-evil-of-our-time-says-jo-cox-commission\" title=\"\">Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness</a>.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Loneliness is sly. It can sidle up even to those who are the least vulnerable to it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Personally, I\u2019m not sure how to feel about this. Even if one accepts that loneliness is on the rise \u2013 I think this difficult to prove \u2013 it is surely strange to medicalise it. The emotional poverty that is loneliness has so many causes, and can be found in so many places for so many different reasons; the isolation of a pensioner who has outlived his peers is hardly the same as the isolation experienced by a teenager whose social life takes place entirely on the screen of her phone. It\u2019s not even as if you have to be alone to suffer from loneliness. Wasn\u2019t it Chekhov who suggested that those who truly fear it had better not get married?</p> <p>But it\u2019s also possible to overcomplicate things. When, in her latest book <em>A Biography of Loneliness</em>, the cultural historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/20/brits-arent-socialising-lonely-report-wellbeing\" title=\"\">Fay Bound Alberti</a> asserts that there are no easy solutions to such a state, I\u2019m inclined both to agree and to disagree. Loneliness is sly. It can sidle up even to those who are the least vulnerable to it. I know this because I sometimes experience it myself, and I am neither old nor poor, my mental health is robust, and I have a family and close friends. (As a writer, I choose to be alone, but even as I cherish such a state, I also know how easily it can become a turning inwards, an introversion that brings with it feelings of anxiety and doubt.) Of course the same remedy \u2013 volunteer, take up yoga! \u2013 is not going to cure everyone.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the case of Terrence is instructive. Our needs are really not so great. If we are all complex, we\u2019re also very simple. Just as those who are surrounded by people need sometimes to be alone, so those who are alone sometimes require company \u2013 or if not that, then at least some momentary contact, even if only as fleeting as a smile. This is something we should all bear in mind; it needs to be felt (perhaps it needs to be taught) as a collective duty.</p> <p>Is it really so hard to meet the eye of the man who is serving us? To talk to the woman who is next to us in the queue? Must our headphones always be clamped to our ears? Why the dread at the thought of actually phoning someone?

      "bodyText": "I loathe the kind of mawkish stunts that cause human beings to cry for the camera. So when people on social media began urging me to watch a video of a lonely pensioner from Oldham called Terrence receiving a surprise visit from local college students \u2013 a clip that was guaranteed to bring a lump to my throat \u2013 I was resistant. Picturing my grandparents, I thought how little they would have liked a stranger to see them weep \u2013 even if the stranger in question had been someone they knew from the telly. (The man behind the students\u2019 visit was the BBC Breakfast presenter, Dan Walker, to whom Terrence had previously revealed that for the past 20 years he\u2019d spent Christmas Day alone.) Frankly, they wouldn\u2019t have wanted a stranger to witness even their happier emotions \u2013 as an expert from Antiques Roadshow once discovered when, on a recce to Sunderland, my granny presented him with a certain unexpectedly valuable rose bowl. But that\u2019s another story. The clip kept appearing in my feed, and eventually I gave in and played it \u2013 and, yes, it did bring a lump to my throat, though in truth I found it chastening rather than uplifting; a lesson in brutal reality rather than in festive cheer. If it was desperately sad hearing Terrence explain to Walker how, before his mother died, he used to buy her \u201clittle bits all the time, like cigarettes, and parcel them all up at Christmas and take them to her\u201d \u2013 to me, all of his loneliness was held, as if in amber, in the modesty of the phrase \u201clittle bits\u201d \u2013 it was even more pitiful to see him press his face into his handkerchief in the moments after the students carried a Christmas tree into his front room. His reaction was instantaneous: as if a gate, long-locked, had been kicked wide open inside him, or the icy surface of some internal lake suddenly cracked. I realised that he wasn\u2019t embarrassed by his tears for the simple reason that there was no time for such a feeling to creep over him. Barely six seconds can have passed between the appearance of the tinsel-bearing young people \u2013 Walker\u2019s carefully staged surprise \u2013 and his first gulping sob. Terrence stayed with me for ages afterwards. I couldn\u2019t get past the idea that his ambitions when it comes to Christmas consist only of giving (and, perhaps, of receiving) a few \u201clittle bits\u201d. This year, as he also told Walker, he will, thanks to his involvement with the charity Age UK, be spending Christmas with a new friend, a 90-year-old woman with dementia \u2013 and I thought again and again of how happy he had sounded when he said the word \u201cfriend\u201d, her illness seemingly taking the shine off the prospect of her company not one iota. Every time I remembered his gratitude for what Walker had arranged (as well as the tree, the students sang his favourite carol, Silent Night), it made me feel something very close to shame. It was so easily won. Loneliness. The media talks of an \u201cepidemic\u201d, encouraged not only by the fact that GPs are reporting increasingly high numbers of patients suffering from it, but also by the news that scientists are investigating the possibility of developing drugs that may reduce its symptoms; in 2018, the government even got in on the act, when it appointed a minister for loneliness. (The remit of the minister for sport was expanded following the recommendations made by the Jo Cox Commission on Loneliness.) Personally, I\u2019m not sure how to feel about this. Even if one accepts that loneliness is on the rise \u2013 I think this difficult to prove \u2013 it is surely strange to medicalise it. The emotional poverty that is loneliness has so many causes, and can be found in so many places for so many different reasons; the isolation of a pensioner who has outlived his peers is hardly the same as the isolation experienced by a teenager whose social life takes place entirely on the screen of her phone. It\u2019s not even as if you have to be alone to suffer from loneliness. Wasn\u2019t it Chekhov who suggested that those who truly fear it had better not get married? But it\u2019s also possible to overcomplicate things. When, in her latest book A Biography of Loneliness, the cultural historian Fay Bound Alberti asserts that there are no easy solutions to such a state, I\u2019m inclined both to agree and to disagree. Loneliness is sly. It can sidle up even to those who are the least vulnerable to it. I know this because I sometimes experience it myself, and I am neither old nor poor, my mental health is robust, and I have a family and close friends. (As a writer, I choose to be alone, but even as I cherish such a state, I also know how easily it can become a turning inwards, an introversion that brings with it feelings of anxiety and doubt.) Of course the same remedy \u2013 volunteer, take up yoga! \u2013 is not going to cure everyone. Nevertheless, the case of Terrence is instructive. Our needs are really not so great. If we are all complex, we\u2019re also very simple. Just as those who are surrounded by people need sometimes to be alone, so those who are alone sometimes require company \u2013 or if not that, then at least some momentary contact, even if only as fleeting as a smile. This is something we should all bear in mind; it needs to be felt (perhaps it needs to be taught) as a collective duty. Is it really so hard to meet the eye of the man who is serving us? To talk to the woman who is next to us in the queue? Must our headphones always be clamped to our ears? Why the dread at the thought of actually phoning someone? At the very least, we could try to answer the emails of those we know and care about. We picture them as harried, and insist on feeling this way ourselves. But in reality we do not know when last they properly talked to someone. How could they, given that there are times when we can hardly remember when we last did so ourselves?",

But she was quietly relieved to see the student was talking about the carrots the school had been growing in their allotment, which to everyone\u2019s shock had turned out purple.</p> <p>There have been countless moments like this since the charity <a href=\"https://www.treesforcities.org/\" title=\"\">Trees for Cities</a> transformed an unused concrete square at Holy Cross Catholic primary school in Birkenhead into a beautiful allotment where staff and students grow strawberries, rhubarb and pumpkins.</p> <p>These allotments, known as \u201cedible playgrounds\u201d, provide some of the most deprived children in the country with the chance to learn about where their food comes from while also giving them an important connection with nature. Trees for Cities, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/06/guardian-and-observer-appeal-2019-our-chosen-charities\" title=\"\">since 1993 has planted more than </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/06/guardian-and-observer-appeal-2019-our-chosen-charities\" title=\"\">1 million trees across the UK</a>, believes this connection is key to raising children who will grow up to be guardians of the environment in the fight to avert the climate crisis.</p> <p>David Elliott, chief executive of Trees for Cities, said: \u201cThe entry point is around healthy food and food-growing but there\u2019s a wide range of benefits that the edible playground brings in behaviour, confidence, and wellbeing. More broadly, our vision is to be working from the youngest age upwards to inspire kids to get out and be connected to nature so they become the guardians and conservationists of the future. Without them, we\u2019re not going to have future cities that have trees and green spaces that are protected and seen as vital.\u201d</p> <p>That vision has already flowered in Bidston Village C of E primary school, down the road from Holy Cross. On a cold December afternoon, 11-year-old Leila said the allotment had made her think more about her place in the world. \u201cIt makes you think about making sure that the plastic isn\u2019t getting in the soil or nothing is getting in the way. It makes you a bit more aware of what\u2019s happening in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you want to help. When I had a sleepover, we took the time in the morning to pick up plastics.\u201d</p> <p>Trees for Cities, which is one of the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> 2019 charity appeal partners, has worked with 100 schools in 12 towns and cities to build bespoke edible gardens over the past 10 years. The programme provides schools with durable oak raised beds and vertical growing spaces, seating, seeds, plants, a greenhouse, one class\u2019s worth of gardening tools, a wormery and composting area.</p> <p>The charity works specifically with schools in areas that have high levels of poverty and obesity but little access to green spaces.

      "bodyText": "Headteacher Clare Higgins was concerned when a 10-year-old student told her \u201csomething had gone wrong\u201d during a recent lunch break. But she was quietly relieved to see the student was talking about the carrots the school had been growing in their allotment, which to everyone\u2019s shock had turned out purple. There have been countless moments like this since the charity Trees for Cities transformed an unused concrete square at Holy Cross Catholic primary school in Birkenhead into a beautiful allotment where staff and students grow strawberries, rhubarb and pumpkins. These allotments, known as \u201cedible playgrounds\u201d, provide some of the most deprived children in the country with the chance to learn about where their food comes from while also giving them an important connection with nature. Trees for Cities, which since 1993 has planted more than 1 million trees across the UK, believes this connection is key to raising children who will grow up to be guardians of the environment in the fight to avert the climate crisis. David Elliott, chief executive of Trees for Cities, said: \u201cThe entry point is around healthy food and food-growing but there\u2019s a wide range of benefits that the edible playground brings in behaviour, confidence, and wellbeing. More broadly, our vision is to be working from the youngest age upwards to inspire kids to get out and be connected to nature so they become the guardians and conservationists of the future. Without them, we\u2019re not going to have future cities that have trees and green spaces that are protected and seen as vital.\u201d That vision has already flowered in Bidston Village C of E primary school, down the road from Holy Cross. On a cold December afternoon, 11-year-old Leila said the allotment had made her think more about her place in the world. \u201cIt makes you think about making sure that the plastic isn\u2019t getting in the soil or nothing is getting in the way. It makes you a bit more aware of what\u2019s happening in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you want to help. When I had a sleepover, we took the time in the morning to pick up plastics.\u201d Trees for Cities, which is one of the Guardian and Observer 2019 charity appeal partners, has worked with 100 schools in 12 towns and cities to build bespoke edible gardens over the past 10 years. The programme provides schools with durable oak raised beds and vertical growing spaces, seating, seeds, plants, a greenhouse, one class\u2019s worth of gardening tools, a wormery and composting area. The charity works specifically with schools in areas that have high levels of poverty and obesity but little access to green spaces. The three issues are deeply interlinked, according to Trees for Cities, and by getting children to grow their own fruit and vegetables, the charity hopes to encourage healthy eating and physical activity. Deprivation levels are high at both Holy Cross and Bidston Village, with nearly one in three children living in poverty in the area. \u201cSome of the children have such sedentary lifestyles. Just getting them up and out and realising that this is pleasurable, enjoyable and quite a social experience is important,\u201d said Bidston Village deputy head Katharine John. She said the two estates and the avenues across the main road had no play park. \u201cWe have to try and compensate for that as much as possible.

It is also worth noting that the Tory national <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2019/results\" title=\"\">vote share</a> rose only by a very modest amount.

The Brexit ultras have never really been convinced that he is one of them and he now has the space to prove them correct for the good of his country. The size of his majority means that he can cut himself free of the fundamentalists and pivot towards a form of Brexit that will maintain a reasonably close relationship with the EU and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/15/one-third-of-car-firms-have-cut-jobs-amid-brexit-uncertainty\" title=\"\">protect jobs in the car industry</a> and other manufacturers in the Midlands and the north of England.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/boris-johnson-to-visit-new-tory-seats-in-north-east-england\">Boris Johnson vows to repay trust of voters in north-east England</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There will be inherent tensions in this government. The size of its majority will be taken by some shrink-the-state Tory ideologues as licence to charge further rightwards. This will be even more the case if Labour is mad enough to keep itself out of contention by continuing with some variation of the suicidal Corbyn experiment. Yet a right-lunging Tory party will be a betrayal of the very voters whom Mr Johnson pledges to work for \u201cday and night\u201d. Forward-thinking Tories would also be wise to think hard about one of the poison pills contained in this victory. They have again won an election thanks to the votes of the middle-aged and the old, while becoming even more toxic to the majority of the young.</p> \n<p>The boy who wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d wears the crown, but he does not reign unopposed across all the kingdom. The surge to the SNP, the night\u2019s other big winners, portends a head-on constitutional car-crash between nationalists demanding a second independence referendum and a Conservative prime minister who says he will never give them one.</p> \n<p>Some depressed non-Tories are talking and writing as if the Conservatives have already won the next election as well. My crystal ball cannot peer that far into the future. What I do know is that nothing lasts forever. Margaret Thatcher was toppled three years after her 1987 landslide. David Cameron was out of Number 10 barely more than a year after his \u201csweetest victory\u201d in 2015. Every triumph contains within it the seeds of later nemesis. Power reveals.

There will be inherent tensions in this government. The size of its majority will be taken by some shrink-the-state Tory ideologues as licence to charge further rightwards. This will be even more the case if Labour is mad enough to keep itself out of contention by continuing with some variation of the suicidal Corbyn experiment. Yet a right-lunging Tory party will be a betrayal of the very voters whom Mr Johnson pledges to work for \u201cday and night\u201d. Forward-thinking Tories would also be wise to think hard about one of the poison pills contained in this victory. They have again won an election thanks to the votes of the middle-aged and the old, while becoming even more toxic to the majority of the young. The boy who wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d wears the crown, but he does not reign unopposed across all the kingdom. The surge to the SNP, the night\u2019s other big winners, portends a head-on constitutional car-crash between nationalists demanding a second independence referendum and a Conservative prime minister who says he will never give them one. Some depressed non-Tories are talking and writing as if the Conservatives have already won the next election as well. My crystal ball cannot peer that far into the future. What I do know is that nothing lasts forever. Margaret Thatcher was toppled three years after her 1987 landslide. David Cameron was out of Number 10 barely more than a year after his \u201csweetest victory\u201d in 2015. Every triumph contains within it the seeds of later nemesis. Power reveals. Another thing power always does is disappoint. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

Florin Soare, an investigator for the institute who spent several years gathering testimony, estimates that between 1966 and 1989 there were between 15,000 and 20,000 unnecessary deaths of children in Romania\u2019s grim network of children\u2019s homes, with the vast majority taking place in those set aside for disabled children.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we started investigating, we knew there were abuses, but we never imagined the extent of the crimes that were committed,\u201d he said in an interview at the institute\u2019s modest headquarters in central Bucharest. The investigators handed over the results of their work to Romanian prosecutors in 2017. The prosecution service told the <em>Observer</em> they are continuing to gather evidence \u201cdue to the large number of cases\u201d. Official charges could be filed next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2a48e9d3dc83ce0d788ce901ad2a68fea6051aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a48e9d3dc83ce0d788ce901ad2a68fea6051aa/0_0_5232_3553/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orphans share a bed in Stefan Nicolau hospital Bucharest, Romania 1990.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orphans share a bed in Stefan Nicolau hospital Bucharest, Romania 1990.

The repression is skimmed over in school classes, said Ana Blandiana, a poet who has transformed a former communist-era prison in the town of Sighet, on Romania\u2019s border with Ukraine, into the country\u2019s only museum of communist crimes.</p> <p>Few among Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s inner circle were tried in the aftermath of the revolution, and attempts to bring prosecutions for specific crimes have ended in failure in all but a handful of cases. The trial of Ion Iliescu, who took over from Ceau\u0219escu and is now 89, finally began in Bucharest last month after years of delay. He is accused of crimes against humanity for his role in the violence that continued after Ceau\u0219escu fled. In October, a Bucharest court acquitted two former officers of the communist-era secret police, the Securitate, of crimes against humanity over the death of dissident Gheorghe Ursu, who died in detention in 1985 after being tortured by his jailers.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is not to put 90-year-olds in prison, the point is to change the atmosphere of the country, to speak the truth about the period and to tell the truth in order to close this chapter,\u201d said Blandiana.</p> <p>Bucharest has no museum of communism, and the city\u2019s history museum ends its displays in 1918, with visitors enquiring where the 20th-century section is given an irritated shake of the head by the attendants.</p> <p>Orphanages are a particularly sensitive point, with many Romanians feeling that the wide publicity for the footage, and subsequent massive global adoption campaign, is a stain on the country\u2019s reputation that is best forgotten.</p> <p>The country\u2019s orphanages began to fill up from the late 1960s, when the state decided to battle a demographic crisis by banning abortion and removing contraception from sale. Many of those in the orphanages were not actually orphans, but those whose parents felt they could not cope financially with raising a child.</p> <p>The most horrific abuse took place in homes for disabled children, who were taken away from their families and institutionalised. At the age of three, disabled children would be sorted by hospital commissions into three categories: so-called \u201ccurable\u201d, \u201cpartially curable\u201d and \u201cincurable\u201d. The children who were sorted into the third category, some of whom had minor or no disabilities, were subjected to particularly brutal conditions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The point is not to put 90-year-olds in prison, the point is to speak the truth about the period to close this chapter</p> <footer> <cite>Ana Blandiana, poet</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across the country, there were 26 institutions catering to the \u201ccategory three\u201d disabled children. Investigators from the institute picked three of them to investigate, and found shocking mortality levels among the children. \u201cThey didn\u2019t die from the disabilities they had: 70% of the registered deaths were for pneumonia. They were dying of external causes that were preventable and treatable,\u201d said Soare.</p> <p>As the investigators continued, they discovered ever more horrific details. There is testimony of children suffering from frostbite, and of children literally being eaten by rats, being kept in cages or being smeared in their own faeces, said Soare.</p> <p>The investigators logged 771 deaths they believed could have been prevented in the three facilities in the late 1980s, suggesting that the number across all 26 institutions over a longer period is much higher. \u201cThere is no document that proves this, but it is clear that the ultimate goal of this was an extermination campaign,\u201d said Soare. The list of those the institute believes should be prosecuted for the deaths is classified, but includes employees directly responsible for abuse, and functionaries in the communist system.</p> <p>Some of those who spent their childhoods in the facilities have mixed feelings about whether court cases are a good idea, three decades later. Florin Catanescu, a 41-year-old who was taken from his mother at birth because she was receiving psychiatric treatment at the time, grew up in a series of orphanages.</p> <p>He remembers cases of ill treatment, but believes in focusing on the future, not the past. \u201cIt\u2019s better to concentrate on positivity moving forward, and to make sure these things can\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said.

Ruckel recalled being subjected to gruesome beatings and other forms of abuse, as well as frequently witnessing other children being given forced sedations, violent beatings or being tied to the beds. \u201cThere were children who were beaten, and the next day they were dead,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, asked whether he wants to see specific employees who may still be alive brought to trial, Ruckel was hesitant, saying it was for God alone to judge, and it would be better \u201cto let it go\u201d after so much time has passed.</p> <p>He said many of the staff were simply broken by the inhumane nature of the system. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them.

Christmas Day will mark 30 years since Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, Romania\u2019s megalomaniac, isolationist dictator, was convicted in an impromptu trial and shot dead together with his wife. His execution ended more than two decades of rule that brought poverty and misery to the majority of the country\u2019s population. In the three decades since his fall, only a handful of people have faced legal punishment for their roles in Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s repressive regime, and there have been no criminal cases over the tens of thousands of children mistreated by the regime\u2019s inhumane network of juvenile internment institutions.

The number of drug-related deaths in the UK during 2019 has yet to be confirmed.

      "body": "<p>No one was more surprised than I when Jake Kasdan\u2019s 2017 romp <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/24/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-mark-kermode-film-of-the-week-review\" title=\"\"><em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em></a> managed to squeeze smart new thrills from the premise of Chris Van Allsburg\u2019s 1981 children\u2019s book, first filmed in 1995. While Joe Johnston\u2019s <em>Jumanji</em> (starring Robin Williams) had featured fantastical creatures escaping from the titular board-game to run wild in Brantford, New Hampshire, Kasdan\u2019s \u201ccontinuation of the story\u201d sent four young players <em>into</em> a video game, where they battled a series of challenges in order to earn a safe passage home. The result was a crowd-pleasing romp that combined the school detention premise of <em>The Breakfast </em><em>Club</em> with boisterous CG action in sprightly fashion.</p> <p>With a worldwide box-office gross just this side of a billion dollars, a sequel became an industrial necessity \u2013 never an inspiring situation. It\u2019s a relief, therefore, to report that <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> keeps things upbeat and lively, thanks in no small part to the introduction of two counterintuitively revivifying characters \u2013 curmudgeonly old codgers whose gripes and aches provide a jolly counterpoint to the teen angst that fired Kasdan\u2019s previous instalment.</p> <p>Danny DeVito and Danny Glover are, respectively, Eddie and Milo \u2013 former restaurateurs nursing a 15-year-old estrangement beef. When Eddie\u2019s disillusioned grandson Spencer (Alex Wolff) ventures back into the Jumanji video game with dreams of once again becoming handsome adventurer Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), his somewhat distant friends are forced to follow. Unfortunately, Eddie and Milo are unwittingly dragged along for the ride, swept into an alternative universe in which Jurgen the Brutal (<em>Game of Thrones</em>\u2019s Rory McCann) has stolen Jumanji\u2019s life-giving jewel, threatening its kingdoms with drought and darkness. \u201cWe\u2019re in a \u2018video game\u2019,\u201d the youngsters try to explain to the old farts, to little avail.</p> <p>More confusing still is the randomness of the in-game avatar identities assigned to each player. This time, the body-swap choices of the first film are shuffled and multiplied, allowing our adult stars to experiment with a wider range of comically mimicked characters. Thus we get to enjoy the Rock doing a loopy impression of Danny DeVito, experiencing the thrill of huge biceps and fully mobile hips (\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d); and Kevin Hart channelling Glover\u2019s laconic verbal delivery as Franklin \u201cMouse\u201d Finbar, drawling: \u201cDid I just kill Eddie by talking too slow \u2013 like he always said I would?\u201d</p> <p>Upping the ante is Awkwafina as new game-character Ming Fleetfoot, whose appearance poses both questions and answers as the narrative (penned by Kasdan with returning co-writers Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg) jumbles identities like T-shirts in a tumble dryer. Like some super-charged kaleidoscopic rehash of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UShtvCen6So\" title=\"\"><em>Freaky Friday</em></a>, <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> takes polymorphous pleasure in its frenetic scrambling of age, gender and racial boundaries, yet somehow manages to keep us up to speed with who is in which body at any given moment \u2013 just about. It\u2019s a credit to the film-makers that a one-sided conversation between a cat burglar and a hybrid horse can still pack an emotional punch, a feat of which Polish surrealist director <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0097259/\" title=\"\">Walerian Borowczyk</a> would have been rightly proud.</p> <p>There are a few false steps. Some of the bawdier gags about horse dicks and eunuch\u2019s testicles strike a duff note, and there\u2019s a bagginess to the third act that afflicts so many FX-heavy blockbusters. Yet for the most part the set pieces (which include giant ostriches chasing dune buggies and airborne encounters with snarling monkeys) have an enjoyable grandeur, emphasised by Henry Jackman\u2019s score, which cheekily invokes Maurice Jarre\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdFwhhH2x7I\" title=\"\"><em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> theme</a> during an early desert sequence.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBxcF-r9Ibs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rBxcF-r9Ibs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch a trailer for Jumanji: The Next Level. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>As before, it\u2019s the characters that shine through; from Karen Gillan\u2019s ludicrously attired Ruby Roundhouse, whose ass-kicking new skills include nunchucks (once blanket-banned from UK screens by the British Board of Film Classification), to Jack Black\u2019s map-reading Dr \u201cShelley\u201d Oberon, delightfully reunited with Madison Iseman\u2019s likable mean girl persona. We even get a reprise of Baby, I Love Your Way, a track that raised a big laugh in <em>Welcome to </em><em>the </em><em>Jungle</em> and provokes a knowing chuckle here.</p> <p>Whether this winning formula can be repeated yet another time remains a moot point. An end-credits sequence invokes the \u201creal world\u201d adventures of yore, paving the way for further instalments, but I hope these characters remain true to their promise to \u201cnever go back again\u201d. It\u2019s a promise they\u2019ve already broken once, and somehow managed to get away with it. Next time, I doubt I\u2019ll be quite so forgiving.</p>",

      "bodyText": "No one was more surprised than I when Jake Kasdan\u2019s 2017 romp Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle managed to squeeze smart new thrills from the premise of Chris Van Allsburg\u2019s 1981 children\u2019s book, first filmed in 1995. While Joe Johnston\u2019s Jumanji (starring Robin Williams) had featured fantastical creatures escaping from the titular board-game to run wild in Brantford, New Hampshire, Kasdan\u2019s \u201ccontinuation of the story\u201d sent four young players into a video game, where they battled a series of challenges in order to earn a safe passage home. The result was a crowd-pleasing romp that combined the school detention premise of The Breakfast Club with boisterous CG action in sprightly fashion. With a worldwide box-office gross just this side of a billion dollars, a sequel became an industrial necessity \u2013 never an inspiring situation. It\u2019s a relief, therefore, to report that Jumanji: The Next Level keeps things upbeat and lively, thanks in no small part to the introduction of two counterintuitively revivifying characters \u2013 curmudgeonly old codgers whose gripes and aches provide a jolly counterpoint to the teen angst that fired Kasdan\u2019s previous instalment. Danny DeVito and Danny Glover are, respectively, Eddie and Milo \u2013 former restaurateurs nursing a 15-year-old estrangement beef. When Eddie\u2019s disillusioned grandson Spencer (Alex Wolff) ventures back into the Jumanji video game with dreams of once again becoming handsome adventurer Dr Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), his somewhat distant friends are forced to follow. Unfortunately, Eddie and Milo are unwittingly dragged along for the ride, swept into an alternative universe in which Jurgen the Brutal (Game of Thrones\u2019s Rory McCann) has stolen Jumanji\u2019s life-giving jewel, threatening its kingdoms with drought and darkness. \u201cWe\u2019re in a \u2018video game\u2019,\u201d the youngsters try to explain to the old farts, to little avail. More confusing still is the randomness of the in-game avatar identities assigned to each player. This time, the body-swap choices of the first film are shuffled and multiplied, allowing our adult stars to experiment with a wider range of comically mimicked characters. Thus we get to enjoy the Rock doing a loopy impression of Danny DeVito, experiencing the thrill of huge biceps and fully mobile hips (\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d); and Kevin Hart channelling Glover\u2019s laconic verbal delivery as Franklin \u201cMouse\u201d Finbar, drawling: \u201cDid I just kill Eddie by talking too slow \u2013 like he always said I would?\u201d Upping the ante is Awkwafina as new game-character Ming Fleetfoot, whose appearance poses both questions and answers as the narrative (penned by Kasdan with returning co-writers Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg) jumbles identities like T-shirts in a tumble dryer. Like some super-charged kaleidoscopic rehash of Freaky Friday, Jumanji: The Next Level takes polymorphous pleasure in its frenetic scrambling of age, gender and racial boundaries, yet somehow manages to keep us up to speed with who is in which body at any given moment \u2013 just about. It\u2019s a credit to the film-makers that a one-sided conversation between a cat burglar and a hybrid horse can still pack an emotional punch, a feat of which Polish surrealist director Walerian Borowczyk would have been rightly proud. There are a few false steps. Some of the bawdier gags about horse dicks and eunuch\u2019s testicles strike a duff note, and there\u2019s a bagginess to the third act that afflicts so many FX-heavy blockbusters. Yet for the most part the set pieces (which include giant ostriches chasing dune buggies and airborne encounters with snarling monkeys) have an enjoyable grandeur, emphasised by Henry Jackman\u2019s score, which cheekily invokes Maurice Jarre\u2019s Lawrence of Arabia theme during an early desert sequence. As before, it\u2019s the characters that shine through; from Karen Gillan\u2019s ludicrously attired Ruby Roundhouse, whose ass-kicking new skills include nunchucks (once blanket-banned from UK screens by the British Board of Film Classification), to Jack Black\u2019s map-reading Dr \u201cShelley\u201d Oberon, delightfully reunited with Madison Iseman\u2019s likable mean girl persona. We even get a reprise of Baby, I Love Your Way, a track that raised a big laugh in Welcome to the Jungle and provokes a knowing chuckle here. Whether this winning formula can be repeated yet another time remains a moot point. An end-credits sequence invokes the \u201creal world\u201d adventures of yore, paving the way for further instalments, but I hope these characters remain true to their promise to \u201cnever go back again\u201d. It\u2019s a promise they\u2019ve already broken once, and somehow managed to get away with it. Next time, I doubt I\u2019ll be quite so forgiving.",

      "body": "<p>Ladies and gentlemen please make way for the man of 2019, barrelling into his lovely kitchen-lounge in a blue dressing gown and tracky bottoms. \u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/stormzy\" title=\"\">Stormzy</a>, enveloping me in a hug. \u201cSorry.\u201d His apologies are because he\u2019s a bit late \u2013 he had a headache, \u201ceven though I went bed early\u201d \u2013 and also because I\u2019ve just heard him bawl out a man who came to his front door. Stormzy had thought it was a food delivery and so buzzed the gate to let him in. But the man wasn\u2019t delivering food. \u201cHe was looking for money,\u201d says Stormzy. \u201cSo send me an email, you get me? I get it\u2019s a charity, but this is my home. I\u2019m Michael here, not Stormzy!\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re sitting on an L-shaped sofa, opposite an enormous TV. Michael Omari Jr, aka Stormzy, who is jolly despite his buzzing head, goes to feed his dog, a huge Rottweiler lounging by the front door. Time for me to have a nosey around. Stormzy\u2019s house is open plan, bright and modern, with what at first glance looks like an awful lot of ornaments but turns out to be awards: 29 of them, on various living-room shelves, including several <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mobos\" title=\"\">M</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mobos\" title=\"\">obos</a>. There\u2019s also his 2019 <em>Time</em> cover, framed and waiting to be hung up, and in his downstairs loo a double platinum disc for his first album, <em>Gang Signs &amp; Prayers</em>. The place is neat, but not a show home. There are clothes on the ironing board, bottles of Coke on the surfaces.Floor-to-ceiling glass doors look out over a grey sky, a small square of grass, a free-standing boxing bag and what looks like a glass-fronted studio. It\u2019s actually a glamma-kennel, for the dog.</p> <p>\u201cI bought this house in October,\u201d says Stormzy, who\u2019s got his food now. \u201cI saw it and I was like: \u2018Yes, bless, this is it.\u2019 But next door is a Lady, no\u2026 a Baroness, who has a Conservative poster up in her window. I took the dog for a walk the other day to the park and there was a gang fight. And everyone rings my bell all the time.\u201d Not that he\u2019s not used to strangers trying to gain entrance: when he lived in Chelsea, with his then girlfriend the TV and radio presenter Maya Jama, the police battered down his front door just after he\u2019d moved in, because a neighbour had assumed Stormzy was a burglar. Anyhow, he split up with Jama last year and now he lives alone. So he has no one to look after him when he\u2019s ill. \u201cI\u2019m sad,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI just lie there and feel sorry for myself!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c9a75b61fd060d034bf4691632ed9b243b4eb12e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a75b61fd060d034bf4691632ed9b243b4eb12e/0_0_945_1197/789.jpg\" alt=\"stormzyobsmagtakeover\" width=\"789\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This interview appeared in the 15 December 2019 Observer Magazine edited by Stormzy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that\u2019s he\u2019s everyone\u2019s favourite homegrown rapper, it\u2019s easy for people to forget where Stormzy came from. He grew up in Norbury, south London, with two elder sisters, a younger brother and his mum. His dad wasn\u2019t around and, back then, home wasn\u2019t a place to hang out. I once asked him if he had posters on his bedroom wall as a kid, and he looked at me as though I was mad. Home was \u201cindividuals operating in the same house,\u201d he told me. \u201cI never had that home of having posters on my wall and having trainers lined up, it was just\u2026 somewhere I slept.\u201d No wonder he\u2019s protective about his home now. It means a lot more to him than it does to most.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>We last met around three years ago, in the Putney studio of Fraser T Smith, the main producer of <em>Gang Signs </em><em>&amp; Prayers</em>. At the time Stormzy was fairly unknown outside of grime \u2013 Shut Up had gone Top 10 a couple of months earlier \u2013 though, personality-wise, he was almost exactly as he is now: chatty, honest, \u201cgassy\u201d (upbeat, energetic) and ambitious. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the best rapper in the UK,\u201d he told me then. \u201cI want to be the best artist in the UK.\u201d His ambition wasn\u2019t just for himself. \u201cThe main thing for me is my young black kings\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cI say to them, \u2018You are sick, you\u2019re nang, you can do this. You\u2019re better than anything anyone\u2019s ever told you that you are.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0031b659f132aa952d7da2dd583cc02a5b4f64aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0031b659f132aa952d7da2dd583cc02a5b4f64aa/0_61_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stepping up: Stormzy announces his scholarship for two students to study at Cambridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stepping up: Stormzy announces his scholarship for two students to study at Cambridge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stormzy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remind him of what he said then, and he is quite overwhelmed. \u201cSick,\u201d he keeps saying. \u201cThat\u2019s hard.\u201d And, \u201cThank God.\u201d Because, of course, he achieved every one of his aims. Not only did he have a massive smash album that moved him from grime into the mainstream, he also set up a book imprint for young black writers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/15/stormzy-to-fund-two-more-cambridge-students\" title=\"\">created a yearly scholarship</a> to Cambridge University for two black undergraduates. (He pays for all their accommodation and fees.) And he\u2019s been an advocate for the victims of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\" title=\"\">Grenfell Tower fire</a>, using his appearance at the 2018 Brits to perform a rap about Grenfell that specifically addressed the then-prime minister, Theresa May, and, more recently, calling Jacob Rees-Mogg \u201can actual piece of shit\u201d for implying that those who died lacked common sense. He has also tackled the current prime minister in his lyrics, mentioning \u201cthe irony of trapping on a Boris bike\u201d in Crown, as well as Vossi Bop\u2019s \u201cFuck the government and fuck Boris\u201d: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-historic-glastonbury-performance\" title=\"\">huge crowd call-back </a>during his triumphant Glastonbury appearance in June this year.</p> <p>So, Stormzy is far from frightened of politics. On social media, he encouraged young people to register to vote and said he\u2019d vote Labour. This led Michael Gove to comment that \u201cStormzy is a far better rapper than he is a political analyst\u201d before, bizarrely, quoting one of his lyrics. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/26/i-set-trends-dem-man-copy-michael-gove-mocks-stormzy-labour-support\" title=\"\">I set trends dem man </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/26/i-set-trends-dem-man-copy-michael-gove-mocks-stormzy-labour-support\" title=\"\">copy</a>\u201d tweeted the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, 52.</p> <p>Two years ago, Stormzy would have reacted. But now he can\u2019t be bothered. \u201cI\u2019m so used to it, being this black face in mainstream culture. It\u2019s like Ali G, like, \u201cYeah, bruv.

No one was talking about that. I wasn\u2019t talking about music, I wasn\u2019t talking about Shut Up \u2013 I was talking about politics. So him saying that is like he said: \u2018Oh, no, forget politics. This is what he does. He\u2019s a rapper.\u2019 It\u2019s a weaponised tactic. They do it to young people, they do it to black people, they do it to rappers, they do it to entertainers: \u2018Just shut up and rap.\u2019 Stay in your lane. It\u2019s very telling of who these people are. As much as I\u2019m a rapper, I\u2019ve also done X, Y, Z. But they\u2019re dismissing everything else. They just look at me and say: \u2018No.\u2019 They reduce us to whatever they need us to be and dismiss it.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>This Stormzy-edited issue of the<em> Observer Magazine</em> was produced in the week before the election, coming out in its immediate aftermath. Clearly, the guest editor is going to be disappointed if the Tories win, but even if they have, he won\u2019t be cowed into silence. \u201cChoosing hope and righteousness and a person committed to helping the many, not the few, that is not a fairy-tale dream,\u201d he says. \u201cThey make it sound like one decision is stupid and uninformed, and the other one is smart and intelligent. That\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s funny, politics is so dark that when a shining knight comes along, we\u2019re told it\u2019s just a fucking dream. But ambition, and a better future, a genuine kinder, better society, that is the smart choice.\u201d</p> <p>Stormzy isn\u2019t ruffled by the insults of politicians, because he knows he\u2019s clever. \u201cI\u2019m intelligent,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s always a bit of a smugness to me.\u201d He did well in his GCSEs, gaining six A*s, three As, and five Bs, and would have smashed his A levels if he\u2019d bothered to do any work. As it was, he got ABCDE. \u201cIt showed me that in life, you need work ethic,\u201d he\u2019s said since.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Eight songs in, during Sweet Like Chocolate, the monitor in his ear blew. 'I came off stage literally bawling my eyes out. I\u2019ve never cried like that in my life.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cSo when they dismiss me it\u2019s like, \u2018You lot picked the wrong fucking rapper.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Anyway, no matter who is now our prime minister, you can guarantee that at some point, they will encounter Stormzy\u2019s new album, <em>Heavy Is the Head</em>, which came out the day after the election. The process of making it was very different to <em>Gang Signs</em> (or \u201c<em>GSAP</em>\u201d as he calls it). <em>GSAP</em> was made in one go, over a solid period in 2016, when Stormzy locked himself in the studio with Fraser T Smith for eight months, quit social media and concentrated.</p> <p>But with <em>Heavy Is the Head </em>that just wasn\u2019t possible. He had all his other new commitments, plus everything else that comes with being famous. \u201cI had to go out into the world,\u201d he says. So he got in touch with a lot of different producers. For instance, he spent several weeks in LA, working with Pharrell Williams, among others. But it didn\u2019t result in anything: \u201cI give him all the love and props, but sometimes it just doesn\u2019t gel.\u201d</p> <p>He did, however, make a track with Ed Sheeran and Burna Boy, Own It. He met Sheeran in 2016, around the time of Shut Up. Sheeran got in touch and asked him to come over. What did they have in common? \u201cAmbition,\u201d says Stormzy. \u201cHe\u2019s super ambitious and so am I.\u201d ( Stormzy used to want to be prime minister, just because \u201cit\u2019s the biggest job\u201d. \u201cI was like, seven? And I was proper not joking. I was like, \u2018That\u2019s light work. Becoming prime minister is light work.\u2019\u201d) He has recently had some stick about it from fans, who\u2019ve accused him of featuring Sheeran just to have a hit. But Stormzy insists it was more natural than that. He never goes into a studio saying to himself, right, I\u2019m going to make a hard grime track or a pop hit. He just \u201cserves the music\u201d, he says, and with Own It, it started with him and producer Fred trying to imitate a sound on Kanye West\u2019s Waves. Then Stormzy decided he wanted a verse from Sheeran, so Sheeran wrote that and sang it. And then, Stormzy thought the tune needs \u201cflavour, sauce\u201d so he turned to Burna Boy. He wasn\u2019t trying to manufacture a hit, he says, he just wanted to make a song that women could put on and feel good about themselves. \u201cSometimes music can be a bit sexist or like using women as objects,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, no, forget all of that, I want a woman to be able to play this before she\u2019s going out for drinks with her girls.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"dd7d325dc3d4a4c31bdda65d1f8547ab2247dae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7d325dc3d4a4c31bdda65d1f8547ab2247dae8/0_89_5099_3059/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brixton boys: Stormzy at the O2 Academy Brixton with Ed Sheeran, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brixton boys: Stormzy at the O2 Academy Brixton with Ed Sheeran, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pjp Photos/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyway, the album is out. The subject matter is, mostly, Stormzy, to be honest, but he\u2019s keen to show he\u2019s not a one-sided character. Each track is a separate entity. \u201cIt\u2019s 16 truths from a man. So it\u2019s like 16 chapters.\u201d This reminds me of his headlining Glastonbury performance. Watching it from the sofa, it seemed very clear that each song had been planned as an individual experience, with every one offering a different feel and delivery, whether a piano ballad, a straight rap, or a full-on performance featuring a choir or ballet dancers. He admits to having been worried about the show. In his assessment: \u201cYou got one fucking album, 59 minutes long. Glastonbury is an hour and 30 minutes.\u201d Hence his use of Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You, Kanye\u2019s Ultralight Beam and Dave and Fredo\u2019s Funky Friday.</p> <p>Though his performance \u2013 Glastonbury\u2019s first headline slot for a solo black British artist \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage\" title=\"\">deemed one of the festival\u2019s best </a>ever, Stormzy did not find it easy. He\u2019s spoken recently about how he couldn\u2019t really hear while he was onstage. The whole story takes a while, because it was \u201cthe moment of my life,\u201d and it\u2019s still raw and real in his mind \u2013 but also because he\u2019s a great storyteller. But the short version is this. Eight songs in, during Sweet Like Chocolate, the monitor in his ear blew. \u201cIt just went\u2026 poof, nothing. I can just hear the distant sound of the festival PA speakers. Everyone\u2019s coming in, \u2018We on an ultralight beam,\u2019 and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018This is the most fucked you\u2019ve ever been in your life. You are on Glastonbury stage and you can\u2019t hear.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>So at the end of the song, he ran off, shouted at everyone, got fitted with another in-ear monitor and came back on. Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin, at the piano, was stalling for time: \u201cYou can see him looking over his shoulder at me, just filling in, but because he\u2019s so classy, you can\u2019t tell.\u201d They perform Blinded By Your Grace Part 1, then Martin leaves and Stormzy segues into Crown. Halfway through that, his monitor blows again.</p> <p>\u201cAnd from then on, I can\u2019t hear anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m in no man\u2019s land. Finished. Can\u2019t hear nothing for the rest of the show. I\u2019m just rapping to this faint sound of the festival speaker PA, but then sometimes I get the full sound of the crowd, like DUUHHHHHHHH, and then nothing. And then I would hear like a fucking conversation, faint little bits of laughter, like the mic is left on in a control room. It was fully like I was going mad.

Yes, he says, and he\u2019ll be happy when it\u2019s not. Now he\u2019s out of a long-term relationship, he\u2019s trying to work things out solo. \u201cThe beauty of a relationship, you lean on each other, you rely on each other, you take energy and give energy to each other,\u201d he says.

Is he planning to step out of the spotlight? It\u2019s a hard thing to do, now it\u2019s focused on him and he shines so bright.

      "bodyText": "Ladies and gentlemen please make way for the man of 2019, barrelling into his lovely kitchen-lounge in a blue dressing gown and tracky bottoms. \u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d says Stormzy, enveloping me in a hug. \u201cSorry.\u201d His apologies are because he\u2019s a bit late \u2013 he had a headache, \u201ceven though I went bed early\u201d \u2013 and also because I\u2019ve just heard him bawl out a man who came to his front door. Stormzy had thought it was a food delivery and so buzzed the gate to let him in. But the man wasn\u2019t delivering food. \u201cHe was looking for money,\u201d says Stormzy. \u201cSo send me an email, you get me? I get it\u2019s a charity, but this is my home. I\u2019m Michael here, not Stormzy!\u201d We\u2019re sitting on an L-shaped sofa, opposite an enormous TV. Michael Omari Jr, aka Stormzy, who is jolly despite his buzzing head, goes to feed his dog, a huge Rottweiler lounging by the front door. Time for me to have a nosey around. Stormzy\u2019s house is open plan, bright and modern, with what at first glance looks like an awful lot of ornaments but turns out to be awards: 29 of them, on various living-room shelves, including several Mobos. There\u2019s also his 2019 Time cover, framed and waiting to be hung up, and in his downstairs loo a double platinum disc for his first album, Gang Signs &amp; Prayers. The place is neat, but not a show home. There are clothes on the ironing board, bottles of Coke on the surfaces.Floor-to-ceiling glass doors look out over a grey sky, a small square of grass, a free-standing boxing bag and what looks like a glass-fronted studio. It\u2019s actually a glamma-kennel, for the dog. \u201cI bought this house in October,\u201d says Stormzy, who\u2019s got his food now. \u201cI saw it and I was like: \u2018Yes, bless, this is it.\u2019 But next door is a Lady, no\u2026 a Baroness, who has a Conservative poster up in her window. I took the dog for a walk the other day to the park and there was a gang fight. And everyone rings my bell all the time.\u201d Not that he\u2019s not used to strangers trying to gain entrance: when he lived in Chelsea, with his then girlfriend the TV and radio presenter Maya Jama, the police battered down his front door just after he\u2019d moved in, because a neighbour had assumed Stormzy was a burglar. Anyhow, he split up with Jama last year and now he lives alone. So he has no one to look after him when he\u2019s ill. \u201cI\u2019m sad,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI just lie there and feel sorry for myself!\u201d Now that\u2019s he\u2019s everyone\u2019s favourite homegrown rapper, it\u2019s easy for people to forget where Stormzy came from. He grew up in Norbury, south London, with two elder sisters, a younger brother and his mum. His dad wasn\u2019t around and, back then, home wasn\u2019t a place to hang out. I once asked him if he had posters on his bedroom wall as a kid, and he looked at me as though I was mad. Home was \u201cindividuals operating in the same house,\u201d he told me. \u201cI never had that home of having posters on my wall and having trainers lined up, it was just\u2026 somewhere I slept.\u201d No wonder he\u2019s protective about his home now. It means a lot more to him than it does to most. * * * We last met around three years ago, in the Putney studio of Fraser T Smith, the main producer of Gang Signs &amp; Prayers. At the time Stormzy was fairly unknown outside of grime \u2013 Shut Up had gone Top 10 a couple of months earlier \u2013 though, personality-wise, he was almost exactly as he is now: chatty, honest, \u201cgassy\u201d (upbeat, energetic) and ambitious. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the best rapper in the UK,\u201d he told me then. \u201cI want to be the best artist in the UK.\u201d His ambition wasn\u2019t just for himself. \u201cThe main thing for me is my young black kings\u2026\u201d he said. \u201cI say to them, \u2018You are sick, you\u2019re nang, you can do this. You\u2019re better than anything anyone\u2019s ever told you that you are.\u2019\u201d I remind him of what he said then, and he is quite overwhelmed. \u201cSick,\u201d he keeps saying. \u201cThat\u2019s hard.\u201d And, \u201cThank God.\u201d Because, of course, he achieved every one of his aims. Not only did he have a massive smash album that moved him from grime into the mainstream, he also set up a book imprint for young black writers and created a yearly scholarship to Cambridge University for two black undergraduates. (He pays for all their accommodation and fees.) And he\u2019s been an advocate for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire, using his appearance at the 2018 Brits to perform a rap about Grenfell that specifically addressed the then-prime minister, Theresa May, and, more recently, calling Jacob Rees-Mogg \u201can actual piece of shit\u201d for implying that those who died lacked common sense. He has also tackled the current prime minister in his lyrics, mentioning \u201cthe irony of trapping on a Boris bike\u201d in Crown, as well as Vossi Bop\u2019s \u201cFuck the government and fuck Boris\u201d: a huge crowd call-back during his triumphant Glastonbury appearance in June this year. So, Stormzy is far from frightened of politics. On social media, he encouraged young people to register to vote and said he\u2019d vote Labour. This led Michael Gove to comment that \u201cStormzy is a far better rapper than he is a political analyst\u201d before, bizarrely, quoting one of his lyrics. \u201cI set trends dem man copy\u201d tweeted the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, 52. Two years ago, Stormzy would have reacted. But now he can\u2019t be bothered. \u201cI\u2019m so used to it, being this black face in mainstream culture. It\u2019s like Ali G, like, \u201cYeah, bruv. Yeah, fam\u201d\u2026 The nuances are as loud as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s the classic, \u2018You\u2019re just a rapper,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cUsing \u2018I set trends dem man copy\u2019... No one was talking about that. I wasn\u2019t talking about music, I wasn\u2019t talking about Shut Up \u2013 I was talking about politics. So him saying that is like he said: \u2018Oh, no, forget politics. This is what he does. He\u2019s a rapper.\u2019 It\u2019s a weaponised tactic. They do it to young people, they do it to black people, they do it to rappers, they do it to entertainers: \u2018Just shut up and rap.\u2019 Stay in your lane. It\u2019s very telling of who these people are. As much as I\u2019m a rapper, I\u2019ve also done X, Y, Z. But they\u2019re dismissing everything else. They just look at me and say: \u2018No.\u2019 They reduce us to whatever they need us to be and dismiss it.\u201d * * * This Stormzy-edited issue of the Observer Magazine was produced in the week before the election, coming out in its immediate aftermath. Clearly, the guest editor is going to be disappointed if the Tories win, but even if they have, he won\u2019t be cowed into silence. \u201cChoosing hope and righteousness and a person committed to helping the many, not the few, that is not a fairy-tale dream,\u201d he says. \u201cThey make it sound like one decision is stupid and uninformed, and the other one is smart and intelligent. That\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s funny, politics is so dark that when a shining knight comes along, we\u2019re told it\u2019s just a fucking dream. But ambition, and a better future, a genuine kinder, better society, that is the smart choice.\u201d Stormzy isn\u2019t ruffled by the insults of politicians, because he knows he\u2019s clever. \u201cI\u2019m intelligent,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why there\u2019s always a bit of a smugness to me.\u201d He did well in his GCSEs, gaining six A*s, three As, and five Bs, and would have smashed his A levels if he\u2019d bothered to do any work. As it was, he got ABCDE. \u201cIt showed me that in life, you need work ethic,\u201d he\u2019s said since. \u201cSo when they dismiss me it\u2019s like, \u2018You lot picked the wrong fucking rapper.\u2019\u201d Anyway, no matter who is now our prime minister, you can guarantee that at some point, they will encounter Stormzy\u2019s new album, Heavy Is the Head, which came out the day after the election. The process of making it was very different to Gang Signs (or \u201cGSAP\u201d as he calls it). GSAP was made in one go, over a solid period in 2016, when Stormzy locked himself in the studio with Fraser T Smith for eight months, quit social media and concentrated. But with Heavy Is the Head that just wasn\u2019t possible. He had all his other new commitments, plus everything else that comes with being famous. \u201cI had to go out into the world,\u201d he says. So he got in touch with a lot of different producers. For instance, he spent several weeks in LA, working with Pharrell Williams, among others. But it didn\u2019t result in anything: \u201cI give him all the love and props, but sometimes it just doesn\u2019t gel.\u201d He did, however, make a track with Ed Sheeran and Burna Boy, Own It. He met Sheeran in 2016, around the time of Shut Up. Sheeran got in touch and asked him to come over. What did they have in common? \u201cAmbition,\u201d says Stormzy. \u201cHe\u2019s super ambitious and so am I.\u201d ( Stormzy used to want to be prime minister, just because \u201cit\u2019s the biggest job\u201d. \u201cI was like, seven? And I was proper not joking. I was like, \u2018That\u2019s light work. Becoming prime minister is light work.\u2019\u201d) He has recently had some stick about it from fans, who\u2019ve accused him of featuring Sheeran just to have a hit. But Stormzy insists it was more natural than that. He never goes into a studio saying to himself, right, I\u2019m going to make a hard grime track or a pop hit. He just \u201cserves the music\u201d, he says, and with Own It, it started with him and producer Fred trying to imitate a sound on Kanye West\u2019s Waves. Then Stormzy decided he wanted a verse from Sheeran, so Sheeran wrote that and sang it. And then, Stormzy thought the tune needs \u201cflavour, sauce\u201d so he turned to Burna Boy. He wasn\u2019t trying to manufacture a hit, he says, he just wanted to make a song that women could put on and feel good about themselves. \u201cSometimes music can be a bit sexist or like using women as objects,\u201d he says. \u201cI was like, no, forget all of that, I want a woman to be able to play this before she\u2019s going out for drinks with her girls.\u201d Anyway, the album is out. The subject matter is, mostly, Stormzy, to be honest, but he\u2019s keen to show he\u2019s not a one-sided character. Each track is a separate entity. \u201cIt\u2019s 16 truths from a man. So it\u2019s like 16 chapters.\u201d This reminds me of his headlining Glastonbury performance. Watching it from the sofa, it seemed very clear that each song had been planned as an individual experience, with every one offering a different feel and delivery, whether a piano ballad, a straight rap, or a full-on performance featuring a choir or ballet dancers. He admits to having been worried about the show. In his assessment: \u201cYou got one fucking album, 59 minutes long. Glastonbury is an hour and 30 minutes.\u201d Hence his use of Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You, Kanye\u2019s Ultralight Beam and Dave and Fredo\u2019s Funky Friday. Though his performance \u2013 Glastonbury\u2019s first headline slot for a solo black British artist \u2013 was deemed one of the festival\u2019s best ever, Stormzy did not find it easy. He\u2019s spoken recently about how he couldn\u2019t really hear while he was onstage. The whole story takes a while, because it was \u201cthe moment of my life,\u201d and it\u2019s still raw and real in his mind \u2013 but also because he\u2019s a great storyteller. But the short version is this. Eight songs in, during Sweet Like Chocolate, the monitor in his ear blew. \u201cIt just went\u2026 poof, nothing. I can just hear the distant sound of the festival PA speakers. Everyone\u2019s coming in, \u2018We on an ultralight beam,\u2019 and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018This is the most fucked you\u2019ve ever been in your life. You are on Glastonbury stage and you can\u2019t hear.\u2019\u201d So at the end of the song, he ran off, shouted at everyone, got fitted with another in-ear monitor and came back on. Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin, at the piano, was stalling for time: \u201cYou can see him looking over his shoulder at me, just filling in, but because he\u2019s so classy, you can\u2019t tell.\u201d They perform Blinded By Your Grace Part 1, then Martin leaves and Stormzy segues into Crown. Halfway through that, his monitor blows again. \u201cAnd from then on, I can\u2019t hear anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m in no man\u2019s land. Finished. Can\u2019t hear nothing for the rest of the show. I\u2019m just rapping to this faint sound of the festival speaker PA, but then sometimes I get the full sound of the crowd, like DUUHHHHHHHH, and then nothing. And then I would hear like a fucking conversation, faint little bits of laughter, like the mic is left on in a control room. It was fully like I was going mad. So I\u2019m just rapping, and all that\u2019s going on through my head is, \u2018Oh, my God, I want to cry so bad. This is the pinnacle of my entire life and it\u2019s all going to shit.\u2019 And I was just thinking, \u2018Just pray. Just keep thanking God, giving God the glory, and take it all in.\u2019\u201d I\u2019ve watched a video of his performance since he told me this and the only way you can tell is he touches his ears and the mic pack every so often, and asks the crowd to \u201cHelp me out!\u201d by joining in choruses, getting them to sing along. At one point Dave and Fredo join him onstage and he has to just bow his head and make the prayer sign \u201cbecause I can\u2019t hear a fucking word Dave\u2019s saying\u201d. Anyway, when he comes off, he\u2019s in bits. \u201cLiterally bawling my eyes out. I\u2019ve never cried like that in my life.\u201d He thought he\u2019d blown it. All his friends and family are looking at him like he\u2019s mad, but he\u2019s in full emotional flow. It was only about an hour later, when his best friend Flipz arrives with a laptop and a USB of the show, that Stormzy realises he\u2019s played a brilliant set. * * * A week or so later, he goes to church. (Stormzy is a regular church-goer, attending the Word of Grace Ministries in Kennington.) He goes to give thanks and to testify. And when he\u2019s there, he discovers his mum hadn\u2019t watched his performance live because the pastor had called her up just before Stormzy went on stage to say that he\u2019d had a vision. \u201cThe pastor saw reviews that said: \u2018The worst performance of all time\u2019 and then a hand coming down holding a stamp, and stamping on the review, DENIED.\u201d He told Stormzy\u2019s mum they needed to pray that Stormzy\u2019s performance go well. So that is what she, the pastor and some other churchgoers were doing while her son was dealing with not being able to hear anything at all in front of the biggest crowd he has ever played before in his life. As far as Stormzy is concerned, God saved him. God and muscle memory: \u201cI was so ready for that show. I\u2019ve never been more prepared for anything.\u201d And if it hadn\u2019t gone well? \u201cI was thinking: \u2018The country\u2019s going to slaughter me for this. They\u2019re going to absolutely rip me to shreds and I\u2019m going to fucking disappear.\u2019 I was going to go. There wouldn\u2019t have been no second album.\u201d I\u2019m exhausted just hearing this. What a rollercoaster Stormzy\u2019s life has been recently! Yes, he says, and he\u2019ll be happy when it\u2019s not. Now he\u2019s out of a long-term relationship, he\u2019s trying to work things out solo. \u201cThe beauty of a relationship, you lean on each other, you rely on each other, you take energy and give energy to each other,\u201d he says. He and Jama started dating when he was 21 and first became a musician, so it\u2019s strange for him to be making music, with all that entails, without a partner. \u201cNow, when I\u2019m alone with my thoughts, it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, this is on you to figure out, and for you to get to the bottom of, and for you to work through,\u2019 which is a new thing for me.\u201d Now, he says, \u201cI just want to be an artist.

Not, like, video games. I love poker, Monopoly, Scrabble, Connect 4. I\u2019m a kid, like. I love a competitive game. And poker\u2019s like the ultimate version of all skilled games. Love it!

I\u2019ve always wanted the movie of my life to be, like, fucking epic. So I got to do some more epic shit, live a little longer. I\u2019m only 26.

Did you encounter any resistance to the idea of a pop star setting up a bursary?\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e4cceecd822ec1a76246e078c6ef86c0b7945810\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4cceecd822ec1a76246e078c6ef86c0b7945810/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"Scholarship material: Sir Elton John.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Elton! I have a lot of respect for Cambridge. When we came in, they just held their hands up and said, \u201cYep, we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Of course! The stats were right there. They said: \u201cWe have a problem, let\u2019s fix it.\u201d And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards now. Since we\u2019ve started working with them they\u2019ve been nothing but brilliant. Super supportive. Whatever ideas we\u2019ve got. Whatever we do. They know they\u2019re way behind in terms of bridging the gap of whatever injustice was there, so they let us do whatever we need to do to make this right.</p> <p>Do you know what I really respect? They\u2019ve been unapologetic with the use of the word \u201cblack\u201d when talking about the problem. They haven\u2019t shied away from it. They haven\u2019t used terms like \u201cunderprivileged\u201d. They know it\u2019s a black problem. Full praise to them.</p> <p>There was resistance to \u201ca pop star\u201d setting up a bursary, but not from Cambridge. A lot of people said that the scholarship I\u2019d set up, which is for black students, is racist. \u201cIt can\u2019t be just for blacks, you\u2019re racist!\u201d I remember that on the day it was first announced I ended up feeling a bit sad. I thought I was doing a really good thing, and we put it out in the world and then the arrows came from everywhere. I spent the whole day replying to people in their DMs, because there were people who genuinely did not understand. You had the idiots who were just angry. And then you had people who were saying, \u201cHey Stormz, really love your music, really love everything you stand for, but how come this is just for black students?\u201d So there was an education that had to happen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0031b659f132aa952d7da2dd583cc02a5b4f64aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0031b659f132aa952d7da2dd583cc02a5b4f64aa/0_31_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"First step to success: candidates for the first Stormzy Scholarship in partnership with Cambridge University\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">First step to success: candidates for the first Stormzy Scholarship in partnership with Cambridge University</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stormzy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of the argument was that there are underprivileged people from all backgrounds. There are underprivileged white people, Asian people\u2026 Yeah, of course! So there is this umbrella of underprivileged that everyone falls under, but beneath that we have being black as well. Being black, you\u2019re under-underprivileged. A lot of people don\u2019t understand racism because they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening. They don\u2019t know what being black means. The lack of opportunities. They\u2019re not privy to it. So I took my time and I explained.</p> <h2>* * *</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8ccb315723c0a060989391d473856d1e88605a38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ccb315723c0a060989391d473856d1e88605a38/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"zadie smith\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Q: <strong>Zadie Smith</strong></h2> <h2>\u2018Top five?\u2019</h2> <p>Rappers, right?

I was just doing what I wanted to be doing, and it turned out I\u2019d done something special. I knew it was good. I knew it was sick.

It\u2019s all about family. We sit down, we talk a bit of shit, we tell jokes. People pop up. And then we just work. And as soon as my brain\u2019s gone dry I pack it up and go home. That might be 7pm, or 4pm, or 4am. Sometimes we\u2019ll be up until 7am.</p> <p>I\u2019m in service to the art. When my brain stops, I call it a day. And then I\u2019m back in the next day.

I couldn\u2019t even get told off by her if I tried. She proper rates me \u2013 whatever I do now I always get a pass from her.

As soon as I\u2019d had my picture taken 10 or 15 times I started saying no. I just wanted to enjoy the show. And my mum said, \u201cNah, Junior, come on.\u201d She always wants me to embrace that kind of thing. The kid at her church who wants a picture, the auntie who wants something signed. She\u2019s always like, \u201cNah, Junior, you have to do this.\u201d And she told me off. But she was probably right.</p>",

I love poker, Monopoly, Scrabble, Connect 4. I\u2019m a kid, like. I love a competitive game. And poker\u2019s like the ultimate version of all skilled games. Love it! If I wasn\u2019t a musician, I\u2019d be a professional poker player. Proper. * * * Q: Candice Carty-Williams \u2018How did your orange trousers stay up when you headlined Glastonbury this year?\u2019 Well, Candice, they didn\u2019t really stay up. I can\u2019t lie, that\u2019s the one thing about Glasto I watch. \u201cOhhhh, they are really low.\u201d My whole bum was out. There was thousands of mums saying, \u201cPull your trousers up young man!\u201d Luckily I was in good nick, so it worked in my favour. My trousers needed to be that far down, for whatever reason. Q: Kurupt FM Crew \u2018Do you have any plans to do a movie? Because we\u2019re doing one so technically if you do one now, it means that we\u2019ve inspired you.\u2019 That\u2019s a proper Kurupt FM question, innit. I don\u2019t have plans right now. I\u2019ve always wanted the movie of my life to be, like, fucking epic. So I got to do some more epic shit, live a little longer. I\u2019m only 26. Don\u2019t know how much of a feature-length film that would make. When I do get round to it though, I\u2019m sure it will have been inspired by the seed that Kurupt FM planted. * * * Q: Jessie Ware \u2018Greggs Yum Yums still? Or are you a Greggs vegan sausage roll man now?\u2019 You know what, I love a vegan sausage roll, but \u2013 disclaimer! \u2013 do not mistake me for a vegan. Still love a Yum Yum though. The sausage bean and cheese melt has been a favourite recently. Sausage steak bake; sausage, bean and cheese melt; or, in the festive season, you really want to get the turkey and cranberry one. That\u2019s a good pastry. Q: Sir Elton John \u2018I\u2019ve been hugely impressed with the way you\u2019ve used your success to establish the Stormzy Scholarships at Cambridge University. What was the response from Cambridge like? Did you encounter any resistance to the idea of a pop star setting up a bursary?\u2019 Elton! I have a lot of respect for Cambridge. When we came in, they just held their hands up and said, \u201cYep, we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d Of course! The stats were right there. They said: \u201cWe have a problem, let\u2019s fix it.\u201d And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards now. Since we\u2019ve started working with them they\u2019ve been nothing but brilliant. Super supportive. Whatever ideas we\u2019ve got. Whatever we do. They know they\u2019re way behind in terms of bridging the gap of whatever injustice was there, so they let us do whatever we need to do to make this right. Do you know what I really respect? They\u2019ve been unapologetic with the use of the word \u201cblack\u201d when talking about the problem. They haven\u2019t shied away from it. They haven\u2019t used terms like \u201cunderprivileged\u201d. They know it\u2019s a black problem. Full praise to them. There was resistance to \u201ca pop star\u201d setting up a bursary, but not from Cambridge. A lot of people said that the scholarship I\u2019d set up, which is for black students, is racist. \u201cIt can\u2019t be just for blacks, you\u2019re racist!\u201d I remember that on the day it was first announced I ended up feeling a bit sad. I thought I was doing a really good thing, and we put it out in the world and then the arrows came from everywhere. I spent the whole day replying to people in their DMs, because there were people who genuinely did not understand. You had the idiots who were just angry. And then you had people who were saying, \u201cHey Stormz, really love your music, really love everything you stand for, but how come this is just for black students?\u201d So there was an education that had to happen. A lot of the argument was that there are underprivileged people from all backgrounds. There are underprivileged white people, Asian people\u2026 Yeah, of course! So there is this umbrella of underprivileged that everyone falls under, but beneath that we have being black as well. Being black, you\u2019re under-underprivileged. A lot of people don\u2019t understand racism because they don\u2019t even know it\u2019s happening. They don\u2019t know what being black means. The lack of opportunities. They\u2019re not privy to it. So I took my time and I explained. * * * Q: Zadie Smith \u2018Top five?\u2019 Rappers, right? Jay-Z. Kendrick Lamar. Kanye West. Wretch 32... Who\u2019s my fifth? Do I give it to Drake? I think it would be Drake. Jay-Z first, and everyone else can battle it out for the other four spots. Q: David Beckham \u2018You are such an inspiring artist for so many people, what are your hopes for the next generation of young grime artists in the UK?\u2019 This is going to sound clich\u00e9d, but my hope for them, honestly, is that they go further than we\u2019ve done. That\u2019s all the elders should want for the next generation. I watched Wiley do that. I have a lot of love and respect for Wiley, because he wanted me to fly. \u201cFly, Stormzy. Take this genre further than we could ever take it.\u201d That\u2019s all we can do. We have to say to the next generation, \u201cWhatever we\u2019ve done, go and trump it.\u201d One day, when I\u2019m 50 or 60, I hope to be in my kitchen, looking at some kid on the telly, some little black boy or girl, thinking, \u201cRah!\u201d Thinking, \u201cI had that at Glasto at 26, but this kid\u2019s 17, and he or she\u2019s three albums deep!\u201d Watching them and thinking, \u201cWoah, we could never have done that. We didn\u2019t have the capacity. And here this kid is. Go and fly. Take it where we didn\u2019t. Make it bigger and better.\u201d I want to watch a kid and think, \u201cFuck it, he\u2019s better than us.\u201d * * * Q: Usain Bolt \u2018We love music in Jamaica, especially reggae and dancehall. Which artists would you like to collaborate with in the future?\u2019 Whaaaaa. Usain! I am the top boy! I am the gaffa! It\u2019s gotta be Vybz innit, and Koffee. Koffee is hard. And there\u2019s a wicked new artist called Stalk Ashley, who I love. She\u2019s from Jamaica. She\u2019s brilliant. Q: Dame Judi Dench \u2018Having set up the wonderful Stormzy Scholarship at Cambridge, what would you have chosen to read had you had this glorious opportunity?\u2019 I might actually go to uni. Something to do with literature. English. I always used to say political science. Could never tell you what the fuck that was, but I always said it because it sounded brilliant. But now: English. Something to do with books. Something that can have me lost in words. Poetry. Creative writing. None of that stiff literature. In the past couple of years I\u2019ve started reading poetry again. Yrsa Daley-Ward, she\u2019s the one, she really got me back into poetry. Rap\u2019s an art form. When I\u2019m writing music I see it as poetry, and I never forget I\u2019m a poet myself. But that pen-to-pencil poetry, the meanings in it, the sentiment\u2026 I just think: \u201cWow, this is the shit that I love!\u201d * * * Q: Iggy Pop \u2018How does the session go down for a track like Shut Up? And what do you eat, drink, sniff or smoke on a session?\u2019 Iggy Pop. He\u2019s a mad hatter! Shut Up wasn\u2019t even a studio session. That was a freestyle in the park. The instrumental I used on that is a legendary grime one. And that was me just writing, taking it back to when I was 13 years old, writing over grime beats. And then I just went to the park with my friends. That was it. I was just doing what I wanted to be doing, and it turned out I\u2019d done something special. I knew it was good. I knew it was sick. But I didn\u2019t think it was going to turn into something iconic, I didn\u2019t know it was going to become what it became. When we\u2019re in the studio, there\u2019s no girls, there\u2019s no alcohol. There might be a little bit of weed sometimes. But if you come to one of my sessions, you\u2019d have a great time. You could get your laptop out and do some work. It\u2019s pure. It\u2019s all about family. We sit down, we talk a bit of shit, we tell jokes. People pop up. And then we just work. And as soon as my brain\u2019s gone dry I pack it up and go home. That might be 7pm, or 4pm, or 4am. Sometimes we\u2019ll be up until 7am. I\u2019m in service to the art. When my brain stops, I call it a day. And then I\u2019m back in the next day. It\u2019s a rapper thing to do nights in the studio. But that\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m old, man. I need to walk my dog. Drinking in the studio? That\u2019s raving every night. Fuck that! My body can\u2019t take that shit. So I treat it like my beautiful job. * * * Q: Emily Eavis \u2018Dear Stormz, I know you\u2019re very close to your mum and she\u2019s your biggest fan, but you were also naughty as a kid. When was the last time your mum gave you a proper telling off and what for?\u2019 Hmmm. I was naughty, yeah, but nowadays I\u2019m her golden boy. Me and my mum are best mates. I couldn\u2019t even get told off by her if I tried. She proper rates me \u2013 whatever I do now I always get a pass from her. As soon as the music started kicking off, around 2014, she knew I\u2019d be fine. When was the last time she told me off? I remember once, a couple of years ago, we were at an awards show together and people kept taking my picture. They weren\u2019t fans; they were award show types. As soon as I\u2019d had my picture taken 10 or 15 times I started saying no. I just wanted to enjoy the show. And my mum said, \u201cNah, Junior, come on.\u201d She always wants me to embrace that kind of thing. The kid at her church who wants a picture, the auntie who wants something signed. She\u2019s always like, \u201cNah, Junior, you have to do this.\u201d And she told me off. But she was probably right.",

This time the roles were reversed.

Corbyn secured a \u201cglorious defeat\u201d in the summer of 2017, when a surge in Labour support saw the party advance in defiance of expectations of disaster.</p> <p>The defeat this time was not glorious. Labour fell everywhere, but the party collapsed in its northern and Midlands heartlands where voters have returned Labour MPs for generations. The \u201cred wall\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/labours-red-wall-demolished-by-tory-onslaught\" title=\"\">collapsed</a>, and Corbyn\u2019s party was left to pick through the rubble of its worst defeat in more than 80 years.</p> <p>Last Thursday I worked at BBC HQ with the team headed by Professor John Curtice to produce the poll released at 10pm on the BBC and ITV that predicted the new political shape of Britain. The security was watertight \u2013 our phones were taken from us, and we had to be escorted to and from the toilets.</p> <p>The early declaration of Blyth Valley made clear why the exit poll was projecting the largest Conservative majority for more than 30 years. The Tories took this north-east mining seat for the first time since 1935 on a dramatic 10-point swing. Further shock defeats soon followed in Workington, Darlington and most dramatically in Leigh, the rock-solid north-west seat formerly held by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:05:28/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:05:28/embed.html\">Graph</a> </figure>  <p>This set the pattern for the night: a general slump in Labour support, with huge swings to the Conservatives in older, white, working-class urban seats with many voters who left school with little in the way of educational qualifications. Brexit was a key driver of these shifts. The higher the Leave share, the greater the Tory gain, rising from a modest two-point swing in seats with a Leave vote below 45% to a whopping eight-point swing in seats where 60% or more voted Leave in 2016.</p> <p>Abstract voting statistics cannot capture the crushing emotional blow of this defeat. Seat after seat that had backed Labour in every vote since at least 1945 abandoned the party, many electing Conservative MPs for the first time ever. Rother Valley, Labour since 1918: gone. West Bromwich East, Tom Watson\u2019s former fortress: gone. Stoke-on-Trent Central and Stoke-on-Trent North, both Labour since 1935: gone. In the former mining seat of Bolsover, the former miner Dennis Skinner was ejected after 49 years serving a seat that has returned Labour MPs for nearly twice as long. Then, at 3.30am, minutes after Corbyn delivered a defiant address from his Islington count, the returning officer in Sedgefield announced the first Tory victory in 88 years in Tony Blair\u2019s old seat.</p> <p>This was total repudiation. Labour returned its smallest cohort of MPs since 1935, and the prospect of power looks more remote than at any time since the early 1980s. Yet even in 1983, the party was suffering just its second successive defeat, and even this could be blamed on a divided vote following the SDP split. In 2019, Labour faced a fourth, crushing defeat in a row to a Tory party that has governed for nearly a decade, yet grown its vote each time it faced the electorate.</p> <p>Labour was not the only party bitterly disappointed by last week\u2019s results. The Liberal Democrats entered the campaign with high hopes of mobilising opposition to Brexit to secure an electoral breakthrough, returning the party to relevance after four post-coalition years in the wilderness. Party leader Jo Swinson even sought to present herself as a prime minister in waiting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/devastated-jo-swinson-apologises-lib-dems-election-failure\" title=\"\">It was not to be</a>. The party that had sought a Remain realignment finished with fewer seats than before, as just three gains in strongly Remain areas were more than offset by four losses of seats won in 2017, including Swinson\u2019s as she was defeated by the SNP in East Dunbartonshire. The party can at least take some consolation from the substantial increase in its vote share in the most middle-class and Remain areas of London and south England, which leave it well placed to benefit at future elections if the Conservatives\u2019 growing alignment with nationalist and Eurosceptic voters alienates its traditional support base in suburbia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:04:45/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:04:45/embed.html\">Graph</a> </figure>  <p>The Brexit party also proved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/nigel-farages-project-falls-flat-as-brexit-party-set-to-win-zero-seats\" title=\"\">an electoral flop</a>, its thunder stolen by a prime minister who talked of little else but \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. Nigel Farage\u2019s new outfit secured just 2% of the overall vote, though this low figure in part reflects the party\u2019s decision to stand candidates down in Conservative-held seats. The Brexit party secured an average of more than 5% in the seats where it did stand, and the main effect of its strongest performances was most likely to prevent even more Tory breakthroughs, helping to save Labour incumbents including Ed Miliband, Yvette Cooper and John Healey by splitting the Leave vote.</p> <p>This was also a night of crushing disappointment for the many defectors and independents who sought to put principle before party. The Liberal Democrats fielded new recruits from both Labour (including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger) and the Conservatives (including Sarah Wollaston and Sam Gymiah). All were defeated. Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, expelled from the Conservatives for rebellions over Brexit, achieved large swings as independents but could not break traditional voter alignments in their safe Tory seats. The various former Labour and Conservative MPs who broke away at the start of the year to form Change UK, and mostly now stood as independents, fared even worse, while Chris Williamson lost his deposit standing as an independent after being expelled from the Labour party.. Local roots matter more than national arguments, with the strongest independent performances on the night both coming from homegrown independent candidates in Ashfield and Devon East.</p> <p>The two governing parties in Northern Ireland also had a very bad night, as Remain-supporting opposition parties surged in the region set to be hardest hit by Brexit. The DUP lost two seats, with its Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, defeated by Sinn F\u00e9in in North Belfast. The SDLP took a seat each from Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP on huge swings, while the cross-community Alliance party took North Down and ran the DUP very close in East Belfast. These results could herald major changes in the balance of power if, as expected, another election is called in the province next year to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland assembly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:26:17/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:26:17/embed.html\">graph</a> </figure>  <p>The Conservatives were not the only governing party to advance. The SNP, which has ruled at Holyrood since 2007, secured its second Westminster landslide in four years. The SNP slumped in 2017, when its campaign for a second independence referendum turned unionist and Leave voters against it. Two years later, the imminence of a hard Brexit under Johnson has renewed the appeal of independence, and the SNP has 48 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats.</p> <p>The Scottish Conservatives gave up more than half of the seats gained in 2017, but the biggest loser was Scottish Labour, once again reduced to a single seat on its lowest ever share of the vote. The SNP\u2019s triumph makes a new constitutional clash highly likely in the coming parliament, as a party determined to secure a mandate for independence faces a prime minister firmly opposed to a second Scottish referendum on the issue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:49:27/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:49:27/embed.html\">graph</a> </figure>  <p>The return of a large and loyal majority will transform the Brexit legislative process. The narrow votes and high drama of the past two years will be at an end. Johnson can go to Brussels safe in the knowledge that any deal he negotiates will pass smoothly through the Commons. Brexit will get done.</p> <p>The harder task comes after that. Johnson\u2019s party may be united (at last) over Brexit, but the places it represents are now drawn from opposite sides of a deeply divided nation. The newly elected Conservative MPs represent some of the poorest parts of the country, joining party veterans who represent some of the wealthiest seats. The government will face a new pressure to spend and invest from the party\u2019s new MPs, who will want to show that \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d delivers some tangible results for constituents in their marginal seats. But big spending runs very much against the ideological grain for the Conservative party, and the challenges such seats face after decades of stagnation and neglect cannot realistically be addressed in a single term of government. Voters who discover that Brexit brings little positive change to their lives may soon turn against a party they have long disliked and still distrust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:56:16/embed.html\" data-alt=\"graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/dec/2019-12-14T14:56:16/embed.html\">graph</a> </figure>  <p>The Conservatives\u2019 future troubles are as nothing compared with the existential crisis facing Labour. The electorate has rejected Corbyn and Corbynism, but loyalists to the radical cause control the commanding heights of the party. Its future direction now lies in the hands of the huge membership Corbyn attracted, who will soon be asked to choose his successor. Will they see this electoral mauling as a signal to change course, or will they regard it as an aberration driven by Brexit fever?</p> <p>Further strife seems inevitable whatever answer the party\u2019s members deliver. The dramas of a gridlocked Commons may be over, for now. But those hoping for a return to boring politics in the new year may be disappointed.</p> <p><em>Dr Rob Ford is a professor of politics at Manchester University</em></p>",

Yet even in 1983, the party was suffering just its second successive defeat, and even this could be blamed on a divided vote following the SDP split. In 2019, Labour faced a fourth, crushing defeat in a row to a Tory party that has governed for nearly a decade, yet grown its vote each time it faced the electorate. Labour was not the only party bitterly disappointed by last week\u2019s results. The Liberal Democrats entered the campaign with high hopes of mobilising opposition to Brexit to secure an electoral breakthrough, returning the party to relevance after four post-coalition years in the wilderness. Party leader Jo Swinson even sought to present herself as a prime minister in waiting. It was not to be. The party that had sought a Remain realignment finished with fewer seats than before, as just three gains in strongly Remain areas were more than offset by four losses of seats won in 2017, including Swinson\u2019s as she was defeated by the SNP in East Dunbartonshire. The party can at least take some consolation from the substantial increase in its vote share in the most middle-class and Remain areas of London and south England, which leave it well placed to benefit at future elections if the Conservatives\u2019 growing alignment with nationalist and Eurosceptic voters alienates its traditional support base in suburbia. The Brexit party also proved an electoral flop, its thunder stolen by a prime minister who talked of little else but \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. Nigel Farage\u2019s new outfit secured just 2% of the overall vote, though this low figure in part reflects the party\u2019s decision to stand candidates down in Conservative-held seats. The Brexit party secured an average of more than 5% in the seats where it did stand, and the main effect of its strongest performances was most likely to prevent even more Tory breakthroughs, helping to save Labour incumbents including Ed Miliband, Yvette Cooper and John Healey by splitting the Leave vote. This was also a night of crushing disappointment for the many defectors and independents who sought to put principle before party. The Liberal Democrats fielded new recruits from both Labour (including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger) and the Conservatives (including Sarah Wollaston and Sam Gymiah). All were defeated. Dominic Grieve and David Gauke, expelled from the Conservatives for rebellions over Brexit, achieved large swings as independents but could not break traditional voter alignments in their safe Tory seats. The various former Labour and Conservative MPs who broke away at the start of the year to form Change UK, and mostly now stood as independents, fared even worse, while Chris Williamson lost his deposit standing as an independent after being expelled from the Labour party.. Local roots matter more than national arguments, with the strongest independent performances on the night both coming from homegrown independent candidates in Ashfield and Devon East. The two governing parties in Northern Ireland also had a very bad night, as Remain-supporting opposition parties surged in the region set to be hardest hit by Brexit. The DUP lost two seats, with its Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, defeated by Sinn F\u00e9in in North Belfast. The SDLP took a seat each from Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP on huge swings, while the cross-community Alliance party took North Down and ran the DUP very close in East Belfast. These results could herald major changes in the balance of power if, as expected, another election is called in the province next year to break the deadlock in the Northern Ireland assembly. The Conservatives were not the only governing party to advance. The SNP, which has ruled at Holyrood since 2007, secured its second Westminster landslide in four years. The SNP slumped in 2017, when its campaign for a second independence referendum turned unionist and Leave voters against it. Two years later, the imminence of a hard Brexit under Johnson has renewed the appeal of independence, and the SNP has 48 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats. The Scottish Conservatives gave up more than half of the seats gained in 2017, but the biggest loser was Scottish Labour, once again reduced to a single seat on its lowest ever share of the vote. The SNP\u2019s triumph makes a new constitutional clash highly likely in the coming parliament, as a party determined to secure a mandate for independence faces a prime minister firmly opposed to a second Scottish referendum on the issue. The return of a large and loyal majority will transform the Brexit legislative process. The narrow votes and high drama of the past two years will be at an end. Johnson can go to Brussels safe in the knowledge that any deal he negotiates will pass smoothly through the Commons. Brexit will get done. The harder task comes after that. Johnson\u2019s party may be united (at last) over Brexit, but the places it represents are now drawn from opposite sides of a deeply divided nation. The newly elected Conservative MPs represent some of the poorest parts of the country, joining party veterans who represent some of the wealthiest seats. The government will face a new pressure to spend and invest from the party\u2019s new MPs, who will want to show that \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d delivers some tangible results for constituents in their marginal seats. But big spending runs very much against the ideological grain for the Conservative party, and the challenges such seats face after decades of stagnation and neglect cannot realistically be addressed in a single term of government. Voters who discover that Brexit brings little positive change to their lives may soon turn against a party they have long disliked and still distrust. The Conservatives\u2019 future troubles are as nothing compared with the existential crisis facing Labour. The electorate has rejected Corbyn and Corbynism, but loyalists to the radical cause control the commanding heights of the party. Its future direction now lies in the hands of the huge membership Corbyn attracted, who will soon be asked to choose his successor. Will they see this electoral mauling as a signal to change course, or will they regard it as an aberration driven by Brexit fever? Further strife seems inevitable whatever answer the party\u2019s members deliver. The dramas of a gridlocked Commons may be over, for now. But those hoping for a return to boring politics in the new year may be disappointed. Dr Rob Ford is a professor of politics at Manchester University",

      "body": "<p>At the beginning of September, Chinese president Xi Jinping incensed Donald Trump by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/01/us-and-china-begin-imposing-new-tariffs-as-trade-war-escalates\" title=\"\">imposing a flurry of new import duties on US goods</a>, including semiconductor chips and mobile phones.</p> <p>It was a retaliation too far for the US president, especially when the stock market reaction was to send shares in America\u2019s second most valuable company at the time, Apple, tumbling by almost 5%. For many observers it was just another skirmish in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/03/trump-says-china-us-trade-deal-could-wait-until-after-2020-election\" title=\"\">the tit-for-tat trade war</a> that had rumbled on for 20 months. But in Washington it came as a shock, and was the driving force behind Trump\u2019s premature announcement the following month of an interim deal \u2013 one that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/12/us-china-trade-deal-in-principle-tariffs\" title=\"\">after much wrangling</a> finally came to fruition, or at least appeared to, last week.</p> <p>Trump said his administration would cancel a new round of 15% tariffs on Chinese goods including toys, phones and clothing that was set to take effect this weekend. In tweets, he added that the White House would halve duties already in place on $120bn (\u00a390bn) of Chinese imports to 7.5%, while leaving 25% tariffs on $250bn of goods imposed earlier this year.</p> <p>Trump probably expected US stock markets to soar as investors thanked him for calming the rhetoric on trade and appearing to move towards a more comprehensive deal next year. That simply didn\u2019t happen, and for two very good reasons. The first lay in the response of vice-minister of finance Liao Min, whose main, underwhelming, concession was that he would buy $50bn of US agricultural produce and consider cancelling retaliatory tariffs also set for this weekend.</p> <p>Then there was what Trump\u2019s hardline anti-China constituency, which is large and cuts across Republican and Democrat party lines, see as the real prize. This involves extracting commitments from Xi to open up China\u2019s financial services sector, crack down on intellectual property theft and block demands from Chinese companies for technology transfers as the price of new contracts. There was not much evidence of this.</p> <p>Robert Lighthizer, Trump\u2019s chief trade negotiator, said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump has focused on concluding a phase one agreement that achieves meaningful, fully enforceable structural changes and begins rebalancing the US-China trade relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Except that sentence was pretty much all that was said about a crucial aspect of the talks. Some Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio, have criticised Trump for potentially winding down import tariffs before the Chinese had agreed to any meaningful structural changes. Without a commensurate sweep of tariff cuts from the Chinese and a lack of commitment from Beijing to tackle domestic governance abuses, the markets were left to ask the obvious question: are we any further forward?</p> <p>The answer must be yes, but it could be that it\u2019s actually the Chinese who can claim to be further forward, and the reason goes back to the US economy and the New York stock market. Beijing knows that Trump faces an election next year, and that to win he must lay claim to a buoyant economy and, to his mind, a soaring stock market.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s problem is that the tariff war has hurt US businesses by raising their costs, and materially harmed US farmers, who have found themselves shut out of Chinese agricultural markets.</p> <p>These developments have played a big part in the halving of US economic growth over the past year. It has also severely dented China\u2019s growth rate \u2013 though by how much it is hard to tell, thanks to the smokescreen of state-published financial data.</p> <p>Beijing, though, doesn\u2019t need to worry about elections and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/07/china-hopes-end-us-trade-war-both-agree-ease-tariffs-imf\" title=\"\">is playing a careful game</a>. However, the world must hope Xi offers some real concessions and that the battle of the past two years calms further.</p> <p>The US/China trade war has proved to be the biggest drag on global growth. It has limited the income growth of billions of people, and that is something most countries can ill afford.</p> <h2>The vote was kind to the water industry. So Ofwat must be tough</h2> <p>The threat of nationalisation disappeared with the Labour party\u2019s election defeat, but here comes a more familiar foe for the English water companies: regulator Ofwat, which on Monday will unveil its pricing regime for the next five years.</p> <p>\u201cFoe\u201d hasn\u2019t always been an apt description of Ofwat over the years. The regulator stands accused of twiddling its thumbs while the water industry loaded up with debt, paid billions to shareholders in dividends and failed to prevent pollution and leaks.</p> <p>That lenient regulatory stance is about to change, or so we\u2019re told. The early drafts of the new regime demanded that household bills be cut by an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/18/regulator-orders-water-bills-in-england-and-wales-to-be-cut-by-50-pounds-ofwat\" title=\"\">average of \u00a350</a> in real terms over five years and that targets on leaks, pollution and flooding become more demanding. Ofwat says it wants a \u201cstep-up\u201d in efficiency.</p> <p>We wait to see if this bolder rhetoric and the tougher draft proposals will be carried into the final determination. The indications suggest it will. Ofwat officials themselves, in a semi-acknowledgment that life was too easy in the past, have described this review as \u201cnot business as usual\u201d and called for an end to \u201cfinancial game playing\u201d.</p> <p>For a few companies \u2013 those at the top of performance league table \u2013 none of this will sound threatening. The interesting part is how the laggards will react if a demand for higher standards implies substantially lower financial returns for owners. Some have muttered about Ofwat having become \u201cpoliticised\u201d but Monday is the day when they\u2019ll either have to accept Ofwat\u2019s rulings or appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority.</p> <p>It\u2019s their choice, but a series of CMA investigations might be a very good thing if Ofwat were to prevail. It could finally close an era in which it was too easy for investors to get rich on the back of bill-payers. In that analysis, Labour was essentially correct.</p> <h2>US regulators face a long haul to regain trust after Boeing crashes</h2> <p>Risk is always a numbers game. A one in a million chance of disaster might sound reasonable; until the calculation that, for example, with 5,000 planes taking off twice a day, only a few months will elapse until one crashes.Risk is always a numbers game. Given the aviation industry\u2019s mantra that safety is its top priority, it was startling to hear that US regulators had worked through some chilling calculations with the Boeing 737 Max in the wake of its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/29/lion-air-plane-lost-contact-indonesia-flight-jt610-jakarta\" title=\"\">first fatal crash</a> in October 2018. Their analysis found that, without intervention, the plane would suffer a fatal crash every two or three years \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/11/boeing-737-max-plane-faa-regulators-crash-risk\" title=\"\">but they let it continue flying nonetheless</a>.</p> <p>Given that one such plane had crashed in Indonesia just a month earlier, killing 189 people, perhaps the Federal Aviation Administration thought time was on its side.</p> <p>The FAA\u2019s inaction was followed in March this year by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/10/ethiopian-flight-302-second-new-boeing-737-max-8-to-crash-in-four-months\" title=\"\">Ethiopian Airlines disaster</a>, which killed 157 people.

      "bodyText": "At the beginning of September, Chinese president Xi Jinping incensed Donald Trump by imposing a flurry of new import duties on US goods, including semiconductor chips and mobile phones. It was a retaliation too far for the US president, especially when the stock market reaction was to send shares in America\u2019s second most valuable company at the time, Apple, tumbling by almost 5%. For many observers it was just another skirmish in the tit-for-tat trade war that had rumbled on for 20 months. But in Washington it came as a shock, and was the driving force behind Trump\u2019s premature announcement the following month of an interim deal \u2013 one that after much wrangling finally came to fruition, or at least appeared to, last week. Trump said his administration would cancel a new round of 15% tariffs on Chinese goods including toys, phones and clothing that was set to take effect this weekend. In tweets, he added that the White House would halve duties already in place on $120bn (\u00a390bn) of Chinese imports to 7.5%, while leaving 25% tariffs on $250bn of goods imposed earlier this year. Trump probably expected US stock markets to soar as investors thanked him for calming the rhetoric on trade and appearing to move towards a more comprehensive deal next year. That simply didn\u2019t happen, and for two very good reasons. The first lay in the response of vice-minister of finance Liao Min, whose main, underwhelming, concession was that he would buy $50bn of US agricultural produce and consider cancelling retaliatory tariffs also set for this weekend. Then there was what Trump\u2019s hardline anti-China constituency, which is large and cuts across Republican and Democrat party lines, see as the real prize. This involves extracting commitments from Xi to open up China\u2019s financial services sector, crack down on intellectual property theft and block demands from Chinese companies for technology transfers as the price of new contracts. There was not much evidence of this. Robert Lighthizer, Trump\u2019s chief trade negotiator, said in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump has focused on concluding a phase one agreement that achieves meaningful, fully enforceable structural changes and begins rebalancing the US-China trade relationship.\u201d Except that sentence was pretty much all that was said about a crucial aspect of the talks. Some Republicans, including Senator Marco Rubio, have criticised Trump for potentially winding down import tariffs before the Chinese had agreed to any meaningful structural changes. Without a commensurate sweep of tariff cuts from the Chinese and a lack of commitment from Beijing to tackle domestic governance abuses, the markets were left to ask the obvious question: are we any further forward? The answer must be yes, but it could be that it\u2019s actually the Chinese who can claim to be further forward, and the reason goes back to the US economy and the New York stock market. Beijing knows that Trump faces an election next year, and that to win he must lay claim to a buoyant economy and, to his mind, a soaring stock market. Trump\u2019s problem is that the tariff war has hurt US businesses by raising their costs, and materially harmed US farmers, who have found themselves shut out of Chinese agricultural markets. These developments have played a big part in the halving of US economic growth over the past year. It has also severely dented China\u2019s growth rate \u2013 though by how much it is hard to tell, thanks to the smokescreen of state-published financial data. Beijing, though, doesn\u2019t need to worry about elections and is playing a careful game. However, the world must hope Xi offers some real concessions and that the battle of the past two years calms further. The US/China trade war has proved to be the biggest drag on global growth. It has limited the income growth of billions of people, and that is something most countries can ill afford. The vote was kind to the water industry. So Ofwat must be tough The threat of nationalisation disappeared with the Labour party\u2019s election defeat, but here comes a more familiar foe for the English water companies: regulator Ofwat, which on Monday will unveil its pricing regime for the next five years. \u201cFoe\u201d hasn\u2019t always been an apt description of Ofwat over the years. The regulator stands accused of twiddling its thumbs while the water industry loaded up with debt, paid billions to shareholders in dividends and failed to prevent pollution and leaks. That lenient regulatory stance is about to change, or so we\u2019re told. The early drafts of the new regime demanded that household bills be cut by an average of \u00a350 in real terms over five years and that targets on leaks, pollution and flooding become more demanding. Ofwat says it wants a \u201cstep-up\u201d in efficiency. We wait to see if this bolder rhetoric and the tougher draft proposals will be carried into the final determination. The indications suggest it will. Ofwat officials themselves, in a semi-acknowledgment that life was too easy in the past, have described this review as \u201cnot business as usual\u201d and called for an end to \u201cfinancial game playing\u201d. For a few companies \u2013 those at the top of performance league table \u2013 none of this will sound threatening. The interesting part is how the laggards will react if a demand for higher standards implies substantially lower financial returns for owners. Some have muttered about Ofwat having become \u201cpoliticised\u201d but Monday is the day when they\u2019ll either have to accept Ofwat\u2019s rulings or appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority. It\u2019s their choice, but a series of CMA investigations might be a very good thing if Ofwat were to prevail. It could finally close an era in which it was too easy for investors to get rich on the back of bill-payers. In that analysis, Labour was essentially correct. US regulators face a long haul to regain trust after Boeing crashes Risk is always a numbers game. A one in a million chance of disaster might sound reasonable; until the calculation that, for example, with 5,000 planes taking off twice a day, only a few months will elapse until one crashes.Risk is always a numbers game. Given the aviation industry\u2019s mantra that safety is its top priority, it was startling to hear that US regulators had worked through some chilling calculations with the Boeing 737 Max in the wake of its first fatal crash in October 2018. Their analysis found that, without intervention, the plane would suffer a fatal crash every two or three years \u2013 but they let it continue flying nonetheless. Given that one such plane had crashed in Indonesia just a month earlier, killing 189 people, perhaps the Federal Aviation Administration thought time was on its side. The FAA\u2019s inaction was followed in March this year by the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, which killed 157 people. Revelations in last week\u2019s House committee hearings in Washington have further eroded trust in the regulator\u2019s determination to do its primary job of cutting risk, rather than looking to preserve Boeing\u2019s licence to fly its new, bestselling plane. The head of the FAA, Stephen Dickson, is pledging reform, as critics damn its relations with the manufacturing giant as classic regulatory capture. The way Boeing was allowed to \u201cself-certify\u201d some safety requirements, and the FAA\u2019s reluctance to join the world in grounding the Max after the Ethiopian crash, will not quickly be forgotten. Boeing has stepped up its efforts to convince the world that its reprogrammed 737 Max is safe, but it will be for regulators to decide. However eager airlines are to see the cheaper model return to the skies, this process should not be rushed. If Canadian, European or Chinese regulators disagree with the FAA\u2019s assessment, there should be no question of bringing back the Max into local service. Safety cannot be partial or geographic. The reciprocal faith regulators have hitherto shown in each other\u2019s judgment \u2013 and the trust that engenders in the global flying public \u2013 will in the long term prove far more valuable than the tens of billions invested in the Max.",

The star architect of the gothic revival, John Loughborough Pearson, was sent for, and no expense was spared. His design was French gothic, externally slender and elegant. Its stone steeple rising above red brick soars over the roofs of Maida Vale and the towers of Kilburn, calm and dignified. But it desperately needs a clean. It has that aloof and unwelcoming aura that so often descends on a neglected church.</p> <p>The inside is extraordinary. It is in the form of a giant hall, 10 bays long, with double aisles on all sides. These carry wide galleries divided by brick buttresses, allowing a perambulation of the entire church at upper floor level, lit by stained-glass windows in the clerestory. The intersecting planes seem to enfold one another, giving St Augustine\u2019s a remarkable atmosphere of light and shade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3913631b460cf1a0f97d33f7b53edc9449ab542\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3913631b460cf1a0f97d33f7b53edc9449ab542/0_160_1426_1426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Loughborough Pearson, star gothic architect.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Loughborough Pearson, star gothic architect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pearson\u2019s Francophilia was intense and Kilburn was partially inspired by the mighty cathedral at Albi in the Languedoc.

      "bodyText": "They are London\u2019s lost cathedrals. A few people still worship in them, a few more know of them, but few visit them. Whenever I have dropped by, they have been locked and seem deserted. Yet inside, these are masterpiece monuments of London\u2019s age of confidence and flair, that of high Victorian gothic. They must be revived. Few 19th-century churches are a match for the soaring edifice of St Augustine\u2019s, Kilburn, once dubbed the \u201ccathedral of north London\u201d. The area was settled by thousands of immigrant Irish workers, and the church was founded in 1870 as a missionary venture by Anglicans eager to keep at bay what promised to be a mass Catholic incursion. A dynamic vicar, RC Kilpatrick, sought help from like-minded \u2013 and wealthy \u2013 souls at All Saints Margaret Street in Marylebone. The church was duly high church Anglo-Catholic, as it is to this day. The new St Augustine\u2019s was to be as splendid as any new church in London. The star architect of the gothic revival, John Loughborough Pearson, was sent for, and no expense was spared. His design was French gothic, externally slender and elegant. Its stone steeple rising above red brick soars over the roofs of Maida Vale and the towers of Kilburn, calm and dignified. But it desperately needs a clean. It has that aloof and unwelcoming aura that so often descends on a neglected church. The inside is extraordinary. It is in the form of a giant hall, 10 bays long, with double aisles on all sides. These carry wide galleries divided by brick buttresses, allowing a perambulation of the entire church at upper floor level, lit by stained-glass windows in the clerestory. The intersecting planes seem to enfold one another, giving St Augustine\u2019s a remarkable atmosphere of light and shade. Pearson\u2019s Francophilia was intense and Kilburn was partially inspired by the mighty cathedral at Albi in the Languedoc. The interior was supposed to be painted throughout, though this extended only to the lower walls and side chapels. The contrast is all the greater with the unadorned brick roof vaults, seemingly gaunt and distant, like those of Catholic Westminster Cathedral. The centre of the church is dominated by Pearson\u2019s enclosed sanctuary. Its surrounding gothic arcades are topped by a frieze crowded with biblical and saintly statues, richly decorative. The altarpiece has a touch of art nouveau to it, as does the pulpit and the ironwork of the gates and railings. A final touch is given by the Chapel of St Michael to the right of the chancel. This is a miniature cathedral in itself. Painted and restored throughout, its ribs and arches are picked out in reds, greens and golds. The altarpiece is a jewelled forest of golden finials. It must be one the loveliest chambers in London. Set among bleak towers off the Edgware Road, this great building really should be open. Whether as concert hall, coffee bar, drop-in centre, cr\u00e8che, library, youth club or even farmers\u2019 market, something should bring it to life and people this glorious space. The same goes for St Augustine\u2019s two sisters. The first, St Mary Magdalene\u2019s, Paddington, lurks beside the Grand Union canal, over which it should exercise patronal authority. Its door has been firmly locked whenever I have tried a visit, though it has been revived as an art venue under the auspices of the admirable Grand Junction social centre next door.

It\u2019s the first book that I wrote truly from my heart and I think that\u2019s made the difference. When I started, though, I thought it would never get published, because it\u2019s so strange \u2013 in terms of the dialect and the setting. And I still think it\u2019s quite a Marmite book.

I haven\u2019t looked at them for quite a while, they may well all be terrible.

But I did go down a lot of mines, and I read a lot of books about that period of mining. And then it sort of wrote itself. Newt was such a strong character in my head.</p> <p><strong>Much of the narrative is written phonetically. Did you take inspiration from other books</strong><strong>? I was reminded a little of </strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview27\" title=\"\">Riddley Walker</a></strong></em><strong> by Russell Hoban.</strong><br>A couple of US publishers mentioned <em>Riddley Walker</em> and I\u2019m ashamed to say I hadn\u2019t heard of it.

It\u2019s an adult novel, though whenever I say that, it sounds very rude, like I\u2019ve written a Mills &amp; Boon. But it\u2019s more historical fiction with a twist, set in Victorian London. <em>Bearmouth</em> is set in a very male-dominated world, whereas this is very much a book about women\u2019s place in society, as well as science and art, religion and morality. It\u2019s much more of an epic tale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/22/young-adult-teenage-fiction-roundup-frances-hardinge-deeplight-liz-hyder-holly-bourne\">Young adult books roundup \u2013 reviews</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What\u2019s your average working day?</strong><br>The first thing I do in the morning, when I\u2019m compos mentis and have drunk a tank of coffee, is reread the last 10,000 words or so and edit them. Then I\u2019ll go for a walk and think about what I\u2019m going to do next. When I come back I\u2019ll just type it up \u2013 I\u2019ve already written it in my head. I try and write 3,000 words a day, in the afternoon. It\u2019s quite hardcore. Everyone writes in very different ways. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/philip-ardagh\" title=\"\">Philip Ardagh</a>, the fantastic children\u2019s author, said on Twitter a while ago that writers can\u2019t tell you how to write, all they can tell you is how they write.

I felt like I was swallowed up: you are there in that world, it\u2019s utterly immersive. I loved it and I can\u2019t wait to read what she does next.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>It\u2019s a massive pile. I just started reading <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/08/sweet-sorrow-david-nicholls-review\" title=\"\">Sweet Sorrow</a></em> by David Nicholls. I\u2019ve got <em>The Song of the Lark</em> by Willa Cather and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/dec/06/season-s-readings-the-box-of-delights\" title=\"\">The Box of Delights</a></em> by John Masefield, which I was flicking through the other day because I needed some comforting. I\u2019ve got <em>Victorian Lady Travellers</em> by Dorothy Middleton and <em>The Fantastical Adventures of the Invisible Boy</em> by Lloyd Alexander. I\u2019ve got <em>Greenvoe</em> by George Mackay Brown, the most extraordinary writer from Orkney, and <em>Small Island</em> by Andrea Levy, and Katherine Rundell\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/05/why-you-should-read-childrens-books-even-though-you-are-old-wise-katherine-rundell-review\" title=\"\">Why You Should Read Children\u2019s Books</a></em>\u2026 which is just delicious. Then Henry Mayhew\u2019s <em>London\u2019s </em><em>Underworld</em> and <em>The Deathless Girls</em> by Kiran Millwood Hargrave, an origin story of Dracula\u2019s brides, which is delicious as well. I told you it was a tower.</p> <p><strong>Were there certain books or authors that made an impression on you as a kid?</strong><br>I loved <em>The Animals of Farthing Wood</em> by Colin Dann. Roald Dahl, obviously, and CS Lewis. Maybe I should confess this \u2013 I never got the religious stuff in Narnia at all until I was much older.

But it\u2019s more historical fiction with a twist, set in Victorian London. Bearmouth is set in a very male-dominated world, whereas this is very much a book about women\u2019s place in society, as well as science and art, religion and morality. It\u2019s much more of an epic tale. What\u2019s your average working day? The first thing I do in the morning, when I\u2019m compos mentis and have drunk a tank of coffee, is reread the last 10,000 words or so and edit them. Then I\u2019ll go for a walk and think about what I\u2019m going to do next. When I come back I\u2019ll just type it up \u2013 I\u2019ve already written it in my head. I try and write 3,000 words a day, in the afternoon. It\u2019s quite hardcore. Everyone writes in very different ways. Philip Ardagh, the fantastic children\u2019s author, said on Twitter a while ago that writers can\u2019t tell you how to write, all they can tell you is how they write. That\u2019s so true. What\u2019s the last great book you read? I finished reading Everything Under by Daisy Johnson the other day and I was totally blown away by it. I felt like I was swallowed up: you are there in that world, it\u2019s utterly immersive. I loved it and I can\u2019t wait to read what she does next. What books are on your bedside table? It\u2019s a massive pile. I just started reading Sweet Sorrow by David Nicholls. I\u2019ve got The Song of the Lark by Willa Cather and The Box of Delights by John Masefield, which I was flicking through the other day because I needed some comforting. I\u2019ve got Victorian Lady Travellers by Dorothy Middleton and The Fantastical Adventures of the Invisible Boy by Lloyd Alexander. I\u2019ve got Greenvoe by George Mackay Brown, the most extraordinary writer from Orkney, and Small Island by Andrea Levy, and Katherine Rundell\u2019s Why You Should Read Children\u2019s Books\u2026 which is just delicious. Then Henry Mayhew\u2019s London\u2019s Underworld and The Deathless Girls by Kiran Millwood Hargrave, an origin story of Dracula\u2019s brides, which is delicious as well. I told you it was a tower. Were there certain books or authors that made an impression on you as a kid? I loved The Animals of Farthing Wood by Colin Dann. Roald Dahl, obviously, and CS Lewis. Maybe I should confess this \u2013 I never got the religious stuff in Narnia at all until I was much older. My favourite Narnia book is The Magician\u2019s Nephew, like all right-thinking people. The Dark Is Rising by Susan Cooper\u2026 It\u2019s not a very diverse list: I just read whatever was in the library or at home. Is there a book or an author that you return to more than any other? Not really, it changes all the time. I will read anything. There is a word for it, when you\u2019re addicted to words [glossophilia]. When I was a kid I would happily read the back of the cereal packet. \u2022 Bearmouth by Liz Hyder (illustrations by Yeti Lambregts) is published by Pushkin Press (\u00a312.99).

In Citizen Kane, publishing mogul Charles Foster Kane\u2019s idealism is corrupted by an unquenchable thirst for power. In Citizen K, Russian plutocrat Khodorkovsky\u2019s career trajectory veers in the opposite direction. One of seven oligarchs whose role in the state privatisations of the 1990s helped transform the country\u2019s communism into \u201cgangster capitalism\u201d, as Gibney\u2019s voiceover puts it, Khodorkovsky was complicit in Putin\u2019s rise. Now living in London in exile (he is wanted for murder), he is one of the president\u2019s fiercest and most vocal critics.

      "body": "<p><strong>An early riser?</strong> Not really, I\u2019ll sleep until midday no matter what I\u2019ve been doing. I like to lie in - I\u2019ve got no reason to be up early and my weeks get so busy. I\u2019ll give my place a quick tidy and then take a shower. I like the house to be clean before I am.</p> <p><strong>A day out? Or a trip?</strong> No thanks, I\u2019m away from home 300 days a year: in Europe, America, Australia, South America and New Zealand. On Sundays in London, I want to be inside and cosy, reading a book or just doing laundry. I definitely want to be somewhere heated.</p> <p><strong>Soundtrack to Sunday?</strong> Old school Sunday best tunes: Miles Davis, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, James Brown\u2026 Something I can have on in the background and sing along to, real feelgood music. I\u2019ve got guitars, basses, an upright piano and a keyboard, I might pick one up - but I don\u2019t feel a pressure.</p> <p><strong>The perfect meal?</strong> I go to Mum\u2019s for dinner, there\u2019s always food in the fridge, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if she\u2019s there or not. I make a big plate of rice, chicken, vegetables and salad and hang out with my sister on the sofa. When we were kids Mum would be at mosque. Our thing has always been winding each other up and being lazy on the sofa.</p> <p><strong>Do you drink?</strong> Sometimes, but nothing hectic, just the one Corona. I\u2019m definitely not getting burst on a Sunday, I\u2019m being good.</p> <p><strong>If you could be anywhere next Sunday?</strong> Watching my five-year-old nephew play football. He\u2019s in the Arsenal academy. He makes everything lighter, nothing is too deep or serious. It\u2019s cool having a relationship with a little human who sees the world so differently. Otherwise just indoors, please.</p> <p><strong>An evening routine? </strong>I clean the house, again, and write down lists, goals and targets for the week ahead. It could be something creative, or just finally sorting that dentist appointment. My mind goes at a million miles an hour. If it\u2019s not written down I forget to do it. <strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p><em>Grey Area is out now</em></p>",

I\u2019ll give my place a quick tidy and then take a shower. I like the house to be clean before I am. A day out? Or a trip? No thanks, I\u2019m away from home 300 days a year: in Europe, America, Australia, South America and New Zealand. On Sundays in London, I want to be inside and cosy, reading a book or just doing laundry. I definitely want to be somewhere heated. Soundtrack to Sunday? Old school Sunday best tunes: Miles Davis, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, James Brown\u2026 Something I can have on in the background and sing along to, real feelgood music. I\u2019ve got guitars, basses, an upright piano and a keyboard, I might pick one up - but I don\u2019t feel a pressure. The perfect meal? I go to Mum\u2019s for dinner, there\u2019s always food in the fridge, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if she\u2019s there or not. I make a big plate of rice, chicken, vegetables and salad and hang out with my sister on the sofa. When we were kids Mum would be at mosque. Our thing has always been winding each other up and being lazy on the sofa. Do you drink? Sometimes, but nothing hectic, just the one Corona. I\u2019m definitely not getting burst on a Sunday, I\u2019m being good. If you could be anywhere next Sunday? Watching my five-year-old nephew play football. He\u2019s in the Arsenal academy. He makes everything lighter, nothing is too deep or serious. It\u2019s cool having a relationship with a little human who sees the world so differently. Otherwise just indoors, please. An evening routine? I clean the house, again, and write down lists, goals and targets for the week ahead. It could be something creative, or just finally sorting that dentist appointment. My mind goes at a million miles an hour. If it\u2019s not written down I forget to do it. Grey Area is out now",

      "body": "<p>This is the most decisive election result for over a decade. Boris Johnson asked the country for a mandate to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and last Thursday voters delivered him an overwhelming majority. The result settles once and for all the vexed question of when and whether we will leave the European Union: Britain\u2019s formal exit will happen at the end of next month. But the conclusiveness of the result should not obscure the massive uncertainty that hangs over our future: over what type of Brexit we choose once we have left, a decision that will have huge implications for our economic wellbeing and the integrity of the union.</p> <p>This is the largest Conservative majority the country has seen since 1987, delivered on the biggest share of the vote won by any party since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979. For Labour, this defeat is its fourth in a row, producing the smallest cohort of MPs the party has seen since 1935. Britain\u2019s electoral map has been upended as the Conservatives have swept to victory with a raft of seats in the north and the Midlands that were not so long ago seen as impregnable Labour strongholds.</p> <p>This new political reality leaves challenges for Britain\u2019s political leaders. A newly triumphantJohnson leads a party stunned by the scale of its victory, a party that will have to confront the challenge of delivering Brexit without inflicting enormous damage on its fragile new electoral coalition. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\" title=\"\">Nicola Sturgeon</a> has been returned with a fresh mandate to champion Scottish independence but no obvious route to securing an independence referendum. Labour and the Liberal Democrats face months of agonising introspection and internal conflict as they embark on the process of choosing new leaders adequate to the task of rebuilding their shattered parties, and finding ways to reconnect with the voters who abandoned them.</p> <h2>Only the start of the EU conversation<br></h2> <p>From his podium outside Downing Street last Friday, Johnson struck a tone of unity and inclusion, in sharp contrast to the tenor of his divisive election campaign. He pledged to lead a \u201cone nation\u201d Conservative government that will bring together the nations of the United Kingdom, and reflect the sentiments of both those who voted to Leave and to Remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum.</p> <p>It is hard to overstate how dramatic a shift from the Tory approach to governing witnessed over the past nine years this would require. It would demand an entirely different strategy for achieving a new relationship with the EU from the one Johnson has pursued to date; an undoing of the painful austerity of the past decade that has most sharply hit low-income families and less affluent areas; and an unravelling of the toxic legacy of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment.</p> <p>Leaving the EU on 31 January 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement will not see \u201cBrexit done\u201d in any but the most superficial sense. Our exit will be only the start of the conversation about what our final relationship with the EU will look like. Do we want a closely aligned relationship, which would minimise the economic damage and protect the Good Friday agreement? Or do we want to diverge sharply from European regulations and standards in order to align more closely with the low-regulation economy of the United States and end free movement, the price of which would be sharpening economic inequalities, a grave risk to the union and a watering-down of worker and consumer protections?</p> <h2>New Tory voters, new Tory MPs<br></h2> <p>Like May before him, Johnson has always prioritised his own political interest over that of the country. The absence of a Conservative majority since 2017 has given undue influence to the hard Eurosceptic flank of the party, and both May and Johnson have been willing to dance to its tune as the price of its support. Johnson has been willing to pursue the hardest of Brexits, which would risk the integrity of the union and impose huge economic pain, as the price of power.</p> <p>His resounding election victory must shift this calculus. Not only does it reduce the influence of his party\u2019s most fanatical Eurosceptics; it has brought in a fresh wave of MPs who represent areas of the country whose economies would be wrecked by a hard Brexit. This provides him with the political imperative to tack towards a soft Brexit that minimises its economic impact, protects the union and recognises that over half of voters did not give his version of Brexit their seal of approval last week.</p> <p>The same imperative operates when it comes to reversing the past decade of spending cuts. Johnson\u2019s manifesto offered far too little on this, including nothing about the slashing of tax credits that has left many working parents thousands of pounds a year worse off. By 2023, more than half of families with children will have been shifted on to universal credit \u2013 which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/14/universal-credit-hardship-tories\" title=\"\">far less generous</a> than the system it replaces \u2013 and many of these will be new Conservative voters, living in constituencies with new Conservative MPs. Johnson ignores this at his peril.</p> <p>But while his majority could push him towards a softened approach, his election campaign risks an altogether different political legacy.

      "bodyText": "This is the most decisive election result for over a decade. Boris Johnson asked the country for a mandate to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, and last Thursday voters delivered him an overwhelming majority. The result settles once and for all the vexed question of when and whether we will leave the European Union: Britain\u2019s formal exit will happen at the end of next month. But the conclusiveness of the result should not obscure the massive uncertainty that hangs over our future: over what type of Brexit we choose once we have left, a decision that will have huge implications for our economic wellbeing and the integrity of the union. This is the largest Conservative majority the country has seen since 1987, delivered on the biggest share of the vote won by any party since Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first victory in 1979. For Labour, this defeat is its fourth in a row, producing the smallest cohort of MPs the party has seen since 1935. Britain\u2019s electoral map has been upended as the Conservatives have swept to victory with a raft of seats in the north and the Midlands that were not so long ago seen as impregnable Labour strongholds. This new political reality leaves challenges for Britain\u2019s political leaders. A newly triumphantJohnson leads a party stunned by the scale of its victory, a party that will have to confront the challenge of delivering Brexit without inflicting enormous damage on its fragile new electoral coalition. Nicola Sturgeon has been returned with a fresh mandate to champion Scottish independence but no obvious route to securing an independence referendum. Labour and the Liberal Democrats face months of agonising introspection and internal conflict as they embark on the process of choosing new leaders adequate to the task of rebuilding their shattered parties, and finding ways to reconnect with the voters who abandoned them. Only the start of the EU conversation From his podium outside Downing Street last Friday, Johnson struck a tone of unity and inclusion, in sharp contrast to the tenor of his divisive election campaign. He pledged to lead a \u201cone nation\u201d Conservative government that will bring together the nations of the United Kingdom, and reflect the sentiments of both those who voted to Leave and to Remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. It is hard to overstate how dramatic a shift from the Tory approach to governing witnessed over the past nine years this would require. It would demand an entirely different strategy for achieving a new relationship with the EU from the one Johnson has pursued to date; an undoing of the painful austerity of the past decade that has most sharply hit low-income families and less affluent areas; and an unravelling of the toxic legacy of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment. Leaving the EU on 31 January 2020 under the terms of the withdrawal agreement will not see \u201cBrexit done\u201d in any but the most superficial sense. Our exit will be only the start of the conversation about what our final relationship with the EU will look like. Do we want a closely aligned relationship, which would minimise the economic damage and protect the Good Friday agreement? Or do we want to diverge sharply from European regulations and standards in order to align more closely with the low-regulation economy of the United States and end free movement, the price of which would be sharpening economic inequalities, a grave risk to the union and a watering-down of worker and consumer protections? New Tory voters, new Tory MPs Like May before him, Johnson has always prioritised his own political interest over that of the country. The absence of a Conservative majority since 2017 has given undue influence to the hard Eurosceptic flank of the party, and both May and Johnson have been willing to dance to its tune as the price of its support. Johnson has been willing to pursue the hardest of Brexits, which would risk the integrity of the union and impose huge economic pain, as the price of power. His resounding election victory must shift this calculus. Not only does it reduce the influence of his party\u2019s most fanatical Eurosceptics; it has brought in a fresh wave of MPs who represent areas of the country whose economies would be wrecked by a hard Brexit. This provides him with the political imperative to tack towards a soft Brexit that minimises its economic impact, protects the union and recognises that over half of voters did not give his version of Brexit their seal of approval last week. The same imperative operates when it comes to reversing the past decade of spending cuts. Johnson\u2019s manifesto offered far too little on this, including nothing about the slashing of tax credits that has left many working parents thousands of pounds a year worse off. By 2023, more than half of families with children will have been shifted on to universal credit \u2013 which is far less generous than the system it replaces \u2013 and many of these will be new Conservative voters, living in constituencies with new Conservative MPs. Johnson ignores this at his peril. But while his majority could push him towards a softened approach, his election campaign risks an altogether different political legacy. Johnson will no doubt extract a dangerous lesson from his win: that putting out untrue claims about your opponents, blaming them for events that happen on your watch, and avoiding scrutiny at all costs is an effective political strategy. At least he can no longer rely on the toxic, populist narrative of \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d. He controls the Commons.

      "body": "<p>Your article on the inhumane working conditions encountered by some of Britain\u2019s numerous delivery drivers was shocking (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/08/christmas-parcel-delivery-drivers-driven-to-the-edge\" title=\"\">Driven to the edge: the hidden cost of our Christmas parcels</a>\u201d, Special report).</p> <p>Expecting a person to use their work vehicle as a toilet or a place to eat (if they are lucky enough to have time to eat) is nothing short of modern-day slavery, not to mention unhygienic. Every working person, no matter what career choice they make, is entitled to basic employment rights. Multinational corporations, under the watchful eye of recent Conservative governments, have developed these cold-hearted working conditions that maximise profits and allow them to pay the minimum amount of corporation tax. One of the glaring realities of Brexit will be the continued undermining of unions like the GMB and the disregard for employment tribunal decisions that seek to protect workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>As consumers, we are driving the online shopping trend, which is predicted to account for over 50% of the retail market within 10 years. Our politicians are not shy in condemning other countries that have little regard for worker rights, but conveniently look the other way when it\u2019s happening in their own back yard. The next time a delivery driver knocks on your door, take a moment to think about their working conditions and don\u2019t give out abuse to them if they are an hour or two late.<br><strong>Stuart Carruthers</strong><br>Lewes, East Sussex<br></p> <p>Your report covers all the major problems encountered by the gig economy. Politicians, trade unions and church organisations have cited the evidence and argued the case for greater regulation of this sector demonstrated by Ken Loach\u2019s recent film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/03/sorry-we-missed-you-review-ken-loach\" title=\"\"><em>Sorry We Missed You</em></a>. However, despite a few court cases and tribunal victories, little actually changes. Perhaps this is because underpinning the willingness of so many to partake in these jobs is the still greater fear of unemployment and our punitive benefits system, where the phrase \u201chostile environment\u201d is an accepted factor without mention.</p> <p>High unemployment has always helped maintain a more compliant workforce. Now, with supposed full employment, we have an accepted harsh regime and ever diminishing level of unemployment benefits, which means workers in such industries are terrified of handing in their notice or of being dismissed. It is the level of benefits and punitive regime that needs to be addressed.<br><strong>Trevor Hopper</strong><br>Lewes, East Sussex<br></p> <h2>Pernicious pornography<br></h2> <p>What on earth is Eva Wiseman proposing or suggesting (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/08/rough-sex-and-rough-justice-we-need-a-greater-understanding-of-consent\" title=\"\">Consent and pleasure need to be addressed far more creatively</a>\u201d, Magazine)? Violence towards women is pornography\u2019s home. There is so much fiction and fact about the violence against women and girls perpetrated by their husbands, partners and random men who beset them. Pornography is the vehicle that enables this violence against your sisters, Eva. Didn\u2019t you know?<br><strong>Jacqueline Darby</strong><br>Twickenham, London<br></p> <h2>Perils of social media<br></h2> <p>Barbara Ellen is possibly guilty of rationalising the plight of millennials and their antisocial attitudes (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/07/millennials-manners-defence-mechanism-against-hostile-world\" title=\"\">Millennials\u2019 manners are a defence mechanism against a hostile world</a>\u201d, Comment). Rather than consciously seeking solace in the online world, it seems more likely that these young people have been deprived of the ability to empathise by their upbringing. With parents reduced to working all the hours God sends simply to keep their heads above water, children have perforce had recourse to screens as a kind of electronic nursemaid.</p> <p>The result, as Ellen points out, is that millennials are becoming \u201cdangerously detached\u201d from the general social consensus and more concerned about trifling matters of social media etiquette. In a world in which people are being voluntarily microchipped in order to better facilitate their interaction with computers, this should be a cause for huge concern. Meanwhile, France\u2019s blanket ban on social media in schools is one that this country could usefully emulate.<br><strong>Steve Williams</strong><br>Peacehaven, East Sussex<br></p> <h2>Gardens of delight? Not here<br></h2> <p>If Rowan Moore thinks Trafalgar Square is bad, he should come to Edinburgh city centre (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/08/britain-great-urban-spaces-are-made-for-celebrations-lets-keep-them-special\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s great urban areas are made for celebrations.

Here, the spectacular <a href=\"https://www.introducingedinburgh.com/princes-street-gardens\" title=\"\">Princes Street Gardens</a>, between the medieval old town and the Georgian new town, are being increasingly prostituted to trashy privatised tourism \u201cattractions\u201d, winter and summer. Scores of junk food joints, booze outlets and expensive sub-Blackpool fairground rides take over the gardens for months each year. And a consortium is leaning on Edinburgh council to build a large, permanent events venue that will be permitted to close the gardens to residents and visitors for long periods.</p> <p>The council, which is responsible for the world heritage site, allows this pollution for minimal fees from the operators, who can\u2019t believe their luck.

Your article about Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the rebel general who defeated French forces and founded the state of Haiti in 1804, reminded me of the vivid account of the liberation of the island in Heinrich von Kleist\u2019s novella of 1811, <em>The</em> <em>Betrothal in Santo Domingo</em>. Kleist was once imprisoned in the Ch\u00e2teau de Joux, the same French fortress as Dessalines\u2019s predecessor, Toussaint Louverture, who had already died a captive there in 1803.<br><strong>Nicholas Jacobs</strong><br>London NW5<br></p> <h2>So much for plucky Brits<br></h2> <p>Whilst applauding the French people for their robust stand on Macron\u2019s pension reform (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/08/france-pensions-reform-emmanuel-macron\" title=\"\">Macron is not just after reform, but permanent change</a>\u201d, World), I cannot help but wonder about our own women who were born in the 1950s.

As he also mentions, the Separatists originally came from the East Midlands. That is where it all started and where the focus should be.</p> <p>They came specifically from a small area in north Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, centred on Retford.

Every working person, no matter what career choice they make, is entitled to basic employment rights. Multinational corporations, under the watchful eye of recent Conservative governments, have developed these cold-hearted working conditions that maximise profits and allow them to pay the minimum amount of corporation tax. One of the glaring realities of Brexit will be the continued undermining of unions like the GMB and the disregard for employment tribunal decisions that seek to protect workers\u2019 rights. As consumers, we are driving the online shopping trend, which is predicted to account for over 50% of the retail market within 10 years. Our politicians are not shy in condemning other countries that have little regard for worker rights, but conveniently look the other way when it\u2019s happening in their own back yard. The next time a delivery driver knocks on your door, take a moment to think about their working conditions and don\u2019t give out abuse to them if they are an hour or two late. Stuart Carruthers Lewes, East Sussex Your report covers all the major problems encountered by the gig economy. Politicians, trade unions and church organisations have cited the evidence and argued the case for greater regulation of this sector demonstrated by Ken Loach\u2019s recent film, Sorry We Missed You. However, despite a few court cases and tribunal victories, little actually changes. Perhaps this is because underpinning the willingness of so many to partake in these jobs is the still greater fear of unemployment and our punitive benefits system, where the phrase \u201chostile environment\u201d is an accepted factor without mention. High unemployment has always helped maintain a more compliant workforce. Now, with supposed full employment, we have an accepted harsh regime and ever diminishing level of unemployment benefits, which means workers in such industries are terrified of handing in their notice or of being dismissed. It is the level of benefits and punitive regime that needs to be addressed. Trevor Hopper Lewes, East Sussex Pernicious pornography What on earth is Eva Wiseman proposing or suggesting (\u201cConsent and pleasure need to be addressed far more creatively\u201d, Magazine)? Violence towards women is pornography\u2019s home. There is so much fiction and fact about the violence against women and girls perpetrated by their husbands, partners and random men who beset them. Pornography is the vehicle that enables this violence against your sisters, Eva. Didn\u2019t you know? Jacqueline Darby Twickenham, London Perils of social media Barbara Ellen is possibly guilty of rationalising the plight of millennials and their antisocial attitudes (\u201cMillennials\u2019 manners are a defence mechanism against a hostile world\u201d, Comment). Rather than consciously seeking solace in the online world, it seems more likely that these young people have been deprived of the ability to empathise by their upbringing. With parents reduced to working all the hours God sends simply to keep their heads above water, children have perforce had recourse to screens as a kind of electronic nursemaid. The result, as Ellen points out, is that millennials are becoming \u201cdangerously detached\u201d from the general social consensus and more concerned about trifling matters of social media etiquette. In a world in which people are being voluntarily microchipped in order to better facilitate their interaction with computers, this should be a cause for huge concern. Meanwhile, France\u2019s blanket ban on social media in schools is one that this country could usefully emulate. Steve Williams Peacehaven, East Sussex Gardens of delight? Not here If Rowan Moore thinks Trafalgar Square is bad, he should come to Edinburgh city centre (\u201cBritain\u2019s great urban areas are made for celebrations. Let\u2019s keep them special\u201d, Comment). Here, the spectacular Princes Street Gardens, between the medieval old town and the Georgian new town, are being increasingly prostituted to trashy privatised tourism \u201cattractions\u201d, winter and summer. Scores of junk food joints, booze outlets and expensive sub-Blackpool fairground rides take over the gardens for months each year. And a consortium is leaning on Edinburgh council to build a large, permanent events venue that will be permitted to close the gardens to residents and visitors for long periods. The council, which is responsible for the world heritage site, allows this pollution for minimal fees from the operators, who can\u2019t believe their luck. One of the most beautiful cities in the world, with probably the world\u2019s worst municipal administration. But if you\u2019re touting tat, one of the most \u201caffordable\u201d. John Jones Edinburgh Heroes of Haiti It is not often that one comes across the name Dessalines in a Sunday newspaper (\u201cSick of corruption, Haiti looks back to its revolutionary hero for hope\u201d, Dispatch). Your article about Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the rebel general who defeated French forces and founded the state of Haiti in 1804, reminded me of the vivid account of the liberation of the island in Heinrich von Kleist\u2019s novella of 1811, The Betrothal in Santo Domingo. Kleist was once imprisoned in the Ch\u00e2teau de Joux, the same French fortress as Dessalines\u2019s predecessor, Toussaint Louverture, who had already died a captive there in 1803. Nicholas Jacobs London NW5 So much for plucky Brits Whilst applauding the French people for their robust stand on Macron\u2019s pension reform (\u201cMacron is not just after reform, but permanent change\u201d, World), I cannot help but wonder about our own women who were born in the 1950s. They, too, have had their pensions reviewed by their government and, undoubtedly, will be much worse off as a result. Where is their vigorous response? Are they content to lie down and be kicked in the teeth? Alas, I thought that we Brits were made of sterner stuff. Mike Woodall Kingswinford, West Midlands They came from Scrooby, too Mick Catmull writes that, despite the fact that Plymouth is the focus for the 400th anniversary celebrations of the Mayflower\u2019s journey to America, none of the Pilgrims came from there (Letters). As he also mentions, the Separatists originally came from the East Midlands. That is where it all started and where the focus should be. They came specifically from a small area in north Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, centred on Retford. The most important were William Brewster, from Scrooby, and William Bradford, from Austerfield, who wrote the definitive work Of Plimoth Plantation and was governor of the Plimoth colony for 30 years.

All week they continued to push for Hunter to appear as a witness, even though there is no evidence of wrongdoing on his part. On Thursday, Matt Gaetz of Florida presented an amendment to the impeachment articles that would replace a reference to investigations into Joe Biden with \u201cthe true topic of the investigation, Burisma and Hunter Biden\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Fox News did not exist, the Republican embrace of wild conspiracy theories would not be tenable or possible</p> <footer> <cite>Kurt Bardella</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another Republican defence hinges on political tribalism. Full of righteous indignation, they claim Democrats had been plotting to impeach Trump all along and so the inquiry is a \u201csham\u201d. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, said Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t get over the fact Donald Trump is president of the United States and they don\u2019t have a candidate that they think can beat him\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018It is incredible\u2019</h2> <p>The impeachment inquiry is not the only glimpse into Trump and his allies\u2019 parallel universe. This week saw the release of a justice department inspector general report that debunked the conspiracy theory that the investigation into Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and its ties to Russia originated with political bias. The report quoted the FBI deputy general counsel as saying: \u201cThe FBI would have been derelict in our responsibility had we not opened the case.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s long-held contention that the Russia investigation was a hoax and witch-hunt was demolished before his eyes. Yet his first response from the White House came from a parallel universe in which up is down and two plus two equals five.</p> <p>\u201cThe IG report just came out, and I was just briefed on it, and it\u2019s a disgrace what\u2019s happened with respect to the things that were done to our country,\u201d he told reporters.</p> <p>\u201cIt should never again happen to another president. It is incredible. Far worse than I would have ever thought possible. And it\u2019s an embarrassment to our country. It\u2019s dishonest. It\u2019s everything that a lot of people thought it would be, except far worse.\u201d</p> <p>Trump turned to Pam Bondi, a special adviser on impeachment and former Florida attorney general <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2016/sep/21/donald-trump-pam-bondi-and-25k-was-it-pay-play/\">to whom he once donated</a>. Like Cruz, she did not disappoint.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, so many of us who are career law enforcement today are outraged,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the American people really should be terrified that this could happen to you when we\u2019re supposed to live in a society of integrity and honesty.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, Trump just makes stuff up. At a campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, he made the baseless allegation that the former FBI agent Peter Strzok needed a restraining order against ex-colleague Lisa Page when their affair ended. The couple\u2019s anti-Trump text messages are a favourite Republican talking point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f4560339f170beea07e72d90a185ae84ce2a4c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f4560339f170beea07e72d90a185ae84ce2a4c9/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of the audience holds up a sticker as Donald Trump speaks in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of the audience holds up a sticker as Donald Trump speaks in Hershey, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis poor guy, did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing, to keep him away from Lisa?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, the fake news will never report it, but it could be true.\u201d</p> <p>Page tweeted: \u201cThis is a lie. Nothing like this ever happened. I wish we had a president who knew how to act like one. SAD!\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The attorney general is a Fox News bot\u2019</h2> <p>The president has found another useful enabler in Bill Barr, the attorney general, who joined him in dismissing most of the inspector general\u2019s findings and promising that his handpicked prosecutor, John Durham, will have the final word.</p> <p>Jeffrey Toobin, a lawyer and legal analyst, told CNN: \u201cThe attorney general of the United States is a Fox News bot. And it\u2019s an outrage. [Barr] keeps demanding investigation after investigation until he gets the results that he wants? That\u2019s something that happens in the Soviet Union, not in the United States.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has far more tools at his disposal than Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton did when facing impeachment in the 1970s and 90s. No matter how outlandish, his assertions are amplified and seldom questioned by loyal hosts on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News network.</p> <p>Bardella said: \u201cIf Fox News did not exist, the Republican embrace of wild conspiracy theories would not be tenable or possible.

At a campaign rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, he made the baseless allegation that the former FBI agent Peter Strzok needed a restraining order against ex-colleague Lisa Page when their affair ended. The couple\u2019s anti-Trump text messages are a favourite Republican talking point. \u201cThis poor guy, did I hear he needed a restraining order after this whole thing, to keep him away from Lisa?\u201d Trump asked the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, the fake news will never report it, but it could be true.\u201d Page tweeted: \u201cThis is a lie. Nothing like this ever happened. I wish we had a president who knew how to act like one. SAD!\u201d \u2018The attorney general is a Fox News bot\u2019 The president has found another useful enabler in Bill Barr, the attorney general, who joined him in dismissing most of the inspector general\u2019s findings and promising that his handpicked prosecutor, John Durham, will have the final word. Jeffrey Toobin, a lawyer and legal analyst, told CNN: \u201cThe attorney general of the United States is a Fox News bot. And it\u2019s an outrage. [Barr] keeps demanding investigation after investigation until he gets the results that he wants? That\u2019s something that happens in the Soviet Union, not in the United States.\u201d Trump has far more tools at his disposal than Richard Nixon or Bill Clinton did when facing impeachment in the 1970s and 90s. No matter how outlandish, his assertions are amplified and seldom questioned by loyal hosts on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News network. Bardella said: \u201cIf Fox News did not exist, the Republican embrace of wild conspiracy theories would not be tenable or possible. They are the editorial centre of the Republican party now.\u201d This is further augmented by social media. Under the headline \u201cFact-based impeachment can\u2019t penetrate the pro-Trump Web\u201d, the Washington Post highlighted how Friday\u2019s impeachment hearing was watched by a private Facebook group with more than 75,000 members under the banner \u201cThe Trump deplorables\u201d. It reported: \u201cThe defense mounted by Trump\u2019s allies made perfect sense to those following live on social media, in groups sealed off from general scrutiny, where facts are established by volume, and confirmation comes from likes. The effect of social media is to jack up the tenor of everything.\u201d This calibrated, multi-pronged Republican assault has left the nation in what some call a state of \u201ctruth decay\u201d as all sense of shared reality breaks down. The tactics offer a chilling preview of how the president intends to fight next year\u2019s election. Bardella said: \u201cWe have one chance to return to a certain amount of normality and respect. Much more than Donald Trump is on the ballot, fact and truth and our democratic way of life are on the ballot.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Gyankroma Akufo-Addo: director of the Creative Arts Council, Ghana</h2> <p>There\u2019s a burgeoning arts scene in our capital, on the Atlantic coast in West Africa. Head to Jamestown, the oldest district, and walk through the old port and along the beaches scattered with graffiti, studios and boxing gyms. Every August the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2019/sep/05/statement-earrings-and-blue-lipstick-street-style-from-ghanas-chale-wote-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Chale Wote</a> festival takes over here. This visual arts event started with 500 guests and next year will host 40,000 people. It\u2019s so exciting to see.</p> <p>You can chuck on your glad rags and eat the best sushi in the city at the swanky <a href=\"http://www.yoloxperiences.com/\" title=\"\">Santoku</a>. Or enjoy the local fare of light soups and giant snails at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bush-Canteen/197973783576298\" title=\"\">Bush Canteen </a>in East Legon.</p> <p>Outside of the capital you\u2019re spoilt for choice, but we\u2019re a beach country, so I\u2019ll always head to the Atlantic coast. Down in the Western Region, Busua Beach is my favourite: whether you\u2019re diving, on jet skis or lying on the golden sand, you\u2019d never know it wasn\u2019t the Seychelles. A flight from Accra only takes 45 minutes, but my advice is jump in a car and enjoy the six-hour drive. You\u2019ll see countless luscious coconut groves and monkeys. Stop for a walk and nature will catch your eye; have a conversation with a roadside kenkey (similar to a sourdough dumpling) seller. Ghana is a country where no two trips are the same.</p> <p>Right now is the Year of Return marking 400 years since the first African slaves left the continent. It\u2019s the perfect time for black people across the world to come to Ghana and start their ancestral journey. It\u2019s a celebration of our culture and heritage, but there\u2019s history to soak up, too. A trip to Elmina castle is a must. A few hours drive from Accra, it was the last port of call for slaves being forced to leave the continent.</p> <p>You don\u2019t have to be African to feel at home here, that\u2019s my tip to visitors. We\u2019re a fun-loving people, as long as everyone is shown respect.

There\u2019s always another opening, house party or album listening session to get to. You\u2019ll head out for the day and only return the following morning. Nobody stays still. A night out in Accra means heading to five, six or seven places \u2013 it\u2019s a kaleidoscopic experience.</p> <p>You need to eat. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dimaensa_/?utm_source=ig_profile_share&amp;igshid=zz22e1qrg6sg\" title=\"\">Dimaensa</a> restaurant in Abelenkpe district, serves fufu (cassava dough) the traditional way, while Mosoko has an amazing African buffet \u2013 to try everything you\u2019ll need a few visits.

Check out <a href=\"http://skybar25.com/\" title=\"\">Sky Bar 25</a> if you want to rub shoulders with Accra\u2019s upper echelons. It\u2019s expensive, but pop in for a cocktail and to look out at the best view in the city. Need a late night snack? The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/burgerboyzz/posts/\" title=\"\">BurgerBoyz</a> outside the nightclub <a href=\"http://acetantra.com/\" title=\"\">Ace Tantra</a> will feed you until 5am.</p> <p>I\u2019m biased, because it\u2019s a place I created, but check out the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBnZ-Live-152384671523249/\" title=\"\">BBnZ Live</a> to meet young creatives and entrepreneurs who are carving out Ghana\u2019s future. We started as an ad agency, became a record label and now we\u2019re an incubator for local startups. Ours is a generation tapping into their purpose, more adventurous than the 9 to 5, and part of a growing middle class.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ellelokko.com/\" title=\"\">Elle Lokko</a> store is well worth a stop, too. It\u2019s an eclectic hub for emerging artists to sell their work, a palace of underground culture and fashion.</p> <p>If you want to escape the hustle and bustle, visit the beaches and hotels of Takoradi \u2013 my hometown, also known as Oil City. A bunch of new places to explore have popped up each time I visit. The tranquil islands of Ada, complete with resorts and palm-lined beaches, are only 45 minutes from Accra. Or drive up to Aburi and check into <a href=\"https://hillburi.com/\" title=\"\">Hillburi</a> hotel, which overlooks Accra. It\u2019s tranquil, somewhere to breath a little and prepare for another city adventure.</p> <h2>Dentaa Amoateng: CEO and founder of Guba</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4b3737570e2201db33b6c76b81e1f408c08fe9dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b3737570e2201db33b6c76b81e1f408c08fe9dd/0_204_4236_2543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"After the deluge: Boti Falls is a 30m-high waterfall within the Boti Forest Reserve about 30 minutes east of Koforidua.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After the deluge: Boti Falls is a 30m-high waterfall within the Boti Forest Reserve about 30 minutes east of Koforidua.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having set up Guba, the UK-based Ghana achievement awards, it\u2019s my job to know what\u2019s worth celebrating here. They say Osu is Ghana\u2019s Oxford Street \u2013 home to restaurants, shops, culture, and all sorts of activities. Head here for a real sense of Accra in all its glory. Pop into Christie Brown, the store of one of our most eminent designers, and eat at <a href=\"https://tgcrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">Gold Coast</a> restaurant for traditional food served with flair and, on Friday nights, a live band. Wander up and down the streets and see what you can find in this bustling and vibrant area.</p> <p>Culture lovers are spoilt for choice in Accra. <a href=\"https://afrochella.com/\" title=\"\">Afrochella</a>, an unrivalled annual celebration of African music, art and fashion, this year takes place on 28 December, and there\u2019ll be more than 50 live performances. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/15/the-playlist-african-pop-olamide-aka-youssoupha-sarkodie-jovi-mtv-africa-music-awards\" title=\"\">Sarkodie</a>, one of Ghana\u2019s renowned rappers, holds a huge concert every Christmas which no visitor (or local for that matter) should miss.</p> <p>Dixcove is a hidden gem, a coastal village in the western region of Ghana. Nobody knows it\u2019s the best spot to see dolphins. Few visitors know about the beautiful and refreshing waterfalls of the Volta Region, either. It\u2019s hot most of the year here, except for May and June, which is the rainy season. Relax by the pool and eat a delicious meal at the <a href=\"https://www.theroyalsenchi.com/?utm_source=GooglePlusLocal&amp;utm_medium=Local&amp;utm_campaign=GooglePlusInitiative\" title=\"\">Royal Senchi Resort</a>, a couple of hours north of the capital. Plan a visit to Kumasi, the centre of Ashanti culture, during the Akwasidae festival, a traditional Ghanian spectacle held every sixth Sunday. Breakfast at <a href=\"http://villamonticello.com/\" title=\"\">Villa Monticello</a>, a luxury boutique hotel in the Airport Residential Area, is a treat, but some of the best food you\u2019ll find comes from street sellers. Try white fish stew, chicken fillets, fried yams and plantains with a side of corn \u2013 and then just watch as the city moves around you. You may have heard of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/22/world-jollof-day-jamies-oliver-rice-scandals\" title=\"\">\u201cjollof war\u201d</a> between Ghana and Nigeria.

Accra is intense, it\u2019s our little New York City. Know what to expect before you\u2019re here \u2013 prepare yourself for the noise, the heat and the people \u2013 so you won\u2019t have to waste time once you arrive. Listen to the <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/sincerely-accra\" title=\"\">Sincerely Accra</a> podcast hosted by Joseph Nti. It\u2019s full of interviews and vox pops with local residents discussing the biggest topics of the day.</p> <p>I\u2019m all about the galleries and exhibitions. My favourite is Omanye House owned by Professor Ablade Glover, a leading light in Africa\u2019s art scene. It\u2019s the perfect place to see work from all over: Ghana, Mali, Togo and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Plus, there\u2019s a bar out the back that looks out onto the ocean.</p> <p>I\u2019m not much of a party person, but I\u2019ve heard good things about the salsa nights on Wednesdays at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Afrikikooo/\" title=\"\">Afrikiko</a>. Every Friday night there\u2019s an open air party called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/serallio/\" title=\"\">Serallio</a> with music and drinking until the morning and I know it gets pretty wild. You\u2019ll probably find me at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AccraNightLifeNumber1Pub/\" title=\"\">Purple Pub </a>\u2013 it\u2019s relaxed, more open-minded than some other places. It\u2019s open 6pm til late, there\u2019s good food and better drinks, and cute night lights reminiscent of Brooklyn backyard parties.</p> <p>For high end fashion, the <a href=\"http://westhillsmallgh.com/\" title=\"\">West Hills Mall</a> on the outskirts of the city is a treat. Steve French, <a href=\"https://www.belloeduwoman.com/\" title=\"\">Bello Edu</a> and Daniks Peters are the young Ghanaian fashion designers to keep an eye on. I\u2019m a designer, too, and in 2018 I launched my own label. Head to Makola Market if you want to see how the city buys and sells. From clothing to wax prints, food and souvenirs, it\u2019s always alive and full of colour.</p> <p>Kwahu in eastern Ghana is the place to go for a more relaxed stay. This area is mountainous and hosts a paragliding festival over Easter. I\u2019d recommend a visit at any time of year if you want more trees, less pollution, and to see giant mansions. We call it the Beverly Hills of Ghana for a reason.</p> <h2>Eyetsa Ocloo: founder of The Shop</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9bffc208dbb0009641c73c8186eb55d825265486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bffc208dbb0009641c73c8186eb55d825265486/0_94_6031_3620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grand designs: independece arch leads on to Independence Square in Accra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grand designs: independece arch leads on to Independence Square in Accra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Asselin/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here at The Shop, a space in Accra that showcases and sells the work of 400 Ghanian artists and creatives, we\u2019re open 12 hours a day, and there\u2019s a caf\u00e9 as well as performances. Next year, it will have been running for five years.</p> <p>To see the rest of Accra, hire a bike and head to Independence Square and check out the castle. Keep an eye out for open gutters \u2013 even the ones which look closed aren\u2019t always as they seem. The <a href=\"https://legonbotanicalgardens.com/\" title=\"\">Botanical Garden</a> in Legon north of Accra is our only major park and a must see on a visit here.</p> <p>For food, I love <a href=\"https://www.kukun.co/\" title=\"\">Kukun</a> caf\u00e9 \u2013 when I\u2019m craving English food it\u2019s the best spot for a fry-up. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Zion-Thai-Restaurant-163171610427199/\" title=\"\">Zion Thai</a> does great Asian dishes and, for a treat, make a reservation at <a href=\"http://www.suncity-apartments.com/restaurant\" title=\"\">Sun</a><a href=\"http://www.suncity-apartments.com/restaurant\" title=\"\">city</a> for amazing fish and a view over the Atlantic.</p> <p>Accra is becoming more urban, and smaller in the sense that we\u2019re well connected. People used to call Abidjan the Paris of Africa, but now I think Accra has taken that title. Our <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.gov.gh/\" title=\"\">National Theatre</a> has seasonal productions so check their calendar of events, and the same goes for the university. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/233jazzbarandgrill/\" title=\"\">+</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/233jazzbarandgrill/\" title=\"\">233 Jazz Bar</a> is my favourite music venue and has shows every evening. I\u2019d recommend heading down on a Thursday \u2013 the same all-woman band has been playing that night for years now.</p> <p>At times the heat can feel overwhelming, especially for visitors. <a href=\"http://lavillaghana.com/lavilla/index.php/contact-us.html\" title=\"\">La Villa Boutique Hotel</a> is an oasis in the centre of the city \u2013 dive into the pool to cool down if it feels too much, then enjoy cocktails and delicious Italian food. For a more traditional African experience book yourself onto a nomadic dinner cooked by Fatmata Binta. She\u2019s a chef of Fulani descent \u2013 one of the largest ethnic groups in the Sahel and West Africa.</p> <p>There are plenty of other interesting food, sightseeing and creative experiences on offer in Accra \u2013 check out <a href=\"https://tastemakersafrica.com/\" title=\"\">tastemakers</a><a href=\"https://tastemakersafrica.com/\" title=\"\">africa.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Ours is a generation tapping into their purpose, more adventurous than the 9 to 5, and part of a growing middle class. The Elle Lokko store is well worth a stop, too. It\u2019s an eclectic hub for emerging artists to sell their work, a palace of underground culture and fashion. If you want to escape the hustle and bustle, visit the beaches and hotels of Takoradi \u2013 my hometown, also known as Oil City. A bunch of new places to explore have popped up each time I visit. The tranquil islands of Ada, complete with resorts and palm-lined beaches, are only 45 minutes from Accra. Or drive up to Aburi and check into Hillburi hotel, which overlooks Accra. It\u2019s tranquil, somewhere to breath a little and prepare for another city adventure. Dentaa Amoateng: CEO and founder of Guba Having set up Guba, the UK-based Ghana achievement awards, it\u2019s my job to know what\u2019s worth celebrating here. They say Osu is Ghana\u2019s Oxford Street \u2013 home to restaurants, shops, culture, and all sorts of activities. Head here for a real sense of Accra in all its glory. Pop into Christie Brown, the store of one of our most eminent designers, and eat at Gold Coast restaurant for traditional food served with flair and, on Friday nights, a live band. Wander up and down the streets and see what you can find in this bustling and vibrant area. Culture lovers are spoilt for choice in Accra. Afrochella, an unrivalled annual celebration of African music, art and fashion, this year takes place on 28 December, and there\u2019ll be more than 50 live performances. Sarkodie, one of Ghana\u2019s renowned rappers, holds a huge concert every Christmas which no visitor (or local for that matter) should miss. Dixcove is a hidden gem, a coastal village in the western region of Ghana. Nobody knows it\u2019s the best spot to see dolphins. Few visitors know about the beautiful and refreshing waterfalls of the Volta Region, either. It\u2019s hot most of the year here, except for May and June, which is the rainy season. Relax by the pool and eat a delicious meal at the Royal Senchi Resort, a couple of hours north of the capital. Plan a visit to Kumasi, the centre of Ashanti culture, during the Akwasidae festival, a traditional Ghanian spectacle held every sixth Sunday. Breakfast at Villa Monticello, a luxury boutique hotel in the Airport Residential Area, is a treat, but some of the best food you\u2019ll find comes from street sellers. Try white fish stew, chicken fillets, fried yams and plantains with a side of corn \u2013 and then just watch as the city moves around you. You may have heard of the \u201cjollof war\u201d between Ghana and Nigeria. Make sure you taste our version of the rice dish \u2013 you\u2019ll know right away whose is better. Papa Oppong: designer and illustrator Do your homework before you come. Accra is intense, it\u2019s our little New York City. Know what to expect before you\u2019re here \u2013 prepare yourself for the noise, the heat and the people \u2013 so you won\u2019t have to waste time once you arrive. Listen to the Sincerely Accra podcast hosted by Joseph Nti. It\u2019s full of interviews and vox pops with local residents discussing the biggest topics of the day. I\u2019m all about the galleries and exhibitions. My favourite is Omanye House owned by Professor Ablade Glover, a leading light in Africa\u2019s art scene. It\u2019s the perfect place to see work from all over: Ghana, Mali, Togo and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Plus, there\u2019s a bar out the back that looks out onto the ocean. I\u2019m not much of a party person, but I\u2019ve heard good things about the salsa nights on Wednesdays at Afrikiko. Every Friday night there\u2019s an open air party called Serallio with music and drinking until the morning and I know it gets pretty wild. You\u2019ll probably find me at Purple Pub \u2013 it\u2019s relaxed, more open-minded than some other places. It\u2019s open 6pm til late, there\u2019s good food and better drinks, and cute night lights reminiscent of Brooklyn backyard parties. For high end fashion, the West Hills Mall on the outskirts of the city is a treat. Steve French, Bello Edu and Daniks Peters are the young Ghanaian fashion designers to keep an eye on. I\u2019m a designer, too, and in 2018 I launched my own label. Head to Makola Market if you want to see how the city buys and sells. From clothing to wax prints, food and souvenirs, it\u2019s always alive and full of colour. Kwahu in eastern Ghana is the place to go for a more relaxed stay. This area is mountainous and hosts a paragliding festival over Easter. I\u2019d recommend a visit at any time of year if you want more trees, less pollution, and to see giant mansions. We call it the Beverly Hills of Ghana for a reason. Eyetsa Ocloo: founder of The Shop Here at The Shop, a space in Accra that showcases and sells the work of 400 Ghanian artists and creatives, we\u2019re open 12 hours a day, and there\u2019s a caf\u00e9 as well as performances. Next year, it will have been running for five years. To see the rest of Accra, hire a bike and head to Independence Square and check out the castle. Keep an eye out for open gutters \u2013 even the ones which look closed aren\u2019t always as they seem. The Botanical Garden in Legon north of Accra is our only major park and a must see on a visit here. For food, I love Kukun caf\u00e9 \u2013 when I\u2019m craving English food it\u2019s the best spot for a fry-up. Zion Thai does great Asian dishes and, for a treat, make a reservation at Suncity for amazing fish and a view over the Atlantic. Accra is becoming more urban, and smaller in the sense that we\u2019re well connected. People used to call Abidjan the Paris of Africa, but now I think Accra has taken that title. Our National Theatre has seasonal productions so check their calendar of events, and the same goes for the university. The +233 Jazz Bar is my favourite music venue and has shows every evening. I\u2019d recommend heading down on a Thursday \u2013 the same all-woman band has been playing that night for years now. At times the heat can feel overwhelming, especially for visitors. La Villa Boutique Hotel is an oasis in the centre of the city \u2013 dive into the pool to cool down if it feels too much, then enjoy cocktails and delicious Italian food. For a more traditional African experience book yourself onto a nomadic dinner cooked by Fatmata Binta. She\u2019s a chef of Fulani descent \u2013 one of the largest ethnic groups in the Sahel and West Africa. There are plenty of other interesting food, sightseeing and creative experiences on offer in Accra \u2013 check out tastemakersafrica.com. Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "There aren\u2019t 20 Senate Republicans with enough integrity to remove the most corrupt president in American history, so we\u2019re going to have to get rid of Trump the old-fashioned way \u2013 by electing a Democrat next 3 November. That Democrat will be Warren Sanders. Although there are differences between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, I\u2019m putting them together for the purpose of making a simple point. These two have most of the grassroots energy in the 2020 campaign, most of the enthusiasm and most of the ideas critical for America\u2019s future. Together, they lead Joe Biden and every other so-called moderate Democrat by a wide margin in all polls. That\u2019s because the real political divide in America today is establishment versus anti-establishment \u2013 the comparatively few at the top who have siphoned off much of the wealth of the nation versus everyone else whose wages and prospects have gone nowhere. Warren and Sanders know the system is rigged and that economic and political power must be reallocated from a corporate-Wall Street elite to the vast majority. This is why both Warren and Sanders are hated by the Democratic establishment. It\u2019s also why much of the corporate press is ignoring the enthusiasm they\u2019re generating. And why it\u2019s picking apart their proposals, like a wealth tax and Medicare for All, as if they were specific pieces of legislation. And why corporate and Wall Street Democrats are mounting a campaign to make Americans believe Warren and Sanders are \u201ctoo far to the left\u201d to beat Trump, and therefore \u201cunelectable\u201d. This is total rubbish. Either of them has a better chance of beating Trump than does any other Democratic candidate. Presidential elections are determined by turnout. More than a third of eligible voters in America don\u2019t vote. They go to the polls only if they\u2019re motivated. And what motivates people most is a candidate who stands for average people and against power and privilege. Average Americans know they\u2019re getting the scraps while corporate profits are at record highs and CEOs and Wall Street executives are pocketing unprecedented pay and bonuses. They know big money has been flooding Washington and state capitals to cut taxes on corporations and the wealthy; roll back health, safety, environment and labor protections; and allow big business to monopolize the economy, using its market power to keep prices high and wages low. Most Americans want to elect someone who\u2019s on their side. In 2016 some voted for Trump because he conned them into believing he was that person. But he\u2019s given big corporations and Wall Street everything they\u2019ve wanted: rollbacks of health, safety, and environmental protections, plus a giant $2tn tax cut that\u2019s boosted stock prices and executive pay while nothing trickled down. Trump is still fooling millions into thinking he\u2019s on their side, and that their problems are due to immigrants, minorities, cultural elites and \u201cdeep state\u201d bureaucrats, rather than a system that\u2019s rigged for the benefit of those at the top. But some of these Trump supporters would join with other Americans and vote for a candidate in 2020 who actually took on power and privilege. This is where Warren and Sanders come in. Their core proposals would make the system work for everyone and alter the power structure in America: Medicare for All based on a single-payer rather than private for-profit corporate insurance; a Green New Deal to create millions of good jobs fighting climate change; free public higher education; universal childcare. All financed mainly by a tax on the super-rich. They\u2019d also get big money out of politics and rescue democracy from the corporate and Wall Street elites who now control it. They\u2019re the only candidates relying on small donations rather than trolling for big handouts from corporations, Wall Street and the wealthy \u2013 or rich enough to self-finance their own campaigns. Only two things stand in their way of becoming president. The first is the power structure itself, which is trying to persuade Democrats that they should put up a milquetoast moderate instead. The second is the possibility that as the primary season heats up, supporters of Warren and Sanders will wage war on each other, taking both of them down. It\u2019s true that only one of them can be the nominee. But if the backers of both Sanders and Warren come together behind one of them, they\u2019ll have the votes to take the White House and even flip the Senate. President Warren Sanders can then start clearing the wreckage left by Trump, and make America decent again.",

It works effectively, particularly when Prenger, who is brilliant as Helen, leans against a piano and lights a cigarette, pours herself a drink and sings about lost love at the start of the play. Mother and daughter snarl insults at each other in succession. Delaney\u2019s characters have a wickedly funny edge \u2013 and Prenger and Dobson bring this brilliantly to the fore. Hildegard Bechtler\u2019s astounding set perfectly recreates deprived 1950s Britain. The kitchen is so grotesque, dark and covered in grime I initially thought it was the bathroom, forgetting that only half of British households at the time had bathrooms and most toilets were outside. There are also several entrances to the flat, where the men in Jo\u2019s life and her own mother drop in and out, reflecting the cyclical nature of poverty and the lonely lives of its victims. \u2022 At Trafalgar Studios until 29 Feb",

Here, co-writers and directors Ben Harrison and Pauline Lockhart have selected eight tales to be enacted by three storytellers, with additional input from video designers Bright Side Studios.

In between embodying fantasticalities, Luna Dai, Robin Khor Yong Kuan and Lockhart conversationally impart background information and share biographical snippets with the audience. Or do they?

      "bodyText": "A demon with a paintbrush retouches the features of the human skin it is about to don; a man sneezes and three voracious beasties leap from his nose to fasten forever to him; another travels to a distant monastery where he sees a goddess descend from the moon and learns a fantastical skill, but when he returns home... In his collection of strange tales, Chinese author Pu Songling (1640-1715) presented hundreds of such uncanny stories. Here, co-writers and directors Ben Harrison and Pauline Lockhart have selected eight tales to be enacted by three storytellers, with additional input from video designers Bright Side Studios. The combination of technology and live action sometimes works well (the goddess descending from moon), sometimes not (a battle between video monsters and a live performer). In between embodying fantasticalities, Luna Dai, Robin Khor Yong Kuan and Lockhart conversationally impart background information and share biographical snippets with the audience. Or do they? The framing of the final story about a visit to a fortune-teller suggests that the script may have been slyly echoing Songling\u2019s boundary-blurring, meta-fictional style, to leave us wondering: where do life and fantasy begin and end? \u2022 At the Traverse, Edinburgh, until 21 December",

They speak of an unusual state of contentment between the artist and the Almighty: an early biographer of the composer said that the goodness of divine nature \u201cinspired him with such confidence and joy that he could have written even a Miserere in tempo allegro\u201d. The late mass settings have quasi-symphonic proportions, while the finest of the earlier masses (1782) is the huge <a href=\"http://www.harmoniamundi.com/#!/albums/2561\" title=\"\"><strong>Missa Cellensis</strong></a> \u201cin honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary\u201d, also called the Mariazeller Mass.

      "bodyText": "\u2022 I love Haydn\u2019s masses. They speak of an unusual state of contentment between the artist and the Almighty: an early biographer of the composer said that the goodness of divine nature \u201cinspired him with such confidence and joy that he could have written even a Miserere in tempo allegro\u201d. The late mass settings have quasi-symphonic proportions, while the finest of the earlier masses (1782) is the huge Missa Cellensis \u201cin honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary\u201d, also called the Mariazeller Mass. This receives a glorious new recording from the RIAS Kammerchor and the Akademie f\u00fcr Alte Musik Berlin under Justin Doyle (Harmonia Mundi). From its hushed slow choral opening, through some buoyant fugues and angular chromaticisms, Haydn traces a spiritual journey with great exuberance \u2013 notably in the flamboyant roulades of the soprano arias, well dispatched by Johanna Winkel. The chamber choir of German broadcaster RIAS has kept up with the times and produces beautifully cool, clean-edged textures, which Doyle moulds with skill. \u2022 The castrato Farinelli (Carlo Broschi 1705-82) died in the year of that Haydn mass; he is a figure of continual fascination, from Clare van Kampen\u2019s 2015 play Farinelli and the King to a lavish new survey by the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli. A more scholarly homage is paid in The Farinelli Manuscript (Glossa), in which the fine Swedish mezzo Ann Hallenberg recreates the exact contents of a manuscript Farinelli sent to the Empress Maria Theresa. The performances are excellent, and there is great interest in the decorations and embellishments notated by the singer himself as a guide to the style of the times. I just wish the arias themselves, by nonentities such as Mele, Giacomelli and Latilla, had been more compelling. \u2022 Opera on Radio 3 flourishes, especially through a happy alliance with the Metropolitan Opera in New York (via the European Broadcasting Union, an ideal of cooperative action we must hope not to lose in the future). Philip Glass\u2019s hypnotic Akhnaten, a rare sell-out success for the Met, is on BBC Sounds, and last night\u2019s offering was Tchaikovsky\u2019s The Queen of Spades.",

Kavaliauskas is landing a bunch of shots to the head and body. Then out of nowhere Crawford connects with a pair of big shots upstairs that send Kavaliauskas crashing backward toward the ropes. Kavaliauskas valiantly throws back and lands with a powerful one-two combo to the head, but Crawford unloads another flurry in response that sends Kavaliauskas to the floor.

But now Crawford is starting to open up and really put it on the challenger. He\u2019s picking away with straight rights and left hooks and beating the Lithuanian to the punch. Crawford is taking punches as well, but giving it worse than he\u2019s getting. Very unusual to see Crawford take this many punches, but that was a clear round for the American. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 48-47 Kavaliauskas)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df5b5f88f087e8308e5e4af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T04:26:40.917Z\">4.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 4</strong></p> <p>Crawford takes another big right hand around the guard from Kavaliauskas early in the fourth and now looks like he\u2019s trying to set the Lithuanian up with the left.

Crawford is a pitbull but he\u2019s feeling his opponent\u2019s power, that\u2019s for certain. Another round for the underdog, who\u2019s scoring at will with the right, as Crawford looks to figure things out while remaining in the southpaw stance. </p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 9-10 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 38-38 Kavaliauskas)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df5b4ec8f085eda5c107def\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T04:22:09.774Z\">4.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 3</strong></p> <p>The crowd is getting a bit restless at the lack of action early in the third. Then Kavaliauskas absolutely rocks Crawford with a big right hand in the center of the right, leaving the American to hold on. Crawford goes to the canvas out of the clinch and the referee rules it a slip, but that should have been ruled a knockdown. Crawford appears to be OK, but that certainly got his attention. Now Kavaliauskas lands a few more nice shots right before the bell and the underdog is very much in the fight!</p> <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 9-10 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 29-28 Kavaliauskas)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5df5b3f08f085eda5c107dec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-15T04:17:58.723Z\">4.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Round 2</strong></p> <p>Another cagey round, this time with Kavaliauskas looking to work the body.

After measuring his opponent throughout a cagey, tactical opening round, L\u00f3pez drops his opponent with a heat-seeking right hand that leaves Commey staggering as he attempts to get up. The champion manages to beat the count, but L\u00f3pez swarms Commey along the ropes until the referee correctly intervenes at 1:13 of the second round to capture Commey\u2019s IBF lightweight title. Afterward, L\u00f3pez pulls on the jersey of LSU quarterback Joe Burrow (who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/14/heisman-trophy-joe-burrow-lsu-quarterback\">won the Heisman Trophy</a> a couple of hours ago) then sticks the landing on his trademark backflip.

Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 78-73 Kavaliauskas) Round 7 Crawford does not look sharp tonight. Kavaliauskas is landing a bunch of shots to the head and body. Then out of nowhere Crawford connects with a pair of big shots upstairs that send Kavaliauskas crashing backward toward the ropes. Kavaliauskas valiantly throws back and lands with a powerful one-two combo to the head, but Crawford unloads another flurry in response that sends Kavaliauskas to the floor. Kavaliauskas beats the count and fends off a Crawford onslaught until he\u2019s saved by the bell. What a turnaround! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 10-8 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 68-64 Kavaliauskas) Round 6 The sixth round is a return to Crawford\u2019s preferred pace. He\u2019s got back to keeping Kavaliauskas at bay with the jab and measuring the distance perfectly. It\u2019s not the two-way action the crowd wants, but it\u2019s an easy round for the champion. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 58-56 Kavaliauskas) Round 5 Kavaliauskas is setting traps on Crawford in an unexpected spot of role reversal and he\u2019s enjoying a bit of success! But now Crawford is starting to open up and really put it on the challenger. He\u2019s picking away with straight rights and left hooks and beating the Lithuanian to the punch. Crawford is taking punches as well, but giving it worse than he\u2019s getting. Very unusual to see Crawford take this many punches, but that was a clear round for the American. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 48-47 Kavaliauskas) Round 4 Crawford takes another big right hand around the guard from Kavaliauskas early in the fourth and now looks like he\u2019s trying to set the Lithuanian up with the left. Can\u2019t remember the last time Crawford looked this easy to hit and Kavaliauskas is taking full advantage. Crawford is a pitbull but he\u2019s feeling his opponent\u2019s power, that\u2019s for certain. Another round for the underdog, who\u2019s scoring at will with the right, as Crawford looks to figure things out while remaining in the southpaw stance. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 9-10 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 38-38 Kavaliauskas) Round 3 The crowd is getting a bit restless at the lack of action early in the third. Then Kavaliauskas absolutely rocks Crawford with a big right hand in the center of the right, leaving the American to hold on. Crawford goes to the canvas out of the clinch and the referee rules it a slip, but that should have been ruled a knockdown. Crawford appears to be OK, but that certainly got his attention. Now Kavaliauskas lands a few more nice shots right before the bell and the underdog is very much in the fight! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 9-10 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 29-28 Kavaliauskas) Round 2 Another cagey round, this time with Kavaliauskas looking to work the body. Crawford isn\u2019t giving him a stationary target, using slippery lateral movement and working off the jab. The fighters burst into a exchange and Kavaliauskas catches Crawford with a counter right to the jaw, but the American takes it well. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas) Round 1 Here we go into the main event! Crawford comes out in a southpaw stance. Kavaliauskas enters a cautious pursuit, throwing straight lefts to the hand and body and landing a couple. Crawford lands a sharp counter left and a bunch of right jabs, mostly upstairs. Not a whole lot of action, but an unmistakable air of menace. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas (Crawford 10-9 Kavaliauskas) \u201cI\u2019m at a loss for words right now,\u201d L\u00f3pez says after winning the IBF lightweight title. \u201cThis a dream come true. [Commey] is a bad man. His shot could\u2019ve done the same to me if he hit me with that shot.\u201d He adds: \u201cYou all know who I want to fight next. 2020 is going to be a big year. \u2018The Takeover\u2019 has arrived, and you haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d Lomachenko, who holds the WBA and WBO lightweight titles, said he\u2019s keen on meeting L\u00f3pez in a unification fight. \u201cNow he\u2019s a world champion and now he\u2019s interesting to me, because he has the title,\u201d Lomachenko told the Guardian at ringside in the moments after L\u00f3pez\u2019s TKO win. \u201cWe want to \u2018unificate\u2019 all four titles.\u201d Te\u00f3fimo L\u00f3pez is a world champion in only his 15th professional fight after a dazzling second-round TKO of Richard Commey. After measuring his opponent throughout a cagey, tactical opening round, L\u00f3pez drops his opponent with a heat-seeking right hand that leaves Commey staggering as he attempts to get up. The champion manages to beat the count, but L\u00f3pez swarms Commey along the ropes until the referee correctly intervenes at 1:13 of the second round to capture Commey\u2019s IBF lightweight title. Afterward, L\u00f3pez pulls on the jersey of LSU quarterback Joe Burrow (who won the Heisman Trophy a couple of hours ago) then sticks the landing on his trademark backflip. It\u2019s a star-making performance for the Brooklyn prodigy and sets the stage for a must-see showdown against Vasyl Lomachenko next year. \u201cI just needed to get that one back,\u201d Conlan says after avenging his nightmarish Rio exit. \u201cIt was a lot of pressure going into that fight, but it\u2019s nice to get it done.\u201d The Belfast man continues: \u201cI needed to right this wrong. Full credit to Nikitin, who fought his heart out. There\u2019s no bad blood. There was never was. Now, we can put this chapter of my career behind me.\u201d What\u2019s next? \u201cWho do I want? I want a Christmas dinner with ham and all the trimmings I want to enjoy this.\u201d Conlan improves to 13 wins in as many professional fights with a unanimous-decision win over Vladimir Nikitin. The ringside judges\u2019 scores of 98-92, 99-91 and 100-90 (!) are laughable, but this was a breakthrough performance of sorts by Conlan, who showed the finishing kick of a seasoned pro in the ninth and 10th rounds in beating back a fierce rally by Nikitin, who came on so strong in the middle act. Conlan\u2019s revenge bid has gotten a bit hairy in the later stages. A crowd-pleasing eighth round descended into the Irishman and Niktin simply trading leather in the center of the ring. Conlan got it back on the rails a bit in the ninth, winning a cagier round on superior body work and taking an 86-85 edge on the Guardian\u2019s card. And now Conlan appears to have done enough in the crowd-pleasing 10th to finish the task. We\u2019ll see if the judges agree. Michael Conlan came out sharp in his revenge match with Vladimir Nikitin. The two-time Irish Olympian boxed beautifully from the opening bell, circling the cruder Niktin and tagging him with one-two combinations upstairs to win four of the first five rounds. But Niktin has come on strong in round six and seven, finding range with the left hook as Conlan has started to slow down a bit and present a more stationary target. Three more rounds to go. Hello and welcome to Madison Square Garden for tonight\u2019s WBO welterweight title fight between Terence Crawford and Egidijus Kavaliauskas. Crawford (35-0, 26 KOs) is returning to action for the first time since a sixth-round technical knockout of Amir Khan in this same building. But rather than a big-money fight with Manny Pacquiao and Errol Spence Jr or any one of the other big names at 147lbs, the Omaha native has been forced to settle for the WBO\u2019s mandatory challenger in Kavaliauskas (21-0-1, 17 KOs), a two-time Olympian for Lithuania fighting out of Oxnard, California. Before that, however, a pair of intriguing co-features. First it\u2019s Ireland\u2019s Michael Conlan (12-0, 7 KOs), who is out to avenge a pair of amateur losses to Vladimir Nikitin (3-0, 0 KOs) \u2013 including his nightmarish Rio \u201cdefeat\u201d at the hands of the Russian. Then highly regarded contender Teofimo Lopez (14-0, 11 KOs) will face off with Richard Commey (29-2, 26 KOs) for Commey\u2019s IBF lightweight title. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s a look at tonight\u2019s order of play in reverse order. Terence Crawford v Egidijus Kavaliauskas, 12 rounds, for Crawford\u2019s WBO welterweight title Richard Commey v Teofimo Lopez Jr, 12 rounds, for Commey\u2019s IBF lightweight title Michael Conlan v Vladimir Nikitin, 10 rounds, featherweights Josue Vargas v Noel Murphy, 10 rounds, junior welterweights Edgar Berlanga v Cesar Nunez, 8 rounds, super middleweights Julian Rodriguez v Manuel Mendez, 8 rounds, junior welterweights George Kambosos Jr v Mickey Bey, 10 rounds, lightweights",

Economists and investors have been poring over the weekend\u2019s announcement, which appeared to end a dispute that has roiled financial markets for 17 months. According to Washington\u2019s trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, China has agreed to buy up to $200bn in additional goods and services over the next two years on top of the amount it purchased in 2017.

Also, there are more rounds of talks to go before an official signing of this phase one deal. Beijing emphasised that the text needed to be legally vetted and translated into Chinese, suggesting that the terms were still not totally agreed upon. Financial markets also betrayed unease that things could fall apart. Stocks on Wall Street and elsewhere were initially buoyed by the announcement, but slipped back when details were not forthcoming. The glacial progress on the so-called \u201cphase one\u201d deal shows neither side wants to compromise and has exposed growing fault lines, threatening what one prominent economist calls the \u201cdeglobalisation\u201d of the world economy. It is now not only a battle over trade and intellectual property, but also one about the future of the rules-based system of international trade and which economic model will prevail. Sharp US criticism of China over human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, Washington\u2019s fears about technology company Huawei acting as a trojan horse in western economies, plus ongoing military tensions in the South China Sea, have added volatile layers to the conflict. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to the insurance giant Allianz, said the \u201cmini deal\u201d announced on Friday was expected by the markets and should be seen more as a \u201ctemporary and reversible truce\u201d as opposed to a comprehensive resolution. It would now come down to whether the two sides press \u201cplay or rewind\u201d on the playbook that has dominated the global economy since the fall of the Berlin Wall 30 years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about economic issues,\u201d El-Erian said. \u201cIt speaks to a bigger question as to what follows this period where the \u2018pause\u2019 button has been pressed on the multi-decade process of economic and financial globalisation. Will the \u2018play\u2019 button be pressed again, as markets currently expect or, instead, \u2018rewind\u2019, marking a period of secular deglobalisation?\u201d Both sides have talked up the benefits of the phase-one deal since it was outlined in October. The Dow Jones average on Wall Street has rallied more than 6% since then to multiple all-time highs, prompting similar gains around the world. But despite Trump agreeing to reduce the 15% tariffs on $160bn worth of goods due to start on Sunday, and halving the 15% tariffs on another $120bn, it is still not clear if the agreement will lead to a second phase deal. Christopher Balding, an expert on the Chinese economy and professor at Fulbright University in Vietnam, also sounded a sceptical note because neither side had conceded very much ground. \u201cI would still say one had to put the odds of this whole thing blowing up at 50%,\u201d he said, adding that the US rollback was \u201cminimal\u201d and \u201ceasy to get out of\u201d if China did not fulfil its side of the bargain on agricultural purchases. Brad Setser, a former US treasury economist and now a fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations thinktank in New York, said an impasse had been reached amid a growing sense in the US that China does not want a deal within the existing framework. \u201cChina won\u2019t get a rollback of all tariffs and the US knows China is not going to moderate its economic model,\u201d he says. \u201cA limited deal is recognition that a broad deal is impossible. Both realise that phase one is all they can get. \u201cBut there is growing friction. China is no longer seen as on a trajectory that favours the US.

However, Kipchoge denies he and other Nike athletes have too great an advantage from wearing shoes that have been shown in scientific experiments to be faster than rival brands. \u201cI thank Nike for the good shoes. They are doing a great job. But above all it is the person themselves.</p> <p>\u201cWe have 10 teams in Formula One, with great engines and tyres from Pirelli, but only Lewis Hamilton is winning. Why? Because he is focused and he is a very good professional driver. I met him in Abu Dhabi and I realised that to win it is not the tyres, it is the person.\u201d</p> <p>But surely the Vaporfly and alphaFLY shoes provide an advantage? \u201cYou know, what makes a human being is his conscience,\u201d Kipchoge says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe you can run fast, even in the best shoes you can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Kipchoge is more hesitant when it comes to discussing the recent problems at his sponsor Nike, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/01/athletics-coach-alberto-salazar-receives-four-year-ban-for-doping-violations\" title=\"\">Alberto Salazar\u2019s four\u2011year ban </a>for doping offences and the criticisms that the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/nov/11/high-time-nike-iaaf-right-thing-athletes\" title=\"\">restricted payments for female athletes who become pregnant</a>. \u201cThat is their business. I cannot comment on that,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is similarly uneasy when asked whether Mo Farah\u2019s achievements are tainted by his seven-year coaching association with Salazar, batting the question back. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d </p> <p>When pressed, Kipchoge adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on the Oregon Project. I am a Kenyan. I am training in Kenya. I think you will know more from those training in America.\u201d</p> <p>But he has warm words for Farah, who he believes can win a gold medal after moving back to the track to defend his 10,000m Olympic title in Tokyo. \u201cMo Farah did not fail in the marathon,\u201d he says. \u201cI respect him as a sportsman and as a human being and I respect the conscience of his team.</p> <p>\u201cSo if the decision is to go back to track, then that is the best. But he will come back in a big way after the 10,000m at the Olympics. He can run very well in the marathon. His PB is 2:05 \u2013 I think that is not enough. He can run 2:03.\u201d</p> <p>For now, though, Kipchoge is concentrating on getting down to serious training again. It means that shortly before dawn on Christmas Day, while the rest of the world are opening their eyes and presents, he will embark on an \u201ceasy\u201d run of 20km \u2013 part of a scheduled 220km of training that week.</p> <p>\u201cI have been doing all sorts of things since Vienna,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been hanging out with the kids, I have been going around to mentor people. I started to train in the gym three times a week and three times running, the training is picking up now.\u201d</p> <p>Does he ever think about sitting on the sofa and jacking it all in? A shake of the head. \u201cEven if I am tired and have just woken up I just go for a run and after 10 minutes the energy just comes.\u201d</p> <p>With that he bursts into a smile again.</p>",

I met him in Abu Dhabi and I realised that to win it is not the tyres, it is the person.\u201d But surely the Vaporfly and alphaFLY shoes provide an advantage? \u201cYou know, what makes a human being is his conscience,\u201d Kipchoge says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe you can run fast, even in the best shoes you can\u2019t do it.\u201d Kipchoge is more hesitant when it comes to discussing the recent problems at his sponsor Nike, including Alberto Salazar\u2019s four\u2011year ban for doping offences and the criticisms that the company restricted payments for female athletes who become pregnant. \u201cThat is their business. I cannot comment on that,\u201d he says. He is similarly uneasy when asked whether Mo Farah\u2019s achievements are tainted by his seven-year coaching association with Salazar, batting the question back. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d When pressed, Kipchoge adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on the Oregon Project. I am a Kenyan. I am training in Kenya. I think you will know more from those training in America.\u201d But he has warm words for Farah, who he believes can win a gold medal after moving back to the track to defend his 10,000m Olympic title in Tokyo. \u201cMo Farah did not fail in the marathon,\u201d he says. \u201cI respect him as a sportsman and as a human being and I respect the conscience of his team. \u201cSo if the decision is to go back to track, then that is the best. But he will come back in a big way after the 10,000m at the Olympics. He can run very well in the marathon. His PB is 2:05 \u2013 I think that is not enough. He can run 2:03.\u201d For now, though, Kipchoge is concentrating on getting down to serious training again. It means that shortly before dawn on Christmas Day, while the rest of the world are opening their eyes and presents, he will embark on an \u201ceasy\u201d run of 20km \u2013 part of a scheduled 220km of training that week. \u201cI have been doing all sorts of things since Vienna,\u201d he says. \u201cI have been hanging out with the kids, I have been going around to mentor people. I started to train in the gym three times a week and three times running, the training is picking up now.\u201d Does he ever think about sitting on the sofa and jacking it all in? A shake of the head. \u201cEven if I am tired and have just woken up I just go for a run and after 10 minutes the energy just comes.\u201d With that he bursts into a smile again.",
