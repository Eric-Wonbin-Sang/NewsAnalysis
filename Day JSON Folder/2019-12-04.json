And it\u2019s been 20 years since they won at Anfield, their last triumph in their old home courtesy of a Kevin Campbell goal. God speed, Toffees.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League, while Everton hover just a couple above the relegation zone. </strong>So it\u2019s not just the history books that Marco Silva\u2019s side are up against; the current form book suggests only one likely result, too. But a quick flick through our third tome - the great big book of hoary old cliches - will tell you that form goes out of the window in a derby. So ...</p> <p><strong>... there is hope! </strong>For starters, Everton usually give Liverpool a proper game. They were the better team at Anfield last season, only to be undone by Jordan Pickford\u2019s surreal late error, while they were awkward and cussed in a goalless draw at Goodison that handed title advantage to Manchester City. It\u2019s been a while since Liverpool have had it easy against their neighbours.</p> <p><strong>And while Everton have injury problems of their own - no Jean-Philippe Gbamin, Andre Gomes, Fabian Delph or Seamus Coleman - Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side is depleted in a couple of important positions. </strong>They\u2019ll miss Fabinho\u2019s midfield glue until the New Year, while keeper Alisson is suspended after his reckless red card against Brighton.</p> <p><strong>So can Everton spring a surprise that may save Marco Silva\u2019s job?</strong> Or will Liverpool keep onwards and upwards in their relentless pursuit of that elusive Premier League title? We\u2019ll find out soon enough as the 234th Merseyside derby plays out in front of our very eyes.

      "bodyText": "A great night for Jurgen Klopp, then, as his surprise selections Divock Origi, Xherdan Shaqiri and Adam Lallana all performed excellently. Not such a good one for Marco Silva, who is under serious pressure now with his side in the relegation zone. \u201cIt was a tough night for us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot concede goals like we did at this level. We were not good enough.\u201d Andy Hunter was at Anfield to witness a memorable Mersey derby. Here\u2019s his report. Click and enjoy, and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! As Anfield celebrates, Divock Origi speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s a special game, and as a team we enjoyed it. We showed that we really enjoy to play for Liverpool. The manager showed us trust, and so it was important to get the three points. I think my first goal was important to break the game open, but the second one, technically, I enjoyed that one! We used the space well. We had wonderful service. We have a great team, and we have to be at our best. We try to push each other and enjoy. I\u2019m grateful to be here.\u201d A rollercoaster ride comes to an end. Liverpool remain eight points clear of second-placed Leicester City, while Everton slip into the relegation zone. Marco Silva warmly hugs Jurgen Klopp on the touchline. Is that his last act as manager at Goodison? 90 min +2: Liverpool stroke it around as their fans question Everton\u2019s 2020-21 status in song form. 90 min +1: There will be three added minutes. This match can\u2019t end soon enough for Marco Silva and Everton. Firmino, out on the left, turns Holgate inside out with a cute drop of the shoulder and a shuffle of the feet. He reaches the byline and pulls the ball back for Wijnaldum, who opens his body and sidefoots across Pickford and into the bottom right. 88 min: A high ball falls towards Pickford on the edge of the box. It\u2019s panto season, so Liverpool\u2019s fans holler as it drops. Pickford, perhaps mindful of what happened at the Kop end last year, does extremely well to claim under pressure. 87 min: Anfield is racked with collective tension. A goal for Everton now would really put the cat among the pigeons. Richarlison competes for a high ball in the Liverpool box, but is penalised for an overly aggressive nudge on Van Dijk. 85 min: Nothing comes of the set piece. Liverpool go up the other end, Shaqiri releasing Mane. He rounds Pickford, but just as he\u2019s preparing to roll home, he\u2019s nudged in the back by Holgate, who nicks the ball away. What a chance spurned! Should it have been a penalty? It would have been a harsh decision. And then, immediately afterwards, Kean is sent clear down the middle! He must score, but slams his shot wide left from the edge of the box. It could have been 5-2, it could have been 4-3. This has been a very odd game. 84 min: Henderson clanks into Sigurdsson and that\u2019s a free kick 40 yards out. Before it\u2019s taken, Joe Gomez comes on for Trent Alexander-Arnold. Everton load the box and Wijnaldum slices out for a corner. 83 min: This is better, though. Digne bursts into space down the left and stands one up to the far post. There\u2019s nobody in blue taking a chance, and Robertson can clear easily. 82 min: Everton stroke it around the back for a bit, a state of affairs Liverpool are quite happy with. They\u2019re going nowhere. 80 min: Mane should have wrapped this match up, with a pretty bow. Henderson plays long for Mane, who takes the ball down on the edge of the D. Wijnaldum gets in his way a little, but even so, Mane should tuck the ball away. Instead he shoots inches wide of the bottom right. Will Liverpool live to regret that miss? There\u2019s still time for Everton to get back into the game. A goal for the visitors and Anfield will get extremely nervous. 79 min: Digne throws in from the left. Lovren goes up with Kean, who goes over, but it\u2019s not a penalty. Everton keep pressing, though, Richarlison winning a corner out on the right. The set piece is a bit of a non-event. 78 min: Shaqiri whips it in. Wijnaldum heads harmlessly into the Kop while looking for the top left. 77 min: A couple of nice flicks by Shaqiri, then Mane bursts down the left. He\u2019s blocked unfairly by Schneiderlin, and this is a free kick out on the wing, a chance to load the box. 75 min: The match has started to drift. To be fair, the punters have already got good bang for their buck. \u201cLiving in deep, dark West Wales, my internet connection is exactly as good as you imagine it to be,\u201d writes Amazon Prime customer Matt Dony. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice to see what it would have been like to watch a live match through a ZX Spectrum.\u201d 73 min: Everton make their last change, replacing Tom Davies with Morgan Schneiderlin. Liverpool respond with a double swap of their own, sending on Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino in place of Adam Lallana and Divock Origi, the latter getting a particularly warm ovation for his evening\u2019s work. 71 min: Robertson fizzes a very inviting pass through the Everton box from the left. There\u2019s nobody there to tap in. Had someone in red taken a gamble, Liverpool would have restored their three-goal lead. 69 min: Shaqiri loops a pass down the inside left and nearly releases Mane, who is forced to check under pressure from Keane. Mane waits for the ball to drop so he can have a bash at goal from the edge of the box ... but it never does, not in an inviting way, anyway. Keane eases him out of the road. 67 min: Davies slides in late on Alexander-Arnold, and is booked for his trouble. 65 min: Davies has a lash from distance. Adrian is behind it all the way. 63 min: All very scrappy, all of a sudden. Alexander-Arnold sticks out an arm in the middle of a melee. A deliberate handball? Not according to the referee. He\u2019d have been walking if the decision went the other way. 61 min: Moise Kean comes on for Dominic Calvert-Lewin. His very first act is to win a corner down the right. Sigurdsson takes, and Richarlison slaps a header straight at Adrian. A great chance. Either side of the keeper, and Everton would be right back in this. 59 min: Alexander-Arnold goes tearing down the right. His cross is headed out weakly by Keane. Milner chests down and thinks about shooting. Instead he slips a ball down the right channel for Lallana, who spins, shoots over, and was offside anyway. 57 min: Mane is bowled over in midfield by Keane and Davies. Keane is fairly fortunate not to see yellow for blootering the ball away in frustration. The resulting free kick, by Alexander-Arnold, sails harmlessly into the Kop. 56 min: Origi makes good down the right and finds himself hauled down by Mina. A free kick just to the side of the box, near the byline. Shaqiri whips it in, but the referee blows up for an Everton free kick, the result of some pushing and shoving. 55 min: Another corner for Liverpool out on the right. Alexander-Arnold takes this one, and it\u2019s easily dealt with by the Everton defence. A fair chance the goal tally in this game won\u2019t end at six. 54 min: One corner leads to another. Shaqiri\u2019s second effort is flicked across the face of goal, but Holgate is on point at the far post to clear with Origi and Wijnaldum lurking. 53 min: Origi spins just inside the Everton box and shoots. It\u2019s blocked instantly. The ball breaks to Milner who has another crack. This one\u2019s deflected out to the right of goal for a corner. Shaqiri will take it, and send the ball into a crowded six-yard box. 52 min: Digne takes a good but not great free kick. It\u2019s aimed towards the top right, but always a little high and wide. An interesting stat here: Everton have had nine attempts to Liverpool\u2019s five. 51 min: Robertson\u2019s poor clearing header causes Van Dijk to uncharacteristically panic, needlessly knocking Calvert-Lewin to the ground under a high ball. A free kick just to the right of the D. A dangerous position. If Everton score the next goal, this really is game on. 49 min: Iwobi and Sigurdsson combine well down the right. The ball\u2019s hooked in for Richarlison, who can\u2019t connect properly, and sends a header sailing harmlessly into the arms of Adrian. Anfield still nervous, bordering on silent. 47 min: Anfield is a fairly pensive place at the moment. You wouldn\u2019t know we were in the middle of a six-goal thriller. Or maybe that\u2019s exactly why everyone\u2019s so tense. Van Dijk doesn\u2019t help matters by spraying a simple pass out of play on the left. Deep breath, then, because here we go again! Everton get the ball rolling again. Liverpool are kicking towards the Kop. Half-time entertainment. Like you weren\u2019t already excited enough. Marco Silva goes off down the tunnel in a fury, waving his arms this way and that. Jurgen Klopp isn\u2019t too happy either. On the balance of play, his side should be home and hosed already ... but this isn\u2019t over by a long chalk. Not if those wild and wonderful 48 minutes were anything to go by! This is absurd! Bernard is fed down the left. He crosses towards Richarlison, who sends a diving header into the bottom right! Actually on second glance, it\u2019s come off his shoulder, not that he cares too much. Everton are still in this! Just about. 45 min +1: There will be three added minutes. Everton are desperate to hear the half-time whistle. The small margins, though. Had Lovren not slid in to feather that cross away from Calvert-Lewin, it\u2019d be 3-2 and game on. As it is, Everton are in all sorts of bother now. Van Dijk heads the resulting corner clear. Mane scampers up the left, and sends Alexander-Arnold away down the wing. Liverpool are two on one, with Shaqiri free on the right. Alexander-Arnold bides his time, and eventually slips the ball right, not to Shaqiri, but to Mane, who had kept running. It\u2019s a perfectly weighted pass, begging to be hit, and Mane sidefoots it into the bottom left from the edge of the box. 44 min: Richarlison bustles into the Liverpool box on the right, and whips a lovely ball across the face of goal. Calvert-Lewin is waiting to run the ball home, but Lovren sticks out a leg to divert the ball away for a corner. A goal-saving intervention. 43 min: Van Dijk looks long for Mane down the right, but there\u2019s way too much juice on the ball, and it sails through to Pickford. Everton go up the other end, Bernard nearly sending Davies into the box with a cute flick down the left, but Alexander-Arnold toes the ball away just in time. 41 min: Calvert-Lewin chases a lost cause down the right. Robertson clumsily barges him in the back, and this is a free kick just outside the box, right on the byline. A very dangerous position. Sigurdsson takes, and finds the head of Keane, six yards out, but the defender can\u2019t guide home this time. 40 min: Richarlison spins down the inside-left channel and slips a pass inside for Iwobi, who has a chance to shoot from the edge of the D. Iwobi hooks a strange effort wide left and high. Adrian had nothing to do. 38 min: Wijnaldum juggles the ball down the right, setting Shaqiri off into space. Shaqiri plays Mane in on the overlap. Mane crosses low, forcing Pickford to parry away from goal and into the heart of the area. Fortunately the ball falls to a blue shirt and Everton can clear their lines. But that was risky. 36 min: Everton\u2019s heads have momentarily gone. They are all over the shop at the back. Milner floats a ball in from the left for Shaqiri, who is outjumped by Keane. Corner ... from which nothing happens. 35 min: Everton make a tactical change. Djibril Sidibe is hooked, with Bernard coming on. Everton will play four at the back, with Mason Holgate taking the departed Sidibe\u2019s slot out on the right. 33 min: Keane clatters into Mane in the midfield. No yellow. This one came out of nowhere. Lovren pings a long pass down the middle. Origi takes it out of the sky with his right peg, then opens his body to sidefoot a lob past Pickford and into the net! Shades of Luis Suarez versus Newcastle. What a touch to kill that long ball! 30 min: It\u2019s getting a bit dirty. Richarlison is late on Shaqiri, studding his left ankle. He sees yellow. Like Alexander-Arnold before him, it could easily have been a red. 29 min: Now Liverpool want a penalty, as Mane tumbles while chasing a pass down the inside-left channel. They\u2019re not getting one. He clattered into Sidibe, but the defender took the ball cleanly, face on. 27 min: Alexander-Arnold is booked, quite correctly, for a late stamp on Digne\u2019s foot. Another referee might have brandished red. Liverpool\u2019s young full-back needs to calm down quickly, or he\u2019ll be the latest in a long line of players to take an early bath in this fixture. 26 min: No penalty. Probably the correct decision, there didn\u2019t seem much contact from behind. Either way, VAR isn\u2019t interested. 25 min: Liverpool play a high line. Iwobi busts it open with a pass down the right, releasing Calvert-Lewin on goal! The air is sucked out of Anfield. An equaliser looks on the cards ... until Calvert-Lewin falls just inside the box, Van Dijk pressurising him from behind. The ball squirts wide right of goal. Everton want a penalty. And there\u2019s going to be a VAR check. 23 min: Richarlison isn\u2019t particularly happy as Alexander-Arnold lands on his leg, studs first. It looked like an accident, though Richarlison clearly doesn\u2019t think it was. The referee gets in between the pair and calms everything down. 22 min: That was very scrappy from Liverpool\u2019s point of view. On the touchline, Jurgen Klopp looks furious. As he fumes, Lallana is stripped of possession while faffing about. Iwobi can\u2019t quite feed Richarlison down the inside-right channel. Had he got the pass right, he\u2019d have freed his team-mate into the box. Anfield is suddenly a very tense place. Everton work a short corner back up the right flank. Iwobi suddenly cruises into the area down the channel and feeds Keane, who breaks through a poor Lovren challenge and lifts the ball over Adrian and into the net. Game back on! 20 min: A free kick for Everton out on the left. Digne\u2019s delivery is no good, but Robertson slashes at a clearance wildly, and shanks the ball out for a corner on the right. From which ... 19 min: Klopp\u2019s team selection, eh. Everton try to bounce back quickly, winning a corner out on the left. Mina heads it well over the bar. Another stunner! Alexander-Arnold, deep on the right, sprays a widescreen pass to Mane out on the left. Mane drifts infield and slips a ball down the inside-left channel. Shaqiri, barrelling in, sticks out a leg and delicately guides the ball past the outrushing Pickford and into the empty net. What a goal that was. 16 min: Robertson clips Davies from behind, then falls on his back. Davies isn\u2019t happy at all, and springs up with a view to throwing hands. Robertson smiles malevolently, not wholly unlike the bit in Trainspotting where Renton gets whacked by a car and then grins at the driver through the windscreen. 14 min: Lallana has a dig from 25 yards. His shot is wide left, and he\u2019d used his arm while chesting the ball down anyway. Free kick. 13 min: Everton are asking a couple of questions, though. Another game of bagatelle in the Liverpool box ends with Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin kind of getting in each other\u2019s way, when a shot from 12 yards looked on. Eventually the ball\u2019s shanked wide right. They too should have done much better. This is a nice, open, free-flowing match. 11 min: Mane is sent clear down the inside left by another raking Van Dijk pass. He should at least get a shot on target, but checks back and shifts inside in order to get a better angle. He allows Mina to get back to block. Should have done much better. 10 min: Iwobi strips Robertson of possession and drives down the inside-right channel. It\u2019s a promising attack, but Milner comes from behind and a superb textbook sliding tackle stops Iwobi in his tracks. 9 min: Lallana spins up and down the left touchline, nearly getting the better of Sidibe ... but not quite. Liverpool are looking sprightly, energised by that early boost. 8 min: Keane flings a ball into the Liverpool area from the left. Adrian claims, then gets into a spat with Calvert-Lewin. Two grown men, and all. Van Dijk breaks it up with a smile. Last season\u2019s hero is at it again! There\u2019s a little bit of pinball in the Liverpool box, started by Richarlison. Robertson clears. Mane picks up possession out on the left, then plays one of the passes of the season, curling a perfectly weighted one to the feet of Origi, who doesn\u2019t have to break stride to collect the ball and round Pickford in one smooth movement, before rolling into the net. That was a delight. 5 min: Iwobi sends Calvert-Lewin scampering down the right wing, but the striker looked offside and the whistle goes anyway. Turns out Iwobi handled while chesting down. 4 min: A scrappy passage of play in the middle of the park. Everton will be happy enough, especially as its quietened the home faithful a tad. 2 min: Mane and Mina clashed heads when the Liverpool man headed over. Trainers on to look at them both. They\u2019re good to go again. The Amazon picture shifts out of focus, art imitating real life. 1 min: Origi has an early dribble into the Everton box, but it\u2019s a dead end. Everton clear. Liverpool come straight back at them, Robertson tearing down the left after a long Van Dijk pass. He crosses for Mane, who heads over from 12 yards. And we\u2019re off! Liverpool get the ball rolling, defending the Kop end in the first half, which is how they like it. Here come the teams! Some breaking news, and a Guardian world exclusive: Liverpool will play in red while Everton sport blue. Here\u2019s another thing you don\u2019t need me to tell you: there\u2019s a cracking atmosphere in Anfield ahead of the Merseyside derby. You Never Walk Alone gets a belt out, while the Everton end sing in defiance. And finally all four corners of the ground give a round of applause for the continued bravery of the Hillsborough families. Justice for the 96. We\u2019ll be off in a minute or two. Marco Silva talks! \u201cIt is a tough match. It is a special game for both teams and for the city. We should forget their position in the table and the record in the last 20 years; it is an opportunity. Just because they have changed players, they have not changed their DNA and will be a strong team for sure. I see a really strong side to play against. It is important we keep the good things we did against Leicester. Some of the other things we should improve, the way we managed the game. It is a challenge. I would like to see the same Everton I saw here last season.\u201d Some pre-match jitters in the LFC fanbase. \u201cThe film critic Pauline Kael said that Brian de Palma films were so tense you wanted someone to hurry up and get killed so you could have a breather,\u201d writes Ian Copestake. \u201cI find myself almost feeling the same about the agonies one goes through watching Liverpool remain unbeaten. But please, not now! Not to them!\u201d Anthony O Connell adds: \u201cThat team Klopp has picked tonight is worrying. Very, very worrying. Lallana in central mid, too light. Origi a great sub, not a great starter.\u201d \u201cGreat to see Shaq getting a start,\u201d begins Alyson Douglas. \u201cNot so much confidence in Lallana.\u201d And finally here\u2019s Alex Davies: \u201cPerhaps you can reassure me - it may just be my inner pessimist - but I can\u2019t shake the feeling, looking at this lineup, that Klopp has gone utterly mad.\u201d It\u2019s almost as though everyone can suddenly feel Pep\u2019s breath on the back of their neck, in the wake of Manchester City\u2019s 4-1 win at Burnley last night. A title race, right here. Jurgen Klopp talks to Amazon Prime. \u201cOne change I had to make, the other four we wanted to. We did it because we can do it. I have said a lot of times we have the squad. It will be intense. It\u2019s a very important game for both sides, but you try to fight as hard as you can for the three points. It\u2019s all clear, it\u2019s a very difficult game, I don\u2019t care about the stats and history. It is nothing we think about.\u201d He also praises Everton, their fans and representatives for their support over Hillsborough during recent trying times. \u201cThe people in the city stand together, we are 100 percent united.\u201d Don\u2019t forget, there are five other Premier League games taking place tonight. They\u2019ve already kicked off. Simon Burnton has your back. Adrian talks to Amazon Prime. \u201cIt is my first derby with Liverpool. I hope we have a great night. I am really happy to be back, it is an opportunity for me, and I\u2019ll try to give my best. We need some fresh legs as we have many games in front of us, a heavy schedule. We have quality enough to play any game with any kind of player, we have a big squad.\u201d Alex Iwobi\u2019s making his first appearance in a Merseyside derby too, and he\u2019s also been chatting to the new broadcaster on the scene. \u201cI\u2019m excited. I\u2019m no stranger to a derby as I\u2019m used to one in north London. We did very well at Leicester, there\u2019s a lot of positives to take and bring into this game. The pressure\u2019s on all of us, but that\u2019s why we are professionals and we\u2019ll do our best. We\u2019re not afraid, we go out there to battle and do our best. If we get a result it\u2019ll turn our season around.\u201d Liverpool make five changes to the XI sent out against Brighton last Saturday. James Milner and Adam Lallana replace Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in midfield. Adrian deputises for the suspended Alisson in goal. And up front, a couple of big and perhaps surprising calls, as Xherdan Shaqiri and Divock Origi allow Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah to put their feet up on the bench. It\u2019s the Powercube\u2019s first start in the Premier League since January. Everton name the same XI so unlucky to lose at Leicester. Another 5-4-1 it is, then. Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Milner, Shaqiri, Mane, Origi. Subs: Keita, Firmino, Salah, Gomez, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kelleher. Everton: Pickford, Sidibe, Holgate, Mina, Keane, Digne, Iwobi, Davies, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Walcott, Tosun, Schneiderlin, Bernard, Kean, Lossl. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral). Two banners. Posted without comment. Everton haven\u2019t had much luck in the Merseyside derby of late. It\u2019s been 19 matches since they won one of them, when Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta saw off Mr Roy\u2019s Reds in 2010. And it\u2019s been 20 years since they won at Anfield, their last triumph in their old home courtesy of a Kevin Campbell goal. God speed, Toffees. Liverpool are currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League, while Everton hover just a couple above the relegation zone. So it\u2019s not just the history books that Marco Silva\u2019s side are up against; the current form book suggests only one likely result, too. But a quick flick through our third tome - the great big book of hoary old cliches - will tell you that form goes out of the window in a derby. So ... ... there is hope! For starters, Everton usually give Liverpool a proper game. They were the better team at Anfield last season, only to be undone by Jordan Pickford\u2019s surreal late error, while they were awkward and cussed in a goalless draw at Goodison that handed title advantage to Manchester City. It\u2019s been a while since Liverpool have had it easy against their neighbours. And while Everton have injury problems of their own - no Jean-Philippe Gbamin, Andre Gomes, Fabian Delph or Seamus Coleman - Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side is depleted in a couple of important positions. They\u2019ll miss Fabinho\u2019s midfield glue until the New Year, while keeper Alisson is suspended after his reckless red card against Brighton. So can Everton spring a surprise that may save Marco Silva\u2019s job? Or will Liverpool keep onwards and upwards in their relentless pursuit of that elusive Premier League title? We\u2019ll find out soon enough as the 234th Merseyside derby plays out in front of our very eyes. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8.15pm GMT.",

      "bodyText": "Labour is to promise free, healthy breakfasts for all primary-age children as part of a multibillion pound plan to \u201cpoverty-proof\u201d England\u2019s schools and boost educational standards. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, will on Thursday pledge to recruit 20,000 more teachers, cap secondary class sizes at 30, and spend \u00a37bn on repairs and upgrades to England\u2019s crumbling school buildings. As well as expanding the provision of free breakfasts to all primary schools across England to help combat hunger, Labour would also pilot free breakfasts in secondary schools and introduce a new programme of \u201cextended schools\u201d, in the evenings and the summer holidays, to help all children to access activities such as sport. \u201cRising child poverty under the Tories is an absolute scandal, and it is a disgrace that their plans will push it to a 60-year high if they win this election. \u201cLabour will tackle child poverty while driving up standards in schools by providing extra support to the children who need it most,\u201d Rayner said. \u201cLabour will invest in both our schools and the children in them, to transform the life chances of a generation being failed by the Tories.\u201d Other measures being announced include: \u2022 Reinstating the education maintenance allowance (EMA), paid to over-16s from low-income families who remain in education \u2013 and increasing the rate by \u00a35 a week, to \u00a335 for the most needy. \u2022 Guaranteeing that all classes will be taught by qualified teachers: requiring 25,000 unqualified staff to be trained in Labour\u2019s first term. \u2022 Closing the gap in funding for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities. \u2022 Reversing cuts to the pupil premium, and increasing it immediately. Funding for the measures will come from the extra set aside for education in Labour\u2019s manifesto \u2013 with the revenue raised through tax increases, including restoring corporation tax to 26%. Labour\u2019s plans followed analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) that Conservative spending plans for school sixth forms in England would result in real-terms falls in spending per student, leaving it more than a quarter below its level in 2010 and lower than at any point in at least 20 years. Research by the main teaching unions shows there are 420,000 more pupils but 3,500 fewer teachers than in 2015: and the government has missed its teacher training targets for seven consecutive years. The unions say almost 1 million children in England are in classes of 31 or more \u2013 a 20% rise since 2015. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents many secondary school heads, applauded the proposals, saying: \u201cLabour\u2019s plans to recruit and train many more teachers are ambitious, but it is right to identify this as a key priority. \u201cSchools will need more teachers because of a huge increase in the number of secondary school pupils. But that is not the end of the story. More teachers are also needed in order to tackle the fact that far too many pupils are currently being taught in large classes of 31 or more because of funding cuts.\u201d A National Audit Office report in 2017 found that it would cost \u00a36.7bn to return all buildings in England\u2019s 22,000 state schools to \u201csatisfactory or better\u201d condition, with an estimated 60% of buildings dating from before 1976 and in some cases riddled with asbestos. Labour is continuing to make fresh policy announcements, despite party strategists suggesting their message would be pared down to a few key pledges for the final week of the campaign. Alongside Rayner promising to tackle schools standards, the shadow housing secretary, John Healey, is making a separate pledge to tackle rough sleeping. He will promise to create a \u00a3600m modern hostels fund, to create 5,000 additional bed spaces. \u201cRising homelessness shames us all in a country as well-off as ours.

Four constitutional scholars, including three called by Democrats and one called by Republicans, became the first witnesses to testify in a second round of public impeachment hearings beginning on Wednesday and expected to last until late next week. The hearings are the last stop before the proceedings could move to the House floor for a vote to impeach, or not to impeach, Trump, which could take place before a holiday break beginning on 20 December. The committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, said that Trump was the first president to engage in conduct that met all three criteria for impeachment contemplated by the framers of the constitution: abuse of power, betrayal of national security, and interference in the conduct of elections. \u201cNever before has a president engaged in a course of conduct that included all the acts that most concerned the framers,\u201d Nadler said. Nadler was echoed by witnesses including Gerhardt. \u201cIf Congress fails to impeach here, then the impeachment process has lost all meaning, and, along with that, our constitution\u2019s carefully crafted safeguards against the establishment of a king on American soil,\u201d Gerhardt said. The witness called by Republicans, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, offered an opposing view, saying that the impeachment process was being rushed. \u201cWe are all mad and where has it taken us?\u201d Turley said. \u201cWill a slipshod impeachment make us less mad or will it only give an invitation for the madness to follow in every future administration?\u201d As the new high-stakes phase of the impeachment inquiry began, Republicans resorted to procedural objections and high-temperature harangues in an effort to protect Trump. The Republican side lodged a series of rapid-fire interruptions and parliamentary inquiries as the hearing began, interrupting the first witnesses and leading Nadler to resort repeatedly to his gavel. The Georgia congressman Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, accused Democrats of moving to impeach Trump \u201cbecause you just don\u2019t like the guy\u201d. \u201cThe American people is [sic] really gonna look at this and say, \u2018Huh? What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Collins said. In his opening remarks, the ranking member laced into the Democrats for pursuing what he called a \u201csimple railroad job\u201d \u2013 and then mocked the legal scholars sitting before him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got law professors here,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cWhat a start to a party.\u201d Democrats accuse Trump of misusing the powers of his office for personal gain by pressuring Ukraine to manufacture negative headlines about Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s political rival. Trump also stands accused of obstructing a congressional investigation by ordering subordinates not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The charges are laid out in a 300-page report referred to the judiciary committee late on Tuesday by Adam Schiff\u2019s intelligence committee, which has led the process to this point. The judiciary committee has historically been the place where articles of impeachment originate. Wednesday\u2019s hearing is the only one scheduled before the committee so far, with more expected.

Republicans led by Collins tried to upend the hearings on Wednesday by objecting on procedural grounds and foregrounding Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders, including the congressmen Jim Jordan of Ohio and John Ratcliffe of Texas. Also sitting on the judiciary committee is Matt Gaetz of Florida, who made a splash last month when he led a group of Republican lawmakers into the secure basement facility where the impeachment inquiry was proceeding. On Wednesday, Gaetz tore into a witness, the Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan, for a joke she made about the president\u2019s youngest son\u2019s name: \u201cThe constitution says there can be no titles of nobility,\u201d Karlan said, \u201cso while the president can name his son Barron, he cannot make him a baron.\u201d The joke also drew censure from the first lady, Melania Trump, who tweeted: \u201cA minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics.\u201d Late in the hearing, after the first lady\u2019s tweet had been read into the record, Karlan apologized, saying: \u201cIt was wrong of me to do that.\u201d Testimony on Wednesday proceeded under rules familiar from the previous public hearings, with 45-minute chunks of questioning time at the top for the committee leaders and staff, followed by five-minute blocks for each member. Norm Eisen, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, acted as chief questioner for the Democrats. The day\u2019s panel included three witnesses called by Democrats \u2013 the Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, Karlan and Gerhardt \u2013 and one called by Republicans, Turley. \u201cThis is not just about our national interests to protect elections or make sure Ukraine stays strong and fights the Russians so we don\u2019t have to fight them here, but it\u2019s in our national interest to promote democracy worldwide,\u201d Karlan said. In an interview with the Guardian last month, Gerhardt said that in spite of Republican complaints that Trump had not been given sufficient opportunity to defend himself in the impeachment proceedings, the House process had been \u201cextremely fair\u201d. \u201cI think that because the constitution says the House has the sole power to impeach, there\u2019s no role for the president to dictate how he should be involved, who should bring a lawyer and things like that \u2013 it\u2019s left to the discretion of the House, and the House I believe in this situation has been extremely fair,\u201d Gerhardt said.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m off. Scott Murray is presiding over the dregs of Liverpool v Everton, which has been disappointingly goalless for the entire second half (though the MBM will certainly be sizzling). Bye! One more match report for you: here\u2019s David Hytner from Old Trafford: The sight of Marcus Rashford in smooth and pacy flow \u2013 the components of his thrilling technique in sync from first to last \u2013 would once have delighted Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Not here. Mourinho had wanted to mark his return to Manchester United with a fourth win on the spin with Tottenham; to make his biggest statement yet with his new club. Instead, Rashford comprehensively upstaged him, scoring both of the goals in a United victory that ought to have been more emphatic, such was their first-half domination, to provide his current manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, with a sorely needed tonic. Much more here: Pete Lansley was at Molineux to see West Ham\u2019s seventh defeat in 10: The biggest challenge for Wolves on their way to fifth place in the Premier League and the knockout stages of the Europa League has been how well their back-up cast can come in for the regulars. So Patrick Cutrone\u2019s clinching goal four minutes from time, after the Italian was teed up by fellow substitute Pedro Neto, could prove crucial in a month when Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s men play eight games. Much more here: Ben Fisher was our man in Southampton for the Saints\u2019 victory over Norwich: With a handful of minutes left to play, Southampton didn\u2019t know what to do with themselves, unsure whether to eke their way through stoppage time or find a third goal to kill the game. They retreated until they could no more, surviving to see off Norwich City. Such trepidation was understandable given March was the last time they recorded back-to-back league wins. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side held on to savour victory, with first-half goals by Danny Ings and Ryan Bertrand paving the way for victory to delight supporters, who have been starved of these kind of gritty displays for too long. Much more here: Paul Doyle was at the King Power Stadium to watch the Leicester bandwagon keep rolling: It is extraordinary that this is becoming business as usual. For the seventh Premier League game in a row, Jamie Vardy scored and Leicester won. This was their most stuttering performance during that run and Vardy needed a second-half penalty to make the breakthrough against the league\u2019s bottom team before James Maddison netted in stoppage time, but Leicester made sure they took maximum points. That is what they do now. Much more here: The match reports are landing! Here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg\u2019s from Stamford Bridge: Once the tributes to John Terry were done, Chelsea got on with showing their former captain the future. There is no place for sentiment in the heat of battle and Frank Lampard\u2019s academy products made sure Aston Villa\u2019s assistant manager did not enjoy his big homecoming too much, earning three important points thanks to excellent goals from Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount. This was a fine victory for Chelsea after their aberration against West Ham. Mount was back to his enterprising best in midfield and Lampard\u2019s side, sitting pretty in fourth place, did well to regain their poise after gifting Villa a soft equaliser on the stroke of half-time. Chelsea created countless chances during the second half and Terry must have known the visitors, a point above the bottom three, were fortunate not to lose by more. Much more here: In all five of the 7.30pm kick-offs the home side scored two goals and won. The last to finish is at the King Power Stadium, where a dodgy penalty and a slightly lucky 95th-minute goal brought Leicester victory over Watford, who had one shot on target in the entire game (and that in the 95th minute). Chelsea pocket all the points and probably should have won more comfortably. They had 25 shots, which strikes me as rather a lot. A deserved win for Manchester United, who played superbly for periods of this game. They leapfrog Spurs and sit sixth! And that\u2019ll seal it! Maddison tries to push the ball past Mariappa and it deflects of both of the defender\u2019s leg and back to Maddison, who runs into the area before beating Foster! And that\u2019s the last chance at St Mary\u2019s, with the final whistle blowing within seconds. With Everton losing, as it stands Southampton are out of the bottom three! A chance for a 93rd-minute equaliser at St Mary\u2019s Stadium, but Sam Byram hits his first effort into a thicket of legs, and his second wide! The final whistle blows at Molineux, and Wolves pocket the points. With Tottenham losing, as things stand they\u2019re fifth tonight. Save from Kepa! Aston Villa swing the ball into the area, and Douglas Luiz rises highest and gets a header on target, which Kepa dives to push away! \u201cCan someone at Guardian towers please explain why it wasn\u2019t possible yesterday to MBM two matches simultaneously (even though Max Rushden was watching the one not covered), yet tonight you are not only doing four matches, but also the one which has its own MBM?\u201d asks Harvey Mayne. a) manpower issues, I expect; b) five matches, I think you\u2019ll find. Wolves seal the win at Molineux! Good work from Raul Jimenez to carry the ball from the left flank into the area, and it\u2019s then touched back into the path of Cutrone, who tucks it just inside the post from the edge of the box! \u201cCould it be that Jose Mourinho has managed to compress time as we might be witnessing the third (league) game syndrome as opposed to usual third season syndrome?\u201d wonders Admir Pajic. The match stats from Anfield make interesting reading: Liverpool have had four shots on target; Everton have had two shots on target ... and it\u2019s 4-2! I\u2019m a bit late in discovering these completely legal Twitter goal videos, but here are a couple of highlights: What a stop! Willian sends a free-kick dipping towards the top-right corner of the net, but Heaton flings himself to his left and gets his fingertips on it, to send it onto the post! It\u2019s half-time at Anfield. Liverpool have abandoned their recent 2-1 habit, and are instead dealing in multiples of the same scoreline. A cross from the left, and Richarlison completely misses with his attempted diving header but accidentally shoulders it into the far corner! Chance for Tammy Abraham! Willian slides the ball into the box, and Abraham clips it towards, but just past, the far post! Another fabulous counter-attack! From an Everton corner Van Dijk heads away to Man\u00e9, who passes left to Alexander-Arnold. He sprints most of the pitch, ignores the completely-unmarked-throughout Shaqiri on the right and instead nudges infield to Man\u00e9, whose first-time finish is perfection! So Jamie Vardy has now scored in seven successive league games. It\u2019s been an exceptional night of football, I think: controversy, quality, and some brilliant, brilliant goals. Dele Alli\u2019s is the highlight so far. Now that\u2019s a finish! Ings shoots just wide for Southampton and Norwich run down the other end, Tettey plays an excellent pass into the left side of the penalty area, and Pukki runs through before lashing a left-footer inside the near post! You\u2019ve got to worry about Watford now. They have played pretty well thus far, but this team only know one way to react to adversity, and that\u2019s badly. As I type that, though, Vardy is played in and dinks the ball over the onrushing Foster, only for Masina to fling a leg out and deflect it over the bar! Lovren catches 60-yard-wonderpassitis! The Liverpool centre-back pings the ball over the entire Everton team, and Origi emphatically outpaces the Everton defence, controls the ball with a brilliant first touch, and then lifts it over Pickford and into the net! Foster stands his ground, and Vardy sends the ball to his left! The foul, such as it was, was committed by Adam Masina on Jonny Evans. Masina was keeping him at arm\u2019s length, so did indeed touch him, but it was a very odd decision. Now Leicester do have a penalty! Or do they? There\u2019s a long VAR check, and he points to the spot! That is a 100% pure make-up penalty award, because the Foxes should have had one in the first half. That, though, looks harsh. Rashford is tripped by Sissoko as he bursts into the area, and the referee points to the spot! The England forward gets up, brushes himself down, sends Gazzaniga the wrong way and sidefoots his penalty into the net! Everton pull one back! From a short corner Iwobi\u2019s cross deflects into Kean\u2019s path, leaving him with a simple finish! Into the second half, and someone has already turned on the goal tap! Willian crosses, Abraham chests it down, and Mount thumps a right-foot volley into the roof of the net from a yard or two behind the penalty spot! Liverpool stretch their lead! Alexander-Arnold starts the move with an insane 60-yard crossfield pass upfield to Mane, whose pass picks out Shaqiri\u2019s run into the area, and he taps it past Pickford! That\u2019s a fantastic break. \u201cDele, seems he\u2019s a one-off physical specimen,\u201d complains Peter Littley, \u201cshoulders stretch all the way to his elbows.\u201d You can\u2019t seriously be telling me you think that goal should have been disallowed? Some half-time reading for you, just in case you\u2019re at a loose end: History has been made at Stamford Bridge: That\u2019s a lovely break from the league leaders! Mane carries the ball down the left, into Everton\u2019s half, and then curls a fabulous left-footed pass around Keane and perfectly into Origi\u2019s path! Pickford rushes out of goal but loses the race to the ball, the Belgian\u2019s first touch takes it past him, and his second sends it into an empty net! It is half time in all the 7.30 kick-offs, so have yourself a breather. Though they\u2019re just five minutes into things at Anfield, so make it a quick one. Looking back at that Trezeguet goal, it is an absolutely classic hilarious slapstick finish. The Egyptian\u2019s header is completely hopeless, but he actually heads it straight down and into his own shin, and it bounces off his shin and into goal! \u201cThank goodness VAR let that Alli goal stand,\u201d writes Rob Moore. \u201cI\u2019m no fan of either Spurs or Man Utd, but that goal was worthy of all the superlatives. To have it ruled out for a graze on a shirt shoulder would be tragic.\u201d It was a fabulous goal, no doubt about it, and though it might have just brushed a bit of fabric in his shoulder area, it was not a handball or even near one. Chance for Watford! Deulofeu slides the ball across the edge of the area to Hughes, who has a fabulous chance! His shot, though, hits Deeney and goes wide. Another set piece for Southampton, and another goal! It\u2019s a corner from the right, which Long flicks on and Bertrand taps in at the back stick! A cross from the right, and everyone thinks it\u2019s going to be met at the near post, including Trezeguet by the looks of things. It misses two players at the near post, hits Trezeguet and bounces in! And after all that dominance, United are pegged back! And what a finish that is from Dele Alli! It\u2019s a cross from the left that goes through to the right, where a shot is blasted goalwards. De Gea beats it away, but Dele Alli, with his back to goal, gets to it, flicks it up and over his head before spinning and volleying it in! It\u2019s a lovely, lovely goal - but did it brush his upper arm? VAR checks, and (quite rightly, in my opinion) says no! Leicester in VAR penalty controversy! Vardy goes down in the area as Mariappa challenges, but the referee is unimpressed and books the Leicester striker for his troubles. VAR checks it, and it looks very much like a penalty from where I\u2019m sitting, even if Vardy fell over in a slightly unnatural way, but it\u2019s not overturned. At Molineux Jota has a pop from the edge of the area, but Martin remains resolute for West Ham, and pushes the ball away. Chance for Leicester! Lovely build-up as Barnes comes inside from the left, plays a couple of little one-twos and bursts into the area, but when he finally gets round to shooting Foster saves it. At Stamford Bridge, Aston Villa win a corner, then another corner, then another corner. Then corner No4 is cleared and suddenly Chelsea have a 3 v 2 break, but Abraham tries to pass inside to Pulisic rather than go for goal himself, and hits a defender. Meanwhile in Scotland, it\u2019s Aberdeen v Rangers and one of the players has been hit with a pie thrown from the stands. Now Lingard shoots just wide! Tottenham are getting overrun here, and it could be time for a Jose Mourinho first-half substitution special. Gazzaniga got a touch to that Rashford shot, so that goes down in the big bumper book of great stops. Now Rashford pings a lovely shot against the bar from 30 yards! That\u2019s a cracking effort, and United could have this game wrapped up by now. Save! James sends in a low cross from the right and the ball hits a few legs before dropping to Greenwood, whose hard, low effort is well stopped by Gazzaniga! And another one! It\u2019s a lovely ball into the box from Reece James, which tempts the keeper into no-man\u2019s land but lands on Abraham\u2019s head, and he nods it into an empty net! Another set-piece goal! It\u2019s a corner from the left, nobody stops Dendoncker\u2019s bulldozing run into the six-yard box, and he touches it back across goal and inside the post with an outstretched boot! James Ward-Prowse sends a lovely free-kick in from the left wing, and any kind of touch at the near post and the keeper was in big trouble. Ings gets the touch, and in it goes! Some kind of snooker-themed celebration follows. Oooh! Rashford sends a free-kick whistling not far wide of goal at Old Trafford. Meanwhile at Stamford Bridge, Mason Mount meets a right-wing cross but his header is straight at Heaton. At Old Trafford, Winks is booked for taking out Daniel James and sending the youngster flying down the little slope at the edge of the pitch, into Jose Mourinho, and onto the paved pitchside walkway bit. He looks hurt for a while, then he gets up and stops looking hurt. You\u2019ve got to love a good aerial duel photo. Deeney, possibly in this very challenge, has already made Soyuncu aware of his presence, using the traditional inadvertent aerial forearm smash. United aren\u2019t just leading Spurs, they\u2019re roaring at them with real vim every time they get the ball. It\u2019s all extremely encouraging for the home side. The ball breaks to Rashford on the left-hand corner of the penalty area. He carries it forward a couple of yards and then lashes a shot towards the near post, which bounces unkindly just before Gazzaniga, who fingertips it into the post and in! Perez gets another chance at the King Power, and this time his shot goes so wide one of his team-mates manages to stop it going out for a throw-in. Ludicrous miss! Leicester should be ahead in the third minute, after Vardy roars into space down the left, cuts inside and taps the ball to Perez, who is running unmolested into the penalty area. He need only pick his spot, and the spot he picks is towards the back of the stand! Peeeeeep! The Leicester and Chelsea matches get under way on time. Everyone else seems to be lagging behind. OK, our players are in their tunnels. Time for action (nearly)! Scott Murray is all over the Merseyside derby, by the way. You can find his liveblog here: Here are the teams from Anfield, where Liverpool spring a surprise by dropping Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino to the bench for the derby. Xherdan Shaqiri starts his first game since January, and Divock Origi and Adam Lallana both also come in. Everton, by contrast, are unchanged: Liverpool: Adrian, Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Milner, Shaqiri, Mane, Origi. Subs: Keita, Firmino, Salah, Gomez, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kelleher. Everton: Pickford, Sidibe, Holgate, Mina, Keane, Digne, Iwobi, Davies, Sigurdsson, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Baines, Walcott, Tosun, Schneiderlin, Bernard, Kean, Lossl. Referee: Mike Dean. Hayden Mullins, Watford\u2019s caretaker manager, has a brief pre-match chat: It\u2019s been a whirlwind couple of days. We\u2019ve been setting up quite a bit, loads to do, but they\u2019ve been very good. it\u2019s taken a lot of preparation, trying to set up in a positive way. We want to come here and put on a good performance. Any game in the Premier League is tough. We\u2019ve got a gameplan, we\u2019ve got a job we\u2019re going to try to do. We can do that by pulling in the same direction, and hopefully we can get a result. It doesn\u2019t look like Tom Heaton is enjoying his warm-up very much: Here\u2019s a bit of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s pre-match chat: There\u2019s a couple of injuries, and Scott\u2019s back fit to play so that was an easy decision. Ashley Young\u2019s very important for us. He\u2019s one of the leaders and it\u2019s important to have experience in these big games. Mason\u2019s a young boy but he\u2019s getting his chance now. I\u2019ve been waiting to see him in the Premier League, and of course it\u2019s a big stage against a big team, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s ready. \u201cI\u2019m a teacher in Montreal, Canada. I\u2019m also a massive Liverpool fan,\u201d writes Pierre-Yves. \u201cI took the day off to watch the Merseyside derby. Does this make me a bad human or a bad teacher or both?\u201d I\u2019d say it doesn\u2019t give us quite enough evidence to be sure on either count, but it does provide a decent clue. Sue Smith, who is on punditry duties at Molineux, has the most incredible hair. There\u2019s lots of it, but it doesn\u2019t move at all. It\u2019s like a wavy bicycle helmet. She\u2019s got an absolutely fantastic hairdo history, very much worth an image search. Watford come up against one of their many former managers at the King Power Stadium. Leicester are unexpectedly without Ben Chilwell, who is replaced at left-back by Christian Fuchs. Watford also make one change, with their interim manager Hayden Mullins bringing Troy Deeney in and leaving Jose Holebas out (apparently he\u2019s injured). That suggests a switch back to four at the back, with a Deulofeu-Deeney-Sarr front three that might be genuinely dangerous (against lesser teams, anyway). At Molineux the managers have only gently massaged their teams. Romain Saiss returns from suspension for the home side, replacing Max Kilman, while West Ham bring in the recently goal-shy Sebastian Haller, who has scored just once in his last 11 games, for the injured Michail Antonio. Meanwhile in Southampton, Ralph Hasenhuttl gives Shane Long only his second league start of the season, dropping Michael Obafemi to the bench. Norwich stick with the starting XI which drew 2-2 against Arsenal. Quite a lot of team changing going on. At Old Trafford Manchester United bring in four, with Scott McTominay returning from injury and Mason Greenwood making his first league start of the campaign. Jesse Lingard and Ashley Young are also in. Tottenham make two changes, with Harry Winks and Lucas Moura replacing Tanguy Ndombele and Eric Dier. Amazon do a sweep around the grounds, providing evidence that they have basically hired every football pundit known to man. The team sheets have all been handed in, and here are all the names you need: Chelsea v Aston Villa Chelsea: Arrizabalaga, James, Christensen, Zouma, Azpilicueta, Kante, Kovacic, Willian, Mount, Pulisic, Abraham. Subs: Jorginho, Caballero, Giroud, Hudson-Odoi, Batshuayi, Tomori, Emerson Palmieri. Aston Villa: Heaton, Elmohamady, Konsa, Mings, Targett, McGinn, Nakamba, Hourihane, Trezeguet, Wesley, Grealish. Subs: Taylor, Douglas Luiz, Lansbury, Engels, Jota, Nyland, Kodjia. Referee: Chris Kavanagh. Leicester v Watford Leicester: Schmeichel, Ricardo Pereira, Evans, Soyuncu, Fuchs, Ndidi, Perez, Tielemans, Maddison, Barnes, Vardy. Subs: Justin, Morgan, Albrighton, Ward, Iheanacho, Choudhury, Praet. Watford: Foster, Femenia, Mariappa, Cathcart, Masina, Doucoure, Capoue, Hughes, Sarr, Deeney, Deulofeu. Subs: Gomes, Chalobah, Gray, Quina, Success, Dele-Bashiru, Foulquier. Referee: Craig Pawson. Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur Man Utd: de Gea, Wan Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Young, McTominay, Fred, James, Lingard, Rashford, Greenwood. Subs: Mata, Andreas Pereira, Romero, Shaw, Garner, Tuanzebe, Williams. Tottenham Hotspur: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Sanchez, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Winks, Sissoko, Lucas Moura, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Rose, Dier, Lo Celso, Foyth, Eriksen, Ndombele, Austin. Referee: Paul Tierney. Southampton v Norwich Southampton: McCarthy, Cedric, Stephens, Bednarek, Bertrand, Djenepo, Ward-Prowse, Hojbjerg, Redmond, Ings, Long. Subs: Yoshida, Adams, Romeu, Boufal, Obafemi, Gunn, Danso. Norwich: Krul, Aarons, Zimmermann, Godfrey, Byram, Amadou, Trybull, Cantwell, McLean, Hernandez, Pukki. Subs: Vrancic, Lewis, Emi, Stiepermann, Fahrmann, Tettey, Srbeny. Referee: Kevin Friend. Wolverhampton v West Ham Wolverhampton: Rui Patricio, Dendoncker, Coady, Saiss, Doherty, Neves, Joao Moutinho, Jonny, Traore, Jimenez, Jota. Subs: Bennett, Pedro Neto, Cutrone, Ruddy, Ruben Vinagre, Kilman, Ashley-Seal. West Ham: Martin, Fredericks, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Snodgrass, Noble, Rice, Fornals, Felipe Anderson, Haller. Subs: Zabaleta, Yarmolenko, Roberto, Sanchez, Masuaku, Ajeti, Holland. Referee: Andre Marriner. Look who\u2019s back in town: Tuck in your bib, you\u2019re about to salivate. We have six top-flight fixtures on our menu this evening/morning/whatever-it-is-where-you-are, including a Merseyside derby (which gets its own liveblog elsewhere, and kicks off 45 minutes after every other game, but we\u2019ll still be monitoring). The teams first, third and fourth in the table all play at home, with Leicester hosting managerless crisis club Watford and Chelsea welcoming Aston Villa, while Southampton, having seen off the Hornets and landed a killer blow on their briefly-manager Quique Sanches Flores in their last outing, play their second consecutive win-or-bust bottom-three humdinger as Norwich come to town. In other news Jos\u00e9 Mourinho returns to Old Trafford with Tottenham, and the division\u2019s bottom two sides (on alphabetical order) play at Molineux, where it\u2019s Wolves v West Ham. Frankly there isn\u2019t a dud among them. So welcome. Sit yourself down, strap yourself in, and prepare for blast off! Kick-offs: 7.30pm GMT, 8.15pm GMT at Anfield.",

      "bodyText": "The sight of Marcus Rashford in smooth and pacy flow, the components of his technique in perfect sync, would once have delighted Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Not here. Mourinho had wanted to mark his return to Manchester United with a fourth win out of four with Tottenham; to make his biggest statement yet with his new club. Instead, Rashford comprehensively upstaged him, scoring both of the goals in a United victory that ought to have been more emphatic, such was their first-half dominance, to provide his current manager, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, with a much needed tonic. Solskj\u00e6r had overseen United\u2019s worst start to a season since 1988 but, not for the first time at this venue, his team raised their levels against a rival with pedigree. It had been a similar story in the win over Chelsea and the draw against Liverpool. Rashford was unplayable at times, particularly in the first 30 minutes, when he scored once and might have had more. He saw the Spurs goalkeeper, Paulo Gazzaniga, tip one vicious long-range shot against the crossbar. He was a threat for most of the evening and, after a moment of sorcery from Dele Alli had temporarily hauled Spurs level, Rashford earned and converted the penalty that proved to be the winner. The statistics show that Rashford now has 12 goals for United this season, nine of them in the Premier League, and he has certainly hit a rich vein of form. Since the middle of October he has scored nine in 10 at club level. Yet it was his all-round game that propelled United to a result that lifted them to sixth in the table; his positivity and directness; the feeling, to borrow a phrase from Solskj\u00e6r, that he was playing in his own back yard. \u201cDoubters just spur me on,\u201d Rashford tweeted after the game, which set a few tongues wagging. Was it a dig at Mourinho, with whom he did not always see eye to eye? Whatever the interpretation, Rashford has got United feeling a bit better about themselves before Saturday\u2019s derby at Manchester City and he was not the only plus point for the team. Scott McTominay, back from injury after one light training session with the reserves, was authoritative in midfield alongside Fred and behind Jesse Lingard, who made things happen from the No 10 role. Solskj\u00e6r would describe McTominay as \u201cundroppable\u201d. Mourinho\u2019s presence at a stadium where he spent two and a half seasons was always going to be a sideshow and, although he had described United as a \u201cclosed chapter\u201d for him, he might still have wanted to hear a chant from the home crowd as acknowledgement for his efforts. That did not happen. Instead, the United support serenaded Solskj\u00e6r, with their first songs about him following Rashford\u2019s early breakthrough. Lingard robbed Davinson S\u00e1nchez and, when the ball broke to Rashford on the left-hand corner of the area, he unloaded a shot that was designed to bounce awkwardly in front of Gazzaniga. The Argentinian could only help it in off the inside of his near post \u2013 a grisly error. Mourinho had restored Lucas Moura to his front four and preferred Moussa Sissoko to Eric Dier in midfield \u2013 another attack-minded move \u2013 but it was United who pressed with the greater intensity for much of the first half.

And I\u2019m sorry about that, and it was one of the things that we did get wrong.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked a similar question about the benefits cap, she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will have done as someone in collective responsibility in government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And asked another similar question on health reforms that allow NHS contracts to be put out to private tender, she responded:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I was in government, so I will have voted for them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Given those facts, Neil asked, why would people believe her when she says she wants to roll back those policies? Swinson told him:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, we\u2019re setting out what our plan is for the future. We did spend five years in a coalition government where clearly we didn\u2019t win every battle against the Conservatives. We fought many battles and we did win battles for more money for schools, for more money for the poorest pupils, for managing to cut tax for the lowest paid, to introduce same-sex marriage. There\u2019s many things that I\u2019m very proud of and where we made a difference.</p> \n   <p>But, of course, there were things where we didn\u2019t win those battles and I\u2019m sorry about that. But it was not a Liberal Democrat government, it was a coalition government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Neil told her 240,000 people had their benefits cut because she went along with the bedroom tax. Would she like to apologise to them, she was asked.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yes, I am sorry that I did that. It was not the right policy and we should have stopped it. And our manifesto, as our previous manifesto, makes clear that that should be scrapped. And we have identified the money to put into it.</p> \n   <p>And not only the bedroom tax, but scrapping the two-child limit, which was introduced by the Conservatives, which we did stop in government, but was introduced by the Conservative majority government after 2015.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if austerity was a \u201cnecessary evil or a terrible mistake\u201d, Swinson said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Clearly, too much was cut. Clearly, not enough was raised from taxation and, certainly, the investment should have kicked in earlier in terms of more borrowing for capital investment.</p> \n   <p>Equally, we implemented pretty much what Labour\u2019s proposed spending plans were from the 2010 election. And I\u2019m not going to say that, in a financial crisis, it was going to be possible \u2013 with the deficit at the level that it was in 2010 \u2013 not to make any cuts at all.</p> \n   <p>Some cuts were necessary. But the shape of those cuts and certainly the balance between cuts and tax rises, I don\u2019t think was the right balance. I think we should have been raising more from taxation. And that\u2019s something which we argued for and, obviously, that was not one of the battles that we always won during coalition.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T18:53:26.967Z\">at 6.53pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7e7ce8f086f4ddd16a928\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T18:06:27.883Z\">6.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump has concluded a two-day visit to the UK without doing anything likely to jeopardise the chances of his close ally Boris Johnson winning the general election a week tomorrow. </strong>Given Trump\u2019s toxic reputation in the UK, Tory strategists had been concerned that any form of endorsement might be counter-productive. But yesterday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/andrew-sparrow-election-briefing-trump-trumps-campaigning\">Trump\u2019s comments about the NHS and a trade deal</a> were not unhelpful to the Conservatives and today the proceedings at the Nato summit were largely overshadowed by a puerile row about whether Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, were laughing at Trump behind his back at a reception last night. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de7c3118f08c347d7ee96d2#block-5de7c3118f08c347d7ee96d2\">Johnson denied this (implausibly) </a>and said it was nonsense to suggest that he did not take Trump seriously. But, at a news conference at the end of the summit, he was careful to distance himself from the man who once dubbed him \u201cBritain[\u2019s] Trump\u201d because the two are supposedly ideologically aligned.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de7c4d88f08c347d7ee96f2#block-5de7c4d88f08c347d7ee96f2\"> Johnson sidestepped an invitation to say anything positive about Trump personally</a>, and even avoided mentioning him by name. This might look like the start of a cooling in the relationship, but Trump understands perfectly well how elections work and, elsewhere in the press conference, there was a hint that behind the scenes the alliance is as strong as ever. That came when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/04/boris-johnson-suggests-huawei-role-in-5g-might-harm-uk-security\">Johnson suggested that he might end up siding with US demands to exclude the Chinese firm Huawei from building Britain\u2019s 5G networks.</a> When Theresa May was prime minister she was reportedly planning a less Washington-friendly approach; according to a leak from the national security council, she was planning to give Huawei access to non-contentious parts of the 5G network.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/trump-describes-trudeau-as-two-faced-over-nato-hot-mic-video\">Trump denounced Trudeau as \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and left the summit venue earlier than expected, cancelling a planned press conference, after apparently being riled by the news that fellow leaders were having a joke at his expense last night.</a> </strong>His abrupt departure dominated the headlines, overshadowing the otherwise modest achievements of a low-key meeting held to mark Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary.

In other words, the EU does not have to reopen these arguments again.</p> \n  <p>The leaked document should be read as the EU getting its house in order to avoid any procedural snarl-ups in Brussels, thus avoiding blame if talks fail. </p> \n  <p>Missing from the document is any mention of no-deal (the EU thinks this is less likely and that its plans are in order) or a renegotiation.

Corbyn gave the right answer - so much so that Johnson resorted a few days later to claiming that, when he had been asked about the monarchy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/29/general-election-tories-threaten-channel-4-after-climate-debate-ice-stunt-live-news?page=with:block-5de106ec8f08dcf251b4b68f#block-5de106ec8f08dcf251b4b68f\">he had actually been speaking about the monarch (ie, the Queen).</a></p> \n  <p>But today Corbyn hasn\u2019t had such a good outing on royal family territory. In an interview with ITV\u2019s <strong>Julia Etchingham</strong> he was asked if he watched the Queen\u2019s speech on Christmas day. He said that he normally did, although the full exchange suggests otherwise. </p> \n  <p>ITV has sent out the transcript of the exchange.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>JE: </strong>Talk to us a bit about Christmas in the Corbyn household.

Which would be better for their campaign, is essentially the question. Fighting it out with Johnson or extracting a promise from an incoming PM Corbyn? Chris, Renfrewshire</em></p> \n  <p>In the election campaign so far, the SNP has been careful not to entertain any \u201cplan B\u201d talk, should either Labour or Tories refuse to grant the s30 order that Holyrood requires to legally hold a second independence referendum. You may recall that an attempt to debate a plan B was swiftly quashed at SNP conference in October, and Sturgeon herself has insisted that a second indyref must meet the \u201cgold standard\u201d internationally.</p> \n  <p>Instead, SNP politicians throw the question back to the other parties: who are you to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people? It will depend on next week\u2019s results how powerful that argument is going to be: Sturgeon has described SNP successes at the ballot box as \u201can instruction to Westminster\u201d. </p> \n  <p>It\u2019s certainly clear already that Labour don\u2019t want to be seen as anti-democratic, so they are willing to entertain a pro-independence mandate at the next Holyrood elections in 2021 as reason to grant a s30 order. But Johnson has said that he\u2019ll refuse under any circumstances. I think both are good for the campaign now, since they both refuse to grant it next year, which is what Sturgeon says she wants, so it fits well with the narrative of Westminster frustrating Scottish democracy.</p> \n  <p><strong>Thanks for all your questions today </strong></p> \n  <p>Next up will be Guardian political correspondent, Kate Proctor.

If you\u2019d like to ask a question in the comments please @Libby or <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ask_us_a_question_snp\">via our form</a>. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why has reformation of the Gender Recognition Act, present in the 2017 manifesto, been removed in the 2019 manifesto? Is there any explanation or reassurance for trans and non-binary people in Scotland who are alarmed by the signal that this withdrawal sends? Will the results of the publicly funded consultation carried out to gather information for the planned reformation be made available to the taxpayer? Sophie, 29, Edinburgh, software developer</em></p> \n  <p>Thanks Sophie, a number of people raised this concern after the manifesto was published, and the Scottish government\u2019s equalities minister Shirley-Anne Somerville sought to reassure them, pointing out that she would be publishing a draft bill following further consultation by the end of the year. But it\u2019s certainly true that this issue has caused a great deal of controversy within the party, with Sturgeon facing a significant amount of push-back on her plans to proceed with a devolved gender recognition act, aimed at streamlining the process by which a transgender person gets legal recognition. The fact that the issue has gone out for consultation twice has alarmed many in the LGBTI community, who saw this as a roll-back from a more solid earlier commitment. But the strength of feeling around the proposals, and the concerns from many women within the party who feel that the impact on equalities legislation and on women-only spaces in particular has not been taken into account , meant that the SG had little option. </p> \n  <p><em>Q: This election my vote will go to a party that will legalise cannabis. What is the SNP policy on this? Gavin, Dumfriesshire</em></p> \n  <p>Worth noting first of all that drugs laws are reserved to Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon has said that devolution of drug laws is one her key demands should another party seek SNP support for their minority government after the election and the SNP\u2019s manifesto calls for this and - pending devolution - that the UK government should introduce a supervised drug consumption facility in Glasgow. Delegates at the SNP\u2019s autumn conference in Aberdeen in October also backed the decriminalisation of controlled drugs, branding the Misuse Of Drugs Act, which dates back to 1971, as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. As you\u2019ll probably know, Scotland is dealing with unprecedented numbers of drug related deaths, and this resolution was linked to attempts to open a safe drugs consumption room in Glasgow, which has so far been blocked by the home office.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What is SNP stand on more support for veterans in Scotland? Anonymous, disabled veteran from service in the Gulf War, Dunfermline</em></p> \n  <p> I know that the next Scottish census will include a question about veteran status, a significant change prompted by the British Legion\u2019s campaigning to make it easier to identify and support veterans. I believe that the SNP government was the first UK administration to make this change and also the first to appoint a Veterans\u2019 Commissioner in the autumn of 2018. Practically, there\u2019s support for getting into employment and also for veterans requiring social care, the Scottish Government has exempted the War Disablement Pension from assessment of income \u2013 meaning that veterans get the help they need and keep the full value of this pension.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7a9488f080aa4db53b3b8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:05:40.757Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: How would a border work between independent-but-in-EU Scotland and out-of-EU England. Would it be a hard border, like the feared one in Scotland? Jack, 29, works in insurance, St Albans</em></p> \n  <p>That\u2019s going to be one of the looming questions should there be a second independence referendum campaign, and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you as much clarity as I\u2019d like at this stage. In 2014, the yes campaign was able to argue that there would be no border between a newly independent Scotland and the rest of the UK because both would remain within the EU. Not so now of course. On The Andrew Marr Show recently, Sturgeon refused to rule out a hard border, saying: \u201cWe need to see how things play out and what the final relationship between the UK and the EU will be,\u201d and adding that Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit was not an inevitability. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAs that picture clarifies, I will be honest with the people of Scotland but that opens a situation where Scotland\u2019s best interests depend on being independent and in charge of our own future and I don\u2019t want borders.\u201d </p> \n  <p><em>Q: How far into nationalism is the SNP prepared to go? We\u2019ve seen the effects of nationalism in Italy, amongst the far-right in Germany and with the EDL in England as well as with Trump in North America, for but a few examples. Do you consider it a potentially dangerous path to travel? Tim Eslip, middle-aged professional, England</em><br></p> \n  <p>The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was questioned on precisely this at the Edinburgh Fringe festival this August, so I think it\u2019s helpful to reproduce her answers at length, since it was the most comprehensive I\u2019ve heard her on this in a while. Asked about the types of nationalism you refer to, she told the audience during an interview with Matt Forde that the \u201ccivic nationalism\u201d of the SNP was \u201con another spectrum altogether\u201d from \u201cfar right, racist, insular movements\u201d seen in other parts of the world. </p> \n  <p>Asked by comedian Matt Forde about Scottish nationalism, Sturgeon said: \u201cA lot of the regimes called nationalist today are not countries striving to be independent, because often they already are, but are based on some kind of racial exceptionalism, or superiority often very illiberal and oppressive of minorities, and Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether</p> \n  <p>Questioned specifically about a protester who had been pictured on the Royal Mile with an \u201cEngland get out of Scotland\u201d banner, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe person with that banner does not speak for the SNP. That kind of sentiment has no place in Scotland. You can\u2019t get to a situation in any party where you say we\u2019ll never attract the wrong kind of person but you can be absolutely vehement and resolute about calling it out. The people who put up that banner, I don\u2019t want them in the SNP.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:16:26.233Z\">at 1.16pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7ad7b8f08c347d7ee9603\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:59:48.114Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from Bloomberg\u2019s <strong>Sebastian Salek.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sebastiansalek/status/1202164071698718723\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">John Major is naaaht messing about this morning<br><br>*MAJOR: BREXIT THE WORST FOREIGN POLICY DECISION EVER<br>*MAJOR: JOHNSON'S BREXIT DEAL IS FLIMSY AND SHABBY<br>*MAJOR: HARD BREXIT DEAL RISKS SCOTLAND, N IRELAND LEAVING UK<br>*MAJOR: COMPREHENSIVE TRADE DEAL CAN'T BE ACHIEVED WITHIN A YEAR</p>\u2014 Sebastian Salek (@sebastiansalek) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebastiansalek/status/1202164071698718723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 4, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>I have not seen the text of his speech, but will post more on it when I can track down a copy.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7accf8f087bedab3e034e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:58:10.379Z\">12.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s more on the economics of an independent Scotland ... </p> \n  <p><em>Q: Given that GERS (Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland) for 2018-9 shows a deficit of \u00a312.6bn or 7.7% of Scottish GDP, how would an independent Scotland pay for the extra spending proposals in the SNP manifesto or even current levels of spending. Richard, Australia</em></p> \n  <p>Thanks Richard - that\u2019s precisely the question that the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which published an analysis of the SNP\u2019s manifesto spending pledges in the Scotsman this morning, asked. As others have noted, the SNP manifesto was notably slim on costings, and associate director of the IFS David Phillips suggests that this may be because the spending plans would necessitate more, not less, austerity for Scotland if it were to become independent. As I set out in an earlier post on this live blog, Phillips points out that pledges including increasing NHS spending across the UK by \u00a3136 per head to close the gap with Scotland, an end to the two-child benefit cap and an increased national living wage, would require significant outlay at a time when an independent Scotland was also starting out with a serious budget deficit.</p> \n  <p>Phillips adds: \u201cPursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manifesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways ... in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more not less austerity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The SNP\u2019s own growth commission report on the economics of independence, which came out in 2018, proposed that the inherited deficit be cut by growing the economy rather than cutting spending. It also said it should delay launching its own currency and introduce tax cuts for migrants. Analysing the report at the time, the IFS commended it for being honest about \u201cthe challenging public finance position an independent Scotland would start life with\u201d.</p> \n  <p>However, it went on to dispute claims that its economic strategy would end austerity, suggesting it in fact implied cuts in spending and benefits equal to 4% of GDP over a 10-year period. </p> \n  <p>Questioned about Scotland\u2019s notional deficit by Andrew Neil last week, which stands at 7% according to current figures, and whether it could hinder renewed membership of the EU (EU members\u2019 budget deficits must not exceed 3% of GDP) Nicola Sturgeon argued: \u201cOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally through growing our economy faster which remaining in the EU or returning to the EU helps us to do.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:35:41.556Z\">at 1.35pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7aafe8f08b5a1928d94a8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:52:08.479Z\">12.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Richard Partington</strong> has been factchecking the John McDonnell claim that a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year.</p> \n  <p>Here is his verdict.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nationalisation could save households money that would otherwise go to private investors, but is reliant on the smooth execution of Labour\u2019s plan.

What would the cost of setting up the structure of an independent Scotland be and where will the newly independent Scotland get the money? Robert, 68, retired, Edinburgh</em><br></p> \n  <p>Hi Robert, you\u2019ll recall this was a much-disputed area during the 2014 campaign. A Treasury report in May of that year estimated the costs of setting up an independent state to be around \u00a31.5bn - including \u00a3750m to create a new tax regime and \u00a3400m for computers and IT for welfare - but this was vigorously challenged by the then first minister, Alex Salmond. Prof Patrick Dunleavy of LSE was quoted by both the UK and Scottish governments as the leading expert on transition costs, and he suggested that \u201cstart-up costs\u201d would come in at around \u00a3200m but then a further \u00a3900m would be required for tax and welfare infrastructure. Nicola Sturgeon confirmed in September this year that she had instructed civil servants to work on a second white paper to convince voters of the case for independence, although it should be noted that the original version relied heavily on projected oil revenues which have since plummeted.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: Would an independent Scotland find it easier to join Efta rather than the EU, which would give an independent Scotland many of the benefits which eg. Norway has, but also allow us to opt out of CFP and the CAP? </em><br></p> \n  <p> While the SNP has explored the possibility of rejoining the single market via the European Free Trade Association, with the option of returning to full EU membership later, the response from other member states is mixed. In 2017, Iceland\u2019s foreign minister warned that Scotland could not apply to join Efta until after it had fully separated from the UK, but in the same year Norway said it would keep an open mind to Scottish membership. </p> \n  <p> Accession to Efta is seen as more straightforward than rejoining the EU, but it is not certain that Scotland would then be allowed into the European Economic Area, membership of which would still have to be agreed by the EU. New members of Efta must be accepted unanimously by the existing four members: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. </p> \n  <p>Since the Brexit vote, there have been some encouraging noises from EU officials that an independent Scotland could automatically join the EU or inherit the UK\u2019s membership after it leaves. But in 2017, Jacqueline Minor, the European commission\u2019s head of representation in the UK, warned that Scotland would need to formally apply after leaving the UK, although it could be fast-tracked because it already complies with EU rules and regulations.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:03:59.944Z\">at 1.03pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7a0ad8f08b5a1928d9403\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:39:21.768Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">John McDonnell's speech and Q&amp;A - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"072a8ef4-44da-4a50-8d09-c8c9d253754e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uDxZ9t9USwE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>With the possible exception of Nicola Sturgeon, <strong>John McDonnell</strong> is probably the stand-out media performer of this campaign. His speeches always contain an essential seriousness, but he can also handle media questions without sounding evasive or tetchy as soon as they turn hostile. This wasn\u2019t the most newsy speech of the campaign, and it will be overshadowed by events at that Nato conference later, but he conveyed a positive message and he took quite a large number of critical questions without tripping up. Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell refused to accept Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks, saying the US president had a \u201cpassing relationship with reality and truth\u201d.</strong> Asked if he thought Trump was lying when he said this yesterday, McDonnell all but said yes. He replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All the evidence that we\u2019ve seen has demonstrated objectively that it is.</p> \n   <p>Donald Trump has a passing relationship with reality and truth sometimes. I believe in one instance claimed he didn\u2019t know what the initials NHS stood for, so the reality is the evidence is there and the anxiety that we have about the NHS under Boris Johnson regime and his relationship with trump causes us extreme concern.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He joked about a Corbyn government having difficult relations with Trump. </strong>Asked to respond to what Trump said yesterday about being able to work with Corbyn if he became PM, McDonnell said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s encouraging to know that we can maintain a good working relationship with the people of America in the future - [McDonnell paused] after possibly another election.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The line about the election prompted laughter from the audience. McDonnell then went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Obviously, Jeremy will work with leaders all over the world including Donald Trump and we will ensure that whatever happens in the future we will look after the interests of our own people as well as other across the globe.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>McDonnell said Labour would announce details of its \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d programme before polling day. </strong>(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de79a678f08f78465b4ab8b#block-5de79a678f08f78465b4ab8b\">11.40am.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He described compensating the Waspi (Women Against State Pensions Inequality) women as being akin to bailing out the banks.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/04/general-election-tories-juggle-trump-nato-and-campaigning-live?page=with:block-5de79d048f08fe0afc2ac7f3#block-5de79d048f08fe0afc2ac7f3\">11.52am.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested the extent of poverty in the UK was incompatible with the values of Christianity.</strong> In his speech he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On Tuesday a new Shelter report also found 135,000 children will be without a home this Christmas.</p> \n   <p>On the same day an analysis by the Equality Trust showed the UK\u2019s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest 13 million.

You can share your questions with us via <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ask_us_a_question_snp\">our form here</a>.</p> \n  <p>Many of you have asked questions about the state of education in Scotland. </p> \n  <p>Q: <em>Does Ms Sturgeon recognise the pledge, \u201cJudge me on my record for education\u201d? As she has not narrowed the attainment gap why should parents and children give her more than an F? Iain RF MacIain, 45, working in education, Scottish Borders</em></p> \n  <p>Interesting you mention that today \u2013 you no doubt saw the latest Pisa report yesterday, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago, and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012. A professor of education at Edinburgh University, Lindsay Paterson, described children\u2019s reading performance as \u201cstagnating around mediocrity\u201d, arguing that the reason the attainment gap on reading had narrowed was because middle-class kids were getting worse. The education secretary, John Swinney, described the results as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d, while accepting there were still challenges. The problem is that this is just one element of the overall picture, as you\u2019ll know if you work in education yourself. </p> \n  <p>Another serious concern is teacher shortages. In rural Scotland we have some of the most severe shortages in Europe; also the numbers of days lost to stress-related illness for teachers who are in post; and worries about availability of subjects to children taking high school exams, with reports of kids travelling for hours each week to access teaching in their chosen subject which is only available in another school in their council area.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p><em>Q: Why don\u2019t the SNP stand candidates in England or Wales? From the reactions to debate it seems they\u2019d win a lot of people over. Levi, 20, student, Caerphilly<br></em></p> \n  <p> As a nationalist party whose primary aim is Scottish independence, the SNP has only ever fielded candidates in Scotland, but it\u2019s a question that often comes up \u2013 particularly after viewers have been impressed by Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s performance in UK-wide televised debates. </p> \n  <p>Indeed, the question of whether non-residents of Scotland could vote for the SNP featured in a list of most searched-for terms provided by Google after Sturgeon impressed voters across the UK in the first leaders\u2019 debate of the 2015 general election campaign.</p> \n  <p>And the SNP is well aware of the usefulness of appealing to voters elsewhere: the question of whether Labour could make a post-election pact with the SNP has become one of the key debates of the general election \u2013 but also one of the Conservatives\u2019 main attack lines.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T13:01:44.436Z\">at 1.01pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de7a32d8f08fe0afc2ac85e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/libbybrooks\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:29:12.098Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m Libby Brooks, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, and will be answering your questions on the SNP manifesto, policies and campaign today.

Change that will help tackle that burden of rising living costs. How can we do that? After nearly 10 years during which it\u2019s seemed impossible that anything might change. I\u2019ll tell you where it starts. It starts with adopting the principle of \u201cdo no harm\u201d. \u201cAt least don\u2019t make things worse.\u201d So we\u2019ll scrap universal credit, stopping its rollout and putting in place a package of fixes while we design a replacement that\u2019s fit for purpose.</p> \n   <p>Of course that won\u2019t help everyone. We need to raise wages across the country so people don\u2019t need to rely on universal credit. That starts with our real living wage: \u00a310 an hour, straight away, for everyone over 16. An average pay rise of up to \u00a36,000 a year. A pay rise for seven and a half million people.</p> \n   <p>For public sector workers, it\u2019s a boost of 5% in the first year of a Labour government ... </p> \n   <p>Our proposals to bring the major energy companies into public ownership has been independently estimated to save an average of \u00a3142 a year, while our proposals to retrofit almost every home in the country would slash the average household bill by over \u00a3400 a year. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T12:06:32.425Z\">at 12.06pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de795378f08f78465b4ab4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T11:20:42.582Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>McDonnell says many people have had problems with the cost of living over the last decade.

It\u2019s fair to say that STV\u2019s debate between the Scottish party leaders \u2013 excluding Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, bizarrely \u2013 was rather a shout-fest, although it was refreshing to see <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> properly interrogated on Holyrood policy, which seldom happens when she takes part in the UK-wide debates. But of course that\u2019s because education, health and so on are devolved \u2013 so while it was good to see those areas covered, they are not technically relevant to a UK general election. </p> \n  <p>The format, which really felt its lack of a live audience, involved a series of questions and interrogations of each leader by the other politicians, rather than by the host, Colin Mackay, and so lent itself to people (men, Sturgeon was the only woman there) talking across one another.</p> \n  <p>At one point I looked up from my notes to see the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 <strong>Jackson Carlaw</strong> shouting at the Lib Dems\u2019 <strong>Willie Rennie</strong>, Rennie shouting at Labour\u2019s <strong>Richard Leonard</strong>, and Sturgeon standing there with her arms folded like a teacher who has already tried multiple timeouts with the kids and is now just waiting for the lunch bell to go.</p> \n  <p>Some interesting points: Tory leader Carlaw urged viewers to \u201clend us your vote to stop indyref2\u201d \u2013 clearly the anti-independence message is working as well for the Scottish Tories, if not better than getting Brexit done. Challenged on Boris Johnson\u2019s previous remarks about Muslim women and gay men, he admitted they were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, but insisted he would judge him on his performance in office. Carlaw and Rennie attacked Labour\u2019s \u201cclear as mud\u201d position on Brexit, mocking Leonard for being \u201cconstantly overruled\u201d by Jeremy Corbyn. Leonard struggled to answer the charge that voters didn\u2019t trust Corbyn to stand up for the union.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon failed to offer a plan B if a new Tory (or Labour) government refused her demand for the powers to hold a second independence referendum next year. Challenged on putting independence before public services, her defence of the latest Pisa report, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012, was weak. But at least it prompted the zingiest response of the debate from Rennie: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you are telling me that a line on a chart going down is optimistic, then the problem of numeracy in your government goes right to the top.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d1cd01290ce7d0daff8ce355c4ab5e5562c0fa\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d1cd01290ce7d0daff8ce355c4ab5e5562c0fa/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left to right: Scottish Labour party leader Richard Leonard, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, STV\u2019s Colin Mackay, Scottish Conservatives leader Jackson Carlaw and Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, ahead of the the first Scottish TV election debate last night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left to right: the Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, the SNP first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, STV\u2019s Colin Mackay, the Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, and the Scottish Lib Dem leader, Willie Rennie.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Devlin/STV/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T10:14:50.014Z\">at 10.14am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de77e188f08bf648cb2389f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T09:38:09.868Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson, or whoever controls his Twitter account, has just posted a picture of the PM meeting a blonde-haired admirer yesterday.

Now, the Labour party he leads is campaigning on a manifesto promise to maintain the UK\u2019s commitment to Nato.</p> \n  <p>Responding to suggestions that Corbyn was ambivalent over Nato, which many consider a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s national defence, Gardiner retorted: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The way you defend this country is to make sure that you don\u2019t go on foreign wars and don\u2019t start bombing before you have started thinking.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ouch! Gardiner was challenged: Is that what Nato does? He continued:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Consistently, if you look at the Iraq war, who was on the right side of history on that? Jeremy Corbyn was not the president at the time and indeed not the Labour party at the time under Tony Blair. But all of parliament went into that, Jeremy Corbyn did not. </p> \n   <p>What I\u2019m saying is that if you look at the way in which we want to use a defensive alliance it is to think carefully through positions, to learn the lessons of the Chilcot report, learn about how we should try and prevent conflict and de-escalate a situation, rather than actually then promoting a conflict. </p> \n   <p>When we went into Libya, when we joined the bombing raid on Libya, we were told it was absolutely essential to do that. I didn\u2019t vote for that, neither did Jeremy Corbyn. That has proved to be a disaster. It\u2019s proved to allow groups like Isis to form and take control and to make that country a complete basket case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d500588ebd6f57b54f1d99421cbd4694c39a2ab7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d500588ebd6f57b54f1d99421cbd4694c39a2ab7/630_0_2825_1695/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Gardiner (left) with Jeremy Corbyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barry Gardiner (left) with Jeremy Corbyn.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T09:03:51.865Z\">at 9.03am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5de763b98f0829bc521b6299\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T07:46:26.430Z\">7.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Speaking on Today this morning, <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> denied any knowledge of talks between the UK and the US on NHS drugs pricing, despite documents unearthed recently showing that officials began negotiations during his tenure as health secretary.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen I was health secretary, I wasn\u2019t aware of any talks going on with the United States at all,\u201d said Hunt, who left his post as foreign secretary when Boris Johnson became prime minister.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In so far as there have been preliminary discussions between officials on both sides, not between politicians, we have made absolutely clear that NHS drugs prices are not on the table.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid this is the traditional scare story.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. Thanks for reading and commenting. My colleagues, Patrick Wintour and Rowena Mason, have tonight\u2019s main story: And Andrew Sparrow has put together a detailed summary of the day\u2019s main events: Since he did so, the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson apologised for her part in introducing austerity after the 2010 election. Swinson said some cuts were necessary but the nature and severity of those implemented by the government of which she was a part were wrong. Commenting on his interview with Johnson, Labour\u2019s Barry Gardiner said to Peston: Quite honestly, if I wanted to see two men shouting at each other without listening I\u2019d go down to the local pub. All he did was bully, hector, and ignore the questions that you put to him. And that is the nature of this man who\u2019s putting himself forward to be elected as our prime minister. As a prime minister, what I want to see somebody who\u2019s prepared to take on the hard questions and actually try and give you a serious answer to them. He didn\u2019t do that with you. He certainly didn\u2019t do it with Marr on Sunday, and he\u2019s refused to do it with Andrew Neil. The guy\u2019s running scared of any genuine sort of scrutiny that we could give to him. On the prime minister being questioned about Brexit, Gardiner said: You challenged him, you challenged him on how he was going to get it done. He didn\u2019t have an answer, he just kept on repeating the slogan. Asked about reports he forced Tory MPs to sign up to his withdrawal agreement deal, Johnson said: \u201cI have not forced them, that is totally unfair, there was absolutely no lobotomy\u201d He insisted \u201cno, not at all\u201d when asked by ITV\u2019s Robert Peston whether he had said they \u201ccouldn\u2019t be candidates?\u201d Boris Johnson, in his interview with ITV, has insisted the UK \u201cwill be out\u201d of the EU on 31 January, while simultaneously acknowledging that the country will actually enter the transition period \u2013 during which it will still be subject to the EU\u2019s rules and regulations. Johnson said the UK would legally have left the EU on 31 January and said it could end the transition period at any point it chose to thereafter. Last month, the Brexit experts Anand Menon and Catherine Barnard wrote an interesting opinion piece for the Guardian on what this might all mean in reality: Wrapping up the interview, Swinson indicated she believed she would be able to stay on as Lib Dem leader, even if the party secured fewer seats than it held in the last Parliament. I\u2019m staying as Liberal Democrat Leader and I\u2019m excited ... about the movement, the Liberal movement that we need to build because we still need to make sure that we can stop Brexit and there is something bigger at stake here as well ... It is about who we are as a country. Whether we are open, whether we are inclusive, whether we go down the route that you see in America of populism and nationalism and it\u2019s liberalism that is the answer to that and that is the Liberal movement that I\u2019m building. Pressed on whether she would stand down following poor results, she added: I\u2019ve got a job to do and I\u2019ve just been elected to do it and I\u2019m excited to be fighting this election and in terms of that wider movement - you know we have more Liberal Democrat members than ever before ... I\u2019m absolutely here to stay. Swinson declined to say whether she would begin campaigning for the UK to rejoin the EU immediately after Brexit. Asked if the country should join the Euro if it were deemed necessary to demonstrate commitment to \u201cbeing at the heart of the European Union\u201d, she added: I don\u2019t think we should be joining the Euro. You know, I think being at the heart of the European Union I do not interpret in the way that you have just described it. I think that\u2019s about us playing a leadership role within the EU. We\u2019ve done that on so many occasions. If you look at the climate talks, the Paris Accord, the UK played a leadership role getting the EU to adopt an ambitious position \u2013 and then the EU managed to get the world to adopt an ambitious position on the climate emergency. That\u2019s the kind of thing about being at the heart of the EU. Swinson confirmed she would want to extend voting in any second Brexit referendum to 16- and 17-year-olds. Asked if she would go ahead with it even if it meant delaying the referendum, she said: Well, I think it\u2019s possible, in discussions that I\u2019ve had about how we could do this swiftly. So for example it would be possible to pass a law to extend the franchise to 16-year-olds. It\u2019s easier with EU citizens because they\u2019re already on the voters roll. Asked whether she would sacrifice a second Brexit referendum if the price of securing one was a second Scottish independence referendum, Swinson said: I will vote for a people\u2019s vote on the Brexit deal and I think SNP members of parliament will also vote for that legislation because they will know that, you know, that\u2019s what people in Scotland want. Swinson insisted again that she would not \u201cput Jeremy Corbyn in No 10\u201d but she said she would vote with him \u2013 or any other government \u2013 to secure a second Brexit referendum. I will vote for legislation to pass a people\u2019s vote, of course I will and I would have done that under the previous Conservative government, just as I would do under any other government. But I will work with people on a cross-party basis. If we can elect enough MPs who support a people\u2019s vote and we have the chance of delivering it, Liberal Democrat MPs are the strongest advocates of remain. But I\u2019m not going to put Jeremy Corbyn in No 10. But, if a government of any colour puts down a bill in parliament to have a people\u2019s vote, then we will support having a people\u2019s vote to put a specific Brexit deal to the people with the option of remaining in the EU. Asked about her personal approval rating, which Neil said was \u201ceven lower than Nigel Farage\u201d at minus 31 \u2013 down from minus 20 at the start of the campaign \u2013 she said: At the end of the day, I\u2019m going to stand for what I believe in and there will be people who dislike that, but I\u2019m not going to ... just have a kind of message that\u2019s full of... I mean, you know, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s not saying where he stands on Brexit and I\u2019m proud to be able to be clear that I think our best future is in the European Union. In a reference to her election campaign tactics, Swinson was asked if she would now acknowledge she will not be the next prime minister. She said: Well, I would obviously love to be prime minister. Clearly, when you look at the polls that\u2019s not the most likely scenario. I will certainly grant you that. But I\u2019m, you know, very glad to be standing up for the millions of people in this country who want to remain in the European Union and the more Liberal Democrat MPs we elect, the more likely we are to be able to stop Brexit. The BBC\u2019s interview with the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has started. She has been defending her personal popularity ratings and her tactics in the election campaign; particularly her decision to insist on reversing Brexit unilaterally. The prime minister has claimed people will stop talking about Brexit after the extension period ends on 31 January 2020, despite the fact the UK would then enter the transition period and no future trade deal is in place to come into force at that point. Asked whether such could happen by ITV News in an interview due to air on Tuesday evening, Boris Johnson said: Yes, and now let me say something: I think we will have got Brexit done and you will find that it moves, because what will happen is that the parliamentary agony will be over, and the political agony will be over, and the misery and tedium and procrastination that\u2019s been going on\u2026 will be over. The interview, Robert Peston, interjected to tell Johnson that his claim was untrue. Earlier, we reported that the EU had drawn up plans for how Brexit talks might run if the Tories win the election (see: 5:47pm). The Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has apologised for her part in introducing swingeing cuts when she was part of the Tory-led coalition government. In an interview with the BBC that\u2019s due to be aired in about an hour, she has said the party was wrong to have backed some of the reforms. The Lib Dems now propose to scrap the bedroom tax. Asked by Andrew Neil who had voted for its introduction nine times, Swinson replied: The Liberal Democrats in government, including myself, which I have previously said \u2013 and I\u2019m happy to say again \u2013 was wrong. And I\u2019m sorry about that, and it was one of the things that we did get wrong. Asked a similar question about the benefits cap, she said: I will have done as someone in collective responsibility in government. And asked another similar question on health reforms that allow NHS contracts to be put out to private tender, she responded: I was in government, so I will have voted for them. Given those facts, Neil asked, why would people believe her when she says she wants to roll back those policies? Swinson told him: Well, we\u2019re setting out what our plan is for the future. We did spend five years in a coalition government where clearly we didn\u2019t win every battle against the Conservatives. We fought many battles and we did win battles for more money for schools, for more money for the poorest pupils, for managing to cut tax for the lowest paid, to introduce same-sex marriage. There\u2019s many things that I\u2019m very proud of and where we made a difference. But, of course, there were things where we didn\u2019t win those battles and I\u2019m sorry about that. But it was not a Liberal Democrat government, it was a coalition government. Neil told her 240,000 people had their benefits cut because she went along with the bedroom tax. Would she like to apologise to them, she was asked. Yes, I am sorry that I did that. It was not the right policy and we should have stopped it. And our manifesto, as our previous manifesto, makes clear that that should be scrapped. And we have identified the money to put into it. And not only the bedroom tax, but scrapping the two-child limit, which was introduced by the Conservatives, which we did stop in government, but was introduced by the Conservative majority government after 2015. Asked if austerity was a \u201cnecessary evil or a terrible mistake\u201d, Swinson said: Clearly, too much was cut. Clearly, not enough was raised from taxation and, certainly, the investment should have kicked in earlier in terms of more borrowing for capital investment. Equally, we implemented pretty much what Labour\u2019s proposed spending plans were from the 2010 election. And I\u2019m not going to say that, in a financial crisis, it was going to be possible \u2013 with the deficit at the level that it was in 2010 \u2013 not to make any cuts at all. Some cuts were necessary. But the shape of those cuts and certainly the balance between cuts and tax rises, I don\u2019t think was the right balance. I think we should have been raising more from taxation. And that\u2019s something which we argued for and, obviously, that was not one of the battles that we always won during coalition. Donald Trump has concluded a two-day visit to the UK without doing anything likely to jeopardise the chances of his close ally Boris Johnson winning the general election a week tomorrow. Given Trump\u2019s toxic reputation in the UK, Tory strategists had been concerned that any form of endorsement might be counter-productive. But yesterday Trump\u2019s comments about the NHS and a trade deal were not unhelpful to the Conservatives and today the proceedings at the Nato summit were largely overshadowed by a puerile row about whether Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, were laughing at Trump behind his back at a reception last night. Johnson denied this (implausibly) and said it was nonsense to suggest that he did not take Trump seriously. But, at a news conference at the end of the summit, he was careful to distance himself from the man who once dubbed him \u201cBritain[\u2019s] Trump\u201d because the two are supposedly ideologically aligned. Johnson sidestepped an invitation to say anything positive about Trump personally, and even avoided mentioning him by name. This might look like the start of a cooling in the relationship, but Trump understands perfectly well how elections work and, elsewhere in the press conference, there was a hint that behind the scenes the alliance is as strong as ever. That came when Johnson suggested that he might end up siding with US demands to exclude the Chinese firm Huawei from building Britain\u2019s 5G networks. When Theresa May was prime minister she was reportedly planning a less Washington-friendly approach; according to a leak from the national security council, she was planning to give Huawei access to non-contentious parts of the 5G network. Trump denounced Trudeau as \u201ctwo-faced\u201d and left the summit venue earlier than expected, cancelling a planned press conference, after apparently being riled by the news that fellow leaders were having a joke at his expense last night. His abrupt departure dominated the headlines, overshadowing the otherwise modest achievements of a low-key meeting held to mark Nato\u2019s 70th anniversary. At the meeting Turkey dropped its opposition to a plan to bolster the defences of Baltic states and Poland against Russia. As my colleague Patrick Wintour reports, Nato leaders also agreed to set up a committee of experts to analyse political decision-making after the French president Emmanuel Macron lamented the \u201cbrain death\u201d of the military alliance. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said he does not accept Trump\u2019s claim that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks, saying the US president has a \u201cpassing relationship with reality and truth\u201d. An Extinction Rebellion protester dressed as a bee glued himself to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 battlebus this morning. John Longworth, a Brexit party MEP, has had the party whip removed after a row with the leadership over election strategy. The former Labour MP Ivan Lewis, who resigned from the party last year when he was suspended over sexual harassment allegations, has urged people in his Bury South constituency to vote Tory to keep Jeremy Corbyn out of Downing Street. Black and ethnic minority voters are backing Corbyn in far higher numbers than the overall electorate as the two main political parties vie for their votes in crucial swing seats. MPs would be banned from holding second jobs under reforms of the rules governing political donations and lobbying that have been proposed by the Labour party. That is all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. But there is more to come tonight. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is being interviewed by Andrew Neil on BBC One at 7.30pm. And Johnson is being interviewed on ITV by Peston. (The programme goes out at 11.15pm, but the interview is broadcast on Twitter at 8pm.) EU leaders will call for swift action to negotiate a future relationship with the UK, according to a draft declaration likely to be agreed the day after the general election. EU leaders are holding one of their regular summits in Brussels on 11-12 December, just as British voters are going to the polls and getting the results While the EU is keen not take sides, officials read British election polls and see a Conservative Brexit on 31 January as the most likely outcome. This leaked document, seen by the Guardian, sets out the next steps in that scenario EU leaders will call on the European commission to draw up \u201ca comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its withdrawal\u201d, while calling on ministers in the general affairs council to \u201cswiftly\u201d adopt that mandate and other relevant decisions. The commission negotiates trade deals on behalf of the EU, after the 28 member states, soon to be 27, have drawn up a mandate for talks. \u201cNegotiations should be organised in a way that makes the best possible use of the limited time available for negotiation and ratification by the end of the transition,\u201d states the document. That is an implicit recognition that not everything can be done in 11 months and the EU will have to prioritise, something EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said in a recent interview. Barnier has said a basic free trade agreement would be possible to negotiate in Johnson\u2019s preferred timetable of 11 months, although some EU diplomats are more sceptical. The text also welcomes the continuing role for Barnier, who has won plaudits in Brussels for his coolness and diligence in keeping everyone informed. It says: The negotiations will continue to take place in a coherent manner and in a spirit of unity and transparency with all member states. That statement could be seen as a warning shot to the commission\u2019s trade department not to try and run the British talks in secret, as well as assurance to small member states that their voices will be heard The text also states: The European council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future relationship with the UK in line with the political declaration and respecting the previously agreed European council\u2019s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations. The reference to \u201cstatements and declarations\u201d is important: it is a message to EU member states that agreements on tricky issues, such as Gibraltar, will be carried over into the next phase on Brexit. In other words, the EU does not have to reopen these arguments again. The leaked document should be read as the EU getting its house in order to avoid any procedural snarl-ups in Brussels, thus avoiding blame if talks fail. Missing from the document is any mention of no-deal (the EU thinks this is less likely and that its plans are in order) or a renegotiation. If Jeremy Corbyn confounded expectations and moved into 10 Downing Street, the EU would once again open talks, but would await first a request for a Brexit extension. Some of Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign visits seem designed entirely to construct visual metaphors for TV reporters. That is certainly the case with his visit to Red Bull Racing in Milton Keynes. (See 4.39pm.) Just in case any reporters missed the hint, Johnson declared: This whole country is stuck in the pits because of this blocked parliament. What we need to do is change the wheel and get it back on track. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. These are from the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins, who has spent more time on the road than most journalists this election. The New Statesman has published its election leader article and it has said that it cannot back any of the three main parties. It does come quite close to backing the Green party, saying it would like to see more Green MPs in parliament, although it won\u2019t endorse the Greens because it says they are not in a position to govern. The New Statesman is broadly on the left and in the past it has backed Labour. But it says it cannot do so because of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. It says: Labour has rightly chipped away at the edifice of \u2018capitalist realism\u2019, the term the late cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe the sense that \u2018not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system\u2026 it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it\u2019. But the essential judgement that must be made is on Mr Corbyn himself. His reluctance to apologise for the antisemitism in Labour and to take a stance on Brexit, the biggest issue facing the country, make him unfit to be prime minister. Before becoming Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn described Nato as \u201ca danger to world peace\u201d and said it should have been disbanded at the end of the cold war. Channel 4 News has a roundup of some of his quotes on the topic here. Today, asked what had made him change his mind and commit to the UK remaining in Nato, Corbyn replied: Our party is committed to remain a part of Nato. It\u2019s also what we do in Nato and what Nato does itself that\u2019s important \u2013 and that\u2019s why I make the point about the need for criticism of human rights abuses wherever they occur, including Russia, but also an understanding of other countries so that we do reduce those tensions and we don\u2019t recreate the tensions of the cold war. Pressed on what had personally made him change his mind, he replied: I have always been in favour of a policy of detente and lowering of tensions and we have decided we will remain in Nato as a party. Asked if he thought Nato now contributed to world peace, he replied: I think we\u2019ll have to contribute to world peace through Nato and any other alliance \u2013 principally through the United Nations. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference at the end of the Nato summit. Johnson denied laughing at President Trump at a reception last night and not taking him seriously. (See 2.36am) Johnson sidestepped an opportunity to praise Trump personally. (See 2.50pm.) In fact, it was almost a case of \u201cDonald who?\u201d as Johnson got through the whole press conference without mentioning the president once by name. Johnson claimed that Jeremy Corbyn wanted to \u201cdestroy Nato\u201d. At times he used the press conference for blatant electioneering, and he ended it with what amounted to a version of his standard election stump speech. He said: There is a choice between those who want to strengthen Nato and those in the Labour opposition who actually want to destroy it, destroy Nato, this alliance that has kept us safe. I want to strengthen MI5, that keeps us safe. Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party want to install a home secretary who wants to disband MI5. I want longer sentences for violent criminals and to make sure that terrorists serve their full term. Mr Corbyn doesn\u2019t agree with that. In the past Corbyn did oppose Nato membership, but as Labour leader he has accepted party policy, and the majority view in the party, which is for the UK to remain a Nato member. And, although Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, signed a Commons early day motion in the 1980s opposing MI5, that is not a view that she has supported for years. Johnson said that \u201cnational security interests\u201d would be a key issue when the government decided whether to let the Chinese firm Huawei play a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G network. Asked about this, he replied: On Huawei and 5G. I don\u2019t want this country to be unnecessarily hostile to investment from overseas. On the other hand, we cannot prejudice our vital national security interests, nor can we prejudice our ability to cooperate with other Five Eyes security partners, and that we will be how \u2013 that will be the key criterion that informs our decision about Huawei. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh took this as a hint that Huawei will be excluded from this work (a decision that would please the US, which has urged the UK not to allow the company to have a role in constructing the 5G network). Johnson also made a more general point about China posing a threat in the technology sector. Asked whether it should be seen as a strategic partner or an enemy, he replied: Well I certainly don\u2019t think the second thing [enemy]. There was no support for that idea. I think what people felt was that it was right that we should build a strategic partnership with China, but that we should be aware also of the challenges that China presents, particularly when it comes to areas of high technology. I think that would be a fairer characterisation of the discussion. Johnson implied that he was opposed to allowing Britons who fought for Islamic State to return to the country. Asked whether they should be allowed back, he replied: As you know, one of the difficulties we have in taking these people back is that our legal systems make it very difficult for us to secure convictions. And I go back to what I said earlier, people go out to break the law, to sort of fight in terrorist organisations, then they really have to take the consequences. Johnson said he was not worried about how a dossier about the UK-US trade talks was leaked. (See 2.18pm.) This is a rare example of Johnson snubbing his former employer the Daily Telegraph, which in its splash story on Monday suggested this might be part of a Russian plot. The former Labour minister Ivan Lewis, who resigned from the party last year criticising Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism, is now urging people in his constituency to vote Conservative. At the time he resigned, Lewis had been suspended from Labour over sexual harassment allegations, but he claimed the investigation was being prolonged for political reasons. Lewis is standing as an independent candidate in Bury South, where he had a majority of almost 6,000 over the Tories in 2017. But now he says people should vote for his Tory opponent because he thinks the priority is for Corbyn to lose. In a post on Facebook he said: I say to my Labour friends, Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is not the Labour party of our parents and grandparents. It is unreasonable of me to expect you all to leave the party because of antisemitism. But it is unreasonable of you to admit there is a serious antisemitism problem in the party then expect me to join you in the mantra \u2018but the most important thing is we have a Labour government\u2019. Imagine if this institutionalised racism was against any other minority community ... At this election, the future of our country is on the line like never before. The only way to stop Corbyn in Bury South is to vote Conservative. This is not a decision I have taken lightly but I believe it to be in the best interests of the constituency and the country. A cold snap is expected to hit Britain just in time for election day on 12 December, the Press Association reports. Meteorologists at the Met Office have predicted that a wintry spell will arrive for election week, covering the UK in frost and seeing temperatures plunge to sub-zero in some areas. But pollsters say voters are unlikely to be deterred from going to the polls next week, with poor weather only having \u201ca small effect on turnout\u201d. The long-term forecast suggests snowfall in Scotland and the Pennines, with the rest of the UK to be hit by blustery winds and freezing fog, PA reports. Temperatures are predicted to drop throughout the week, dipping below normal towards election day, with a greater chance of frost developing across the country. But the election would go ahead, even in a blanket of snow, because it is written in law and cannot be postponed unless the law is changed. The chair of campaign group Leave Means Leave has been axed as a Brexit party MEP over disloyalty, party officials have claimed. John Longworth, who publicly differed on general election strategy with Nigel Farage, has had the whip removed and will no longer represent the party in Brussels. Unease between Longworth and his party is understood to have stemmed from his insistence early in the election that the party operate a smaller campaign and not target Tory seats. Others wanted to contest 600-plus constituencies. The Brexit party\u2019s chief whip and MEP, Brian Monteith, said: We regret having to remove the whip, but we have been left with no alternative after John Longworth repeatedly undermined the party\u2019s Brexit strategy over the last few months. The Brexit party shall not be deflected from, or undermined in, its campaign to win Labour seats. We are receiving a great reception from disenchanted Labour voters and have believe we have a good chance of winning in many seats. Longworth spoke openly about how his then party should focus on 20 to 30 seats in Labour areas at the very start of the campaign. A few days later Farage announced it was standing down in 317 Tory-held seats, which in some areas has disappointed candidates and party supporters. Its campaign is now focused on Labour heartland areas in northern England, the Midlands and Wales and it is running 274 candidates. Here is some reaction to the Boris Johnson press conference from political journalists. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From my colleague John Crace From the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner From the Independent\u2019s Benjamin Kentish From my colleague Dan Sabbagh President Trump has confirmed that he is not holding an end-of-summit press conference. Boris Johnson may have denied laughing at Donald Trump. But he was not prepared to praise him personally. This is what he said when he was asked if he thought that, \u201cas a leader and as a man that Donald Trump is good for the west and good for Britain\u201d. Johnson replied: I certainly think that the United States ... has massively contributed to Nato, has been for 70 years a pillar of stability for our collective security. If you want evidence of the willingness of the United States to stand shoulder to shoulder with us, I would point you back to what happened in the case of the poisonings in Salisbury ... And the United States actually expelled 60 [Russian diplomats]. That was a fantastic testament I think to the trans-Atlantic alliance. At this point Johnson started comparing the US response to the Salisbury poisoning attack to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. When pressed again for his view on Trump personally, Johnson pointed out that the US response to Salisbury happened under the Trump administration. They were \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with the UK, he said. They \u201ccould not have been more supportive\u201d. But Johnson declined both opportunities to praise Trump personally as a leader. In contrast, Trump has repeatedly spoken of his admiration for Johnson. Yesterday he said Johnson was \u201cvery capable\u201d and a few weeks ago he told LBC that Johnson was a \u201cfantastic man and [the] exact right guy for the times\u201d. This is what Boris Johnson said when he was asked about the footage apparently showing him laughing at Donald Trump at a reception last night. \u201cDo you not take President Trump seriously,\u201d he was asked. He replied: No. That\u2019s complete nonsense. I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from. My colleague Owen Gibson has the answer. Q: Did you make it clear to Trump that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks? If so, does that mean this time next year the UK could be leaving the transition with no EU trade deal and no US trade deal? Johnson says the questions are now scraping the bottom of the barrel. He will wrap up. He ends with a riff about the choice at the election: between getting Brexit done, and having two referendums. There is also a choice about Nato. He wants to strengthen Nato. Corbyn wants to scrap it, he says. And Diane Abbott wants to disband MI5, he claims. (She doesn\u2019t, although in the 1980s she signed an early day motion that implied that she did.) And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Trump said yesterday he did not know Prince Andrew. But there are lots of photographs of them together. Is Trump an amnesiac or a liar? Johnson says that is a good effort to get an answer on something that did not come up at the summit. Q: Did the issue of Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian missiles come up? Johnson says this did not come up formally at the meeting. Q: President Trump wants the UK to take more Islamic State fighters back. Are we going to take them back? Johnson says our legal system makes it very hard to secure convictions if people return. People must accept the consequences for their choices. Q: [From the Telegraph] Are you concerned about how the full text of the dossier about the UK-US trade talks became public? (The Telegraph has implied the Russians were involved.) Johnson says he thought this material had been on the internet for some time. He says he is not concerned about this. Q: President Trump said every leader he had spoken to here has agreed not to let Huawei play a role in its critical infrastructure. He spoke to you last night. So does that mean the UK will not let Huawei build the 5G network here. Johnson says he does not want the country to be \u201cunnecessary hostile to investment from overseas\u201d. But he will not prejudice security. Those principles will decide his approach to Huawei. This is from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn on this topic. Q: Were you joking about President Trump at the reception last night? Johnson denies it. That suggestion is \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d, he says. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: President Trump has spoken of his admiration for you. Do you think the president, as a man, is good for the west and good for Britain? Johnson says America has been a loyal ally to the UK. The alliance has been good for the UK. After the Salisbury poisoning attack, the US expelled 60 Russian diplomats. He contrasts that with the approach taken by Jeremy Corbyn, who wanted to involve Russia in the investigation. This happened under the current administration, he says. Johnson sidesteps opportunity to praise Trump personally. Here is the declaration issued at the end of the Nato conference. Boris Johnson is giving a press conference at the end of the Nato summit. He starts with a short speech about the value of Nato. One of the interesting moment in the ITV leaders\u2019 debate came when Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson were both asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose. Tories assume that Corbyn will always on the royal family agenda (not singing the national anthem damaged him badly), but on this occasion Corbyn said the monarchy needed improvement, and the audience applauded. Johnson said it was beyond reproach, and his reply was met with stony silence. Corbyn gave the right answer - so much so that Johnson resorted a few days later to claiming that, when he had been asked about the monarchy, he had actually been speaking about the monarch (ie, the Queen). But today Corbyn hasn\u2019t had such a good outing on royal family territory. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Julia Etchingham he was asked if he watched the Queen\u2019s speech on Christmas day. He said that he normally did, although the full exchange suggests otherwise. ITV has sent out the transcript of the exchange. JE: Talk to us a bit about Christmas in the Corbyn household. Do you sit down to watch the Queen\u2019s speech? Mr Corbyn. JC: It\u2019s on the morning, usually we have it on .. some of the time. JE: It\u2019s not on in the morning .. it\u2019s at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon JC: It\u2019s when its repeated .. in the afternoon JE: So you don\u2019t sit down, as a family, to watch the Queen speech. JC: We don\u2019t watch television very much on Christmas Day. Maybe a film in the evening. Erm I\u2019d like to do a bit of exercise on Christmas morning JE: You do some exercise on Christmas morning. I don\u2019t think the Queen\u2019s speech is in the morning. It\u2019s three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. That\u2019s when everybody watches it. JC: Well. Our Christmas is sometimes ... JE: You don\u2019t watch it do you Mr Corbyn? JC: There is lots .. lots to do .. I enjoy the presence of my family and friends around Christmas. Obviously, like everybody else does. And, I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day, or the day before, to talk to, and listen to people\u2019s lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them. It\u2019s not quite Frost/Nixon, although Corbyn would probably have been better off just saying he caught up with the Queen\u2019s speech through the news (if at all), like most of the population. Here is the clip of President Trump calling Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d. Trump says he will not be holding a further press conference. He has done plenty of press conferences, he says. Trump cancels press conference expected at end of Nato summit. (That will probably be a relief to No 10.) Donald Trump criticised Canada for not spending 2% of GDP on defence. He says he called Justin Trudeau, the Canadian PM, about that. He says Trudeau was not happy about that. He also described Trudeau as \u201ctwo-faced\u201d over the footage of Trudeau apparently joking about Trump at a reception last night. And a a final answer to your questions from me ... Q: What issues do the SNP anticipate in calling another independence referendum in the case of either a returned Tory government, or a new Labour administration? Which would be better for their campaign, is essentially the question. Fighting it out with Johnson or extracting a promise from an incoming PM Corbyn? Chris, Renfrewshire In the election campaign so far, the SNP has been careful not to entertain any \u201cplan B\u201d talk, should either Labour or Tories refuse to grant the s30 order that Holyrood requires to legally hold a second independence referendum. You may recall that an attempt to debate a plan B was swiftly quashed at SNP conference in October, and Sturgeon herself has insisted that a second indyref must meet the \u201cgold standard\u201d internationally. Instead, SNP politicians throw the question back to the other parties: who are you to deny the democratic will of the Scottish people? It will depend on next week\u2019s results how powerful that argument is going to be: Sturgeon has described SNP successes at the ballot box as \u201can instruction to Westminster\u201d. It\u2019s certainly clear already that Labour don\u2019t want to be seen as anti-democratic, so they are willing to entertain a pro-independence mandate at the next Holyrood elections in 2021 as reason to grant a s30 order. But Johnson has said that he\u2019ll refuse under any circumstances. I think both are good for the campaign now, since they both refuse to grant it next year, which is what Sturgeon says she wants, so it fits well with the narrative of Westminster frustrating Scottish democracy. Thanks for all your questions today Next up will be Guardian political correspondent, Kate Proctor. She will be answering any questions you may have about the Brexit party at 12.30pm on Friday. You can ask your question via our form here. President Trump is speaking to reporters at the end of the Nato summit, at a meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. Trump says he thinks he will solve the trade crisis with China. There must be fairness in trade, he says. Some interesting questions on different issues from readers here. If you\u2019d like to ask a question in the comments please @Libby or via our form. Q: Why has reformation of the Gender Recognition Act, present in the 2017 manifesto, been removed in the 2019 manifesto? Is there any explanation or reassurance for trans and non-binary people in Scotland who are alarmed by the signal that this withdrawal sends? Will the results of the publicly funded consultation carried out to gather information for the planned reformation be made available to the taxpayer? Sophie, 29, Edinburgh, software developer Thanks Sophie, a number of people raised this concern after the manifesto was published, and the Scottish government\u2019s equalities minister Shirley-Anne Somerville sought to reassure them, pointing out that she would be publishing a draft bill following further consultation by the end of the year. But it\u2019s certainly true that this issue has caused a great deal of controversy within the party, with Sturgeon facing a significant amount of push-back on her plans to proceed with a devolved gender recognition act, aimed at streamlining the process by which a transgender person gets legal recognition. The fact that the issue has gone out for consultation twice has alarmed many in the LGBTI community, who saw this as a roll-back from a more solid earlier commitment. But the strength of feeling around the proposals, and the concerns from many women within the party who feel that the impact on equalities legislation and on women-only spaces in particular has not been taken into account , meant that the SG had little option. Q: This election my vote will go to a party that will legalise cannabis. What is the SNP policy on this? Gavin, Dumfriesshire Worth noting first of all that drugs laws are reserved to Westminster. Nicola Sturgeon has said that devolution of drug laws is one her key demands should another party seek SNP support for their minority government after the election and the SNP\u2019s manifesto calls for this and - pending devolution - that the UK government should introduce a supervised drug consumption facility in Glasgow. Delegates at the SNP\u2019s autumn conference in Aberdeen in October also backed the decriminalisation of controlled drugs, branding the Misuse Of Drugs Act, which dates back to 1971, as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. As you\u2019ll probably know, Scotland is dealing with unprecedented numbers of drug related deaths, and this resolution was linked to attempts to open a safe drugs consumption room in Glasgow, which has so far been blocked by the home office. Q: What is SNP stand on more support for veterans in Scotland? Anonymous, disabled veteran from service in the Gulf War, Dunfermline I know that the next Scottish census will include a question about veteran status, a significant change prompted by the British Legion\u2019s campaigning to make it easier to identify and support veterans. I believe that the SNP government was the first UK administration to make this change and also the first to appoint a Veterans\u2019 Commissioner in the autumn of 2018. Practically, there\u2019s support for getting into employment and also for veterans requiring social care, the Scottish Government has exempted the War Disablement Pension from assessment of income \u2013 meaning that veterans get the help they need and keep the full value of this pension. Q: How would a border work between independent-but-in-EU Scotland and out-of-EU England. Would it be a hard border, like the feared one in Scotland? Jack, 29, works in insurance, St Albans That\u2019s going to be one of the looming questions should there be a second independence referendum campaign, and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you as much clarity as I\u2019d like at this stage. In 2014, the yes campaign was able to argue that there would be no border between a newly independent Scotland and the rest of the UK because both would remain within the EU. Not so now of course. On The Andrew Marr Show recently, Sturgeon refused to rule out a hard border, saying: \u201cWe need to see how things play out and what the final relationship between the UK and the EU will be,\u201d and adding that Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit was not an inevitability. \u201cAs that picture clarifies, I will be honest with the people of Scotland but that opens a situation where Scotland\u2019s best interests depend on being independent and in charge of our own future and I don\u2019t want borders.\u201d Q: How far into nationalism is the SNP prepared to go? We\u2019ve seen the effects of nationalism in Italy, amongst the far-right in Germany and with the EDL in England as well as with Trump in North America, for but a few examples. Do you consider it a potentially dangerous path to travel? Tim Eslip, middle-aged professional, England The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was questioned on precisely this at the Edinburgh Fringe festival this August, so I think it\u2019s helpful to reproduce her answers at length, since it was the most comprehensive I\u2019ve heard her on this in a while. Asked about the types of nationalism you refer to, she told the audience during an interview with Matt Forde that the \u201ccivic nationalism\u201d of the SNP was \u201con another spectrum altogether\u201d from \u201cfar right, racist, insular movements\u201d seen in other parts of the world. Asked by comedian Matt Forde about Scottish nationalism, Sturgeon said: \u201cA lot of the regimes called nationalist today are not countries striving to be independent, because often they already are, but are based on some kind of racial exceptionalism, or superiority often very illiberal and oppressive of minorities, and Scottish independence is not just at the other end of the spectrum of that, but on another spectrum altogether Questioned specifically about a protester who had been pictured on the Royal Mile with an \u201cEngland get out of Scotland\u201d banner, Sturgeon said: \u201cThe person with that banner does not speak for the SNP. That kind of sentiment has no place in Scotland. You can\u2019t get to a situation in any party where you say we\u2019ll never attract the wrong kind of person but you can be absolutely vehement and resolute about calling it out. The people who put up that banner, I don\u2019t want them in the SNP.\u201d This is from Bloomberg\u2019s Sebastian Salek. I have not seen the text of his speech, but will post more on it when I can track down a copy. Here\u2019s more on the economics of an independent Scotland ... Q: Given that GERS (Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland) for 2018-9 shows a deficit of \u00a312.6bn or 7.7% of Scottish GDP, how would an independent Scotland pay for the extra spending proposals in the SNP manifesto or even current levels of spending. Richard, Australia Thanks Richard - that\u2019s precisely the question that the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which published an analysis of the SNP\u2019s manifesto spending pledges in the Scotsman this morning, asked. As others have noted, the SNP manifesto was notably slim on costings, and associate director of the IFS David Phillips suggests that this may be because the spending plans would necessitate more, not less, austerity for Scotland if it were to become independent. As I set out in an earlier post on this live blog, Phillips points out that pledges including increasing NHS spending across the UK by \u00a3136 per head to close the gap with Scotland, an end to the two-child benefit cap and an increased national living wage, would require significant outlay at a time when an independent Scotland was also starting out with a serious budget deficit. Phillips adds: \u201cPursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manifesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways ... in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more not less austerity.\u201d The SNP\u2019s own growth commission report on the economics of independence, which came out in 2018, proposed that the inherited deficit be cut by growing the economy rather than cutting spending. It also said it should delay launching its own currency and introduce tax cuts for migrants. Analysing the report at the time, the IFS commended it for being honest about \u201cthe challenging public finance position an independent Scotland would start life with\u201d. However, it went on to dispute claims that its economic strategy would end austerity, suggesting it in fact implied cuts in spending and benefits equal to 4% of GDP over a 10-year period. Questioned about Scotland\u2019s notional deficit by Andrew Neil last week, which stands at 7% according to current figures, and whether it could hinder renewed membership of the EU (EU members\u2019 budget deficits must not exceed 3% of GDP) Nicola Sturgeon argued: \u201cOur task is to get our deficit reducing faster. That is principally through growing our economy faster which remaining in the EU or returning to the EU helps us to do.\u201d My colleague Richard Partington has been factchecking the John McDonnell claim that a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year. Here is his verdict. Nationalisation could save households money that would otherwise go to private investors, but is reliant on the smooth execution of Labour\u2019s plan. The party could face difficulties and unintended consequences, putting savings at risk. Some of the savings are also not open to families until 2030. And here is the full article. According to Joe Murphy and Nicholas Cecil in the Evening Standard, No 10 sources have been keen to insist that Boris Johnson was not one of the world leaders joking about Donald Trump at the reception last night. Here is an extract from their story. Downing Street quickly made clear that Mr Johnson had not been involved in any laughing about any disruption caused by the US president\u2019s press conference, which was held at the American ambassador\u2019s residence in Regent\u2019s Park yesterday morning. A senior source said: \u2018The prime minister was hosting and engaging with world leaders. It is others that were having the conversations and Boris certainly was not leading, as can be seen from the clip. \u2018You did not see any commentary from him except for an innocent question as to why one was late.\u2019 If you want to ask a question in the comments please @Libby, so they\u2019re easier to find. Many of you have been asking about the economics of an independent Scotland. Q: This is a question that the Scottish press don\u2019t ask. What would the cost of setting up the structure of an independent Scotland be and where will the newly independent Scotland get the money? Robert, 68, retired, Edinburgh Hi Robert, you\u2019ll recall this was a much-disputed area during the 2014 campaign. A Treasury report in May of that year estimated the costs of setting up an independent state to be around \u00a31.5bn - including \u00a3750m to create a new tax regime and \u00a3400m for computers and IT for welfare - but this was vigorously challenged by the then first minister, Alex Salmond. Prof Patrick Dunleavy of LSE was quoted by both the UK and Scottish governments as the leading expert on transition costs, and he suggested that \u201cstart-up costs\u201d would come in at around \u00a3200m but then a further \u00a3900m would be required for tax and welfare infrastructure. Nicola Sturgeon confirmed in September this year that she had instructed civil servants to work on a second white paper to convince voters of the case for independence, although it should be noted that the original version relied heavily on projected oil revenues which have since plummeted. Q: Would an independent Scotland find it easier to join Efta rather than the EU, which would give an independent Scotland many of the benefits which eg. Norway has, but also allow us to opt out of CFP and the CAP? While the SNP has explored the possibility of rejoining the single market via the European Free Trade Association, with the option of returning to full EU membership later, the response from other member states is mixed. In 2017, Iceland\u2019s foreign minister warned that Scotland could not apply to join Efta until after it had fully separated from the UK, but in the same year Norway said it would keep an open mind to Scottish membership. Accession to Efta is seen as more straightforward than rejoining the EU, but it is not certain that Scotland would then be allowed into the European Economic Area, membership of which would still have to be agreed by the EU. New members of Efta must be accepted unanimously by the existing four members: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Since the Brexit vote, there have been some encouraging noises from EU officials that an independent Scotland could automatically join the EU or inherit the UK\u2019s membership after it leaves. But in 2017, Jacqueline Minor, the European commission\u2019s head of representation in the UK, warned that Scotland would need to formally apply after leaving the UK, although it could be fast-tracked because it already complies with EU rules and regulations. With the possible exception of Nicola Sturgeon, John McDonnell is probably the stand-out media performer of this campaign. His speeches always contain an essential seriousness, but he can also handle media questions without sounding evasive or tetchy as soon as they turn hostile. This wasn\u2019t the most newsy speech of the campaign, and it will be overshadowed by events at that Nato conference later, but he conveyed a positive message and he took quite a large number of critical questions without tripping up. Here are the main points. McDonnell refused to accept Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the NHS would not be on the table in trade talks, saying the US president had a \u201cpassing relationship with reality and truth\u201d. Asked if he thought Trump was lying when he said this yesterday, McDonnell all but said yes. He replied: All the evidence that we\u2019ve seen has demonstrated objectively that it is. Donald Trump has a passing relationship with reality and truth sometimes. I believe in one instance claimed he didn\u2019t know what the initials NHS stood for, so the reality is the evidence is there and the anxiety that we have about the NHS under Boris Johnson regime and his relationship with trump causes us extreme concern. He joked about a Corbyn government having difficult relations with Trump. Asked to respond to what Trump said yesterday about being able to work with Corbyn if he became PM, McDonnell said: It\u2019s encouraging to know that we can maintain a good working relationship with the people of America in the future - [McDonnell paused] after possibly another election. The line about the election prompted laughter from the audience. McDonnell then went on: Obviously, Jeremy will work with leaders all over the world including Donald Trump and we will ensure that whatever happens in the future we will look after the interests of our own people as well as other across the globe. McDonnell said Labour would announce details of its \u201cfirst 100 days\u201d programme before polling day. (See 11.40am.) He described compensating the Waspi (Women Against State Pensions Inequality) women as being akin to bailing out the banks. (See 11.52am.) He suggested the extent of poverty in the UK was incompatible with the values of Christianity. In his speech he said: On Tuesday a new Shelter report also found 135,000 children will be without a home this Christmas. On the same day an analysis by the Equality Trust showed the UK\u2019s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest 13 million. It all went to show just how unequal our society is. It\u2019s three weeks to Christmas. The celebration of the birth of Jesus. Children going hungry and homeless in the 5th largest economy in the world begs the question: \u201cAre we really living up to the values of Christianity or any other of our religions or beliefs for that matter?\u201d McDonnell brought up a Roman Catholic and for a while trained for the priesthood before deciding that his vocation lay elsewhere. He said a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700. Families with someone eligible for free personal care would save more than \u00a37,000, he said. (See 11.29am.) You have been sending in your questions about the SNP manifesto, policies and campaign which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Many of you have asked questions about the state of education in Scotland. Q: Does Ms Sturgeon recognise the pledge, \u201cJudge me on my record for education\u201d? As she has not narrowed the attainment gap why should parents and children give her more than an F? Iain RF MacIain, 45, working in education, Scottish Borders Interesting you mention that today \u2013 you no doubt saw the latest Pisa report yesterday, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago, and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012. A professor of education at Edinburgh University, Lindsay Paterson, described children\u2019s reading performance as \u201cstagnating around mediocrity\u201d, arguing that the reason the attainment gap on reading had narrowed was because middle-class kids were getting worse. The education secretary, John Swinney, described the results as \u201cvery encouraging\u201d, while accepting there were still challenges. The problem is that this is just one element of the overall picture, as you\u2019ll know if you work in education yourself. Another serious concern is teacher shortages. In rural Scotland we have some of the most severe shortages in Europe; also the numbers of days lost to stress-related illness for teachers who are in post; and worries about availability of subjects to children taking high school exams, with reports of kids travelling for hours each week to access teaching in their chosen subject which is only available in another school in their council area. Q: Why don\u2019t the SNP stand candidates in England or Wales? From the reactions to debate it seems they\u2019d win a lot of people over. Levi, 20, student, Caerphilly As a nationalist party whose primary aim is Scottish independence, the SNP has only ever fielded candidates in Scotland, but it\u2019s a question that often comes up \u2013 particularly after viewers have been impressed by Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s performance in UK-wide televised debates. Indeed, the question of whether non-residents of Scotland could vote for the SNP featured in a list of most searched-for terms provided by Google after Sturgeon impressed voters across the UK in the first leaders\u2019 debate of the 2015 general election campaign. And the SNP is well aware of the usefulness of appealing to voters elsewhere: the question of whether Labour could make a post-election pact with the SNP has become one of the key debates of the general election \u2013 but also one of the Conservatives\u2019 main attack lines. I\u2019m Libby Brooks, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, and will be answering your questions on the SNP manifesto, policies and campaign today. I\u2019m based in Glasgow and returned to Scotland \u2013 where I grew up \u2013 on a six-month secondment to help out with coverage of the 2014 independence referendum and since then I\u2019ve reported on some of the most seismic developments in Scottish politics for decades. Before that I was an editor and columnist on the opinion desk and have also written for features, foreign and home news over the years. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. Here is the full text of the John McDonnell speech. McDonnell says he thinks that, just as the Attlee government is remembered for founding the NHS, the Corbyn government will be remembered for setting up a national education service. Education is not a commodity, he says. It is a gift from one generation to another. The national education service will transform lives, he says. He says the number of young people involved in Labour\u2019s campaign is terrific. He says he thinks people will be surprised by how many young people turn out to vote next week. Young people have forced the climate crisis onto the agenda, he says. This is a make-or-break moment for the world. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Why were you not more explicit about the Waspi women pledge in the manifesto? McDonnell says he was working on this for 18 months. He was worried if it got announced on manifesto day, it would be swamped by other issues. And he says he wanted the policy to be launched on a day when Labour could also launch its calculator, to show how much women might get. That took a lot of work, he says. He says the money will be paid over five years. If the government had lost the court case on this, it would have to have paid up anyway. He says this is a lot of money. But \u00a3100bn has been given away to the rich in tax cuts, he says. And he says when the banks were in trouble, hundreds of billions were found to bail them out. He says he wanted a scheme that was straightforward and readily implementable. He is proud of it, he says. McDonnell says Labour will reintroduce sectoral collective bargaining for wages. That will lead to wages going up, he says. Q: Do you support the RMT holding a 27-day rail strike? McDonnell says he hopes both sides will get around the table to negotiate. He says the union is trying to address safety issues. Q: Are you worried about leave supporters not backing Labour? And what has happened to prominent remainers like Keir Starmer, who are not being put up by the party for interviews? McDonnell says people like Starmer are campaigning all over the country. On Brexit, he says Labour would let the people decide. But he says this election is not just about Brexit. People are asking about other issues, he says. Q: You said you will release details of how you will fund your plans in the next few days. Isn\u2019t that too late? McDonnell says the questioner misunderstood the point he was making earlier. (See 11.30am.) He says what he was referring to were announcements about what would happen in the first 100 days of a Corbyn government. The party will also announce details of its first Queen\u2019s speech, and some details of its first budget, he says. Q: Isn\u2019t the idea that Labour can save families \u00a36,700 a year make-believe? McDonnell says Labour\u2019s plans are costed. And they have been tested, he says. In the party he has a reputation as a bureaucrat who insists on detail. He says Labour\u2019s plans are credible. But the party also has an ambitious programme, he says. He says he wants to ensure there is never another programme like the Dispatches documentary. (See 11.14am.) Q: Your manifesto largely protects middle-earners. Is that right? McDonnell says he wants a fair tax system. At the last election he was accused of having a magic money tree. Now the Tories have a magic money forest. If there is a magic money tree, it is in the Cayman Islands. He says Labour will dig it up and bring it back to the UK. Q: Donald Trump says he can work with Jeremy Corbyn. Is that encouraging? McDonnell says Labour will work well with whoever is in the White House \u2013 after the next presidential election, he jokes. He then says the party was encouraged by what Trump said yesterday about Corbyn. John McDonnell is now taking questions. Q: Is President Trump lying when he says the NHS is not on the table in UK-US trade talks? McDonnell says all the evidence suggests it is on the table. Donald Trump has a passing relationship with reality and truth sometimes. McDonnell says he will say more about how Labour would implement change before polling day. For those of us, who believe that real change is not only necessary but readily achievable, we need to spell out in detail how concretely, step by step, that change can be brought about. We have done that, through our manifesto and our grey book. And I\u2019ll be saying even more about that theme in the days ahead. So that before polling day people will know not just what we want to achieve. McDonnell says Labour policies could save families more than \u00a37,000 a year if someone needs personal care. That\u2019s why Labour has a fair approach to tax: raising income tax rates for the top 5% while closing loopholes and taxing income from wealth the same as that from work. And what a difference that could make. Paying for free childcare \u2013 saving on average almost \u00a33,000 a year per child. Providing free school meals for all primary school children, saving parents over \u00a3400 and ensuring that no child struggles to concentrate because of hunger. Paying for the personal care that we or our family members might need in old age. If you or someone in your family needs care at home, that could mean a saving of over \u00a37,000 a year. Paying for a reduction in rail fares, to keep the cost of living down and encourage more people on to public transport. And paying for free prescriptions, saving those with monthly prescriptions over a hundred pounds a year. Ask our experts a question As part of our election coverage you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Today, Libby Brooks, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland correspondent, will answer your questions about the SNP manifesto. You can ask your question via our form here. McDonnell dismisses claims that providing services for free is unrealistic. Because you\u2019ve heard the Tories and Liberal Democrats over recent weeks telling you that the essentials of life can\u2019t be provided free at the point of use, paid for through taxation. And you\u2019re a dreamer if you think otherwise. The same people whose political ancestors would have laughed at the idea of free healthcare, free roads or education are now telling you that we can\u2019t possibly provide free social care, prescriptions or childcare. McDonnell summarises some of the Labour measures that would lift living standards. In our exciting manifesto launched two weeks ago, Labour set out its plan for real change. Change that will help tackle that burden of rising living costs. How can we do that? After nearly 10 years during which it\u2019s seemed impossible that anything might change. I\u2019ll tell you where it starts. It starts with adopting the principle of \u201cdo no harm\u201d. \u201cAt least don\u2019t make things worse.\u201d So we\u2019ll scrap universal credit, stopping its rollout and putting in place a package of fixes while we design a replacement that\u2019s fit for purpose. Of course that won\u2019t help everyone. We need to raise wages across the country so people don\u2019t need to rely on universal credit. That starts with our real living wage: \u00a310 an hour, straight away, for everyone over 16. An average pay rise of up to \u00a36,000 a year. A pay rise for seven and a half million people. For public sector workers, it\u2019s a boost of 5% in the first year of a Labour government ... Our proposals to bring the major energy companies into public ownership has been independently estimated to save an average of \u00a3142 a year, while our proposals to retrofit almost every home in the country would slash the average household bill by over \u00a3400 a year. McDonnell says many people have had problems with the cost of living over the last decade. Stagnant wages have not affected just a few people; a majority of people have lost out, he says. He claims families have lost almost \u00a36,000 a year as a result of Tory policies. Labour has published today a report setting out the cost to most, of the nearly 10 years of the Conservatives in government and the policies of privatisation under successive Conservative governments. Going all the way back to the Thatcher and Major administrations selling off our nation\u2019s public utilities and natural assets. \u2018The family silver\u2019 \u2013 as a former Conservative prime minister called it. Profiteering through privatisation and the Conservatives\u2019 failure to curb rising bills has cost families nearly \u00a36,000 a year since 2010. While wages are still lower than before the financial crash, inaction and economic mismanagement by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats over the past decade has meant the cost of living for millions of households has soared. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is giving a speech in Birmingham now. He says he watched the Channel 4 Dispatches documentary about child poverty on Monday. It was shocking, he says. He urges people who have not seen it to watch it. The Guardian review of the programme is here. Here is a question from below the line. Do candidates see postal votes before election day? Candidates, or their agents, do get to see postal votes as they come in. They don\u2019t get counted before polling day, but when they are opened someone has to check they are in order, and that process is overseen by the candidates. But, under election law, no one is allowed to release information about how people have actually voted until polls close. So, if a candidate were to say \u2018Postal votes show we\u2019re on X%, and our rivals are on Y%\u2019, they would probably be committing an offence. In the video clip cited above, in response to a question about his seat being at risk, Dominic Raab says: \u201cHave a look at the postal votes.\u201d But, beyond giving a knowing look, he does not go much further than that, saying he is not giving too much away. No one is likely to be marching him away in handcuffs on the basis of that. Extinction Rebellion protesters have targeted the Liberal Democrats this morning, with one of them gluing himself to the Lib Dem battlebus. These are from my colleague Peter Walker, who is there. At his press conference later Donald Trump may be asked about the video that appeared to show world leaders including Boris Johnson, Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron joking about him at a reception last night. Our story about it is here. And here is the video. There\u2019s an interesting analysis of the SNP\u2019s manifesto from the Institute of Fiscal Studies this morning. Writing in the Scotsman, the associate director of the IFS David Phillips notes the absence of costings from the document launched by Nicola Sturgeon in Glasgow last week, but suggests that this may be because the spending plans would necessitate more, not less, austerity for Scotland if it were to become independent. Acknowledging that the manifesto \u201cisn\u2019t really about a plan of action for five years of governing the UK \u2013 rather it is about starting the process of leaving the UK in the next year\u201d, Phillips points out that plans including increasing NHS spending across the UK by \u00a3136 per head to close the gap with Scotland would require significant outlay at a time when an independent Scotland was also starting out with a serious budget deficit. Phillips adds: Pursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manifesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways ... in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more not less austerity. It should be noted that the IFS has already described both Labour and Conservative manifesto spending plans as \u201cnot credible\u201d. The SNP\u2019s own growth commission report on the economics of independence accepted that a newly independent Scotland would have to cut spending significantly in order to manage its deficit. Boris Johnson is delivering a speech at the opening of the Nato summit. He says: The fact that we live in peace today demonstrates the power of the simple proposition at the heart of this alliance: that for as long as we stand together, no one could hope to defeat us \u2013 and therefore no one will start a war. This essential principle is enshrined in article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty: that if any one of us is attacked, all of us will go to their defence. If Nato has a motto, it is: one for all, and all for one. And here\u2019s the Boris Johnson/Donald Trump handshake. President Trump has now posed for a photograph with Boris Johnson. It came after Johnson and Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, formally welcomed him to the summit. Johnson and Stoltenberg had a handshake and picture with every Nato leader one by one, ahead of the \u201cfamily photo\u201d taking place about now. On his arrival at the Nato summit the French president, Emmanuel Macron, defended his recent claim that the organisation was experiencing \u201cbrain death\u201d. Asked if he still stood by the comment, he replied: Yes, absolutely. In fact it allowed us to raise some crucial debates. He said those included how to create a durable peace in Europe and clarifying who was the enemy. So I think it was our responsibility to raise ambiguities that could be harmful, and to tackle a real strategic debate. It has started, I am satisfied. If you\u2019re a UK viewer living outside Scotland, and feeling deprived of your leaders\u2019 debate fix last night, then read on. It\u2019s fair to say that STV\u2019s debate between the Scottish party leaders \u2013 excluding Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, bizarrely \u2013 was rather a shout-fest, although it was refreshing to see Nicola Sturgeon properly interrogated on Holyrood policy, which seldom happens when she takes part in the UK-wide debates. But of course that\u2019s because education, health and so on are devolved \u2013 so while it was good to see those areas covered, they are not technically relevant to a UK general election. The format, which really felt its lack of a live audience, involved a series of questions and interrogations of each leader by the other politicians, rather than by the host, Colin Mackay, and so lent itself to people (men, Sturgeon was the only woman there) talking across one another. At one point I looked up from my notes to see the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 Jackson Carlaw shouting at the Lib Dems\u2019 Willie Rennie, Rennie shouting at Labour\u2019s Richard Leonard, and Sturgeon standing there with her arms folded like a teacher who has already tried multiple timeouts with the kids and is now just waiting for the lunch bell to go. Some interesting points: Tory leader Carlaw urged viewers to \u201clend us your vote to stop indyref2\u201d \u2013 clearly the anti-independence message is working as well for the Scottish Tories, if not better than getting Brexit done. Challenged on Boris Johnson\u2019s previous remarks about Muslim women and gay men, he admitted they were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, but insisted he would judge him on his performance in office. Carlaw and Rennie attacked Labour\u2019s \u201cclear as mud\u201d position on Brexit, mocking Leonard for being \u201cconstantly overruled\u201d by Jeremy Corbyn. Leonard struggled to answer the charge that voters didn\u2019t trust Corbyn to stand up for the union. Sturgeon failed to offer a plan B if a new Tory (or Labour) government refused her demand for the powers to hold a second independence referendum next year. Challenged on putting independence before public services, her defence of the latest Pisa report, which saw Scotland achieve its lowest scores in maths and science since it first took part in the survey almost 20 years ago and reported that pupils\u2019 performance in reading tests had recovered only to the level it was at in 2012, was weak. But at least it prompted the zingiest response of the debate from Rennie: If you are telling me that a line on a chart going down is optimistic, then the problem of numeracy in your government goes right to the top. Boris Johnson, or whoever controls his Twitter account, has just posted a picture of the PM meeting a blonde-haired admirer yesterday. But not that one ... President Trump has also retweeted the group photograph from last night. President Trump has tweeted about his meeting with Boris Johnson last night. But he hasn\u2019t included a picture. President Macron has arrived at the Nato summit venue. Arriving at the Nato summit Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said he was confident differences with Turkey over a new alliance defence plan to protect the Baltic states and Poland could be resolved. As the Press Association reports, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has threatened to block the plan after criticism of Turkey\u2019s incursion against the Kurds in northern Syria. Stoltenberg said: I am confident that we will find a solution to the updating of the revised defence plan. He said Nato leaders would for the first time discuss the rise of China, which was now the world\u2019s second biggest spender on defence. \u201cThis provides opportunities and also challenges,\u201d he said. On his arrival at the Nato summit, Boris Johnson was asked why he was avoiding being photographed with Donald Trump. (See 8.40am.) Johnson said he would be photographed with every Nato leader. Our main focus here will be all news relating to the general election campaign, and not all the news from the Nato summit, but obviously there will be an overlap. In terms of Nato coverage, we will be focusing in particular on what gets said at the final press conferences from Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. Here is the agenda for the day. From 7.45am: Nato leaders arrive at the summit. 10am: The Nato summit officially starts. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech in Birmingham. As my colleague Heather Stewart reports, he will claim that a Labour government would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year by \u201cputting a stop to rip-off Britain\u201d. 2pm: Johnson is due to hold a press conference at the end of the Nato summit. 3pm: Trump is due to hold his own press conference. 7.30pm: Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is interviewed by Andrew Neil on BBC One. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle. Boris Johnson has arrived for the Nato summit taking place at a hotel outside Watford. On his way in, he said he had had a \u201cvery good\u201d bilateral meeting with Donald Trump in No 10 last night. He continued: We discussed the future of Nato, we discussed what is going on in Syria and various other matters. However, Johnson does not seem to have thought it was important enough for the photographers to have been allowed to record it. Trump is seen as electorally toxic in the UK (he came close to admitting as much yesterday) and, although Johnson and Trump attended events at both Buckingham Palace and No 10 yesterday, as well as having their own bilateral, there is still not public picture of just the two men together. On his arrival at the Nato summit, Johnson also said there was more that united the alliance than divided it. He said: Clearly it is very important that the alliance stays together, but there is far, far more that unites us than divides us. Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary, has mounted a stout defence of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s record on foreign intervention and his attitude to Nato, suggesting that his peace-promoting credentials are in fact the best defence policy for Britain. Corbyn has, as they say in politics, been on a journey as regards his position on Nato. Five years ago \u2013 as a backbencher \u2013 he was speaking at an anti-Nato conference. Now, the Labour party he leads is campaigning on a manifesto promise to maintain the UK\u2019s commitment to Nato. Responding to suggestions that Corbyn was ambivalent over Nato, which many consider a cornerstone of the UK\u2019s national defence, Gardiner retorted: The way you defend this country is to make sure that you don\u2019t go on foreign wars and don\u2019t start bombing before you have started thinking. Ouch! Gardiner was challenged: Is that what Nato does? He continued: Consistently, if you look at the Iraq war, who was on the right side of history on that? Jeremy Corbyn was not the president at the time and indeed not the Labour party at the time under Tony Blair. But all of parliament went into that, Jeremy Corbyn did not. What I\u2019m saying is that if you look at the way in which we want to use a defensive alliance it is to think carefully through positions, to learn the lessons of the Chilcot report, learn about how we should try and prevent conflict and de-escalate a situation, rather than actually then promoting a conflict. When we went into Libya, when we joined the bombing raid on Libya, we were told it was absolutely essential to do that. I didn\u2019t vote for that, neither did Jeremy Corbyn. That has proved to be a disaster. It\u2019s proved to allow groups like Isis to form and take control and to make that country a complete basket case. Speaking on Today this morning, Jeremy Hunt denied any knowledge of talks between the UK and the US on NHS drugs pricing, despite documents unearthed recently showing that officials began negotiations during his tenure as health secretary. \u201cWhen I was health secretary, I wasn\u2019t aware of any talks going on with the United States at all,\u201d said Hunt, who left his post as foreign secretary when Boris Johnson became prime minister. In so far as there have been preliminary discussions between officials on both sides, not between politicians, we have made absolutely clear that NHS drugs prices are not on the table. I\u2019m afraid this is the traditional scare story. What would really damage the NHS are economic policies that destroy jobs in the economy and destroy the tax base that the NHS depends on. We have at the moment a very, very radical economic platform from John McDonnell which would do immense damage to our tax base and therefore our ability to fund the NHS. Since that last post, it\u2019s Damien Gayle now at the helm of the blog, taking over from my colleague Kate Lyonsr, and filling in while Andy Sparrow eats his cornflakes and limbers up to take you through the day\u2019s political drama. Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, has come out with all guns blazing over Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s attitude to Nato, the transatlantic alliance meeting in London. Last night, the heads of government of the Nato member states met for tea with the Queen at Buckingham palace, amid concern over the alliance\u2019s future after Donald Trump\u2019s complaints that other allies were not spending enough on guns and soldiers. Speaking on the Today programme, Hunt backed Trump\u2019s comments, pointing out that France, for example, spends just 1.5% of its total budget on defence, compared with the US spend of 4%, which he claimed contributed towards \u201ca third of the cost of defending Europe\u201d. But, he added: The biggest thing on the minds of those Nato leaders which they are perhaps not talking about is that in eight days\u2019 time the second-most important member of Nato [I think he means us] could elect the most anti-Nato, anti-western leader in the history of the alliance, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s been very open in the past about wanting to dismantle Nato. What the papers said A story to give you a chuckle over your breakfast: a Tory councillor climbed dustbins and scaled a school fence to escape a climate crisis debate after she met with a crowd unimpressed with her answers. Nancy Bikson\u2019s great escape would have stayed secret were it not for a 13-year-old girl who saw the incident at Priory school in Lewes, East Sussex. Trust me, everything about this story is designed to amuse. The day ahead The prime minister\u2019s time will be split between campaigning in the home counties and hosting leaders for the Nato summit. Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning in the East Midlands, while John McDonnell gives a speech on the economy in the West Midlands outlining how Labour\u2019s policies will save average people money. In the Lib Dem camp, Jo Swinson will visit a youth centre in London and then sit down for her Andrew Neil interview, which will be broadcast at 7.30pm. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, will speak at a public meeting in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, in the morning while the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, will campaign in Edinburgh. The Ulster Unionist party will launch its manifesto in Belfast. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian live blog, where we bring you all the politics news you could possibly want. We\u2019re a little more than a week out from the election and there\u2019s a lot going on today, so strap in. Donald Trump\u2019s presence in the UK for Nato talks continues to loom over the election. The summit started with heated exchanges and further tensions are expected as leaders meet again today. Donald Trump is seen as an electoral liability for the Conservatives over fears that he may be interested in putting the NHS on the table in US-UK trade talks \u2013 though yesterday the president categorically denied the US was interested in the health service. Boris Johnson has so far managed to keep his distance from Trump, with Marina Hyde writing that Johnson will continue to studiously avoid the president because \u201cTories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed\u201d. Meanwhile, Labour will today try to convince voters of the financial benefit of electing a Corbyn government. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say his party\u2019s policies would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year by \u201cputting a stop to rip-off Britain\u201d as Labour narrows its focus to bread-and-butter issues. In a dossier to be published alongside the speech, McDonnell will claim that policies including nationalising utilities and reducing the cost of rail season tickets \u2013 as well as free childcare for all two- to four-year-olds, free prescription charges and free school meals \u2013 will help the hip pocket of average households. However, Labour candidates are privately concerned about the scattergun nature of the giveaways, with one Labour saying the manifesto, while good, is \u201cjust long and confusing\u201d and some promises could appear too good to be true.",

      "body": "<p>Tagged (BBC Three) follows three of the 6,000 subjects of electronic supervision orders issued every year in the UK. In Warrington, 19-year-old Jordan must wear his ankle bracelet for 12 weeks as part of his parole conditions after finishing a prison sentence for car theft. \u201cThey keep an eye on you for six months after release \u2026 I\u2019m classed as a prolific offender,\u201d he says, not boasting, just explaining for the people at home who don\u2019t live his life. Half of which has been spent in care, and most of which currently consists of getting into fights (\u201cthe sense of relief after it \u2026\u201d) despite his best friend recently getting stabbed in one and dying in Jordan\u2019s arms. He loses his flat as a result, and ends up in a homeless shelter.</p> <p>On an inescapably deprived-looking estate in St Helens, 17-year-old Kian is \u201con tag\u201d for 12 weeks, too. He was prosecuted for carrying a machete his friend had given him for his birthday, which, he says, he gathered up with some other belongings when he stormed out of the house after a row with his sister. His mum is delighted he has been tagged. She knows where he is now and it\u2019s not \u201changing out with some of the dickheads you used to hang about with\u201d. He has always been in and out of trouble. Free-running classes at the local community centre used to help him channel some of his energy, until the funding ran out. We see him jumping effortlessly over walls and joyfully swinging off the overhead bars of a bridge as naturally as breathing, but there\u2019s no one to cultivate this ability in the lad now. His mother tells him she is proud of him sticking to his curfew, and he is childishly pleased with her praise. Seventeen is so young. Old enough to know you shouldn\u2019t go walking the streets with a machete, mind. But still so young, in so many ways.</p> <p>Tommy is older, a former soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) he remains tight-lipped about, and is first seen cleaning his home to military standards (\u201cFucking clean home\u2019s a happy home\u201d) before he goes to the local food bank for one of the millions of parcels distributed in the UK last year. He has been on tag for four months while he awaits trial for robbery. He says he had just gone to collect a debt owed on the fake tobacco he used to trade in, and that the witness who rang the police misinterpreted his demand for money. His solicitor is not convinced that a jury will agree, so to prepare for a possible five-year sentence, Tommy busies himself selling his possessions.</p> <p>These intermingled stories unfold across three 20-minute episodes instead of the traditional hour. This works tremendously well, mirroring the short-termism with which their lives are lived and leaving us as uncertain of their fates as the three central figures are themselves. It gives a compressed, kinetic feel to the whole thing, which resonates with their frustrations as they live under curfew.</p> <p>Tagged belongs to a school of documentary that really should have been recognised as a discrete genre by now. You could call it the \u201cshit rolls downhill\u201d category, home of all the shows whose makers turn their attention to the overlooked and the underprivileged and serve up \u2013 be it in 20-, 30- or 60-minute chunks or whole series \u2013 more and more irrefutable evidence of this abiding truth. This week, we had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/02/growing-up-poor-britains-breadline-kids-review-the-lives-stolen-by-poverty\" title=\"\">Britain\u2019s Breadline Kids</a>, which showed how one ordinary piece of bad luck (bereavement, divorce, job loss) can precipitate an avalanche of crises \u2013 especially among those who are already vulnerable.

      "bodyText": "Tagged (BBC Three) follows three of the 6,000 subjects of electronic supervision orders issued every year in the UK. In Warrington, 19-year-old Jordan must wear his ankle bracelet for 12 weeks as part of his parole conditions after finishing a prison sentence for car theft. \u201cThey keep an eye on you for six months after release \u2026 I\u2019m classed as a prolific offender,\u201d he says, not boasting, just explaining for the people at home who don\u2019t live his life. Half of which has been spent in care, and most of which currently consists of getting into fights (\u201cthe sense of relief after it \u2026\u201d) despite his best friend recently getting stabbed in one and dying in Jordan\u2019s arms. He loses his flat as a result, and ends up in a homeless shelter. On an inescapably deprived-looking estate in St Helens, 17-year-old Kian is \u201con tag\u201d for 12 weeks, too. He was prosecuted for carrying a machete his friend had given him for his birthday, which, he says, he gathered up with some other belongings when he stormed out of the house after a row with his sister. His mum is delighted he has been tagged. She knows where he is now and it\u2019s not \u201changing out with some of the dickheads you used to hang about with\u201d. He has always been in and out of trouble. Free-running classes at the local community centre used to help him channel some of his energy, until the funding ran out. We see him jumping effortlessly over walls and joyfully swinging off the overhead bars of a bridge as naturally as breathing, but there\u2019s no one to cultivate this ability in the lad now. His mother tells him she is proud of him sticking to his curfew, and he is childishly pleased with her praise. Seventeen is so young. Old enough to know you shouldn\u2019t go walking the streets with a machete, mind. But still so young, in so many ways. Tommy is older, a former soldier with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) he remains tight-lipped about, and is first seen cleaning his home to military standards (\u201cFucking clean home\u2019s a happy home\u201d) before he goes to the local food bank for one of the millions of parcels distributed in the UK last year. He has been on tag for four months while he awaits trial for robbery. He says he had just gone to collect a debt owed on the fake tobacco he used to trade in, and that the witness who rang the police misinterpreted his demand for money. His solicitor is not convinced that a jury will agree, so to prepare for a possible five-year sentence, Tommy busies himself selling his possessions. These intermingled stories unfold across three 20-minute episodes instead of the traditional hour. This works tremendously well, mirroring the short-termism with which their lives are lived and leaving us as uncertain of their fates as the three central figures are themselves. It gives a compressed, kinetic feel to the whole thing, which resonates with their frustrations as they live under curfew. Tagged belongs to a school of documentary that really should have been recognised as a discrete genre by now. You could call it the \u201cshit rolls downhill\u201d category, home of all the shows whose makers turn their attention to the overlooked and the underprivileged and serve up \u2013 be it in 20-, 30- or 60-minute chunks or whole series \u2013 more and more irrefutable evidence of this abiding truth. This week, we had Britain\u2019s Breadline Kids, which showed how one ordinary piece of bad luck (bereavement, divorce, job loss) can precipitate an avalanche of crises \u2013 especially among those who are already vulnerable. And there are many other examples, about the ramifications of dementia and caring responsibilities or the woefully underserved children in the foster system, and so on across all terrestrial channels and just about every other platform, too. I\u2019d call this growing genre \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d but for the fact that would imply that power is listening. So far, there is no sign. We leave the three men in Tagged on relatively positive notes \u2013 Tommy is found not guilty, Jordan\u2019s tag is taken off, and he says as he drinks his first pint without it that he is \u201cSick of being a knobhead \u2026 sick of stress \u2026 fighting \u2026 getting hurt. Decided I\u2019m gonna do honest work. Honest work isn\u2019t stressful.\u201d Kian is detagged, gets a landscaping job and plans to pay his mum back for the fine. But pull back the camera \u2013 will a \u201cprolific offender\u201d find employment before his resolve wears off? Will there be free, accessible support for Tommy to undo the traumas and PTSD he cannot even put into words? \u2013 and the greater truth remains.

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s Jeremy Sinclair\u2019s entry into the book of silly things said by advertising folk: \u201c2018 was our 10th year of growth,\u201d declared the chairman of M&amp;C Saatchi in the annual report in May. \u201cGrowth of profit, earnings and dividends. Whilst it might be too early to say we\u2019ve cracked it, it does seem that the strategy is proving itself.\u201d</p> <p>M&amp;C Saatchi\u2019s share price at the time was 360p. Now it is 79p, a level last seen in 2010, so yes, it was a tad premature to declare a great triumph. Even Sinclair\u2019s boast about profits growth last year may need to be revisited in light of the ad firm\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/04/mc-saatchi-accounting-scandal-deepens-shares-plunge-profit-warning\">latest confessions</a>. An adjustment of \u00a311.6m to reflect \u201caccounting misstatements\u201d will be spread between the financial results for 2018 and 2019.</p> <p>When the latter figures appear, let\u2019s hope the chair of the audit committee, Sir Michael Peat, the former private secretary to the Prince of Wales and a member of the family that supplied the \u201cP\u201d in KPMG, will explain to shareholders what went wrong with the financial controls. The timing of revenue recognition, for example, is meant to be basic stuff.</p> <p>For good measure, M&amp;C Saatchi threw in a profits warning, plus news that it will be \u201crestructuring its UK office,\u201d by which it meant the people rather than the plush premises in Soho\u2019s Golden Square. The departees, it is safe to assume, will not include the crew of famous Thatcher-era ad men who fled from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to found their new agency in 1995 \u2013 Sinclair, Maurice Saatchi himself, Bill Muirhead and the chief executive, David Kershaw.</p> <p>And what about the strategy, the one that was \u201cproving itself\u201d? The goal is to \u201cmake people rich\u201d \u2013 those at M&amp;C Saatchi in the centre and the advertising startups who join the network. The carrot for the entrepreneurs is supposed to be the chance to earn some M&amp;C Saatchi equity but that prize (expressed in fixed number of shares) will look substantially less glittering at the new sunken stock market value.</p> <p>That\u2019s the problem with a model of \u201cshared ownership, shared objectives and shared ambitions\u201d. It works splendidly when everyone is aligned to a share price that is rising, but there is potential for aggro after a big fall. It is why the City speculates that the tale will end in breakup or takeover.</p> <p>Still, it\u2019s fertile material for an adland drama and luckily Michael Dobbs, author of House of Cards, is on hand as a non-executive director in the star-studded boardroom. House of Hubris might work.</p> <h2>UK property investors head for the exit</h2> <p>Brexit is killing property investors\u2019 appetite for risk. That statement is not fresh news, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/dec/04/m-and-g-suspends-property-portfolio-fund-retail-downturn-brexit\">the suspension of dealings in M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a32.5bn Property Portfolio fund</a> is a vivid example of what\u2019s happening.</p> <p>Property is an investment class where you\u2019re supposed to sit tight, collect the rental income and ride a cycle or two. That invitation is easy to refuse, however, if, say, you are a foreign investor. You may still wish, in principle, to own property in the UK, but you don\u2019t want to be exposed to a currency that could fall by 15% if Brexit goes badly.</p> <p>Private investors in the UK, who are the main target for the M&amp;G fund, can read the same breezes and are heading for the exit. Their mood may change if departure happens at the end of January, but don\u2019t bet on it. Negotiation of the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU has the potential to cause as much currency uncertainty.</p> <p>However, the rotten retail climate, the other main factor cited by M&amp;G, seems to be the main problem. The crisis on the high street shows no sign of abating. While property prices have fallen, we haven\u2019t yet witnessed a cathartic moment, such as a big landlord going bust. That may lie ahead.</p> <p>The M&amp;G suspension also underlines the madness of offering daily dealings in funds that are invested in illiquid assets. Mark Carney annoyed the investment industry when he said such structures were \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d, but the governor of the Bank of England was essentially correct. Planned reforms, such as halting trading if a fifth of the assets can\u2019t be valued accurately, can\u2019t arrive soon enough.</p> <h2>Time was up for Metro Bank chief</h2> <p>Craig Donaldson tried to resign as chief executive of Metro Bank after the accounting calamity at the start of this year, but the board wouldn\u2019t let him go. Now he\u2019s off.</p> <p>What\u2019s changed, one assumes, is that Vernon Hill, Metro\u2019s domineering founder and chairman, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/metro-bank-chairman-resigns-immediately-after-torrid-year\">has also gone</a>. It\u2019s the right decision. Donaldson had his fans, but a chief executive can\u2019t survive a horrible year like Metro\u2019s. He had to go.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Jeremy Sinclair\u2019s entry into the book of silly things said by advertising folk: \u201c2018 was our 10th year of growth,\u201d declared the chairman of M&amp;C Saatchi in the annual report in May. \u201cGrowth of profit, earnings and dividends. Whilst it might be too early to say we\u2019ve cracked it, it does seem that the strategy is proving itself.\u201d M&amp;C Saatchi\u2019s share price at the time was 360p. Now it is 79p, a level last seen in 2010, so yes, it was a tad premature to declare a great triumph. Even Sinclair\u2019s boast about profits growth last year may need to be revisited in light of the ad firm\u2019s latest confessions. An adjustment of \u00a311.6m to reflect \u201caccounting misstatements\u201d will be spread between the financial results for 2018 and 2019. When the latter figures appear, let\u2019s hope the chair of the audit committee, Sir Michael Peat, the former private secretary to the Prince of Wales and a member of the family that supplied the \u201cP\u201d in KPMG, will explain to shareholders what went wrong with the financial controls. The timing of revenue recognition, for example, is meant to be basic stuff. For good measure, M&amp;C Saatchi threw in a profits warning, plus news that it will be \u201crestructuring its UK office,\u201d by which it meant the people rather than the plush premises in Soho\u2019s Golden Square. The departees, it is safe to assume, will not include the crew of famous Thatcher-era ad men who fled from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to found their new agency in 1995 \u2013 Sinclair, Maurice Saatchi himself, Bill Muirhead and the chief executive, David Kershaw. And what about the strategy, the one that was \u201cproving itself\u201d? The goal is to \u201cmake people rich\u201d \u2013 those at M&amp;C Saatchi in the centre and the advertising startups who join the network. The carrot for the entrepreneurs is supposed to be the chance to earn some M&amp;C Saatchi equity but that prize (expressed in fixed number of shares) will look substantially less glittering at the new sunken stock market value. That\u2019s the problem with a model of \u201cshared ownership, shared objectives and shared ambitions\u201d. It works splendidly when everyone is aligned to a share price that is rising, but there is potential for aggro after a big fall. It is why the City speculates that the tale will end in breakup or takeover. Still, it\u2019s fertile material for an adland drama and luckily Michael Dobbs, author of House of Cards, is on hand as a non-executive director in the star-studded boardroom. House of Hubris might work. UK property investors head for the exit Brexit is killing property investors\u2019 appetite for risk. That statement is not fresh news, but the suspension of dealings in M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a32.5bn Property Portfolio fund is a vivid example of what\u2019s happening. Property is an investment class where you\u2019re supposed to sit tight, collect the rental income and ride a cycle or two. That invitation is easy to refuse, however, if, say, you are a foreign investor. You may still wish, in principle, to own property in the UK, but you don\u2019t want to be exposed to a currency that could fall by 15% if Brexit goes badly. Private investors in the UK, who are the main target for the M&amp;G fund, can read the same breezes and are heading for the exit. Their mood may change if departure happens at the end of January, but don\u2019t bet on it. Negotiation of the UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU has the potential to cause as much currency uncertainty. However, the rotten retail climate, the other main factor cited by M&amp;G, seems to be the main problem. The crisis on the high street shows no sign of abating. While property prices have fallen, we haven\u2019t yet witnessed a cathartic moment, such as a big landlord going bust. That may lie ahead. The M&amp;G suspension also underlines the madness of offering daily dealings in funds that are invested in illiquid assets. Mark Carney annoyed the investment industry when he said such structures were \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d, but the governor of the Bank of England was essentially correct. Planned reforms, such as halting trading if a fifth of the assets can\u2019t be valued accurately, can\u2019t arrive soon enough. Time was up for Metro Bank chief Craig Donaldson tried to resign as chief executive of Metro Bank after the accounting calamity at the start of this year, but the board wouldn\u2019t let him go. Now he\u2019s off. What\u2019s changed, one assumes, is that Vernon Hill, Metro\u2019s domineering founder and chairman, has also gone. It\u2019s the right decision. Donaldson had his fans, but a chief executive can\u2019t survive a horrible year like Metro\u2019s. He had to go.",

I didn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p> <p>Neatly handwritten on yellow paper, though with six corrections, this recollection was probably set down shortly after Rosa Parks\u2019s arrest for refusing to surrender her seat on a crowded bus to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama, on the evening of 1 December 1955.</p> <p>It is now among 90 items \u2013 writings, reflections, photographs, records and memorabilia \u2013 that go on public display on Thursday in the first exhibition of Parks\u2019s personal collection at the Library of Congress in Washington.</p> <p>The young woman\u2019s decision to disobey a law requiring black passengers to give up seats to white passengers when the bus was full was a milestone in the civil rights struggle.</p> <p>It triggered a 381-day boycott of the Montgomery bus system and led to a 1956 supreme court decision banning segregation on public transport.</p> <p>Jane Gunter, 80, a white woman, was on the bus that day, recently married and pregnant.<em> </em>\u201cI sat down on the long seat behind the driver and was lost in my thoughts,\u201d she recalled on Wednesday, having travelled from Atlanta for a first look at the show. \u201cI was alone and all of a sudden the commotion started when this big man got up in front of me and was looking down the aisle and shouted out, \u2018You gotta let me have that seat!\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI said, \u2018She can have my seat!\u2019 And when I did that, a tall, fair-skinned man pushed his knees into mine and said, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare.\u2019 At that time women did what men said, period, no discussions. I sat down and when the driver got off to call the police \u2013 we didn\u2019t have cellphones back then \u2013 he had to use a payphone and he demanded that all of the riders get off the bus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cd31f898fb90cedcb4cd6b898e5b32ce95c3872\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd31f898fb90cedcb4cd6b898e5b32ce95c3872/0_226_5748_3449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A personal bible that was carried by Rosa Parks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A personal bible that was carried by Rosa Parks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Parks was arrested but it was the start of a lifelong friendship with Gunter, who has run a ministry that takes care of the poor for 38 years. \u201cShe was a great woman, strong but tender. She reminded me of what a grandmother would look like. She had wisdom but yet she was a lot of fun,\u201d Gunter said of Parks.</p> <p>Parks died aged 92 at her home in Detroit, Michigan, in October 2005, and became the first woman to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/29/usa.garyyounge\">lie in honour</a> in the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington. \u201cShe would have been happy,\u201d about the election of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>, the first black president, Gunter said, but \u201cI have no idea\u201d what she would have made of Donald Trump.</p> <p>Although Parks has been generally framed as a quiet seamstress defined by the bus incident \u2013 it even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/21/doctor-who-recap-series-37-episode-3-rosa\">featured in Doctor Who</a> last year \u2013 Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words, which has been in the works since the library received the collection on loan from the Howard G Buffett Foundation in 2014, makes clear that it was merely one episode in the life of a rebel with a cause.</p> <p>Exhibits include the Parks family Bible, her account of \u201ckeeping vigil\u201d with her grandfather to protect their home from the Ku Klux Klan, a manuscript in which Parks recalls a childhood encounter with a white boy who threatened to hit her, documentation of the Montgomery bus boycott, a handmade blue dress from her wardrobe, letters to congressman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/27/john-conyers-democrat-dies\">John Conyers</a> when Parks worked on his congressional staff from 1965 to 1988 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded to her at the White House in 1996.</p> <p>Together they tell the story of a woman who advocated for racial equality and the rights of women, workers and prisoners and who affirmed the Black Power movement, which evoked her grandfather\u2019s Garveyism.

She was a woman. She was a wife. She was a mother. She was a daughter. She was an aunt. She was a young girl who attracted the boys and she went to dances and parties.</p> <p>Cannon, Afro-American history and culture specialist for the library\u2019s manuscript division, added: \u201cThe power of this collection is that it reveals the truth of a public figure that we thought we knew, that we discover we didn\u2019t really know. That\u2019s the power of any real manuscript collection: that surprise.\u201d</p> <p>Parks saved money by being an early recycler of papers, aluminium foil, jars and tea bags. She wrote one note on the back of a pharmacy bag. The exhibition includes some handpicked quotations. One says: \u201cI want to be remembered as a person who stood up to injustice \u2026 and most of all, I want to be remembered as a person who wanted to be free and wanted others to be free.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI had been pushed around all my life and felt at this moment that I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. When I asked the policeman why we had to be pushed around? He said he didn\u2019t know. \u2018The law is the law. You are under arrest\u2019. I didn\u2019t resist.\u201d Neatly handwritten on yellow paper, though with six corrections, this recollection was probably set down shortly after Rosa Parks\u2019s arrest for refusing to surrender her seat on a crowded bus to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama, on the evening of 1 December 1955. It is now among 90 items \u2013 writings, reflections, photographs, records and memorabilia \u2013 that go on public display on Thursday in the first exhibition of Parks\u2019s personal collection at the Library of Congress in Washington. The young woman\u2019s decision to disobey a law requiring black passengers to give up seats to white passengers when the bus was full was a milestone in the civil rights struggle. It triggered a 381-day boycott of the Montgomery bus system and led to a 1956 supreme court decision banning segregation on public transport. Jane Gunter, 80, a white woman, was on the bus that day, recently married and pregnant. \u201cI sat down on the long seat behind the driver and was lost in my thoughts,\u201d she recalled on Wednesday, having travelled from Atlanta for a first look at the show. \u201cI was alone and all of a sudden the commotion started when this big man got up in front of me and was looking down the aisle and shouted out, \u2018You gotta let me have that seat!\u2019 \u201cI said, \u2018She can have my seat!\u2019 And when I did that, a tall, fair-skinned man pushed his knees into mine and said, \u2018Don\u2019t you dare.\u2019 At that time women did what men said, period, no discussions. I sat down and when the driver got off to call the police \u2013 we didn\u2019t have cellphones back then \u2013 he had to use a payphone and he demanded that all of the riders get off the bus.\u201d Parks was arrested but it was the start of a lifelong friendship with Gunter, who has run a ministry that takes care of the poor for 38 years. \u201cShe was a great woman, strong but tender. She reminded me of what a grandmother would look like. She had wisdom but yet she was a lot of fun,\u201d Gunter said of Parks. Parks died aged 92 at her home in Detroit, Michigan, in October 2005, and became the first woman to lie in honour in the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington. \u201cShe would have been happy,\u201d about the election of Barack Obama, the first black president, Gunter said, but \u201cI have no idea\u201d what she would have made of Donald Trump. Although Parks has been generally framed as a quiet seamstress defined by the bus incident \u2013 it even featured in Doctor Who last year \u2013 Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words, which has been in the works since the library received the collection on loan from the Howard G Buffett Foundation in 2014, makes clear that it was merely one episode in the life of a rebel with a cause. Exhibits include the Parks family Bible, her account of \u201ckeeping vigil\u201d with her grandfather to protect their home from the Ku Klux Klan, a manuscript in which Parks recalls a childhood encounter with a white boy who threatened to hit her, documentation of the Montgomery bus boycott, a handmade blue dress from her wardrobe, letters to congressman John Conyers when Parks worked on his congressional staff from 1965 to 1988 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded to her at the White House in 1996. Together they tell the story of a woman who advocated for racial equality and the rights of women, workers and prisoners and who affirmed the Black Power movement, which evoked her grandfather\u2019s Garveyism. She spoke out against apartheid in South Africa and other injustices around the world. In one letter, Parks writes: \u201cI would rather be lynched than live to be mistreated and not be allowed to say \u2018I don\u2019t like it.\u2019\u201d Adrienne Cannon, the curator of the exhibition, said: \u201cWe want to present her as a seasoned, lifelong activist and we also want to show that\u2019s not all of who she was. She was a woman. She was a wife. She was a mother. She was a daughter. She was an aunt. She was a young girl who attracted the boys and she went to dances and parties. Cannon, Afro-American history and culture specialist for the library\u2019s manuscript division, added: \u201cThe power of this collection is that it reveals the truth of a public figure that we thought we knew, that we discover we didn\u2019t really know. That\u2019s the power of any real manuscript collection: that surprise.\u201d Parks saved money by being an early recycler of papers, aluminium foil, jars and tea bags. She wrote one note on the back of a pharmacy bag. The exhibition includes some handpicked quotations. One says: \u201cI want to be remembered as a person who stood up to injustice \u2026 and most of all, I want to be remembered as a person who wanted to be free and wanted others to be free.\u201d",

State district Judge Keno Vasquez on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order against a group called We Build the Wall, which raised $25m through crowdfunding and other means after promising to build its own private barrier on parts of the border between the US and Texas. Vasquez set a 17 December hearing for We Build the Wall and its founder, military veteran Brian Kolfage, to appear in court in the south-eastern Texas city of Edinburg, near McAllen on the border. The judge said the project risked causing \u201cimminent and irreparable harm\u201d to the area. We Build the Wall announced on Facebook last month that it was starting construction of a section of wall on private land in Hidalgo county next to the Rio Grande, the river that separates the US and Mexico in Texas. It posted videos that showed a construction foreman describing plans to install posts a short distance from the riverbank. The announcement drew immediate criticism from the not-for-profit National Butterfly Center, which is located near the site and filed the motion for the temporary restraining order. Wall opponents also say private construction could worsen erosion or push floodwaters on to other people\u2019s property in a storm, in addition to threatening the delicate biodiversity of the area. The plans also drew the attention of the International Boundary and Water Commission, an agency set up by the US and Mexico under treaty obligations where both sides agree to cooperate on any changes to the riverbank that could affect the other side. The commission has asked We Build the Wall and Fisher Industries, its construction partner, for more information. Rightist Trump allies including Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach have been involved with the groups\u2019 construction projects. Kolfage has said his organization won\u2019t begin construction until it gets the commission\u2019s approval. The butterfly center and the advocacy group EarthJustice issued a statement on Wednesday calling We Build the Wall\u2019s plans \u201cillegal\u201d. \u201cThe incredible biodiversity found here, supported and enhanced by 17 years of labor and millions of dollars of investment, is integral to the health of a fragile, but vibrant ecosystem and warrants protection against this unlawful incursion,\u201d said Jeffrey Glassberg, president of the North American Butterfly Association, in a statement.

      "bodyText": "Jo Swinson has repeatedly apologised for her role in austerity measures under the Lib Dem-Conservative coalition after she was pressed in a BBC interview over why her party is seeking to roll back several measures she voted for in the 2010-15 administration. \u201cI am sorry that I did that. It was not the right policy. And we should have stopped it,\u201d the Lib Dem leader said, when asked by Andrew Neil if she wanted to apologise to people affected by the bedroom tax, saying her party would reverse the policy. Swinson, who is facing criticism of her tactical decisions and voter appeal in a campaign which has seen the Lib Dems\u2019 poll rating gradually slip, also said she would remain as leader even the party ended up with fewer than the 21 MPs they began the election with. \u201cI\u2019m continuing as Liberal Democrat leader,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do and I\u2019ve just been elected to do it.\u201d Asked if she would remain regardless of the result, she replied: \u201cI\u2019m here to stay and we\u2019re going to get a great result.\u201d Swinson is among the leaders of all the main political parties to undergo a grilling from Neil, with the exception of Boris Johnson, who is refusing to agree to an appearance. The quizzing on benefit cuts began with Neil noting that the Lib Dems wanted to scrap the bedroom tax, which cuts benefits for people living in social homes with more rooms than they are deemed to need. \u201cWho voted nine times to introduce the bedroom tax?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe Liberal Democrats in government, including myself,\u201d said Swinson, who held various junior ministerial roles from 2012 to 2015. She added: \u201cWhich I have previously said \u2013 and I\u2019m happy to say again \u2013 was wrong. And I\u2019m sorry about that, and it was one of the things that we did get wrong.\u201d Swinson also acknowledged that while in the coalition she backed the benefits cap, which limits the maximum benefits income a family can receive regardless of circumstances, and private tendering in the NHS \u2013 all of which she now wants to reverse. Asked why voters should trust her, Swinson said: \u201cClearly we didn\u2019t win every battle against the Conservatives. We fought many battles and we did win battles for more money for schools, for more money for the poorest pupils, for managing to cut tax for the lowest paid. To introduce same sex marriage. There\u2019s many things that I\u2019m very proud of where we made a difference. \u201cBut of course, of course there were things where we didn\u2019t win those battles, and I\u2019m sorry about that. It was not a Liberal Democrat government, it was a coalition government.\u201d Swinson has faced criticism for beginning the election campaign with the argument she could become prime minister. Asked about this by Neil, she said: \u201cClearly, when you look at the polls that\u2019s not the most likely scenario. I will certainly grant you that.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, a campaign visit by Swinson to a youth centre in Streatham, south London, was disrupted by protesters from the Extinction Rebellion protest group, dressed as bees. One of the activists glued his hand to the windscreen of the Lib Dem battle bus. Extinction Rebellion is targeting every party. Other members, also dressed as bees, lay on the floor of the Brexit party\u2019s office in Grimsby, while others later glued themselves to the Brexit party bus. Swinson met the protesters, arguing with them that the Lib Dem\u2019s target of becoming carbon neutral by 2045 was realistic and could be shortened as technology advanced.",

Though that reform was never formally announced, it became a lightning rod for widespread dissatisfaction with the government of Duque, whose approval rating has dropped to just 26% since he took office in August last year.

Police have often responded with teargas and \u201cless lethal\u201d bean bag rounds and flash bangs. One 18-year-old protester, Dilan Cruz, was killed by riot police after being shot in the head with a bean bag on 23 November. The incident infuriated demonstrators and led strike organisers to demand the dismantling of Esmad, Colombia\u2019s feared riot police squadron, who they accuse of readily using excessive force.

Strike organisers are also demanding the scrapping of proposed economic reforms and that the government honour the peace deal. Despite the ongoing demonstrations, some analysts suspect that Christmas could offer Duque a much-needed reprieve. \u201cThe protests will take a break for the holiday season, unless something egregious happens, and are likely to pick up in the new year,\u201d said Sergio Guzm\u00e1n, the director of Colombia Risk Analysis. \u201cThe big risk is if the protests transcend their urban nature and spill over into rural areas.\u201d",

His 325 wickets from 90 matches place him at number four in the list of all-time English wicket-takers in Test cricket. Yet you would never have guessed that if you looked across the dressing room at the exhausted figure in the string vest after a long day in the field.</p> \n<p>Willis had no right to be such a successful pace bowler. He possessed sparrows\u2019 legs and wonky knees, which were frequently visited by surgeons; he had a pigeon-chest that was inhabited by half a dozen measly hairs and he was seemingly devoid of any biceps. Not even Heath Robinson would have had the gall to design a fast-bowling machine like this. Yet Willis, with his mop of straggly hair, which was often his most convincing sign of hostility, adorned the England side for more than 13 years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/04/bob-willis-obituary\">Bob Willis obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He was there as a gawky 21-year-old replacement, pitchforked into the Test team in Sydney under Ray Illingworth on the 1970-71 tour; under Tony Greig he broke Rick McCosker\u2019s jaw in the Centenary Test of 1977; under Mike Brearley he famously delivered eight for 43 when rampaging down the slope at Headingley in 1981 and under David Gower he witnessed at first hand Gordon Greenidge making England\u2019s declaration look rather silly at Lord\u2019s in 1984. In between he led England in 18 Test matches as well as in the World Cup of 1983, the only specialist fast bowler ever to do so (we must regard Gubby Allen and Johnny Douglas as all-rounders and Alfred Shaw\u2019s bowling could probably not be classified as \u201cfast\u201d when he was captain on the 1881-82 tour of Australia).</p> \n<p>So how could such a flawed physical specimen achieve so much? Willis\u2019s height \u2013 he was 6ft 6in tall, when this was an unusual phenomenon \u2013 was an advantage but it might have been his only obvious one. His action, which defied the traditional notion that cricket had to be a sideways game, did little to delight the purists \u2013 or Fred Trueman. Nor did his massive and sometimes meandering run-up to the crease, where on bad days he had a habit of overstepping.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"00e61124-e198-4426-83a7-c2acae4676da\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ccRSt38XMG0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, Willis possessed many invisible virtues. He had a deep reservoir of willpower and he drove himself ferociously hard \u2013 running miles to improve his stamina in an age when this was not a conventional thing to do. He was also utterly single-minded, a characteristic which may have prompted him to give himself a third initial \u2013 D for Dylan, in homage to Bob \u2013 long before he had any captaincy designs and which also accounted for his vigorous disapproval of those who signed up for Kerry Packer in 1977.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/04/bob-willis-former-england-cricket-captain-dies-aged-70\">Bob Willis, former England cricket captain, dies aged 70</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For a while his colleague at Edgbaston, Dennis Amiss, a Packer signatory, was ostracised. Willis shunned not only Packer but also the first rebel tour of South Africa so that his England career was only ever interrupted by injury or loss of form \u2013 unlike many of his peers.</p> \n<p>His most memorable performance was, of course, at Headingley in 1981. On that Test\u2019s rest day he feared it would be his last since England were in a hopeless position and he had bowled so poorly. He once described himself as \u201ca born pessimist\u201d and this was a case in point. Perhaps those eight wickets did help to prolong his career by three years but remember he took 317 other Test wickets all around the globe. He could bowl fast and, as time passed, he could bowl accurately.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51b14ac0ed5e40358c29c230fec2c961aec1e6df\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51b14ac0ed5e40358c29c230fec2c961aec1e6df/0_127_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Willis, second left, here with Ian Botham and Jimmy Anderson (second right).

Willis moved into broadcasting after retiring as a player and coach.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus/Corbis via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In that famous spell in Leeds he was in a trance, oblivious to the outside world, a state he often pursued with the ball in his hand. Brearley had told him to forget about the no-balls that had been plaguing him and to bowl fast. And so he did. He was still in another world after the game when he gave that unsmiling, monosyllabic interview to a startled Peter West, who never set out to antagonise anyone.</p> \n<p>As a player \u2013 and especially as a captain \u2013 Willis often had a spiky relationship with the media. On his first tour as England captain he instructed his team not to waste any time communing with the press with such vigour that Graeme Fowler declined to say \u201cgood morning\u201d to them in the hotel lift on the way to breakfast the following morning. Another meeting had to be held to ensure a semblance of civility between press and players.</p> \n<p>When Willis was assistant manager to the England team in West Indies on the 1985-86 tour he was once asked by a BA steward if there was anything he wanted to be taken back to England. \u201cThirty-four journalists and two camera crews\u201d was his response. While still captain he declared: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when I give up but I can tell you this: I\u2019m not going to go on TV slagging off the players.\u201d Which is what he did rather brilliantly on Sky TV\u2019s The Verdict towards the end of a long broadcasting career.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2019/dec/04/bob-willis-a-life-in-pictures\">Bob Willis \u2013 a life in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As captain he had, with some reluctance, to desert the back of the bus, where he had been a lively, quick-witted presence on earlier tours. He was not a brilliant tactician. And it was hard to attend to the minutiae in the field when he was consumed by his own bowling while 40 yards from his nearest colleague at the end of his run-up. But the example he set on the field as he strained every creaking sinew could be inspirational. Moreover his record was not so bad, winning seven and losing five of his 18 Tests in charge. England\u2019s 2-1 defeat on the 1982-83 tour to Australia would have been his greatest disappointment, being persuaded to bowl first in Adelaide on that tour his greatest regret.</p> \n<p>Teammates are a reliable barometer and you would be hard-pressed to find any who do not speak well of Willis, citing not only his unrelenting passion for playing for England but also a piercing, dry sense of humour. Away from the cricket he smiled quite often and was the most entertaining of companions. Perhaps more telling are reports of a dinner that Willis had with England\u2019s pace bowlers a couple of years ago. The youngsters arrived warily since this was the man who always seemed to be slagging them off on Sky; they left enlightened and entertained after the most congenial of evenings, recognising that Bob Willis was actually one of them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bob Willis was one of England\u2019s greatest fast bowlers. His 325 wickets from 90 matches place him at number four in the list of all-time English wicket-takers in Test cricket. Yet you would never have guessed that if you looked across the dressing room at the exhausted figure in the string vest after a long day in the field. Willis had no right to be such a successful pace bowler. He possessed sparrows\u2019 legs and wonky knees, which were frequently visited by surgeons; he had a pigeon-chest that was inhabited by half a dozen measly hairs and he was seemingly devoid of any biceps. Not even Heath Robinson would have had the gall to design a fast-bowling machine like this. Yet Willis, with his mop of straggly hair, which was often his most convincing sign of hostility, adorned the England side for more than 13 years. He was there as a gawky 21-year-old replacement, pitchforked into the Test team in Sydney under Ray Illingworth on the 1970-71 tour; under Tony Greig he broke Rick McCosker\u2019s jaw in the Centenary Test of 1977; under Mike Brearley he famously delivered eight for 43 when rampaging down the slope at Headingley in 1981 and under David Gower he witnessed at first hand Gordon Greenidge making England\u2019s declaration look rather silly at Lord\u2019s in 1984. In between he led England in 18 Test matches as well as in the World Cup of 1983, the only specialist fast bowler ever to do so (we must regard Gubby Allen and Johnny Douglas as all-rounders and Alfred Shaw\u2019s bowling could probably not be classified as \u201cfast\u201d when he was captain on the 1881-82 tour of Australia). So how could such a flawed physical specimen achieve so much? Willis\u2019s height \u2013 he was 6ft 6in tall, when this was an unusual phenomenon \u2013 was an advantage but it might have been his only obvious one. His action, which defied the traditional notion that cricket had to be a sideways game, did little to delight the purists \u2013 or Fred Trueman. Nor did his massive and sometimes meandering run-up to the crease, where on bad days he had a habit of overstepping. However, Willis possessed many invisible virtues. He had a deep reservoir of willpower and he drove himself ferociously hard \u2013 running miles to improve his stamina in an age when this was not a conventional thing to do. He was also utterly single-minded, a characteristic which may have prompted him to give himself a third initial \u2013 D for Dylan, in homage to Bob \u2013 long before he had any captaincy designs and which also accounted for his vigorous disapproval of those who signed up for Kerry Packer in 1977. For a while his colleague at Edgbaston, Dennis Amiss, a Packer signatory, was ostracised. Willis shunned not only Packer but also the first rebel tour of South Africa so that his England career was only ever interrupted by injury or loss of form \u2013 unlike many of his peers. His most memorable performance was, of course, at Headingley in 1981. On that Test\u2019s rest day he feared it would be his last since England were in a hopeless position and he had bowled so poorly. He once described himself as \u201ca born pessimist\u201d and this was a case in point. Perhaps those eight wickets did help to prolong his career by three years but remember he took 317 other Test wickets all around the globe. He could bowl fast and, as time passed, he could bowl accurately. In that famous spell in Leeds he was in a trance, oblivious to the outside world, a state he often pursued with the ball in his hand. Brearley had told him to forget about the no-balls that had been plaguing him and to bowl fast. And so he did. He was still in another world after the game when he gave that unsmiling, monosyllabic interview to a startled Peter West, who never set out to antagonise anyone. As a player \u2013 and especially as a captain \u2013 Willis often had a spiky relationship with the media. On his first tour as England captain he instructed his team not to waste any time communing with the press with such vigour that Graeme Fowler declined to say \u201cgood morning\u201d to them in the hotel lift on the way to breakfast the following morning. Another meeting had to be held to ensure a semblance of civility between press and players. When Willis was assistant manager to the England team in West Indies on the 1985-86 tour he was once asked by a BA steward if there was anything he wanted to be taken back to England. \u201cThirty-four journalists and two camera crews\u201d was his response. While still captain he declared: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when I give up but I can tell you this: I\u2019m not going to go on TV slagging off the players.\u201d Which is what he did rather brilliantly on Sky TV\u2019s The Verdict towards the end of a long broadcasting career. As captain he had, with some reluctance, to desert the back of the bus, where he had been a lively, quick-witted presence on earlier tours. He was not a brilliant tactician. And it was hard to attend to the minutiae in the field when he was consumed by his own bowling while 40 yards from his nearest colleague at the end of his run-up. But the example he set on the field as he strained every creaking sinew could be inspirational. Moreover his record was not so bad, winning seven and losing five of his 18 Tests in charge. England\u2019s 2-1 defeat on the 1982-83 tour to Australia would have been his greatest disappointment, being persuaded to bowl first in Adelaide on that tour his greatest regret. Teammates are a reliable barometer and you would be hard-pressed to find any who do not speak well of Willis, citing not only his unrelenting passion for playing for England but also a piercing, dry sense of humour. Away from the cricket he smiled quite often and was the most entertaining of companions. Perhaps more telling are reports of a dinner that Willis had with England\u2019s pace bowlers a couple of years ago. The youngsters arrived warily since this was the man who always seemed to be slagging them off on Sky; they left enlightened and entertained after the most congenial of evenings, recognising that Bob Willis was actually one of them.",

      "bodyText": "An investigation is under way at the University of Reading following a confrontation between security officers and students who attempted to occupy a building in support of staff taking strike action over pay, pensions and working conditions. A 21-year-old undergraduate has been suspended and banned from campus pending enquiries, while a 25-year-old postgraduate has been banned from campus. The students claim security was \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and say two of their number suffered bruising to their legs. More than 40,000 lecturers, technicians, librarians and other academic and support staff at 60 universities have been on strike for eight days and are due to return to work on Thursday with no sign of a breakthrough in the dispute. About a million students have been affected by the action by members of the University and College Union (UCU) and many have come out in support of university staff with student occupations at institutions including Nottingham and Edinburgh. Nine students attempted to occupy the International Capital Market Association building at Reading University on Sunday, in support not only of UCU strikes but also divestment from fossil fuels and the arms industry. At one point the students claim they were \u201cpushed back by a picked-up table and chased by security\u201d. A Reading University spokesman refused to comment on individual student disciplinary issues. \u201cThe safety and welfare of our students and staff is our number one priority, and in all incidents we review all available evidence to guide us in making appropriate decisions.\u201d Letters from the deputy vice-chancellor accuse the students of assaulting a member of security staff but Oliver Kent, the postgraduate banned from campus said security staff were \u201cheavy handed\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished my master\u2019s and won\u2019t be able to attend my graduation ceremony on 12 December,\u201d he said.

Among the 12 universities being reballoted are Imperial College London, University of the West of Scotland, Falmouth, Surrey, Northumbria, Worcester, Kent and Leeds Beckett. There are two strands to the UCU dispute. The first is over the universities superannuation scheme (USS), which was the source of a 14-day strike last year, and the second is about pay, workload, pay equality and casualisation. On the USS dispute, UCU members meet on Friday to discuss next steps, while a second report from the joint expert panel (JEP), set up to investigate the USS valuation after last year\u2019s strikes, is due to publish soon. USS employers said the JEP report should be the springboard to stepping up discussions. \u201cWe are calling on the union to work constructively with employers to deliver positive long-term changes to the USS scheme,\u201d a spokesperson said. On pay and equalities, the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) is due to report back to the UCU following consultations with universities.

      "body": "<p>A US president\u2019s low-key exit from a Nato summit, skipping the traditional press conference, would once have been perceived as a snub to the host government. But Donald Trump\u2019s departure from London will come as a relief to Boris Johnson. Mr Trump is a fan of Brexit and praises the prime minister as the man to deliver it, but his presence in the country was an electoral hazard for the Conservatives.</p> <p>Some British voters admire Mr Trump, or find him entertaining, but more do not. It is no recommendation for the Tory leader to be liked by a man notorious for dishonesty, ignorance, narcissism and chauvinism.</p> <p>The US president did one favour for his British counterpart. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/03/general-election-nhs-staff-lead-protests-as-trump-visits-london-for-nato-talks-live?page=with:block-5de634ef8f08f78465b49f49#block-5de634ef8f08f78465b49f49\" title=\"\">claimed no interest in the NHS</a> as a subject of post-Brexit trade talks. That helped rebut a Labour campaign attack, although the veracity of the denial is as doubtful as everything else Mr Trump says.</p> <p>The two men keeping a choreographed distance from one another does not dispel the perception of ideological proximity, which is problematic for Mr Johnson on many levels. European governments have largely accepted that Brexit will happen, but that does not mean they are reconciled to its strategic implications. The 2016 referendum and Mr Trump\u2019s election are associated in continental leaders\u2019 minds as twin ballot-box traumas. They appeared to herald a two-pronged assault on institutional framework that has underpinned European peace and prosperity since the second world war.</p> <p>Mr Trump has been openly contemptuous of EU leaders and engaged them in a destructive tariff war. Mr Johnson was known in Brussels as a propagandising Eurosceptic journalist before he was ever elected as an MP. His reputation for disregarding facts and reckless mischief preceded his arrival in Downing Street. Realpolitik compels continental leaders to do business with both men, but the sense that Britain and the US have been captured by a wrecking political culture has opened dangerous divisions.</p> <p>This is a bigger problem for Mr Johnson than Mr Trump. The US can afford to rip up the rules of international engagement. It is an unwise path but technically available to a superpower. The UK has no such luxury. A British prime minister who plays Mr Trump\u2019s game exposes the country to dangerous diplomatic isolation and economic decline.</p> <p>Mr Johnson appears to recognise this hazard. He reassures EU audiences of his support for their common enterprise, while seeking divergence from their regulatory framework. At the Nato summit he has emphasised continuity with the past. He has avoided being drawn on the question of whether Europe should pursue a more autonomous security agenda when Washington might no longer be reliable. That is a strategic conundrum to which Brexit offers no solution. The awkwardness of Mr Johnson\u2019s position has been neatly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/footage-appears-to-show-world-leaders-joking-about-trump-at-nato-summit\" title=\"\">captured on film</a>.

      "bodyText": "A US president\u2019s low-key exit from a Nato summit, skipping the traditional press conference, would once have been perceived as a snub to the host government. But Donald Trump\u2019s departure from London will come as a relief to Boris Johnson. Mr Trump is a fan of Brexit and praises the prime minister as the man to deliver it, but his presence in the country was an electoral hazard for the Conservatives. Some British voters admire Mr Trump, or find him entertaining, but more do not. It is no recommendation for the Tory leader to be liked by a man notorious for dishonesty, ignorance, narcissism and chauvinism. The US president did one favour for his British counterpart. He claimed no interest in the NHS as a subject of post-Brexit trade talks. That helped rebut a Labour campaign attack, although the veracity of the denial is as doubtful as everything else Mr Trump says. The two men keeping a choreographed distance from one another does not dispel the perception of ideological proximity, which is problematic for Mr Johnson on many levels. European governments have largely accepted that Brexit will happen, but that does not mean they are reconciled to its strategic implications. The 2016 referendum and Mr Trump\u2019s election are associated in continental leaders\u2019 minds as twin ballot-box traumas. They appeared to herald a two-pronged assault on institutional framework that has underpinned European peace and prosperity since the second world war. Mr Trump has been openly contemptuous of EU leaders and engaged them in a destructive tariff war. Mr Johnson was known in Brussels as a propagandising Eurosceptic journalist before he was ever elected as an MP. His reputation for disregarding facts and reckless mischief preceded his arrival in Downing Street. Realpolitik compels continental leaders to do business with both men, but the sense that Britain and the US have been captured by a wrecking political culture has opened dangerous divisions. This is a bigger problem for Mr Johnson than Mr Trump. The US can afford to rip up the rules of international engagement. It is an unwise path but technically available to a superpower. The UK has no such luxury. A British prime minister who plays Mr Trump\u2019s game exposes the country to dangerous diplomatic isolation and economic decline. Mr Johnson appears to recognise this hazard. He reassures EU audiences of his support for their common enterprise, while seeking divergence from their regulatory framework. At the Nato summit he has emphasised continuity with the past. He has avoided being drawn on the question of whether Europe should pursue a more autonomous security agenda when Washington might no longer be reliable. That is a strategic conundrum to which Brexit offers no solution. The awkwardness of Mr Johnson\u2019s position has been neatly captured on film. He appears with a group of leaders at a Nato reception, apparently all sharing a joke at Mr Trump\u2019s expense. He later denied any knowledge of the episode. The Conservatives will be glad if the whole summit is swiftly forgotten. That in itself hints at a wider cultural fraud being perpetrated in this election: the assertion of Brexit as a project of national emancipation when, on the terms currently on offer, it will make Britain more subordinate to US interests and weaker in negotiations with Brussels. Tory discomfort around Mr Trump\u2019s visit flows from widespread British mistrust of the man. That in turn is symptomatic of a cultural similarity with the rest of Europe that is much neglected in political debate. Our attachment to socialised healthcare and suspicion of US opposition to it is emblematic of a gulf between the political traditions on either side of the Atlantic. There is common history, and a common language, but just as many points of divergence. There is an appetite in Britain to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d, as Mr Johnson glibly promises, but that is a product of fatigue with the process, not a licence to turn the country into a European franchise of Trumpism. Those Conservatives who pursue such an agenda do so surreptitiously, knowing it is not one that appeals to the vast majority of British voters.",

      "bodyText": "Give Eddie Hearn his due. Not only has the promoter brought the world heavyweight championship to Saudi Arabia, he is also rapidly embracing its culture. In a country ranked 172 out of 180 in the world press freedom index \u2013 two places above Syria and seven ahead of North Korea \u2013 he did not bother to invite questions from journalists at the final press conference before Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr meet in a rematch on Saturday. Still, Hearn was able to glean a few nuggets by himself. That Ruiz is convinced his opponent will come in lighter and faster, in a bid to dance and entrance for 12 rounds. That Joshua has forewarned his audience \u201cI am not here to put on a show, I am here to win\u201d. And finally \u2013 as every fighter on the bill kept reminding us \u2013 that the hospitality of the Saudis has been spectacular. At one point Joshua even described Diriyah, on the outskirts of the capital Riyadh, as \u201cthe real Mecca of boxing\u201d \u2013 which will raise eyebrows in Las Vegas to put it mildly. The press conference might have been held in a luxury box overlooking the city\u2019s Formula E track, but there was little chance of Hearn doing a U-turn about coming to the Middle East. In fact, the promoter doubled down on his decision, lavishing praise on his hosts as he predicted a \u201chistoric\u201d night of boxing. Addressing Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, he told him: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how honoured I am to be in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We were very close to going to Wales, then I got a message from Prince Khalid. I told him: \u2018Don\u2019t waste our time.\u2019 But the passion this man had to bring the fight here was undeniable. \u201cSometimes there was shock. Sometimes there was criticism. Sitting here today I can tell you it was a wonderful, wonderful decision.\u201d Then came a delightfully sycophantic question for the prince. \u201cI know you as the one and only Big K,\u201d said Hearn, beaming like the cat that has not only got the cream but is having it mainlined into his mouth. \u201cHow does it feel to be bringing the fight here?\u201d After a few words of happiness from the prince, Hearn was off again. \u201cJust 10 weeks ago they embarked on getting a purpose-built stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not just done \u2013 it is done as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world. My stomach right now is full of butterflies. This is a new dawn for the sport of boxing.\u201d History will be the judge of that. But for now at least the big fight playbook is not so very different.

For a time, Brin had moved his desk to <a href=\"https://x.company/\">X</a>, the self-described \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d where engineers worked on projects that were expected to fail but had big potential if they didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Together, Brin and Page control 51% of a special class of Alphabet\u2019s voting shares, giving them ultimate control of the company\u2019s future direction.

      "bodyText": "Twenty-one years after founding Google in a messy garage in Menlo Park, California, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have stepped down from day-to-day management of the company to assume the role of \u201cproud parents \u2013 offering advice and love, but not daily nagging!\u201d Page and Brin\u2019s decision to hand over control of Google, and its parent company Alphabet, to long-standing lieutenant Sundar Pichai is the end of an era for the search engine giant, which had been built in their image and followed their personal values. Their exit from the executive suite is the biggest change at the top of a US technology powerhouse since Steve Jobs resigned as chief executive of Apple shortly before he died from cancer in 2011, or when Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft, stood down as chief executive in 2000. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos is now the only founder-chief executive from that period to still be in day-to-day control of his company. \u201cToday, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,\u201d Google\u2019s founders wrote in a public letter on Tuesday. \u201cWhile it has been a tremendous privilege to be deeply involved in the day-to-day management of the company for so long, we believe it\u2019s time to assume the role of proud parents \u2013 offering advice and love, but not daily nagging! \u201cWe\u2019ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there\u2019s a better way to run the company. And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a president.\u201d Pichai, 47, who was previously chief executive of Google, will take on all of those roles as Alphabet\u2019s chief executive. He owns about 0.1% of Alphabet\u2019s shares. \u201cI\u2019m excited about Alphabet\u2019s long-term focus on tackling big challenges through technology,\u201d Pichai, who has worked at the company since 2004, said on Twitter. \u201cThanks to Larry &amp; Sergey, we have a timeless mission, enduring values and a culture of collaboration &amp; exploration \u2013 a strong foundation we\u2019ll continue to build on.\u201d Brin and Page, both 46, said they would remain \u201cactively involved\u201d as board members and major shareholders. \u201cIn addition, we plan to continue talking with Sundar regularly, especially on topics we\u2019re passionate about,\u201d they said. Page had been chief executive of Alphabet since the parent company was created in 2015 to manage all of Google\u2019s disparate \u201cmoonshoot\u201d ventures, including flying cars and technology to disrupt the ageing process. Brin had been president of Alphabet and had already distanced himself from day-to-day management. For a time, Brin had moved his desk to X, the self-described \u201cmoonshot factory\u201d where engineers worked on projects that were expected to fail but had big potential if they didn\u2019t. Together, Brin and Page control 51% of a special class of Alphabet\u2019s voting shares, giving them ultimate control of the company\u2019s future direction. They own 11.4% of the company, worth $101bn (\u00a377bn). Alphabet\u2019s total stock market value is $912bn and has increased by almost 25% so far this year. Page and Brin are ranked the seventh- and tenth-richest people in the world, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index with estimated fortunes of $62.7bn and $60.9bn respectively. Under Page and Brin, Google\u2019s motto had been: \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d but it was changed to: \u201cDo the right thing\u201d when Alphabet was created in 2015. The company has recently faced a growing number of complaints and allegations from politicians and its own workforce. Last year Page was called before the US Senate Intelligence Committee investigating foreign powers\u2019 influence in elections, but he didn\u2019t show up. Last week, Google dismissed several outspoken workers for allegedly violating its data security policies. Some employees accused the firm of trying to suppress its critics. Thousands of employees walked out of Google offices around the world last year to protest against a $90m payoff to the former Android boss Andy Rubin, despite finding sexual misconduct claims against him to be credible. The board has since opened an investigation into how executives handle claims of sexual misconduct. Employees also protested against the company\u2019s contract with the US Department of Defence for artificial intelligence work, arguing that Google should not be in the \u201cbusiness of war\u201d. Google said last year it would not renew the contract. Google was fined \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) by the European commission earlier this year for \u201cabusive practices\u201d in its AdSense platform by blocking rivals Microsoft and Yahoo from selling ads in Google search results pages. This followed a $5bn fine for anti-competitive behaviour associated with its Android mobile operating system in 2018 and a \u20ac2.4bn fine for ecommerce violations in 2017. The pair\u2019s reference to becoming \u201cproud parents\u201d is a knowing nod to the \u201cparental supervision\u201d they brought to the company when they appointed the Silicon Valley veteran Eric Schmidt as Google\u2019s chief executive in 2001, when Page and Brin were still in their 20s and the company was growing rapidly.",

And we are also surprised by the ferocity of the dust environment.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/parker_probe-zip/giv-3902jzeM70cYi8hk/\" data-alt=\"Guardian graphic.\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/12/parker_probe-zip/giv-3902jzeM70cYi8hk/\">Guardian graphic.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Over the next six years, the car-sized spacecraft will follow an ever-closer elliptical orbit, eventually swooping so near that it will technically \u201ctouch\u201d the sun. A drawback of being at such close quarters is that Parker will not be sending pictures home. If it swivelled towards the sun its camera would melt, so the spacecraft\u2019s instruments gaze sideways, measuring the stream of supersonic charged particles that make up the solar wind.</p> \n<p>Previously, scientists observed that the sun\u2019s wind appears to have two main components: a \u201cfast\u201d one that travels around 700km per second (and comes from giant coronal holes in the sun\u2019s polar region; and a \u201cslow\u201d wind, travelling below 500km per second, whose origin is unknown.</p> \n<p>The Parker probe traced the slow wind back to small coronal holes dappled around the sun\u2019s equator \u2013 solar structures that had not previously been observed. Coronal holes are cooler, less dense regions, through which magnetic fields stream out into space, acting as channels for the charged particles to flow along.</p> \n<p>The observations also point to an explanation for why the corona is so blisteringly hot.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe corona is a million degrees, but the sun\u2019s surface is only thousands,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.horbury\">Prof</a><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.horbury\"> Tim Horbury</a>, a co-investigator on the Parker Solar Probe Fields instrument at Imperial College London. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the Earth\u2019s surface temperature were the same, but its atmosphere was many thousands of degrees. How can that work? You\u2019d expect to get colder as you moved away.\u201d</p> \n<p>Parker\u2019s sidelong observations revealed that the particles in the solar wind appeared to be released in explosive jets, rather than being radiated out in a steady stream. \u201cIt\u2019s bang, bang, bang,\u201d said Horbury.</p> \n<p>This rapid release of energy from the sun\u2019s interior into its atmosphere could help explain why the atmosphere is so staggeringly hot compared to the solar surface, he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d19a21ab-533e-421f-a78b-f7538500c96f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gYzIryEdo7k?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Another surprise was the dustiness of the area close to the sun. During the nearest approach of its orbit, the probe was peppered with a fine dust, chipping tiny pieces off its heat shield that showed up as white streaks in images captured by the high-resolution camera. It is thought to be the remains of asteroids and comets that came close to the sun, causing them to evaporate, leaving behind just a dusty haze.</p> \n<p>The new observations were made when Parker was about 15m miles (24m km) from the sun, but it will eventually fly to about 6m km of its surface \u2014 more than seven times closer than the previous closest mission, the Helios 2 spacecraft in 1976.</p> \n<p>The extreme conditions faced by Parker has required the use of unconventional materials and spacecraft design.

      "bodyText": "Nasa\u2019s Parker Solar Probe, which has flown closer to the sun than any spacecraft, has beamed back its first observations from the edge of the sun\u2019s scorching atmosphere. The first tranche of data offers clues to long-standing mysteries, including why the sun\u2019s atmosphere, known as the corona, is hundreds of times hotter than its surface, as well as the precise origins of the solar wind. \u201cThe first three encounters of the solar probe that we have had so far have been spectacular,\u201d said Prof Stuart Bale, a physicist at the University of California, in Berkeley, who led the analysis from one of the craft\u2019s instruments. \u201cWe can see the magnetic structure of the corona, which tells us that the solar wind is emerging from small coronal holes; we see impulsive activity, large jets or switchbacks, which we think are related to the origin of the solar wind. And we are also surprised by the ferocity of the dust environment.\u201d Over the next six years, the car-sized spacecraft will follow an ever-closer elliptical orbit, eventually swooping so near that it will technically \u201ctouch\u201d the sun. A drawback of being at such close quarters is that Parker will not be sending pictures home. If it swivelled towards the sun its camera would melt, so the spacecraft\u2019s instruments gaze sideways, measuring the stream of supersonic charged particles that make up the solar wind. Previously, scientists observed that the sun\u2019s wind appears to have two main components: a \u201cfast\u201d one that travels around 700km per second (and comes from giant coronal holes in the sun\u2019s polar region; and a \u201cslow\u201d wind, travelling below 500km per second, whose origin is unknown. The Parker probe traced the slow wind back to small coronal holes dappled around the sun\u2019s equator \u2013 solar structures that had not previously been observed. Coronal holes are cooler, less dense regions, through which magnetic fields stream out into space, acting as channels for the charged particles to flow along. The observations also point to an explanation for why the corona is so blisteringly hot. \u201cThe corona is a million degrees, but the sun\u2019s surface is only thousands,\u201d said Prof Tim Horbury, a co-investigator on the Parker Solar Probe Fields instrument at Imperial College London. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the Earth\u2019s surface temperature were the same, but its atmosphere was many thousands of degrees. How can that work? You\u2019d expect to get colder as you moved away.\u201d Parker\u2019s sidelong observations revealed that the particles in the solar wind appeared to be released in explosive jets, rather than being radiated out in a steady stream. \u201cIt\u2019s bang, bang, bang,\u201d said Horbury. This rapid release of energy from the sun\u2019s interior into its atmosphere could help explain why the atmosphere is so staggeringly hot compared to the solar surface, he said. Another surprise was the dustiness of the area close to the sun. During the nearest approach of its orbit, the probe was peppered with a fine dust, chipping tiny pieces off its heat shield that showed up as white streaks in images captured by the high-resolution camera. It is thought to be the remains of asteroids and comets that came close to the sun, causing them to evaporate, leaving behind just a dusty haze. The new observations were made when Parker was about 15m miles (24m km) from the sun, but it will eventually fly to about 6m km of its surface \u2014 more than seven times closer than the previous closest mission, the Helios 2 spacecraft in 1976. The extreme conditions faced by Parker has required the use of unconventional materials and spacecraft design. The craft\u2019s white ceramic heat shields will reach a temperature of nearly 1,400C (2,552F) during the mission\u2019s closest approach. As it passes close to the sun, its solar panels are retracted into the shadow of the heat shield, with just a tiny area remaining exposed to generate power. The craft has also broken the record for the fastest moving spacecraft, relative to the sun. It will reach speeds of nearly 435,000 mph (700,000 km/h) in 2024. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bold mission, it\u2019s really extreme and it\u2019s an enormously impressive engineering effort,\u201d said Horbury. The findings are reported in three papers in the journal Nature.",

If we are to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030, we must all work together to eradicate poverty, reduce inequality, end violence and exploitation of the most vulnerable and tackle the climate and environment emergency. Delivery of these commitments will require a shift in the way we design government policy at home and abroad so future generations can live in a safe, just, prosperous world where no one is left behind. The next prime minister has an opportunity to show the world what it means to be an outward-facing and progressive nation, a nation that is proud of our official development assistance, with a Department for International Development - represented by its own secretary of state - that delivers for those most in need. Let\u2019s use this opportunity to make the UK a major force for good in the world.

But they should be forgiven: it\u2019s hard to imagine these costs when they\u2019re used to going to a doctor, getting picked up in an ambulance or getting an operation, and receiving no bill. In the UK, there are no questions asked about whether you would prefer the better, more expensive surgery, or the cheaper one \u2013 the best option is simply chosen for you; something that public health officials spend hours poring over, in publicly available cost-benefit analyses.

We can and we must do better. We need Medicare for All now,\u201d he said. The video, posted by the news website Joe, has been viewed more than 10m times. When the price of two EpiPens ($600 in the US; free in the UK) is told to one British interviewee, she conveys her shock in a quintessentially British way: \u201cShut the fridge!\u201d she says. \u201cIs there a price for that?\u201d responds another, when asked about the cost of getting an ambulance ($2,500 in the US; free in the UK). At times, amid all of the \u201cFor real?\u201d, \u201cFor what?\u201d and \u201cWhy?\u201d responses, the Brits in the video might sound a bit smug. But they should be forgiven: it\u2019s hard to imagine these costs when they\u2019re used to going to a doctor, getting picked up in an ambulance or getting an operation, and receiving no bill. In the UK, there are no questions asked about whether you would prefer the better, more expensive surgery, or the cheaper one \u2013 the best option is simply chosen for you; something that public health officials spend hours poring over, in publicly available cost-benefit analyses. And it costs the UK government less than the US \u2013 the UK government pays about half what the US does towards healthcare \u2013 with better outcomes than the US to boot. Meanwhile, in the US, the average consumer spends more than $10,000 a year on healthcare, and 52% of all debt collection actions include unpaid medical bills. A significant number of Americans go broke trying to pay off their medical debt \u2013 530,000 bankruptcies a year are because of debt accrued due to a medical illness. Outside of going broke is a nasty reality \u2013 about 45,000 Americans die annually because they don\u2019t have healthcare. As one Brit in the video succinctly puts it: \u201cMan, so if you\u2019re poor, you\u2019re dead.\u201d The takeaway message from Brits in the video is clear: \u201c[The NHS is] literally the gift that keeps on giving. People are so dumb for taking advantage of it,\u201d says one woman, referring to those who take the NHS for granted. Another woman is a bit more blunt. Asked what message she would give to those profiting off the outrageous cost of healthcare in the US, she says: \u201cYou bastards.\u201d This article was amended on 5 December to correct that the video was viewed, rather than shared, over 10m times.",

      "bodyText": "Finally, back in the markets, renewed trade war optimism has pushed Wall Street higher. The Dow is up 200 points, after Bloomberg reportedly earlier that the US and China were closer to a deal than Donald Trump suggested yesterday. European stock markets also rallied, in their best day for a month (after the worst day in two months). The FTSE 100 has a more modest rally, up 29 points at 7,188. It was held back by the pound, which is still at a 7-month high at nearly $1.31. Goodnight! GW Here\u2019s my colleague Patrick Collinson on M&amp;G\u2019s property fund freeze: One of the UK\u2019s biggest property funds, which owns shopping centres across the country, has alarmed investors by banning withdrawals and blaming both Brexit and the retail downturn for its problems. The \u00a32.5bn M&amp;G Property Portfolio was suspended after \u201cunusually high and sustained outflows\u201d \u2013 demand from investors for their money back \u2013 prompted by \u201cBrexit-related political uncertainty and ongoing structural shifts in the UK retail sector\u201d. M&amp;G admitted it had been unable to sell commercial property fast enough to fund the rush for the door by investors, leaving it with no choice but to prevent further withdrawals. The fund\u2019s biggest holdings include shopping centres such as Fremlin Walk in Maidstone, Kent, where House of Fraser is one of the biggest tenants. M&amp;G said the suspension would give it time to raise cash to repay investors. While the fund is suspended, M&amp;G will cut the fees it charges to manage the fund. M&amp;G did not give a timeline for when the fund would be reopened, saying it was monitoring the situation daily. The financial adviser Chase de Vere told investors not to panic, but added: \u201cM&amp;G has struggled with this due to number of investors cashing out and a relatively high exposure to retail properties, which are proving difficult to sell. \u201cAs a result, the amount of cash in the fund has fallen to about 5%, making it difficult for them to meet ongoing redemptions.\u201d More here. Rival property funds are scrambling to reassure investors. Aviva says it has build a 30% cash level in its property fund, due to \u201cheightened market uncertainty\u201d. BMO has said its fund holds 24% of its assets in cash, and is still open (vie Reuters). That is meant to reassure investors that they can withdraw their funds when they like (preventing a panicky dash to the exit). But it may also annoy some customers -- after all, these funds are meant to be putting cash to work, not sitting on it. MorningStar reported today that investors are being charged management fees even if their cash hasn\u2019t been invested. Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial Planning, told them: \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. These funds are offering something that they are not delivering. It is plain wrong to charge investors the full annual fee on a fund when only 70% of their money is being invested.\u201d More here: Are Property Funds Holding Too Much Cash? Too much spare cash wasn\u2019t M&amp;G\u2019s problem, of course..... M&amp;G investors could be trapped in the Property Portfolio fund for some time. Laura Suter of stockbroker AJ Bell points out that the fund was closed for two months after the Brexit vote: M&amp;G\u2019s problems may have been exacerbated by the crisis at Neil Woodford\u2019s asset management empire. Woodford was forced to freeze his once-popular Woodford Equity Income fund this summer, after a wave of redemption requests. Investors now face massive losses - they could lose two-thirds of their money once the fund is wound down. The Woodford debacle has highlighted the danger of open-ended funds. Last month, FT Advisor reported there has been \u201ca surge\u201d of property fund redemptions since. M&amp;G\u2019s move is the first suspension of a major property fund since the panic after the Brexit vote (explained here), says the Financial Times. Here\u2019s its take: Fund manager M&amp;G has suspended trading in its \u00a32.5bn Property Portfolio, which is marketed to retail investors, after facing \u201cunusually high and sustained outflows\u201d it blamed on Brexit and the retail downturn. The fund is the first major open-ended property fund to halt redemptions in this way since the crisis in the sector that caused seven funds to \u201cgate\u201d in 2016 following the Brexit referendum \u2014 one of the most high-profile market consequences of the vote to leave the EU. M&amp;G, a London-listed asset manager, said the pressure of outflows had exceeded the speed at which it can sell properties, leading it to suspend any redemption requests arriving after midday on Wednesday. More here: M&amp;G suspends \u00a32.5bn property fund on Brexit and retail woes Signs of distress at M&amp;G\u2019s Property Portfolio fund have been building in recent weeks, leading to today\u2019s suspension. Last month, M&amp;G carried out an unusual \u2018intra-month valuation update\u2019, having spotted a material (downward) move in its assets. This update revealed that M&amp;G\u2019s retail property assets had lost 7.7% of their value, due to a \u201cmarked deterioration\u201d in the retail sector. The company says the rise of internet shopping, and the collapse of several high street chains, were to blame: It is has been well documented that the bricks and mortar retail sector is suffering substantial headwinds. The rise of e-commerce coupled with recent retailer failures is increasing uncertainty across the sector. Retailers are reluctant to pay high rents and investors are decreasing their appetite for retail assets. (Transaction volumes have decreased by 24% compared to the same period in 2018). Even in highly sought after locations such as Bath and Manchester, rents have declined over the last 12 months. More here.... In October, fund industry tracker Morningstar spotted that \u00a32bn of cash had left property funds this year -- with M&amp;G losing \u00a3750m alone. That was an \u201cecho\u201d of the stampede after the Brexit vote, Reuters reported. The BBC\u2019s Simon Gompertz has also heard that the cash reserves in M&amp;G\u2019s property fund have run rather low, forcing today\u2019s suspension. Readers might also remember that a swathe of property funds were temporarily frozen after the EU referendum in 2016. Two weeks after the vote, around \u00a318bn was locked up as asset managers barred the doors, to give time to sell office blocks and shops in order to meet redemption requests. The fundamental problem is that these funds are open-ended, allowing a retail investor to put money in and take it out again as they like. Until too many of them want to cash in at once. Merryn Somerset Webb, editor in chief of Money Week, says there is a structural problem here: The BBC\u2019s Simon Gompertz is tweeting a handy explanation to M&amp;G\u2019s shock property suspension: Shares in M&amp;G have fallen by 2% since it suspended the Property Portfolio fund. M&amp;G is also waiving around a third of the management fee it charges investors -- to address the frustration they\u2019ll feel about being locked into the Property Portfolio. It says: The funds will still be actively managed during suspension, but we understand that being unable to deal in the funds is very frustrating for our customers. In recognition, M&amp;G is waiving 30% of its annual charge, which will end when the funds resume dealing. Suspension will be formally reviewed on a monthly basis and we will inform investors if the level of discount changes. In all other respects, the funds will operate as normal and you will continue to receive income payments, fund reporting and updates as usual This surprise suspension will allow M&amp;G breathing room to raise cash (by selling property) so it can pay people who want to redeem their investment in the Property Portfolio. It says: In accordance with the Fund\u2019s strategy, the suspension will allow the fund managers time to raise cash levels to pay redemptions, whilst ensuring that asset sales are achieved at market prices and investors in the Fund are safeguarded. In all other aspects, the Fund will continue to operate as normal throughout the suspension and customers will continue to receive income payment. NEWSFLASH: One of Britain\u2019s biggest fund managers has just suspended dealing in its multi-billion property fund. M&amp;G has blamed Brexit for the temporary move, saying political uncertainty has made it hard to sell property assets to meet redemption requests from investors in its Property Portfolio. The crisis on the high street -- with many retailers shutting stores -- is another factor. In a letter to investors, M&amp;G says: In recent months, continued Brexit-related uncertainty and ongoing structural shifts in the UK retail sector have prompted unusually high outflows from our property fund for retail investors. Given that these circumstances and deteriorating market conditions have significantly impacted our ability to sell commercial property, we have temporarily suspended dealing in the interests of protecting our customers. The assets owned by the M&amp;G Property Portfolio, such as office buildings and shopping centres, are held for the long term and take time to buy and sell, making it difficult to immediately meet sudden and sustained levels of redemptions. Suspending the funds at this time will allow the fund managers, Fiona Rowley and Justin Upton, time to restore the cash levels by selling assets in an orderly manner and preserve value for our investors. What does it mean? The Property Portfolio holds 91 commercial properties across the UK, and manages assets of \u00a32.54 billion. Funds of its type take money from investors, invest it in commercial property assets, and pay returns from rental payments and capital appreciation. As M&amp;G points out, those properties are hard to sell quickly (unless you accept a firesale price). So if too many investors want to withdraw their money at the same time, the fund can struggle to meet those redemptions. Back on trade.... Donald Trump has told reporters in London that talks with China are going \u201cvery well\u201d. During a press event with German chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump said: Discussions are going very well, and we\u2019ll see what happens. That\u2019s a more upbeat assessment than yesterday, when the president hinted that he might not sign off a deal for another year. This is likely to reassure markets; a cynic might question whether Trump is keen to reverse yesterday\u2019s selloff with some good publicity. But the BIG headlines are on Trump calling Justin Trudeau \u201ctwo-faced\u201d after video emerged showing Canada\u2019s PM laughing about Trump with Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron,Mark Rutte and Princess Anne. Boom! Sterling has now hit its highest level against the euro since May 2017. General election speculation has driven the pound up to \u20ac1.182 against the single currency, a 31-month high. Traders are increasingly betting on a Conservative victory next week. The pound is also benefitting from the fact that this morning\u2019s service sector data was less bad than feared (but really not good!). We should remember, though, that one pound was worth \u20ac1.30 before the Brexit referendum.... Ian Strafford-Taylor, CEO of currency and payments firm Equals, suggests the pound is still vulnerable to political drama: \u201cThe pound is now trading at its highest level in over two-years off the back of more election rumours and polls, showing once again how it is at the mercy of British politics. As it stands the pound is at 1.18 against the euro which we haven\u2019t seen since May 2017.\u201d \u201cHowever, the outcome of next week\u2019s general election will not spell the end of the pound\u2019s rocky journey as the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU remains uncertain. We\u2019ve seen in the run-up to past elections that the pound has had a turbulent time, and with more than just a new Prime Minister at stake we shouldn\u2019t get used to these kinds of rates just yet.\u201d Newsflash: Rather fewer jobs were created at American companies last month than expected, a new report shows. The ADP payroll, which measures US employment, has risen by 67,000 in November, much weaker than the 140,000 which Wall Street expected. October\u2019s payroll has been revised lower too, to 121,000 from 125,000. This might be a sign that the US economy is losing momentum; we\u2019ll get a better picture on Friday, when the broader Non-Farm Payroll survey of US labor is released. Sterling is continuing to climb, and is now up a whole cent today at $1.309. That\u2019s a new seven-month high against the US dollar, the strongest position since May 7th. Aviation News: Budget airline Ryanair is planning to close two bases, due to the ongoing delays to Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX jet. Ryanair says it now expects to only receive 10 737 MAX aircraft in time for next summer, not the 20 previously expected. That means it will carry a million fewer passengers -- 156m, not 157m -- and force it to shutter operations at Nuremberg and Stockholm Skavsta. Boeing is still trying to get the 737 Max recertified, following the two fatal crashes blamed on a flawed anti-stall mechanism. John Goldie, FX Dealer at Argentex Group, predicts the pound could rise to at least $1.33 if Johnson wins a majority next week. But victory isn\u2019t assured, so sterling could yet slide back to $1.25, Goldie suggests. It may seem like the political equivalent to Ronny Rosenthal vs. Aston Villa circa-early 90s, but missing an open goal, as the first YouGov MRP suggests it is, seems like an entirely feasible thing for Boris to do. \u201cGiven that the market has already positioned itself to some degree on a Tory majority,... from today\u2019s $1.3000, I\u2019d expect 1.25-1.27 to be the initial fallout for the pound\u2019s nightmare scenario in the early hours of Friday the 13th next week.\u201d Here\u2019s a clip of Rosenthal picking out the crossbar when it was rather easier to score.... Pollsters, such as YouGov, have been giving the Conservatives a solid lead in the polls for months. But Boris Johnson has suggested that the race is \u2018very tight\u2019. That could just be a message designed to get the vote out next Thursday... ...or it could reflect memories of 2017, when Theresa May lost her majority despite beginning her election campaign with a big lead. Wall Street is expected to recover yesterday\u2019s slump too, thanks to Bloomberg\u2019s report that a US-China trade deal could still happen soon. Sterling is also climbing against the euro, hitting a near-nine month high of \u20ac1.1786. That\u2019s because Boris Johnson appears to be on track for victory in next week\u2019s election, says Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management. But with a week\u2019s campaigning to go, nothing is certain. Turner writes: The election is Boris Johnson\u2019s to lose. However, turnout rates, tactical votes, and the usual campaign trail pitfalls could all swing the final result. \u201cSterling has strengthened on days when the prospects for the Conservative Party have seemingly improved, and vice versa. One interpretation of this phenomenon is that investors favour the prospect of clarity on Brexit. [But] Markets have not reacted much to campaign trail developments so far and sterling volatility has been contained. We retain our bullish medium to long-term view on sterling versus the US dollar and expect that the pound-dollar exchange rate will rise toward $1.38 by the end of next year.\u201d The pound has hit its highest level in seven months, as City traders show increased confidence that Boris Johnson will win next week\u2019s general election. Sterling has jumped to $1.3039, up nearly half a cent, to levels not seen since May 2019. Traders appear to be reacting to the latest Sky News/YouGov poll, which gave the Conservatives a nine-point lead ahead of Thursday\u2019s general election. The poll puts the Tories on 42%, Labour on 33%, the Liberal Democrats are on 12%, and Brexit Party is on 4%, up two points. The City fears another hung parliament, which could mean more deadlock and possible a disorderly Brexit. So this polling is pushing the pound up. Rupert Thompson, Head of Research at Kingswood, says investor confidence in a Conservative victory has grown. Even so, while the polls continue to point to the Conservatives gaining a majority, it is still not a done deal. The danger of an outright Labour victory may be slight but if it did transpire, it would likely cause a slump in the pound. But even at todays levels, the pound is still some 13% weaker than before the Brexit vote three years ago. Thompson explains: So, if market hopes of a Conservatives victory are vindicated, the pound will very likely strengthen further from $1.30 currently to maybe $1.35 or so. Even at $1.35, the pound would remain below the levels seen prior to the 2016 Brexit referendum. This would seem appropriate as, even with a Conservative victory, significant Brexit uncertainty will remain. While Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal would almost certainly be ratified in short order if the Conservatives win, doubts will remain over whether the UK will be able to finalise a trade deal with the EU by the end of the transition period in December 2020. The risk of a No-Deal exit may be much reduced but it has not been eliminated altogether.\u201d In a surprise twist, European stock markets are all rallying.... as hopes of a US-China trade deal grow again. Every index is up, with France, Italy andGermany rallying by over 1%, after unnamed sources claimed that Donald Trump had painted a too-gloomy picture of negotiations yesterday. According to these insiders, a deal could still be reached this month. Bloomberg has the details: The people, who asked not to be identified, said that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s comments Tuesday downplaying the urgency of a deal shouldn\u2019t be understood to mean the talks were stalling, as he was speaking off the cuff. Recent U.S. legislation seeking to sanction Chinese officials over human-rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang are unlikely to impact the talks, one person familiar with Beijing\u2019s thinking said. U.S. negotiators expect a phase-one deal with China to be completed before American tariffs are set to rise on Dec. 15, the people said. Outstanding issues in the talks include how to guarantee China\u2019s purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and exactly which tariffs to roll back, they added. Andy Bruce of Reuters shows how UK service sector growth has fizzled out this year: If today\u2019s PMIs are accurate, they suggest the UK could be sliding back to the brink of recession. Howard Archer of EY Item Club is revising down his hopes for growth in the fourth quarter of 2019, having seen November\u2019s gloomy PMIs. Even allowing for the fact that the purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are prone to portraying an overly gloomy picture at times of heightened uncertainties, there now looks to be a very real danger that the economy will stagnate in the fourth quarter. We had originally thought the economy could eke out GDP growth of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter but this now looks pretty optimistic. Any growth in the economy in the fourth quarter is likely to be pretty dependent on consumers \u2013 who have been the most resilient part of the economy \u2013 spending a decent amount over the critical Christmas period. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, blames Brexit for the drop in UK service sector activity last month. Here\u2019s his take on November\u2019s PMIs: \u201cThe sector was hemmed in with no room for improvement in November by the fastest fall in the pipeline of new work since July 2016, and the biggest drop in export orders since this index began in September 2014. As Brexit nerves continued to affect domestic client decision-making, a veil of silence also descended over European clients in particular who were reluctant to commit until there is more clarity in the UK\u2019s future direction. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, says the UK economy is \u201cstaggering\u201d through the final quarter of the year, with output falling at services companies and factories. \u201cNovember\u2019s PMI surveys collectively suggest that the UK economy is staggering through the final quarter of 2019, with service sector output falling back into decline after a brief period of stabilisation. \u201cLacklustre demand remains centred on business-to- business spending. Service providers have attributed the recent soft patch to delayed decision-making on new projects until greater clarity emerges in relation to the domestic political landscape. Sales to export markets were hard-hit in November, as signalled by the steepest fall in new work from abroad for more than five years. \u201cService providers reported concerns that consumer appetite for big-ticket purchases has begun to falter, while those reliant on consumer footfall and discretionary spending noted the negative impact of unusually wet weather in November. \u201cLower manufacturing production alongside an absence of growth in the service economy means that the IHS Markit/ CIPS Composite Output Index is consistent with UK GDP declining at a quarterly rate of around 0.1%.\u201d Britain\u2019s private sector shrank in November, as the ongoing Brexit uncertainty hurts the country\u2019s dominant services sector. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit, which says its services PMI slumped to 49.3 last month. That\u2019s down from October\u2019s 50, which showed stagnation. That\u2019s not quite as bad as the \u2018flash\u2019 estimate released a couple of weeks ago - but it\u2019s still the worst reading since March. Service sector managers say they suffered a drop in new business last month, with exports shrinking at the fastest rate in five years. Many firms warned that domestic political uncertainty was hurting their business, and dampening consumer spending. We learned on Monday that factory output shrank. Put it together, and it suggests the UK economy is contracting by around 0.1% in the current quarter. More to follow.... Heads-up. Bloomberg is reporting that Washington and Beijing are making progress towards a trade deal. It says: The U.S. and China are moving closer to agreeing on the amount of tariffs that would be rolled back in a phase-one trade deal despite tensions over Hong Kong and Xinjiang, people familiar with the talks said, Bloomberg News reports. That\u2019s not what Donald Trump was suggesting yesterday... perhaps the market slump has unblocked negotiations? The eurozone\u2019s private sector had a lacklustre November. The composite PMI, which measures activity across service sector firms and manufacturers, was unchanged at 50.6 -- showing modest growth. The latest economic data from Hong Kong is an absolute shocker. Private sector activity slumped alarmingly last month, at the fastest rate since the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus crisis gripped the city, causing hundreds of deaths. Data firm Markit says its Hong Kong PMI, slumped to just 38.5 in November, from 39.3. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and a sub-40 reading suggest a sharp downturn. We already knew that the pro-democracy demonstrations, and the clashes with security forces, pushed Hong Kong into recession in the last quarter. Clearly there\u2019s no sign of recovery. Bernard Aw, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, said: \u201cThe average PMI reading for October and November combined showed the economy on track to see GDP fall by over 5% in the fourth quarter, unless December brings a dramatic recovery. he survey showed that the escalating political unrest saw business activity shrinking at the steepest rate since the survey started in July 1998. This occurred concurrently with the sharpest decline in new sales since the depths of the global financial crisis. The business outlook unsurprisingly remained gloomy, with confidence still stuck among the lowest levels seen in the survey history. In a further sign of pessimism, firms continued to make deep cuts to purchasing activity and inventories, reducing both at a survey record pace.\u201d Away from trade, we have bleak news from the UK high street Fast fashion chain Quiz has warned it could close a swathe of stores, after slumping into a \u00a36.8m loss in the last six month. It blames the decline in visitors to physical stores, and hinted that it could close loss-making outlets when its leases expire. The Chinese government has hit back against Donald Trump\u2019s criticism. At a press briefing, China\u2019s foreign ministry warned that Beijing will take \u201cthe necessary countermeasures\u201d to defend its interests. That sounds like a warning shot to Washington not to implement the tariffs planned for 15 December. After tumbling on Monday and Tuesday, European stock markets are attempting to clamber off the mat this morning. The Stoxx 600 index, which includes the largest EU companies, has gained 0.4% - which recovers a chunk of yesterday\u2019s losses. The FTSE 100, though is flat, with a strengthening pound hitting multinationals. Mohamed Zidan, chief market strategist at ThinkMarkets, says traders remain nervous: Uncertainty is everywhere with negative sentiment among market players after VIX [the volatility index] rebounded from its lowest level in 2019. This rebound and rally was fueled by the unexpected comments by Trump, the only thing which is certain now is that we face a highly volatile environment! Many parents look to their sons-in-law for help, perhaps with a tricky computing problem or a DIY task. Donald Trump, though, is turning to his eldest daughter\u2019s husband to resolve the China trade war! According to Reuters, Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, has taken a more direct involvement in the negotiations with China over the past two weeks. Kushner does have experience of trade, having worked on the US-Mexico-Canada agreement hammered out a year ago. Reuters says: While the talks have made some progress, these people said the two sides have not yet agreed on the extent to which the United States will remove existing tariffs on Chinese goods and on specific commitments by China to increase purchases of U.S. agriculture products. A White House official confirmed Kushner\u2019s involvement, but declined to provide specific details on the influence he has had on the negotiations. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said Kushner has recently met with Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States. The two have met multiple times since Trump took office, establishing a kind of back-channel relationship, trade experts say. Neil Wilson of Markets.com has sent over some salient points about the trade war situation, and how investors may react. Markets are discounting a trade deal with China being done this year, but it\u2019s still not impossible. The caprice of Trump means, as we have consistently stressed, anything can happen. An EU-US tit-for-tat trade war is a risk but not to be overplayed yet \u2013 most think it can be avoided Global equities have had a good run this year \u2013 there is still plenty of profit taking that could occur in the run-up to Christmas- do we see a repeat of last year and the \u2018nightmare on Wall Street before Christmas\u2019? The market, and Trump, ultimately know the Fed has their back. Pullbacks are to be expected as the market drifts higher and higher Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The season of goodwill may be approaching, but clearly no-one told Donald Trump. The US president has spooked investors around the globe with a series of attacks on other nations, including some close allies, as he threatens to escalate his trade war. Fresh from threatening France with tariffs on cheese and champagne, Trump hinted that he could use trade as a weapon to force NATO members to spend more on defence. But markets were really riled when the president suggested that he might wait to agree a trade deal with China until after the 2020 presidential election - a whole year away. A negotiating tactic, or an admission that talks behind the scenes are floundering? Either way, Trump\u2019s words sent stocks sliding in London and New York last night, with Britain\u2019s FTSE sinking 127 points to a two-month low of 7158. We might see a small recovery this morning, but the mood in the City is rather unfestive. Traders are concerned that America will impose fresh tariffs on China on December 15. Previously, there was hope that Washington would waive them, to help secure a Phase One deal with Beijing. The mood has totally changed in a couple of days, from optimism to pessimism. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank tells clients this morning: Mr Trump has completely taken the momentum out of financial markets this week and the December 15th date will increasingly become a focal point over the next couple of weeks. Last week the mood music suggested that even if a \u201cphase one\u201d deal hadn\u2019t been reached by then, then there was a good chance tariffs planned to be implemented on that date would be postponed. After the stepping up of negative global tariff rhetoric over the last 48 hours, yesterday\u2019s headlines suggesting that the US is going forward with the December 15 tariffs grabbed the limelight, although markets had already been trading weaker prior to that. Stocks in Asia-Pacific markets have already been hit, extending earlier losses this week. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200, which is vulnerable to a slowdown in China, has shed more than 1%. Commodity prices are also being hammered, on concerns that global growth will be hurt by an escalating trade war. The most-traded nickel contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange has crumbled by over 4%. Gold, though, is rising, as nervous investors look for a safe haven for their cash. Also coming up today Data firm Markit publishes its PMI surveys for the world\u2019s service sector companies today. The \u2018flash\u2019 estimates released two weeks ago were poor, and suggested Britain\u2019s services sector contracted during November. So today\u2019s \u2018final PMI\u2019 report could show that the UK economy is shrinking again.....

      "bodyText": "About 8 million HSBC customers are to have their overdraft rate doubled \u2013 and in some cases quadrupled \u2013 to 39.9% as it becomes the biggest UK bank so far to respond to tough new borrowing rules. Some customers \u2013 potentially running into the millions \u2013 will now pay more for going into the red as a result of the move, which comes after the Financial Conduct Authority ordered a ban on excessive overdraft fees. HSBC\u2019s new single rate for all overdrafts matches the 39.9% rate announced by Nationwide in July. However, there was disagreement about how many HSBC customers will pay more than they currently do. The MoneySavingExpert.com said it was highly probable that the majority of customers who had gone into their authorised overdraft would be worse off, but HSBC said that seven in 10 people who used their overdraft would either be charged the same or less because some charges had been removed or reduced. However, HSBC\u2019s argument still points to potentially millions of customers \u2013 or three in 10 account holders who use their overdraft \u2013 paying more if they are overdrawn. HSBC, which has between 8 million and 9 million current account holders and a 14% share of the UK market, said the new higher interest rate would apply to authorised and unauthorised borrowing across its whole range of accounts except for its student bank account. The new rate is double the 19.9% that the bank now charges holders of several of its main accounts for an authorised overdraft. However, for some customers the increase is a lot more than that: HSBC\u2019s Jade bank account has a 9.9% rate at the moment, while customers of its Premier account are currently charged 11.9%. HSBC is the biggest name so far to respond to the FCA\u2019s clampdown announced in June, which the regulator said would make overdrafts simpler, fairer, and easier to manage. The new 39.9% rates follow warnings that while the shake-up would benefit more vulnerable consumers, it could lead to firms seeking to make up the losses they would suffer by imposing higher authorised overdraft rates. Other banks are expected to announce higher headline rates over the coming weeks. The FCA announced in June it would be stopping banks from charging higher prices for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised ones, banning fixed daily or monthly charges for borrowing in this way, and requiring banks to price overdrafts using a simple annual interest rate. The watchdog had called the overdraft market \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and said it was causing significant consumer harm. There are 26 million UK overdraft users, and they are a huge cash cow for banks, which made more than \u00a32.4bn from them in one year alone (2017). While the new rules do not take effect until April 2020 at the latest, banks have to give their customers notice of changes. In addition to the new rate, HSBC\u2019s shake-up \u2013 which comes into effect on 14 March \u2013 includes the removal of a \u00a35 daily fee for going overdrawn without permission, a reduction in the maximum monthly charge from \u00a380 to \u00a320, and the introduction of an interest-free \u00a325 buffer on many accounts in order to provide some leeway should a customer accidentally nudge into the red. The ban would lead to a big reduction in costs for some people who may be struggling financially. A customer overdrawn by \u00a3200 for 15 days without permission would have the amount they are charged slashed from \u00a380 now to \u00a32.78 under the new structure. Andrew Hagger, the founder of the financial website MoneyComms.co.uk, said: \u201cPaying almost 40% for agreed overdrafts looks like becoming the norm, even if you have a top-notch credit record \u2013 double the rate on credit cards. Surely this isn\u2019t the outcome the regulator was expecting?\u201d In June the FCA had indicated its clampdown \u201ccould create winners and losers, as firms would be likely to seek to recover lost overdraft revenue from within their overdraft offering by, for example, increasing arranged overdraft prices\u201d. It said the net effect would be better for the public overall because these changes would \u201creduce the burden \u2026 on vulnerable consumers, whose welfare we are particularly concerned about\u201d.",

This would effectively hike the earliest age at which one can collect so-called full retirement benefits from 62 to 64, overhaul the formula for calculating benefits and merge the country\u2019s 42 existing pension schemes into a single regime \u2013 all in all, resulting in likely benefit cuts for millions. Authorities have defended their ambitions with the language of French republicanism, vowing to forge a \u201cuniversal system\u201d in which everyone is treated equally. But what they neglect to mention is that the new standard would be worse than today\u2019s.</p> <p>Yes, Macron\u2019s reforms would probably save money \u2013 under the current system, authorities face a total pension deficit slated to reach between <a href=\"https://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRKBN1XS1X3\" title=\"\">\u20ac8bn and \u20ac17bn by 2025</a>.

And indeed, the call to strike initially came from militant railway workers with relatively good benefits. But it has since spread elsewhere: to state schoolteachers, hospital staffers, postal workers and employees of the state electricity provider. Student unions and groups of <em>gilets jaunes </em>(yellow vests) looking to re-energise their year-long protest movement have also joined the cause.

On paper, the UK and US might be more economically competitive than France, but at what cost? Can anyone truly say that neoliberal reforms have made them better countries to live in? In this case, like so many others, the people on the streets in France will carry far more wisdom than the national assembly or the Elys\u00e9e palace. The country\u2019s welfare state is a world-class achievement that ought to be protected, not hollowed out for savings. \u2022 Cole Stangler is a journalist based in Paris",

      "body": "<p>Given the event was potentially awkward for him, it\u2019s amazing Boris Johnson didn\u2019t send his dad to the Nato summit in his place. One of these days we\u2019re going to see Stanley Johnson elbowing his way through a flag backdrop and inquiring of the world\u2019s media: \u201cAre you lovely lot all here for me?\u201d Answer: no. I\u2019m afraid tickets to public life are non-transferable.</p> <p>But at Wednesday\u2019s summit in Watford, Johnson Jr was going to be a big boy boss and do it all on his own. Yes, here he comes, Cuck Norris, electioneering from behind a Nato platform. He\u2019s not a statesman, but he plays one on TV.</p> <p>For this press conference, Johnson was being minded by Dominic Cummings, who was clad in a heavily unbuttoned shirt, and watching from the sidelines with all the easy charm of an East German gymnastics coach. Oof. You really, really don\u2019t want to mess up those landings, prime minister, or deliver your \u201cCorbyn means two referendums\u201d line merely twice, and not the three times you were instructed. Otherwise you\u2019ll be getting the belt and another injection tonight.</p> <p>Fortunately for his life expectancy \u2013 and his precious fertility \u2013 Johnson followed his coach\u2019s instructions. Not once in the entire press conference or the questions thereafter did he utter the word \u201cTrump\u201d, or even the word \u201cpresident\u201d. Instead, he found endless distancing variants, from \u201cthe current US administration\u201d to \u201cthe United States\u201d to simply ignoring the mention of Trump in any question.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the prime minister had appeared rather more forthcoming when he thought he wasn\u2019t being watched. Tuesday\u2019s Buckingham Palace reception <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/footage-appears-to-show-world-leaders-joking-about-trump-at-nato-summit\">yielded a couple of viral clips</a>, in which Johnson could be seen joining in with Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron as they took the piss out of Donald Trump, in order to amuse Princess Anne, who many viewers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2019/dec/04/queen-gestures-at-princess-anne-for-not-greeting-donald-trump-video\">assumed had herself just done the Alan Partridge \u201cso what?\u201d shrug</a> at the Queen when she got a dirty look for not greeting the US president/hotelier. (Incidentally, the latter sentence marks the exact point at which the \u201csentences you didn\u2019t expect to type four years ago\u201d officially outnumbered all the other typed sentences, ever. We have reached it: the political singularity. There is now no way back to normality.)</p> <p>As far as the Buckingham Palace piss-taking was concerned, Johnson was stagily baffled. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what is being referred to,\u201d he said of things that people can literally see happening on film. \u201cThat\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d he eye-rolled. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from.\u201d From the film of it happening.

      "bodyText": "Given the event was potentially awkward for him, it\u2019s amazing Boris Johnson didn\u2019t send his dad to the Nato summit in his place. One of these days we\u2019re going to see Stanley Johnson elbowing his way through a flag backdrop and inquiring of the world\u2019s media: \u201cAre you lovely lot all here for me?\u201d Answer: no. I\u2019m afraid tickets to public life are non-transferable. But at Wednesday\u2019s summit in Watford, Johnson Jr was going to be a big boy boss and do it all on his own. Yes, here he comes, Cuck Norris, electioneering from behind a Nato platform. He\u2019s not a statesman, but he plays one on TV. For this press conference, Johnson was being minded by Dominic Cummings, who was clad in a heavily unbuttoned shirt, and watching from the sidelines with all the easy charm of an East German gymnastics coach. Oof. You really, really don\u2019t want to mess up those landings, prime minister, or deliver your \u201cCorbyn means two referendums\u201d line merely twice, and not the three times you were instructed. Otherwise you\u2019ll be getting the belt and another injection tonight. Fortunately for his life expectancy \u2013 and his precious fertility \u2013 Johnson followed his coach\u2019s instructions. Not once in the entire press conference or the questions thereafter did he utter the word \u201cTrump\u201d, or even the word \u201cpresident\u201d. Instead, he found endless distancing variants, from \u201cthe current US administration\u201d to \u201cthe United States\u201d to simply ignoring the mention of Trump in any question. Unfortunately, the prime minister had appeared rather more forthcoming when he thought he wasn\u2019t being watched. Tuesday\u2019s Buckingham Palace reception yielded a couple of viral clips, in which Johnson could be seen joining in with Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron as they took the piss out of Donald Trump, in order to amuse Princess Anne, who many viewers assumed had herself just done the Alan Partridge \u201cso what?\u201d shrug at the Queen when she got a dirty look for not greeting the US president/hotelier. (Incidentally, the latter sentence marks the exact point at which the \u201csentences you didn\u2019t expect to type four years ago\u201d officially outnumbered all the other typed sentences, ever. We have reached it: the political singularity. There is now no way back to normality.) As far as the Buckingham Palace piss-taking was concerned, Johnson was stagily baffled. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what is being referred to,\u201d he said of things that people can literally see happening on film. \u201cThat\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d he eye-rolled. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that\u2019s come from.\u201d From the film of it happening. It\u2019s come from the film of it happening. For their part, No 10 tried a slightly different tack. A senior source scrambled to tell lobby journalists: \u201cIt is others that were having the conversations and Boris certainly was not leading.\u201d \u201cNot leading.\u201d You don\u2019t need to tell us that, dear \u2013 he\u2019s barely turned up to his own general election campaign. Yet preposterously, we\u2019ve spent much of the past few days having to listen to radioactively bad-taste declarations that Johnson is the only one who will stand up to terrorists, when he\u2019s miles too scared to even stand up to Andrew Neil. I try not to pay too much attention to terrorist methods, but I\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t bring down planes and buildings and decent people with the polite inquiry: \u201cHow many children do you have?\u201d In the event of an actual terrorist attack, Boris Johnson is the guy who\u2019d pull you in front of him as a human shield. So yes, I believe the term is \u201cleading from behind\u201d. In fact, the Buckingham Palace camera picked up Johnson pulling some weird lumbering move for the others, perhaps imitating Trump\u2019s rather simian deportment.

      "bodyText": "One of the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s most senior officials has hit out at multinational corporations and other big companies for failing to properly inform the public about the tax positions of their Australian operations. Speaking to Guardian Australia as the ATO prepares for its annual release of tax transparency data later this month, second commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said would be \u201cwise\u201d to improve the information contained in locally filed financial reports to include details of the operations of their Australian companies. Hirschhorn also warned the big four accounting firms that the ATO was closely watching their behaviour because it regarded them as systemically important because of their role in the tax system, as auditors of big companies and as suppliers to government. Every year the ATO publishes revenue, taxable income and tax paid by large Australian subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies and big Australian companies. However, the data is difficult to reconcile with accounting information published by some of the companies. \u201cThe tax office is obliged to publish each year three numbers, which is of course a very limited perspective on a company\u2019s tax performance,\u201d Hirschhorn said. He said a number of companies \u2013 generally those \u201cwith better Australian tax performance\u201d \u2013 had also signed up to a voluntary tax transparency code that requires them to publish an annual report on the tax they have paid. \u201cSome disclosures under the VTTC are disappointing in that they have technically produced a report but do not meet the code\u2019s intent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe warning signs are companies which focus on how much tax they pay on behalf of other people, how many excises or royalties they pay and how much they\u2019ve invested in Australia, and down the back you might get a little aside about how much corporate tax they pay.\u201d He said other companies disappointed because they have signed up to the code but only published one report. \u201cThe expectation was that companies would publish every year, and we are keen to see this,\u201d he said. A third set of very large companies, with worldwide turnover of $1bn or more, are required to file annual financial reports in Australia because they are regarded as \u201csignificant global entities\u201d. \u201cThe challenge with this measure is that if you\u2019re a company that doesn\u2019t want to shed too much light on your affairs, you can produce your global accounts, and of course they\u2019re accounts which include your Australian operations, but they don\u2019t tell the Australian community much about what you did in Australia,\u201d Hirschhorn said. \u201cYou meet all the requirements technically but you\u2019ve provided no insight into your Australian operations to the Australian community. \u201cWhat Australians are actually interested in is a full picture of your Australian operations at general purpose financial statement level, and the wise company would produce that.\u201d He said some multinationals were also struggling to deal with an ATO crackdown on inbound supply chains for products they sell in Australia. The assault mirrors a successful one on the outbound version for Australia exports, so-called \u201cmarketing hubs\u201d in Singapore used by the big miners. \u201cThe industry was very happy with where things were, which in my view was systemic underbooking of profits in Australia,\u201d Hirschhorn said. He said \u201cpushback\u201d against the ATO\u2019s new harder line was \u201centirely expected\u201d. \u201cAs the administrator, we\u2019ve got to judge whether we\u2019ve overstepped \u2013 at this stage we don\u2019t think so and we\u2019re confident that our supporting analysis holds true. It can\u2019t be that large companies operate successfully in Australia over long periods, even decades, without making a profit here.\u201d Hirschhorn has also been tackling the big four accounting firms \u2013 Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY \u2013 by travelling to their offices with a blunt warning that they need to improve their behaviour. For the past year, the ATO has been locked in battle with tax partners at the big four, especially over what it sees as the misuse of legal professional privilege to shield tax minimisation schemes from exposure. Industry sources say the dispute is likely set to boil over into the courts in the new year in legal action the ATO is believed to be contemplating against a handful of practitioners with whom it has so far been unable to resolve its differences. The ATO\u2019s efforts have also come amid renewed scrutiny of the roles of the big four firms. A parliamentary committee is currently inquiring into standards in financial audits, which have been consistently criticised by the corporate regulator and at the big end of town are dominated by the big four. The role of the accounting giants has also been under scrutiny in large-scale corporate collapses and alleged frauds including UK outsourcing giant Carillion and Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB scandal. \u201cIf you are systemically important, in any of those but especially if you are systemic across multiple lenses, you must behave differently from being a boutique, which really can just live in a system rather than be an integral part of the system,\u201d Hirschhorn said. He said systemically important firms had to realise that they could not get away with the same actions as boutique firms because the system as a whole would respond to their movements. \u201cThe corollary of that is that a systemically important firm brings great opportunities and strengths, but must be more careful and wiser \u2013 some superficially successful businesses may fall outside the parameters of a systemically important firm,\u201d he said. He said it was difficult for big firms to realise this because of their roots \u201cas amalgamations of smaller firms and add-on practices\u201d. \u201cTraditionally each partner or small group of partners was given a high degree of autonomy and the firms were not necessarily very good at judging the risk-adjusted returns of those businesses,\u201d he said. He said the ATO\u2019s message had resonated with managing partners. \u201cMy impression is the senior leaders in the firms are thinking deeply on these issues, not just in their tax businesses, and it reinforces their efforts in managing their firms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are certainly seeing the senior leaders take concrete action.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The latest GDP figures released on Wednesday suggest on the surface the overall economy is doing better, but further inspection highlights the underlying weakness. The domestic private sector is in a dire state, having now shrunk for four consecutive quarters \u2013 the worst result since the 1990s recession \u2013 and the economy is now more dependent on government spending to keep it afloat than at any time since the GFC . First the good news \u2013 things are better than we previously thought. The GDP figures contained some fairly significant revisions of past data, based on more accurate underlying data. Whereas in June it appeared the economy grew by just 1.5% \u2013 the worst since 2001 \u2013 now the ABS estimates in June the economy was growing at an annual rate of 1.7% and is now growing at 1.8% in trend terms: This is good, and yet it is pretty sad really how low the bar has become to think economic growth can be called \u201cgood\u201d. The current growth rate of 1.8% is around 1% point below the long-term trend and well below the old marker of 3% growth that used to be considered average. In the September quarter the economy grew by 0.4% (seasonally adjusted), or 0.5% (trend), still below average, but what is important is where this growth is being generated. The biggest driver was net exports \u2013 contributing 0.35% pts of that growth. Mostly this came not from surging exports but another big decline in imports: For the past four quarters we have reduced the amount we have been importing. So while the 1% growth in exports is below the post-GFC average, net exports (exports minus imports) are our biggest contributor to growth. The reason we are importing less is because both private-sector businesses and households are slowing their growth of spending. And that is not a good thing. In the past 12 months household consumption grew by a mere 1.2% \u2013 less than half the long-term average: And this is off the back of the tax cuts. Clearly we have chosen to save more rather than spend, which is also reflected by the savings ratio increasing from 3.5% to 4.0%. The treasurer and prime minister have both suggested this is fine \u2013 they argue it is up to people to decide how to spend their money \u2013 but it reflects a generally negative outlook. As a result the second-biggest contributor to GDP growth was not household consumption but government spending: Mostly this is increased spending on the NDIS and aged care. It is not due to a big increase in infrastructure. In the September quarter, public-sector investment contributed just 0.03% pts to GDP growth and a mere 0.01% pts over the past year \u2013 the lowest amount for four years: The past two quarters have seen the rare case where government spending is contributing more to economic growth than that of households. That generally happens only during recessions or sharp downturns such as the GFC: It means if we take away government spending and investment as well as net exports, the private sector domestic economy is shrinking \u2013 it has fallen for four consecutive quarters and is down 0.8% in the past year: This again is a very sad state of affairs \u2013 essentially suggesting the domestic private sector is in a recession. It is certainly not resonant of an economy with strong fundamentals. Similarly, the productivity growth figures echo the dire results revealed earlier this week. GDP per hour worked has now averaged an annual growth of just 0.2% over the past three years \u2013 the worst result since the 1990s recession: This is disastrous, given 1% average productivity growth is generally viewed as the long-term minimum that is utterly crucial for ensuring long-term wage and income growth. On the latter, at least this quarter has seen some improvement. Real household disposable income per capita rose 0.9% over the past year \u2013 the strongest growth since 2015 \u2013 a welcome improvement, even if it only repairs the fall of the past few quarters: But again, when we look closer we see the improvement is not due to a fundamental health in the economy, but rather just the tax cuts. The level of income paid in tax in real and per capita terms fell 2% in the September quarter, but gross household income per capital did not rise at all in real terms: Little wonder that households took the tax cuts and put it on their mortgage or paid off their credit card rather than feel confident enough to spend the money.

      "bodyText": "A group of Wilderness Society life members led by the former Greens leader Bob Brown are calling for an independent review into the conservation group after it recorded a $1.7m deficit last financial year, forcing it to sack campaign and other staff. In a letter to the organisation\u2019s directors, Brown and four other life members expressed \u201cprofound concern\u201d for the 43-year-old organisation, which they say is \u201cone of the world\u2019s most important defenders of wild and natural country\u201d. The letter was written before a fiery annual general meeting last week at which members voted down motions to accept the organisation\u2019s annual financial report and to acknowledge the work of board members. The board did not receive the letter until Wednesday this week. Brown, a founding member, former director and the public face of the organisation\u2019s groundbreaking early 1980s campaign to save the Franklin River, told Guardian Australia the scale of the loss was unprecedented in its history. He said concern for the environment within the community was at record levels and other green groups were growing, but the Wilderness Society was not. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly time for a review. The organisation has obviously hit a rut. There has never been a time when the Wilderness Society was more needed to be firing on all four cylinders,\u201d Brown said. The society\u2019s chief executive, Matt Brennan, said the board would organise a meeting with the life members to discuss their concerns. He said the group\u2019s revenue was down about $2m last year, $1.5m of which was due to a decline in bequests. Brennan said the society had been \u201cpushing\u201d its budget to prioritise campaigns, but realised in February it was taking a loss and would need to make tough decisions. Membership was down to about 28,000 from more than 45,000 last decade, but he said the organisation received money from more than 40,000 people each year. \u201cI think at its heart there is a misunderstanding and having an opportunity for people to genuinely hear each other is going to be critical,\u201d he said of the promised meeting. The letter from the life members asks for more information about the wilderness protection benefits of \u201cmovement for life\u201d, a community engagement program that received more than a quarter of spending on programs last year. Many of the cuts at the Wilderness Society came after it played a leading role in a stalled campaign for the introduction of stronger environment laws and a national environment protection authority. Labor, which had been widely expected to win the election, embraced the push for change. The victorious Coalition did not. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some members privately see the split in the organisation on political lines: that Greens supporters are particularly unhappy with an election campaign seen as closely aligned with Labor. The annual general meeting was told the group spent nearly $400,000 on campaigning for new environment laws. Nearly 20 staff have resigned or been made redundant since last year. Its long-time national campaigns director and joint chief executive, Lyndon Schneiders, left last month. The life member\u2019s letter expresses concern about the events that led to staff being dismissed and the number of premises reduced when environmental concern is on the rise. \u201cAn independent review of (the organisation\u2019s) circumstances would be a good way forward and we would welcome the opportunity to take part in establishing such a review,\u201d it says. Other signatories to the letter are Geoff and Judy Lambert, Karen Alexander and a fifth life member whose name was redacted in the copy sent to Guardian Australia. Judy Lambert, a former national liaison officer, said the organisation had always striven to find a balance between funding local campaigns run by state and regional offices and centralised programs such as movement for life. She said she was concerned the organisation now \u201clacked a clear focus of speaking up for wilderness\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Wilderness Society is for,\u201d she said. Brennan said the organisation had run strong recent campaigns, including to protect forests in Victoria and Tasmania, highlighting deforestation and opposing oil and gas development in the Great Australian Bight. It played a leading role in raising awareness of the extinction crisis and the need for new environment laws, he said. \u201cWe are not wanting for campaigns to spend on,\u201d Brennan said. Brown said the five life members had each spent decades dedicated to the society and its priorities of protecting wilderness, and wanted to see it back on track. He said the board members were \u201call fine people\u201d and they looked forward to meeting with them. \u201cI love the Wilderness Society and it has got a great future, but its future has always depended on membership, and members have a right to know and have confidence about how campaign funds are being spent,\u201d he said.",

Visitors will navigate between thematic \u201cworlds\u201d \u2013 costumes, artefacts, video, photographs and soundscapes \u2013 to explore the history of Bangarra, and the Indigenous concepts of \u201ccountry, language and kinship\u201d that inspires it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"edc48dfd8b3af052dd62e65ecebcfbe424ac06ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edc48dfd8b3af052dd62e65ecebcfbe424ac06ec/0_0_5158_3439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Installation view of Knowledge Ground\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Installation view of Knowledge Ground: 30 Years of Sixty-Five Thousand, a celebration of three decades of Bangarra dance company which opened at Carriageworks in December 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The event will also herald the launch of the company\u2019s new digital archive site of the same name, which contains interviews, photographs, videos and essays about Bangarra\u2019s productions and processes.

      "bodyText": "When Brett Leavy recently showcased his digital renditions of pre-colonial landscapes in Australia, one Aboriginal man in the audience started to cry. \u201cI get tears [from the Indigenous audience] because they feel a sense of loss ... And then there\u2019s also anger,\u201d he says. Leavy is a Kooma man and founder of Brisbane-based Virtual Songlines: a First Nations interactive design agency whose output ranges from video games to virtual reality. \u201cI\u2019m doing this in a fun way \u2013 it\u2019s a bit gamefied \u2013 but the question I\u2019m asking is: who are the sovereign custodians of the land?\u201d For millennia, Indigenous Australian communities have been passing down histories, knowledge, language and customs, largely through oral storytelling. But in a world of digital addiction, where even the most remote parts of the country are being infiltrated by smartphones, telling stories via screens is the new necessary: a way to both preserve tradition and reach out to the young. And arts organisations are taking note: Indigenous digital storytelling forms a key part of major exhibitions ranging from Linear at Sydney\u2019s Powerhouse Museum \u2013 an exploration of Indigenous culture, lineage and storytelling across science, VR, technology and design \u2013 to the new permanent exhibition at Acmi in Melbourne, opening in 2020. And for many pioneers in the digital space, harnessing the tools of a new virtual world is a critical way to ensure Indigenous people retain control over their own stories. \u201cThere is massive intellectual capital in our community. There is this whole untapped resource,\u201d Mikaela Jade, founder of the Indigenous augmented reality app Indigital Storytelling, said at a talk in Sydney in 2017. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for it to be built and then be given it to us.\u201d Stephen Page, creative director of Indigenous dance company Bangarra, is taking this idea seriously.

      "bodyText": "Seventy years after Nato was founded to protect western Europe from Joseph Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union, the military alliance returned this week to its first home in London to discuss an increasingly sprawling set of goals while bickering leaders competed to see who could offer the most contentious soundbite. Normally this is an arena that would be dominated by Donald Trump, although this time he was somewhat upstaged by Emmanuel Macron, whose pre-summit declaration that the organisation had become \u201cbrain dead\u201d obliged Trump to describe his French counterpart\u2019s comments as \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d. In the end, France pointedly secured in the nine-paragraph post-summit statement recognition that \u201cRussia\u2019s aggressive actions\u201d are in essence as important a threat as \u201cterrorism in all its forms\u201d \u2013 an attempt to ensure that the fight against Islamic State is not, as Trump tried to argue last month, over. Post-summit declarations can only go so far. The growing complexity of the organisation required Nato leaders to negotiate with Turkey, which had refused to sign off updated plans to defend the Baltic states against Russia unless Nato agreed to designate the Kurdish Syrian YPG as terrorists. This time, diplomacy appears to have succeeded, and Ankara signed up to a new defence plan for Russia\u2019s nervous western neighbours. But it was an uncomfortable reminder how an increasingly assertive ally \u2013 with the second-largest armed forces in the organisation \u2013 can exert influence, potentially affecting the security of others far away. Despite this, Nato\u2019s focus continues to spread. The summit is the first time its leaders have considered the rise of China, which has never been a focus for the organisation; they also confirmed that it was time for Nato to have a military presence in space, and they worried about cyberwarfare and Russian disinformation. But just as the UK debates leaving the EU, Nato is, prompted by Macron\u2019s outburst, deciding itself how to \u201cstrengthen its political dimension\u201d \u2013 or to put it another way, how it can insulate itself against an erratic US president who nobody is totally sure would defend a fellow ally after the abandonment of the Syrian Kurds. Trump\u2019s focus, meanwhile, has been on getting other Nato countries to spend more and more on defence. The UK is one of only nine countries to meet the target of spending 2% or more of GDP, but Boris Johnson, eager to keep Trump happy, has already agreed to make real terms increases every year, while China is talked up as a risk. This has been a triumph of sorts for White House diplomacy \u2013 not least because at the last summit in Brussels last year, a belligerent US president had threatened to \u201cgo it alone\u201d if other countries did not spend more. In London, Trump threatened to launch trade wars against \u201cdelinquent\u201d states not prepared to spend more on arms, then petulantly decided to cancel a press conference \u2013 almost certainly to the delight of Johnson\u2019s Downing Street, a week before an election \u2013 claiming a \u201ctwo-faced\u201d Justin Trudeau had joked about him at Buckingham Palace the night before. Nevertheless, Nato defence spending has been gradually creeping up: by 4.6% in 2019 among Canada and the European members, a demonstration arguably of what Nato supporters say is the most successful military alliance in history. But the events of the last two days also serve to underline that Nato is becoming an ever more complex organisation whose persistent squabbling means that questions will linger over precisely how effective it would be in the unlikely event collective military defence would ever be required.",

There are an infinite number of such possible scenarios, but real-world emissions will follow only one path, and it will never exactly match the few scenarios input into climate models. Thus, if Earth warms less than in a climate model projection, it does not necessarily mean the model was inaccurate.</p> \n<p>Put simply, climate scientists are not in the business of predicting human fossil fuel consumption but are attempting to accurately simulate how the climate will change in response to a given rise in greenhouse gas emissions.</p> \n<p>\u201cFuture emissions depend on human behaviour, not physical systems, and climate models should be evaluated on their physics rather than the future emission projections,\u201d said Hausfather.</p> \n<p>In nearly half of the model projections examined in the paper, the input scenarios were significantly different from the real-world changes in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, projected temperature changes were only consistent with observed global warming in 10 of the 17 models, with four projecting more warming and three projecting less than subsequently occurred.</p> \n<p>However, the study authors addressed these inconsistencies by evaluating the change in temperature per change in \u201cradiative forcing\u201d \u2013 the global energy imbalance caused by the increased greenhouse effect and other factors \u2013 in models against what happened in the real world. This metric reveals whether the climate models are accurately producing the temperature response to a given emissions change \u2013 in essence, whether are accurately simulating the physical response of Earth\u2019s climate system.

      "bodyText": "Climate models have accurately predicted global heating for the past 50 years, a study has found. The findings confirm that since as early as 1970, climate scientists have had a solid fundamental understanding of the Earth\u2019s climate system and the ability to project how it will respond to continued increases in the greenhouse effect. Since climate models have accurately anticipated global temperature changes so far, we can expect projections of future warming to be reliable as well. The research examines the accuracy of 17 models published over the past five decades, beginning with a 1970 study and including 1981 and 1988 models led by James Hansen, the former Nasa climatologist who testified to the US Senate in 1988 about the impacts of anthropogenic global heating. The study also includes the first four reports by the UN\u2019s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC). \u201cWe found that climate models \u2013 even those published back in the 1970s \u2013 did remarkably well, with 14 out of the 17 model projections indistinguishable from what actually occurred,\u201d said Zeke Hausfather, of the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the paper, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Based on modern climate model projections, if countries follow through with current and pledged climate policies, the world is on track for about 3C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 \u2013 a situation the IPCC and others predict would be catastrophic. The challenge in evaluating climate model accuracy lies in the fact that due to computing power limitations, simulations are only run for a few specific future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. There are an infinite number of such possible scenarios, but real-world emissions will follow only one path, and it will never exactly match the few scenarios input into climate models. Thus, if Earth warms less than in a climate model projection, it does not necessarily mean the model was inaccurate. Put simply, climate scientists are not in the business of predicting human fossil fuel consumption but are attempting to accurately simulate how the climate will change in response to a given rise in greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cFuture emissions depend on human behaviour, not physical systems, and climate models should be evaluated on their physics rather than the future emission projections,\u201d said Hausfather. In nearly half of the model projections examined in the paper, the input scenarios were significantly different from the real-world changes in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, projected temperature changes were only consistent with observed global warming in 10 of the 17 models, with four projecting more warming and three projecting less than subsequently occurred. However, the study authors addressed these inconsistencies by evaluating the change in temperature per change in \u201cradiative forcing\u201d \u2013 the global energy imbalance caused by the increased greenhouse effect and other factors \u2013 in models against what happened in the real world. This metric reveals whether the climate models are accurately producing the temperature response to a given emissions change \u2013 in essence, whether are accurately simulating the physical response of Earth\u2019s climate system. With this factored in, 14 of the 17 models were accurate. \u201cThe rate of warming we are experiencing today is pretty much exactly what past climate models projected it would be,\u201d said Hausfather. Those who oppose policies to limit the impacts of global heating have long sought to undermine the credibility of climate models. If the model projections are considered unreliable, they argue, then we do not know how urgent slowing global warming is. As a result, \u201cclimate models are unreliable\u201d has become a popular myth propagated by climate deniers. The latest study adds to the body of evidence supporting the accuracy of climate models, and will be welcomed by those arguing that more aggressive climate policies are needed to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. The UN climate summit in Glasgow in 2020 will be crucial, as countries will be expected to commit to scaling up the emission reductions that were pledged in the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.",

Det Supt Des McHugh said: \u201cAt 13:58 hours, police were contacted with reports that a male was attacking delegates at the event [at Fishmongers\u2019 Hall]. Armed officers attended the scene. On their arrival, the man had left the building and was being restrained on London Bridge by several members of the public. The male was subsequently shot by the police.\u201d McHugh said pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl had determined that both victims died from shock and haemorrhaging, in each case caused by a stab wound to the chest. Jones was pronounced dead at 2.25pm. Merritt had been moved by police from Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, where a prison rehabilitation event was being held, to the junction with King William Street because of the ongoing incident. He was pronounced dead there at 3.14pm. McHugh described Jones as \u201cpassionate about victim support\u201d, detailing how she had applied to join the graduate recruitment programme of West Midlands police. He said she hoped to use that role to further her studies with a PhD at Oxford University. She was a volunteer with the Learning Together programme, while the role of Merritt, who graduated with a master\u2019s in criminology from Cambridge in 2017, included rehabilitation work with prisoners. McHugh said the investigation into their deaths was being led by the Metropolitan police\u2019s counter-terrorism command. Three other people were injured by the assailant, Usman Khan, 28, he said. Alison Hewitt, the senior coroner of the City of London, said the chief coroner for England and Wales, Mark Lucraft QC, would preside over the inquests into the deaths of Jones and Merritt and a counsel to the inquests would be appointed to assist him. As a result, she said, no date could yet be set for the inquests. The inquests will likely scrutinise the decision to free Khan from jail in December 2018, halfway through his sentence, after he was convicted in 2012 of a terror plot. The revelation has already provoked a row between Labour and the Conservatives despite Merritt\u2019s father, Dave, pleading for Boris Johnson not to politicise his son\u2019s death. Khan, who had been living in Stafford, was given permission to travel to London by the police and probation service. He was wearing a fake suicide vest. The security services will also inevitably face difficult questions during the inquests as Khan is only the second suspect under active investigation by MI5 who has gone on to kill. The first was the ringleader of the 2017 attack on London Bridge, Khuram Butt. In his prevention of future deaths report, released last month, following the inquests into the eight victims of the 2017 London Bridge attacks, Mark Lucraft raised concerns about the monitoring of Butt, particularly two suspensions of the priority MI5 investigation into him. Last week\u2019s London Bridge attack bore similarities to the one in 2017. Khan and Butt had both strapped knives to their wrists and constructed fake bomb belts. Both had been close to the al-Muhajiroun group, whose spokesperson was the jailed Islamic State supporter Anjem Choudary, but had moved away. An inquest into Khan\u2019s death was also opened and adjourned until a date to be determined. McHugh said: \u201cHis life was pronounced extinct at 15:07 hours \u2026 whilst he was on London Bridge.\u201d Fegan-Earl determined Khan\u2019s cause of death to be \u201cshock and haemorrhage from the multiple gunshots to the chest and abdomen\u201d.",

Trump complained about a recently announced French tax on American tech companies such as Google, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let people take advantage of American companies, because if anyone is going to take advantage of American companies, it\u2019s gonna be us.\u201d Noah translated Trump\u2019s logic: \u201cHow dare you take advantage of American companies \u2013 that\u2019s what I was gonna do.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s like the world\u2019s worst superhero,\u201d Noah marveled. \u201cHe\u2019ll like stop a mugger who\u2019s robbing an old lady, but only so he can fly off with her purse.\u201d In response to the French taxes, Trump is now threatening to tax \u201call the most cliched French goods like wine, cheese and handbags\u201d, Noah explained. \u201cHe was probably also going to tax French fries and mistresses, but that hit too close to home.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also recapped the president\u2019s trip to London for the Nato summit, starting with Trump\u2019s claim that if anyone was going to take advantage of American companies, it would be him. \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2013 nobody beats up my little brother except for me,\u201d Kimmel explained as reasoning. Kimmel also touched on Trump\u2019s issues with Macron\u2019s \u201cbraindead\u201d characterization of Nato. \u201cHe\u2019s right \u2013 what kind of a person would go around making disrespectful statements about Nato?\u201d Kimmel said before rolling a series of clips of Trump lambasting Nato as \u201cobsolete\u201d, \u201cripping us off\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s old, it\u2019s fat, it\u2019s sloppy\u201d. In other words, \u201cit\u2019s just like him\u201d, Kimmel said. Meanwhile, the House released its report based on the impeachment hearings, which revealed that according to phone records, the House intelligence committee member and notorious Trump loyalist Devin Nunes had multiple conversations with Lev Parnas, one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian associates recently indicted for campaign finance violations. Nunes did not disclose the conversations to the committee nor recuse himself from the investigation; the revelation is \u201clike if we found out Judge Ito used to crash on OJ\u2019s couch or something\u201d, Kimmel explained. \u201cThis report explains why these Republicans around Trump keep saying he didn\u2019t do anything wrong: it\u2019s because they did the same stuff he did.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I won\u2019t be voting in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2019\" title=\"\">coming general election</a>. I would gallop to my polling station on a horse, or even crawl there to do so, (it\u2019s not half a mile away), but I\u2019m not a UK citizen, so I can\u2019t. My family and I have lived here just over five years, and we pay taxes and national insurance. We also pay the immigrant health surcharge every year for each family member, according to the terms of our visas. However, we\u2019re not quite there yet on the path to citizenship, so no votes for us this time. But I love the UK, very much and that\u2019s mostly down to the people who inhabit it (that includes you!) so forgive me if I weigh in.</p> <p>Strange to think now, but we were planning to leave the UK and return to the US after we\u2019d been here a couple of years. We missed our friends and the wild nature of southern California. But then our youngest son was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and his treatment began at Great Ormond Street hospital in London. While its staff were the experts in treating his cancer, my wife and I devoted our attention to keeping the family together and making sure Henry and his brothers could be together as much as possible, be it in his hospital room or on the odd visit Henry could make to our house.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is more money available to strengthen the social safety net than you can imagine, even if your imagination is very supple and rubbery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I remember with joy the first time a nurse said, \u201cI think Henry is ready to go up on the roof,\u201d and we left the paediatric intensive care unit, and Henry felt sunlight and wind on his skin for the first time in months.</p> <p>A couple of months later, another wonderful nurse said, \u201cThink Henry\u2019d like to take a taxi and go see his room and toys at home?\u201d Boy, did he. We were so happy.</p> <p>Twenty-one months after his diagnosis, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@robdelaney_50150/note-i-wrote-all-of-this-except-the-last-paragraph-in-april-or-may-of-2017-6b8f5e702533\" title=\"\">Henry died at home, early on a January morning</a>. He was able to do so because the NHS had turned my wife and me into expert carers, and Great Ormond Street\u2019s palliative care team had set us up so well.</p> <p>I believe I counted 13 NHS nurses at Henry\u2019s memorial service. A doctor and one of his home carers too. Several charity workers as well. After that, we didn\u2019t want to move right away. Henry\u2019s death hadn\u2019t been up to us, but inflicting an intercontinental move on our grief-stricken older boys was. Plus, our local state primary school had been taking such wonderful care of them we didn\u2019t want to lose that invaluable resource.</p> <p>So, we stayed. My wife had another baby. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/05/americans-uk-health-system-trump-nhs\" title=\"\">Unlike in the US</a>, where home births are usually denied to women by their private insurance companies (you\u2019re free to pay thousands out of your own pocket if you can afford it), the NHS was happy to facilitate one. Thus, our new little nugget entered the world in a pool at home, with my wife assisted by a midwife, me and our two older boys. They had seen hell with Henry, and when they asked if they could be present at the new one\u2019s birth, we said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d This was made possible by the NHS.</p> <p>In the days leading up to the election, some people are asking, \u201cHow will we pay to properly fund the NHS, social care, schools and more?\u201d While my family\u2019s experience with NHS has been positive, the horror stories you read are also true. It is underfunded. It is being sold off piecemeal to private companies whose main priority is to make money off your ailments, injuries and prescriptions. One massive reason I\u2019m such an NHS cheerleader, even in these bleak times, is because I grew up with the for-profit private American healthcare system.</p> <p>The stress you feel surrounding your health in the UK is so much lower than in the US, thanks to the absence of financial fear. Waiting for two hours in A&amp;E at one in the morning sucks; waiting for two hours in an American ER at one in the morning as you rehearse the speech you\u2019ll give the billing office about how the insurance from your new job doesn\u2019t kick in until the end of the month and you can\u2019t afford the CT scan your child is likely to need is a whole level of stress that I pray no one in the UK ever feels.</p> <p>So where does the money come from to properly fund the NHS, you\u2019ve been trained to ask. You know what financial stress feels like. You can\u2019t afford a Land Rover, so how the hell can the nation afford to provide home care for disabled kids? Isn\u2019t that how it works? Well, think about this: you probably could afford a Land Rover if your income was tripled or quintupled. What if you wanted to really challenge your imagination though? And you genuinely have to stretch and warm up to imagine how much money there is just sitting around, metastasising in tax shelters and unoccupied Mayfair flats.</p> <p>You\u2019re <em>not</em> an idiot because you find it difficult to grapple with how wealthy UK billionaires and corporations are. Guess how many times you would have to multiply the average UK salary of \u00a337,000 to equal what the <em>second</em> highest paid CEO in the UK \u2013 a man called Simon Peckham \u2013 got in 2017? If you guessed 1,162 times, congratulations. I personally make a lot of money because I won some cosmic lottery and have the incredible privilege to write and appear in TV shows and movies. But if you even \u201cmerely\u201d doubled my income, I would immediately shit my pants in shock. And even then, I still wouldn\u2019t buy a Land Rover as I live in London, whose world-class tube, buses and overground make owning a car unnecessary. Black cabs are great too and are fantastic for disabled travellers, as we learned with our Henry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/03/jeremy-corbyn-on-the-offensive-over-donald-trumps-plans-for-nhs\">Jeremy Corbyn on the offensive over Donald Trump\u2019s plans for NHS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Above even Simon Peckham are the people whose inherited wealth just throws off interest and capital gains every year, which make the biggest salaries in the world look quaint. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, heir to the beer fortune, could buy and sell Simon Peckham, me, and you, before breakfast. If you\u2019re keeping track, it goes you, me, Simon Peckham, Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken. Then above Carvalho-Heineken is the UK government, rich beyond comprehension, and possessed of the ability to literally print money. This digression just scratches the surface but suffice it to say there is more cash available to strengthen the social safety net than you can imagine, even if your imagination is very supple and rubbery.</p> <p>It\u2019s a question of will. Billionaires \u2013 in particular the billionaires who own most UK newspapers \u2013 don\u2019t want you to use your imagination though: they want you to take any dreams you have and smother them. I\u2019d ask that you do the opposite. Dream, on a personal level and on a national level. But since faith without work is dead, please also work. Campaign to elect a government that would prioritise schools, the climate and the NHS. If people tell you we can\u2019t afford it, you can slap that bullshit right to the floor. Read history and learn about the creation of the NHS, so beloved by my family and yours, or the gloriously successful New Deal in the US.

      "bodyText": "I won\u2019t be voting in the coming general election. I would gallop to my polling station on a horse, or even crawl there to do so, (it\u2019s not half a mile away), but I\u2019m not a UK citizen, so I can\u2019t. My family and I have lived here just over five years, and we pay taxes and national insurance. We also pay the immigrant health surcharge every year for each family member, according to the terms of our visas. However, we\u2019re not quite there yet on the path to citizenship, so no votes for us this time. But I love the UK, very much and that\u2019s mostly down to the people who inhabit it (that includes you!) so forgive me if I weigh in. Strange to think now, but we were planning to leave the UK and return to the US after we\u2019d been here a couple of years. We missed our friends and the wild nature of southern California. But then our youngest son was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and his treatment began at Great Ormond Street hospital in London. While its staff were the experts in treating his cancer, my wife and I devoted our attention to keeping the family together and making sure Henry and his brothers could be together as much as possible, be it in his hospital room or on the odd visit Henry could make to our house. I remember with joy the first time a nurse said, \u201cI think Henry is ready to go up on the roof,\u201d and we left the paediatric intensive care unit, and Henry felt sunlight and wind on his skin for the first time in months. A couple of months later, another wonderful nurse said, \u201cThink Henry\u2019d like to take a taxi and go see his room and toys at home?\u201d Boy, did he. We were so happy. Twenty-one months after his diagnosis, Henry died at home, early on a January morning. He was able to do so because the NHS had turned my wife and me into expert carers, and Great Ormond Street\u2019s palliative care team had set us up so well. I believe I counted 13 NHS nurses at Henry\u2019s memorial service. A doctor and one of his home carers too. Several charity workers as well. After that, we didn\u2019t want to move right away. Henry\u2019s death hadn\u2019t been up to us, but inflicting an intercontinental move on our grief-stricken older boys was. Plus, our local state primary school had been taking such wonderful care of them we didn\u2019t want to lose that invaluable resource. So, we stayed. My wife had another baby. Unlike in the US, where home births are usually denied to women by their private insurance companies (you\u2019re free to pay thousands out of your own pocket if you can afford it), the NHS was happy to facilitate one. Thus, our new little nugget entered the world in a pool at home, with my wife assisted by a midwife, me and our two older boys. They had seen hell with Henry, and when they asked if they could be present at the new one\u2019s birth, we said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d This was made possible by the NHS. In the days leading up to the election, some people are asking, \u201cHow will we pay to properly fund the NHS, social care, schools and more?\u201d While my family\u2019s experience with NHS has been positive, the horror stories you read are also true. It is underfunded. It is being sold off piecemeal to private companies whose main priority is to make money off your ailments, injuries and prescriptions. One massive reason I\u2019m such an NHS cheerleader, even in these bleak times, is because I grew up with the for-profit private American healthcare system. The stress you feel surrounding your health in the UK is so much lower than in the US, thanks to the absence of financial fear. Waiting for two hours in A&amp;E at one in the morning sucks; waiting for two hours in an American ER at one in the morning as you rehearse the speech you\u2019ll give the billing office about how the insurance from your new job doesn\u2019t kick in until the end of the month and you can\u2019t afford the CT scan your child is likely to need is a whole level of stress that I pray no one in the UK ever feels. So where does the money come from to properly fund the NHS, you\u2019ve been trained to ask. You know what financial stress feels like. You can\u2019t afford a Land Rover, so how the hell can the nation afford to provide home care for disabled kids? Isn\u2019t that how it works? Well, think about this: you probably could afford a Land Rover if your income was tripled or quintupled. What if you wanted to really challenge your imagination though? And you genuinely have to stretch and warm up to imagine how much money there is just sitting around, metastasising in tax shelters and unoccupied Mayfair flats. You\u2019re not an idiot because you find it difficult to grapple with how wealthy UK billionaires and corporations are. Guess how many times you would have to multiply the average UK salary of \u00a337,000 to equal what the second highest paid CEO in the UK \u2013 a man called Simon Peckham \u2013 got in 2017? If you guessed 1,162 times, congratulations. I personally make a lot of money because I won some cosmic lottery and have the incredible privilege to write and appear in TV shows and movies. But if you even \u201cmerely\u201d doubled my income, I would immediately shit my pants in shock. And even then, I still wouldn\u2019t buy a Land Rover as I live in London, whose world-class tube, buses and overground make owning a car unnecessary. Black cabs are great too and are fantastic for disabled travellers, as we learned with our Henry. Above even Simon Peckham are the people whose inherited wealth just throws off interest and capital gains every year, which make the biggest salaries in the world look quaint. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, heir to the beer fortune, could buy and sell Simon Peckham, me, and you, before breakfast. If you\u2019re keeping track, it goes you, me, Simon Peckham, Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken. Then above Carvalho-Heineken is the UK government, rich beyond comprehension, and possessed of the ability to literally print money. This digression just scratches the surface but suffice it to say there is more cash available to strengthen the social safety net than you can imagine, even if your imagination is very supple and rubbery. It\u2019s a question of will. Billionaires \u2013 in particular the billionaires who own most UK newspapers \u2013 don\u2019t want you to use your imagination though: they want you to take any dreams you have and smother them. I\u2019d ask that you do the opposite. Dream, on a personal level and on a national level. But since faith without work is dead, please also work. Campaign to elect a government that would prioritise schools, the climate and the NHS. If people tell you we can\u2019t afford it, you can slap that bullshit right to the floor. Read history and learn about the creation of the NHS, so beloved by my family and yours, or the gloriously successful New Deal in the US. Arm yourself with facts in your head and dreams in your heart. But get involved; the solutions to the UK\u2019s problems lie in more democracy, not less. And, oh yeah, do feel free to tick Labour on 12 December. I\u2019ve read the manifesto, and it\u2019s genuinely inspiring (and fully costed just in case your imagination got strained above). And it\u2019s entirely achievable too, if you want it. It\u2019s up to you. \u2022 Rob Delaney is the co-creator and co-writer of Catastrophe",

      "body": "<p>Black and ethnic minority voters are backing Jeremy Corbyn in far higher numbers than the overall electorate as the two main political parties vie for their votes in crucial swing seats.</p> <p>Labour is leading the Conservatives by 25 points among black, Asian and minority ethnic voters (BAME), according to polling by Opinium. More than half (52%) said they could imagine Corbyn in Downing Street.</p> <p>The figures have been disclosed as the two main parties make a concerted push to win over the BAME vote with specifically tailored policies. They appear to reinforce the belief that second- and third-generation BAME immigrants, alarmed by the Windrush scandal and allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservatives, still distrust the party.</p> <p>Despite the latest data, the Conservatives believe they are gaining support in areas with large Hindu, Sikh and African communities, with promises of business-friendly policies and an easing of post-Brexit immigration restrictions on Commonwealth countries.</p> <p>It came as the campaign group Operation Black Vote (OBV) said the BAME vote could dictate the outcome in 100 key marginals including Labour-held Kensington, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Richmond Park, Southampton Itchen, Peterborough and Portsmouth South.</p> <p>Lord Woolley, the founder of OBV, said that during this election, the BAME vote will be more crucial than ever. \u201cThere have never been so many marginal seats, and there have never been so many where the BAME vote is important,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe implications for people of colour are writ large in this election. The Brexit narrative says \u2018we are a white, Christian nation and we are going to assert that\u2019. Think about it and you begin to realise how important those votes will be.\u201d</p> <p>Opinium surveyed BAME voters nationwide between 5 and 14 November and discovered differing approval ratings from those in the electorate at large.</p> <p>Nearly half of BAME voters (49%) said they intend to vote for Labour compared with 24% for the Conservatives. However, 38% believe they will not get their way and Johnson will be returned to Downing Street, compared with 23% who think that Corbyn will succeed on 12 December.</p> <p>While Corbyn had a +8% rating when ethnic minority voters were asked about his handling of his current job, Johnson had a -22% rating. When a Delta poll of the whole electorate asked a similar question about whether the leaders were doing their jobs well, it delivered a -34% approval rating that Corbyn was compared with -10% for Johnson. The poll was conducted between 14 and 16 November.</p> <p>The figures might offer some hope for the Tories, who have traditionally struggled with minority ethnic voters. In 2017, Labour enjoyed an enormous 34% lead over the Conservatives among minority ethnic voters, a surge that has not yet materialised, according to Opinium\u2019s data.</p> <p>Corbyn last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-to-launch-race-and-faith-manifesto\">launched the party\u2019s first race and faith manifesto </a>in an effort to woo BAME voters. Policies included a new public body to oversee the legacy of colonialism, a race equality unit at the Treasury, a pledge to introduce more black teachers and reduced charges for Home Office documents and tests.</p> <p>The policy announcement was overshadowed by the chief rabbi\u2019s criticisms of Labour\u2019s leadership for failing to tackle prejudice against another minority, the UK\u2019s Jewish community. Labour is facing a formal antisemitism inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and pollsters believe the party could pay an electoral price for the allegations which have dogged it for three and a half years.</p> <p>The Conservatives have included policies in their manifesto that they believe will appeal to minority ethnic voters. They include pledges to invest \u00a390m into the Youth Futures Foundation to improve employment outcomes for young people, mainly in urban areas.</p> <p>There is also a pledge to support for a memorial recognising the contribution of the Windrush generation after the scandal that dogged the party in 2017.</p> <p>Senior Tories, including the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, have attempted to exploit resentment among BAME residents over the apparent ease with which \u201cwhite Europeans\u201d could bring over spouses compared with BAME people from African, Asian and Caribbean countries.</p> <p>Others say that the apparent wooing of BAME people may well take a back seat towards the end of the campaign. The Conservatives have acknowledged they must win leave seats in the north and the Midlands, which have large white working-class communities.</p> <p>Sunder Katwala, the director of the British Future thinktank, said the BAME vote gets more important at every election because the population is becoming increasingly diverse.</p> <p>But he expects the campaign to increasingly focus upon the needs of predominantly white communities whose votes are required for a working Commons majority. \u201cLeave voting towns are, in the main, a little older and whiter. We can expect that the battlegrounds will be slightly less diverse seats,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the Tories have won, they have concentrated on less diverse areas and they can do that again. But in the long term, their strategy will have to change to find a way of winning over a more diverse and fractured BAME community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There has been a recognisable change in the way BAME communities vote, Katwala said. First-generation immigrants could not bring themselves to vote for the Conservatives because of the party\u2019s past pandering to racist attitudes exemplified by Enoch Powell\u2019s speeches and Norman Tebbit\u2019s \u201ccricket test\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAsk younger BAME people, they do not know who Enoch Powell is. His resonance is of less importance and other mainstream issues such as health, education and the economy are of more importance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Politicians will continue to ingratiate themselves with ethnically diverse communities during election campaigns, Katwala said, but can no longer rely upon a bloc vote to turn out.</p> <p>\u201cIt is fine if politicians go to gurdwaras and mosques as they always do for photo opportunities but they must drop the idea that ethnic minority voters turn up to those places to be told how to vote any more than a white British voter turns up to a C of E chapel to hear how they should vote,\u201d he said.<br></p>",

Lord Woolley, the founder of OBV, said that during this election, the BAME vote will be more crucial than ever. \u201cThere have never been so many marginal seats, and there have never been so many where the BAME vote is important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe implications for people of colour are writ large in this election. The Brexit narrative says \u2018we are a white, Christian nation and we are going to assert that\u2019. Think about it and you begin to realise how important those votes will be.\u201d Opinium surveyed BAME voters nationwide between 5 and 14 November and discovered differing approval ratings from those in the electorate at large. Nearly half of BAME voters (49%) said they intend to vote for Labour compared with 24% for the Conservatives. However, 38% believe they will not get their way and Johnson will be returned to Downing Street, compared with 23% who think that Corbyn will succeed on 12 December. While Corbyn had a +8% rating when ethnic minority voters were asked about his handling of his current job, Johnson had a -22% rating. When a Delta poll of the whole electorate asked a similar question about whether the leaders were doing their jobs well, it delivered a -34% approval rating that Corbyn was compared with -10% for Johnson. The poll was conducted between 14 and 16 November. The figures might offer some hope for the Tories, who have traditionally struggled with minority ethnic voters. In 2017, Labour enjoyed an enormous 34% lead over the Conservatives among minority ethnic voters, a surge that has not yet materialised, according to Opinium\u2019s data. Corbyn last week launched the party\u2019s first race and faith manifesto in an effort to woo BAME voters. Policies included a new public body to oversee the legacy of colonialism, a race equality unit at the Treasury, a pledge to introduce more black teachers and reduced charges for Home Office documents and tests. The policy announcement was overshadowed by the chief rabbi\u2019s criticisms of Labour\u2019s leadership for failing to tackle prejudice against another minority, the UK\u2019s Jewish community. Labour is facing a formal antisemitism inquiry by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and pollsters believe the party could pay an electoral price for the allegations which have dogged it for three and a half years. The Conservatives have included policies in their manifesto that they believe will appeal to minority ethnic voters. They include pledges to invest \u00a390m into the Youth Futures Foundation to improve employment outcomes for young people, mainly in urban areas. There is also a pledge to support for a memorial recognising the contribution of the Windrush generation after the scandal that dogged the party in 2017. Senior Tories, including the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the chancellor, Sajid Javid, have attempted to exploit resentment among BAME residents over the apparent ease with which \u201cwhite Europeans\u201d could bring over spouses compared with BAME people from African, Asian and Caribbean countries. Others say that the apparent wooing of BAME people may well take a back seat towards the end of the campaign. The Conservatives have acknowledged they must win leave seats in the north and the Midlands, which have large white working-class communities. Sunder Katwala, the director of the British Future thinktank, said the BAME vote gets more important at every election because the population is becoming increasingly diverse. But he expects the campaign to increasingly focus upon the needs of predominantly white communities whose votes are required for a working Commons majority. \u201cLeave voting towns are, in the main, a little older and whiter. We can expect that the battlegrounds will be slightly less diverse seats,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the Tories have won, they have concentrated on less diverse areas and they can do that again. But in the long term, their strategy will have to change to find a way of winning over a more diverse and fractured BAME community,\u201d he said. There has been a recognisable change in the way BAME communities vote, Katwala said. First-generation immigrants could not bring themselves to vote for the Conservatives because of the party\u2019s past pandering to racist attitudes exemplified by Enoch Powell\u2019s speeches and Norman Tebbit\u2019s \u201ccricket test\u201d. \u201cAsk younger BAME people, they do not know who Enoch Powell is. His resonance is of less importance and other mainstream issues such as health, education and the economy are of more importance,\u201d he said. Politicians will continue to ingratiate themselves with ethnically diverse communities during election campaigns, Katwala said, but can no longer rely upon a bloc vote to turn out. \u201cIt is fine if politicians go to gurdwaras and mosques as they always do for photo opportunities but they must drop the idea that ethnic minority voters turn up to those places to be told how to vote any more than a white British voter turns up to a C of E chapel to hear how they should vote,\u201d he said.",

Cricket has lost a dear friend.\u201d Fellow England captain David Gower, who worked closely with Willis during his time in the broadcast studios, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cI toured with him as a captain and I took over the captaincy from him and then had him as what was called in those days as an assistant manager. He was a very loyal friend and a loyal supporter. \u201cWithout going into too much unseemly detail, it was an era where you were allowed to have more fun than you are possibly today. Various tours Down Under were colourful, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d An emotional Paul Allott, another teammate and former broadcasting colleague, described Willis as a \u201csweet, sweet guy\u201d and one of his closest friends. He told Sky Sports News: \u201cI was there when Bob passed away with Lauren, his wife, and his daughter in Wimbledon this afternoon. \u201cIt was a peaceful passing but it was obviously a hugely emotional moment. We\u2019ve known each other for more than 40 years. We played together. He was my first vice-captain for England and he took me under his wing in India.\u201d His former county Surrey posted on Twitter: \u201cAll at Surrey County Cricket Club are devastated to learn of the passing of former Surrey and England bowler Bob Willis. Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.\u201d Willis began at Surrey where he spent the first two years of his county cricket career before representing Warwickshire for 12 years, ending with a total of 899 wickets from 308 first-class matches at an average of 24.99. He made his international debut aged 21 in the 1971 Ashes series. Remarkably one of this country\u2019s finest pace bowlers was troubled with injuries early in his career and was forced to have surgery on both knees in 1975, before playing another nine years at the top level. The ex-England opener Michael Carberry tweeted: \u201cVery sad to hear the passing of Bob Willis. Had the pleasure of working with him on SkyCricket. Great man and knowledge of the game as well as a great. #ripbobwillis.\u201d Actor and friend Stephen Fry highlighted Willis\u2019s non-sporting interests. He tweeted: \u201cOh no, not Bob Willis ... what joy he gave, and what a marvellous man. That 8 for 43. Used to lunch with him occasionally to talk cricket, Wagner and Bob Dylan, his three great passions.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The idea came to them in June. The Turner prize nominees had arrived in Margate to visit the Turner Contemporary. The four artists \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/01/silence-or-death-turner-finalist-lawrence-abu-hamdan-on-recreating-a-horrific-syrian-jail\">Lawrence Abu Hamdan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/18/helen-cammock-turner-prize-nominee-artist-social-worker\">Helen Cammock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/16/oscar-murillo-interview-turner-prize-hold-a-mirror-to-this-country\">Oscar Murillo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/24/tai-shani-semiramis-review-art-installation-tetley-leeds\">Tai Shani</a> \u2013 had never met before and, as they talked in a white-walled meeting room facing the North Sea, they began to discuss proposing themselves to the judges as a collective. Their idea was, in other words, that there should be no single winner of this year\u2019s Turner prize. It was a plan for a hijack \u2013 albeit, says Cammock, \u201ca considered hijack\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember who said it out loud first,\u201d says Shani, whose sensuous, voluptuous work for the prize\u2019s exhibition combines performance, text and installation to imagine a post-patriarchal world. \u201cWe\u2019d all thought about it. For me, it felt like being nominated was a huge recognition. I was really happy with that. When someone suggested it, we were very cohesive immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Murillo \u2013 who is showing an unsettling installation of papier-mache figures staring out to sea, their view all but blocked by a dark curtain \u2013 says: \u201cIf any of us had individually won, I would have felt I was betraying my own work and ideas \u2013 if we are indeed really talking about solidarity.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"633566f654798cada2dc1c31973f9a87fc7ea260\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/633566f654798cada2dc1c31973f9a87fc7ea260/189_0_2755_3444/800.jpg\" alt=\"The quartet celebrate their joint-win.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The quartet celebrate their joint-win.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images for Turner Contemporary</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abu Hamdan quickly understood that although his fellow shortlisted artists use very different aesthetic tools from him, they have much in common \u2013 an interest in power and agency, exclusion and oppression. \u201cIf anyone gets what we do as individual artists, they will get why this decision had to be made,\u201d he says. His films in the show arise from a project to collect aural memories from survivors of the infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/18/saydnaya-prison-syria-assad-amnesty-reconstruction\">Saydnaya prison</a> in Syria \u2013 memories that in practical terms helped researchers reconstruct the conditions of incarceration but also, in their distortions and metaphorical layerings, allowed the artist to mine a deeper, poetic understanding of these horrific experiences.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something about the way we work and why we work that resonated,\u201d remembers Cammock, who is showing a film about women\u2019s resistance and protest in Derry during the Troubles. \u201cWe started to talk about the toxic political environment and it felt like it was a moment we could start doing something about that, between us \u2013 however that worked or manifested.\u201d</p> <p>As their eventual joint statement puts it, they believed that pitting themselves against each other \u201cwould undermine our individual artistic efforts to show a world entangled. The issues we each deal with are as inseparable as climate chaos is from capitalism.\u201d Proposing themselves as a collective, as an act of resistance, would be a symbolic gesture. Symbolism is, of course, the great tool of the artist \u2013 and the Turner prize, for the British artist, is the most prominent platform from which to deploy it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84b98f4df85e32d337121686ff33b90aabd1925b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84b98f4df85e32d337121686ff33b90aabd1925b/0_367_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 One of Oscar Murillo\u2019s installations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re talking about solidarity\u2019 \u2026 One of Oscar Murillo\u2019s installations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This coup was, says Shani, \u201cactually quite a bureaucratic process. We didn\u2019t have very high hopes of it going through. This idea of Mutiny on the Bounty \u2013 that wasn\u2019t quite how it panned out.\u201d</p> <p>They made a proposal to Tate Britain, which runs the prize, in the summer and it wound its way up to the trustees before being offered to the jurors as an option. They weren\u2019t at all sure it would be accepted. The jurors met as usual on Tuesday, the day of the announcement, and were free to ignore what the artists had suggested \u2013 though realistically, there wasn\u2019t much moral wriggle-room. So they accepted and the artists will split the prize money equally, \u00a310,000 each.</p> <p>At the prize ceremony, in Margate\u2019s art deco Dreamland amusement park, Cammock read the full statement \u2013 the most political Turner prize speech in years, a sustained attack on the Conservatives\u2019 politics of austerity and exclusion. To slam the point home, Shani was sporting an enormous pendant bearing the slogan: \u201cTORIES OUT.\u201d She talked of an increasingly narrow idea of \u201cBritishness\u201d offered by the right. As Abu Hamdan put it the morning after: \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between being accepted as a British artist culturally \u2013 and being put on the highest platform of what it means to be a British artist \u2013 and the \u2018hostile environment\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>This feels personal to all of them. Abu Hamdan has a British passport but lives in Beirut partly because of the difficulties of settling his Lebanese wife in Britain. Murillo, who was born in Colombia, once flushed his British passport down an aeroplane loo in a moment of rebellion against the privilege the document confers. Shani, who is Jewish, talks about how she feels \u201cantisemitism has been manipulated by the right. There\u2019s a feeling that you are being instrumentalised and that people are speaking on behalf of your identity in the name of protecting you.\u201d Cammock feels that the current climate of division and racism is \u201ca resurgence of something toxically dangerous, like a wave that keeps rising\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a755e80e302d1d984f05b0a05fffc7a0c62bca06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a755e80e302d1d984f05b0a05fffc7a0c62bca06/0_70_5500_3300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 a piece from Tai Shani\u2019s Semiramis show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Everything is related\u2019 \u2026 \u2026 a piece from Tai Shani\u2019s Semiramis show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Should artists be getting into this kind of territory? Well, why not? All art is political. But the other point these artists press home is that they also live in the real world. Their work is not magically disconnected from their lives and opinions, and the society in which they live. \u201cI\u2019ve been vocal about my financial precarity,\u201d says Shani, who has posted on social media about how she\u2019s feared having to give up working as an artist because of the difficulty of making ends meet. \u201cPeople ask me,\u201d chips in Cammock, \u201cabout how the arts can become more inclusive spaces for people who don\u2019t come from wealthy backgrounds. But art isn\u2019t isolated from society. If people are excluded from other things, they will also be excluded from the arts.\u201d</p> <p>Shani continues: \u201cIf people aren\u2019t paid properly in the arts then people can\u2019t be artists.\u201d Cammock: \u201cAnd if it\u2019s being taken out of state education and becomes something for privileged private schools.\u201d Shani: \u201cThen there\u2019s higher education, tuition fees. Everything is related. We are part of society.\u201d</p> <p>You could reasonably ask: if the artists had been so eager to disrupt the rules of the Turner prize, why did they allow their nominations to go forward in the first place? They had the choice and many \u2013 mostly famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/06/sarah-lucas-venice-biennale-interview\">Sarah Lucas</a> \u2013 have turned down the chance over the years. The artists all say they are honoured to have been shortlisted, and their decision was contingent on the synergies between them \u2013 another combination, in another year, and it wouldn\u2019t have happened.</p> <p>But also, points out Cammock, this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Look at the history of sport. \u201cThere have been many moments when people have taken a stand \u2013 moments where people have seen the interconnectedness between things and have made a decision. They run across the line together. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\">do the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\">black </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/black-power-salute-1968-olympics\">power salute</a>.\u201d Abu Hamdan pitches in: \u201cAnd there\u2019s Kaepernick\u201d \u2013 referring to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/upset-at-nfl-colin-kaepernick-moves-scheduled-tryout\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, who took the knee during The Star-Spangled Banner as a protest against racism. \u201cWe are not in an isolated bubble,\u201d says Cammock. \u201cWe are people too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1b3ed66287f352f6efa81048e13af1798a719a5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b3ed66287f352f6efa81048e13af1798a719a5d/0_0_5976_3984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We are people too\u2019: Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo, Tai Shani and Lawrence Abu Hamdan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We are people too\u2019: Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo, Tai Shani and Lawrence Abu Hamdan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are in a moment when the traditional cultural authority of the arts prize \u2013 with its single \u201cgenius\u201d winner \u2013 is being challenged. More and more victors of prizes (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/09/helen-marten-turner-prize-winner-art-world\">Helen Marten</a>, for example, who won the Turner in 2016) are choosing to share out the prize money with their fellow nominees. In the case of the Booker prize this year, it was the judges who refused to observe the rules, presenting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/14/booker-prize-judges-break-the-rules-and-insist-on-joint-winners\">Bernardine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood</a> as joint winners in defiance of the organisers.</p> <p>Shani sees this as part of a wider shift \u2013 a mood of unpicking authority, of seeing through the accepted matrices of power and questioning them. It is possible that the world is moving beyond the monolithic, winner-takes-all prize \u2013 increasingly people are questioning the act that holds up one artist as the best. In the present case, it\u2019s hard not to fall for the sincerity of these four artists who, without cynicism, have expressed their beliefs and hopes through the means at their disposal.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did Audre Lorde say?\u201d says Cammock, in reference to the American poet and activist. \u201c\u2018Your silence will not protect you.\u2019 This is a moment of saying no to silence.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Turner prize exhibition is at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 12 January.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The idea came to them in June. The Turner prize nominees had arrived in Margate to visit the Turner Contemporary. The four artists \u2013 Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo, Tai Shani \u2013 had never met before and, as they talked in a white-walled meeting room facing the North Sea, they began to discuss proposing themselves to the judges as a collective. Their idea was, in other words, that there should be no single winner of this year\u2019s Turner prize. It was a plan for a hijack \u2013 albeit, says Cammock, \u201ca considered hijack\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t remember who said it out loud first,\u201d says Shani, whose sensuous, voluptuous work for the prize\u2019s exhibition combines performance, text and installation to imagine a post-patriarchal world. \u201cWe\u2019d all thought about it. For me, it felt like being nominated was a huge recognition. I was really happy with that. When someone suggested it, we were very cohesive immediately.\u201d Murillo \u2013 who is showing an unsettling installation of papier-mache figures staring out to sea, their view all but blocked by a dark curtain \u2013 says: \u201cIf any of us had individually won, I would have felt I was betraying my own work and ideas \u2013 if we are indeed really talking about solidarity.\u201d Abu Hamdan quickly understood that although his fellow shortlisted artists use very different aesthetic tools from him, they have much in common \u2013 an interest in power and agency, exclusion and oppression. \u201cIf anyone gets what we do as individual artists, they will get why this decision had to be made,\u201d he says. His films in the show arise from a project to collect aural memories from survivors of the infamous Saydnaya prison in Syria \u2013 memories that in practical terms helped researchers reconstruct the conditions of incarceration but also, in their distortions and metaphorical layerings, allowed the artist to mine a deeper, poetic understanding of these horrific experiences. \u201cThere was something about the way we work and why we work that resonated,\u201d remembers Cammock, who is showing a film about women\u2019s resistance and protest in Derry during the Troubles. \u201cWe started to talk about the toxic political environment and it felt like it was a moment we could start doing something about that, between us \u2013 however that worked or manifested.\u201d As their eventual joint statement puts it, they believed that pitting themselves against each other \u201cwould undermine our individual artistic efforts to show a world entangled. The issues we each deal with are as inseparable as climate chaos is from capitalism.\u201d Proposing themselves as a collective, as an act of resistance, would be a symbolic gesture. Symbolism is, of course, the great tool of the artist \u2013 and the Turner prize, for the British artist, is the most prominent platform from which to deploy it. This coup was, says Shani, \u201cactually quite a bureaucratic process. We didn\u2019t have very high hopes of it going through. This idea of Mutiny on the Bounty \u2013 that wasn\u2019t quite how it panned out.\u201d They made a proposal to Tate Britain, which runs the prize, in the summer and it wound its way up to the trustees before being offered to the jurors as an option. They weren\u2019t at all sure it would be accepted. The jurors met as usual on Tuesday, the day of the announcement, and were free to ignore what the artists had suggested \u2013 though realistically, there wasn\u2019t much moral wriggle-room. So they accepted and the artists will split the prize money equally, \u00a310,000 each. At the prize ceremony, in Margate\u2019s art deco Dreamland amusement park, Cammock read the full statement \u2013 the most political Turner prize speech in years, a sustained attack on the Conservatives\u2019 politics of austerity and exclusion. To slam the point home, Shani was sporting an enormous pendant bearing the slogan: \u201cTORIES OUT.\u201d She talked of an increasingly narrow idea of \u201cBritishness\u201d offered by the right. As Abu Hamdan put it the morning after: \u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between being accepted as a British artist culturally \u2013 and being put on the highest platform of what it means to be a British artist \u2013 and the \u2018hostile environment\u2019.\u201d This feels personal to all of them. Abu Hamdan has a British passport but lives in Beirut partly because of the difficulties of settling his Lebanese wife in Britain. Murillo, who was born in Colombia, once flushed his British passport down an aeroplane loo in a moment of rebellion against the privilege the document confers. Shani, who is Jewish, talks about how she feels \u201cantisemitism has been manipulated by the right. There\u2019s a feeling that you are being instrumentalised and that people are speaking on behalf of your identity in the name of protecting you.\u201d Cammock feels that the current climate of division and racism is \u201ca resurgence of something toxically dangerous, like a wave that keeps rising\u201d. Should artists be getting into this kind of territory? Well, why not? All art is political. But the other point these artists press home is that they also live in the real world. Their work is not magically disconnected from their lives and opinions, and the society in which they live. \u201cI\u2019ve been vocal about my financial precarity,\u201d says Shani, who has posted on social media about how she\u2019s feared having to give up working as an artist because of the difficulty of making ends meet. \u201cPeople ask me,\u201d chips in Cammock, \u201cabout how the arts can become more inclusive spaces for people who don\u2019t come from wealthy backgrounds. But art isn\u2019t isolated from society. If people are excluded from other things, they will also be excluded from the arts.\u201d Shani continues: \u201cIf people aren\u2019t paid properly in the arts then people can\u2019t be artists.\u201d Cammock: \u201cAnd if it\u2019s being taken out of state education and becomes something for privileged private schools.\u201d Shani: \u201cThen there\u2019s higher education, tuition fees. Everything is related. We are part of society.\u201d You could reasonably ask: if the artists had been so eager to disrupt the rules of the Turner prize, why did they allow their nominations to go forward in the first place? They had the choice and many \u2013 mostly famously Sarah Lucas \u2013 have turned down the chance over the years. The artists all say they are honoured to have been shortlisted, and their decision was contingent on the synergies between them \u2013 another combination, in another year, and it wouldn\u2019t have happened. But also, points out Cammock, this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Look at the history of sport. \u201cThere have been many moments when people have taken a stand \u2013 moments where people have seen the interconnectedness between things and have made a decision. They run across the line together. They do the black power salute.\u201d Abu Hamdan pitches in: \u201cAnd there\u2019s Kaepernick\u201d \u2013 referring to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took the knee during The Star-Spangled Banner as a protest against racism. \u201cWe are not in an isolated bubble,\u201d says Cammock. \u201cWe are people too.\u201d We are in a moment when the traditional cultural authority of the arts prize \u2013 with its single \u201cgenius\u201d winner \u2013 is being challenged. More and more victors of prizes (Helen Marten, for example, who won the Turner in 2016) are choosing to share out the prize money with their fellow nominees. In the case of the Booker prize this year, it was the judges who refused to observe the rules, presenting Bernardine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood as joint winners in defiance of the organisers. Shani sees this as part of a wider shift \u2013 a mood of unpicking authority, of seeing through the accepted matrices of power and questioning them. It is possible that the world is moving beyond the monolithic, winner-takes-all prize \u2013 increasingly people are questioning the act that holds up one artist as the best. In the present case, it\u2019s hard not to fall for the sincerity of these four artists who, without cynicism, have expressed their beliefs and hopes through the means at their disposal. \u201cWhat did Audre Lorde say?\u201d says Cammock, in reference to the American poet and activist. \u201c\u2018Your silence will not protect you.\u2019 This is a moment of saying no to silence.\u201d \u2022 The Turner prize exhibition is at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 12 January.",

Arsenal \u2013 then the best team in the land (kids, ask granny) \u2013 faced Arsenal Reserves in a training match at Highbury, the only ground the Beeb could reach from their Alexandra Palace studio with their big roll of cable. Eighty-two years on, Amazon joined the fray, and history soon repeated itself. On Tuesday night \u2013 using exactly the same vintage BBC equipment, if the way The Fiver\u2019s picture regularly slipped in and out of focus was any guide \u2013 the newest broadcaster on the scene also premiered with a dull training run-out. Manchester City\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/03/burnley-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">gentle trot around Turf Moor</a> made for viewing nearly as captivating as the eight hours of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/aug/23/all-or-nothing-manchester-city-fans-documentary\">All or Nothing</a>.

Much more. Wednesday\u2019s line-up on Amazon includes the Merseyside derby, Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s Frank Lampard versus Plain Old John Terry, another tense relegation six-pointer at St Mary\u2019s, and a festive panto from Manchester in which Humility Man\u2122, the boy who never grew up, returns to Neverland. It\u2019s a schedule sure to go down in broadcasting lore, alongside those legendary Christmas Days when BBC1 aired The Generation Game, Mike Yarwood and Morecambe and Wise, the must-see-TV nights on NBC when Friends was followed by Seinfeld and ER, and of course Television Service\u2019s memorable triple whammy of 3.40pm Football at the Arsenal, 3.55pm Cartoon, 4pm Closedown. Thanks again, Jeff!</p> <p>The biggest match in the listings is ostensibly the one at Anfield, where league leaders Liverpool defend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/03/marco-silva-everton-team-spirit-end-20-year-anfield-drought-merseyside-derby-liverpool\">their long unbeaten run</a> against Everton. But anyone who remembers Wayne Clarke and what he did in 1988 \u2013 another question for granny, perhaps \u2013 already knows how that one is likely to end. It\u2019s just going to happen, isn\u2019t it. So perhaps the more intriguing programme is the panto. Manchester United are currently enduring their worst start to a league season in 31 years, so the last person anyone at Old Trafford wants to see is \u2026 look out, Ole! He\u2019s behind you! Yes, it promises to be a proper night of entertainment, and it\u2019s all live on Amazon.

Wednesday\u2019s line-up on Amazon includes the Merseyside derby, Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea\u2019s Frank Lampard versus Plain Old John Terry, another tense relegation six-pointer at St Mary\u2019s, and a festive panto from Manchester in which Humility Man\u2122, the boy who never grew up, returns to Neverland. It\u2019s a schedule sure to go down in broadcasting lore, alongside those legendary Christmas Days when BBC1 aired The Generation Game, Mike Yarwood and Morecambe and Wise, the must-see-TV nights on NBC when Friends was followed by Seinfeld and ER, and of course Television Service\u2019s memorable triple whammy of 3.40pm Football at the Arsenal, 3.55pm Cartoon, 4pm Closedown. Thanks again, Jeff! The biggest match in the listings is ostensibly the one at Anfield, where league leaders Liverpool defend their long unbeaten run against Everton. But anyone who remembers Wayne Clarke and what he did in 1988 \u2013 another question for granny, perhaps \u2013 already knows how that one is likely to end. It\u2019s just going to happen, isn\u2019t it. So perhaps the more intriguing programme is the panto. Manchester United are currently enduring their worst start to a league season in 31 years, so the last person anyone at Old Trafford wants to see is \u2026 look out, Ole! He\u2019s behind you! Yes, it promises to be a proper night of entertainment, and it\u2019s all live on Amazon. Thanks in advance for all the fun, Jeff, and especially for the chance to cough up an extra eight quid for some stuff we already had. Thanks! LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Simon Burnton from 7.30pm GMT for hot Premier League clockwatch action, while Scott Murray will be on hand for Liverpool 1-2 Everton at 8.15pm.

Also on the list is Phil Brown as any character drawn in a yellowish-orange hue\u201d \u2013 Mike Wilner. \u201cBy suggesting we make a play into touch with the shiny baubles awarded on Monday night, has The Fiver inadvertently (or advertently?) stopped the STOP FOOTBALL campaign?

A 12-inch of Lizzo\u2019s Coconut Oil was pressed on coconut-coloured vinyl with a coconut-scented insert (\u00a325). If you missed those, you could grab Lou Reed\u2019s 2003 album, The Raven, for \u00a350.</p> <p>RSD and the fetishisation of vinyl has grown in inverse proportion to any pleasure I used to feel as a longtime record buyer. I started as a teenager in the early 2000s and now own a couple of thousand LPs. I\u2019m no longer overwhelmed by choice and excitement when I walk into a shop, just dismayed and despondent about how much everything costs and how silly some of it is.

Recently, the American record label <a href=\"https://twitter.com/numerogroup/status/1184485244315017222\">Numero Group tweeted</a>: \u201cReal talk: Records are too expensive. $30 represses from your favourite major label now dominate the bins.\u201d They launched a counteroffensive, slashing LP prices to $15, double LPs to $22 and CDs to $10. \u201cWe try to treat records as a format to distribute music, not as merch,\u201d label co-founder Rob Sevier tells me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4f372c0810304aa28b633eb202a33fb891e0b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4f372c0810304aa28b633eb202a33fb891e0b79/0_188_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coconut Oil pressed on coconut-coloured vinyl with a coconut-scented insert, anyone? ...

As a student, buying albums might mean skimping on the food shop or putting off that final-warning bill for another week. The trade-off felt worth it as I regarded my growing collection with pride, something that I had worked hard to build. But the trade-off between sacrifice and reward has soured. I went to buy the recent Inoyama Land reissue but was met with a \u00a342 price tag. I scanned the racks for something else, searching through countless \u00a325 new releases while spotting reissues that I bought six years ago, for \u00a315, that have now been reissued again at \u00a335. I didn\u2019t have any more luck in the secondhand section, rarely finding anything below \u00a320. It\u2019s felt like this for a while.</p> <p>I used to love trawling charity shops for bargains, but online marketplace Discogs has given shops a resource to increase prices. While nobody can begrudge charities for getting wise to a trend and changing prices accordingly, the thrill of finding gold there is long gone. The relatively recent days of skipping past hundreds of copies of Paul Young\u2019s No Parlez to unearth \u00a32 copies of Talking Heads albums have been replaced by \u00a315 stickers slapped on tatty copies of bog standard stuff such as Bob Dylan\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol 2.</p> <p>So why have records become more expensive? Phil Leigh of online retailer Norman Records blames RSD. \u201cIt\u2019s been hugely popular and is largely based around reissues, legacy acts and collectibles. The major labels have realised they can expand on that and make quite a bit of money from it \u2013 so they have.\u201d</p> <p>What constitutes an easy cash-in for majors doesn\u2019t trickle down to small indies. Michael Kasparis of Glaswegian label Night School <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NightSchoolRecs/status/1192515996818513921\">recently tweeted</a>: \u201cIf I had the guts I\u2019d stop doing stupid limited editions with signed tat or hardcover books or candy coloured splatter vinyl because I find the whole thing based on novelty and totally toxic when it comes to sustainability in this fucked industry. But I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfe3e842fe2d1eac15726f772df1648c01915dff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfe3e842fe2d1eac15726f772df1648c01915dff/0_0_5568_3699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Records\u2019s Phil Leigh: \u2018We could sell 100 copies of a coloured vinyl and not sell a single black one\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Records\u2019s Phil Leigh: \u2018We could sell 100 copies of a coloured vinyl and not sell a single black one\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They\u2019re a necessary evil, he tells me. \u201cI\u2019ll often put a record out that\u2019s just 500 copies on black vinyl,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I guarantee you, if I did it as 500 clear vinyl it\u2019d sell way quicker. It doesn\u2019t make sense. I think RSD and producing manufactured rarities has developed this mentality in record buyers that was kind of already there but it\u2019s turbo-charged now.\u201d</p> <p>Leigh says that some distributors price new box sets so high that it\u2019s often cheaper for Norman Records to acquire them from Amazon, in which case they simply won\u2019t stock them. He confirms Kasparis\u2019s accounts of consumers becoming averse to standard issue records. \u201cWe could sell 100 copies of a coloured vinyl and not sell a single black one,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cIt\u2019s the same record and the black one probably sounds better. It\u2019s just weird.\u201d</p> <p>The culture of collecting rare records is nothing new. But deliberately forcing rarity and collectible status on new music, on a widespread scale and at increased prices, has seen average buyers herded into that collector mentality. For some, buying records is no longer about owning the same piece of music as everyone else but owning a version of it that few others have. It reflects a change in contemporary relationships to owning music, says Sevier. \u201cOwning a limited or special edition is doubling down on the closeness you feel to an album or artist. You can\u2019t display your streaming history like a trophy.\u201d</p> <p>Kasparis welcomes counter-initiatives such as <a href=\"https://dinkededition.co.uk/\">Dinked</a>, a run of exclusive editions only available at independent outfits, although they also contribute to the pricing problem. \u201cCombating Amazon by having indie store-only releases has been great,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019m not sure indie stores would exist any more. Even if you disapprove of where things are going, you still want those shops to stay open.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc0757304422afb7c3bb1af6c3dcaa4aad811bc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc0757304422afb7c3bb1af6c3dcaa4aad811bc5/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Record-buying will \u2018never go away because there\u2019s always a market for it \u2013 it\u2019s been so over-fetishised that it\u2019s part of the culture now\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Record-buying will \u2018never go away because there\u2019s always a market for it \u2013 it\u2019s been so over-fetishised that it\u2019s part of the culture now\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Urbancow/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This year, vinyl sales in the UK are predicted to hit 4.5m \u2013 up from 4m in 2018 and outselling CDs for the first time in more than 30 years.

Or the peak of a classic boom and bust cycle? \u201cI\u2019ve always had a gut feeling that during the vinyl revival, labels are going to end up killing it by pricing everything too high,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cThey could end up shooting themselves in the foot. If they want vinyl to become mainstream then it needs to be cheaper.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he admits that there\u2019s a diehard group of consumers who will continue to support this state of affairs. \u201cIt\u2019ll never go away because there\u2019s always a market for it \u2013 it\u2019s been so over-fetishised that it\u2019s part of the culture now.

Scanning new vinyl releases for this Friday, I see three different versions of the same live album by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/idles\">Idles</a> at \u00a330 a pop.

He confirms Kasparis\u2019s accounts of consumers becoming averse to standard issue records. \u201cWe could sell 100 copies of a coloured vinyl and not sell a single black one,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cIt\u2019s the same record and the black one probably sounds better. It\u2019s just weird.\u201d The culture of collecting rare records is nothing new. But deliberately forcing rarity and collectible status on new music, on a widespread scale and at increased prices, has seen average buyers herded into that collector mentality. For some, buying records is no longer about owning the same piece of music as everyone else but owning a version of it that few others have. It reflects a change in contemporary relationships to owning music, says Sevier. \u201cOwning a limited or special edition is doubling down on the closeness you feel to an album or artist. You can\u2019t display your streaming history like a trophy.\u201d Kasparis welcomes counter-initiatives such as Dinked, a run of exclusive editions only available at independent outfits, although they also contribute to the pricing problem. \u201cCombating Amazon by having indie store-only releases has been great,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019m not sure indie stores would exist any more. Even if you disapprove of where things are going, you still want those shops to stay open.\u201d This year, vinyl sales in the UK are predicted to hit 4.5m \u2013 up from 4m in 2018 and outselling CDs for the first time in more than 30 years. Is the industry\u2019s embrace of novelty simply a case of supply and demand? Or the peak of a classic boom and bust cycle? \u201cI\u2019ve always had a gut feeling that during the vinyl revival, labels are going to end up killing it by pricing everything too high,\u201d says Leigh. \u201cThey could end up shooting themselves in the foot. If they want vinyl to become mainstream then it needs to be cheaper.\u201d Still, he admits that there\u2019s a diehard group of consumers who will continue to support this state of affairs. \u201cIt\u2019ll never go away because there\u2019s always a market for it \u2013 it\u2019s been so over-fetishised that it\u2019s part of the culture now. That\u2019s why the majors have adopted some of these silly pricing policies.\u201d For labels, a consumer is a consumer. But for every new buyer willing to spend \u00a345 on a new record, I\u2019d wager that someone like me is lost. Rummaging and revelation have been replaced by expense and exclusion. I\u2019ll doubtless continue to buy some records but it\u2019s becoming a world to which I no longer feel attached. The 15 David Bowie records I own, picked up from various charity shops, cost me a grand total of about \u00a320. The last 7-inch I bought \u2013 one song \u2013 was \u00a310 plus postage. Scanning new vinyl releases for this Friday, I see three different versions of the same live album by Idles at \u00a330 a pop. Of course, you can buy the collector\u2019s bundle and get all three for just \u00a385. I\u2019m starting to think: what\u2019s the point?",

      "bodyText": "It was the Labour leader\u2019s Theresa May moment \u2013 and it was about as risqu\u00e9 as his former rival\u2019s memory of running through a field of wheat. Two years after May was asked by ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham to share the naughtiest thing she had ever done, the broadcaster urged Jeremy Corbyn to reveal \u201cthe most romantic \u2026 wild and reckless\u201d moment of his life \u2013 and eventually drew the answer that he had enjoyed some \u201cwonderful holidays\u201d with his wife, Laura \u00c1lvarez. Corbyn\u2019s reluctant reply came in previews of an interview with ITV\u2019s Tonight show to be broadcast on Thursday evening, which drew a shocked response from some social media users after Corbyn gave a hazy answer to the question of whether he, like 90% of the population, chooses not to watch the Queen\u2019s speech on Christmas Day. Etchingham\u2019s question on his romantic traits also drew an awkward response. \u201cWow. That\u2019s a hard one. Nobody ever thinks of me as romantic,\u201d he said when the question was first put to him. The presenter asked again: \u201cWhat is the most romantic sort of wild and reckless thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d to which Corbyn said: \u201cYou can\u2019t ask that question on television!\u201d Etchingham pressed Corbyn, reminding him of the infamous occasion on which she asked Theresa May the naughtiest thing she ever did during the 2017 election, prompting the Labour leader to finally say: \u201cWhen you\u2019re with somebody, you have a great time together, and we\u2019ve had some wonderful holidays together, and we enjoy that.\u201d May\u2019s response to Etchingham\u2019s question about her naughtiest moment drew widespread derision and imitation in memes. \u201cI have to confess, when me and my friend, sort of, used to run through the fields of wheat \u2013 the farmers weren\u2019t too pleased about that,\u201d the former prime minister admitted.

While Corbyn admitted he wasn\u2019t very good at housework, he said: \u201cI am good at putting the garbage out, I am good at putting the recycling out \u2026 I\u2019m also the head manager of the whole composting arrangements.\u201d Corbyn said he would give up Chequers if he was elected as prime minister.

      "body": "<p>One of the UK\u2019s biggest property funds, which owns shopping centres across the country, has alarmed investors by banning withdrawals and blaming both Brexit and the retail downturn for its problems.</p> <p>The \u00a32.5bn M&amp;G Property Portfolio was suspended after \u201cunusually high and sustained outflows\u201d \u2013 demand from investors for their money back \u2013 prompted by \u201cBrexit-related political uncertainty and ongoing structural shifts in the UK retail sector\u201d.</p> <p>Nearly \u00a31bn has been withdrawn by investors from the fund over the last year. M&amp;G admitted it had been unable to sell commercial property fast enough to fund the rush for the door by investors, leaving it with no choice but to block further withdrawals.</p> <p>The fund\u2019s biggest holdings include shopping centres such as Fremlin Walk in Maidstone, Kent, where House of Fraser is one of the biggest tenants, the Gracechurch centre in Sutton Coldfield, where stores include House of Fraser, Topshop and New Look and the Wales designer Outlet in Bridgend, home to retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Next.</p> <p>Investors may now have to wait months to see their cash again. In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in 2016, M&amp;G\u2019s fund was shut from July to November, as panicked investors fearing a collapse in values were prevented from withdrawing their cash.</p> <p>There will now be concern of a domino effect in a repeat of the 2016 experience, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/24/property-funds-back-brexit-vote-closures\">funds worth a total of \u00a335bn</a> were forced to close their doors.</p> <p>M&amp;G said the suspension would give it time to sell property to raise cash to repay investors. While the fund is suspended, M&amp;G will cut the fees it charges to manage the fund. M&amp;G did not give a timeline for when the fund would be reopened, saying it was monitoring the situation daily.</p> <p>The fund is the latest victim of Britain\u2019s ailing high streets and shopping centres. Last month, the independent valuers Knight Frank knocked \u00a376m off the value of the fund\u2019s retail assets, after what Knight Frank described as a marked deterioration in the retail sector since the summer. It warned of falling rents even in highly sought after locations.</p> <p>The suspension of the fund is highly embarrassing for the M&amp;G group, one of the world\u2019s largest property investors with \u00a333.5bn invested on behalf of small investors and pension funds alike.</p> <p>Its property investments are largely focused on retail parks, which have been hit particularly hard by the problems facing bricks and mortar retailers, which include cost increases driven by the higher minimum wage and business rates bills and the switch by shoppers to buying more goods online.</p> <p>According to the Local Data Company retail parks had the biggest rise in store vacancies, up 2.3%, in the first half of this year. That compares with a 0.5% rise of high streets.</p> <p>Many retailers, including New Look, Monsoon and Debenhams have used a legal insolvency procedure to force rent cuts \u2013 which hit the value of property \u2013 while House of Fraser, which is owned by Sports Direct, has agreed many low or no rent deals with its landlords as the department store chain struggles to stay afloat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gina-miller\">Gina Miller,</a> the anti-Brexit campaigner who also manages an investment firm, SCM Direct, said M&amp;G\u2019s decision to partly blame Brexit was a distraction as there had been related uncertainty since the 2016 EU referendum.</p> <p>\u201cThe real question is why did M&amp;G decide to invest as much as 36.4% of the fund in retail,\u201d said Miller. \u201cWhy on earth did the regulator, the FCA, and M&amp;G allow these direct property funds to be marketed to retail investors given the fundamental mismatch between the underlying liquidity of its assets and the daily dealing of the fund?\u201d</p> <p>The suspension of the fund is likely to raise further alarm among investors as it comes so soon after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/oct/19/neil-woodford-funds-when-will-investors-get-their-money-back\">debacle at Woodford funds,</a> which was also unable to finance withdrawals from investors.</p> <p>Ryan Hughes of AJ Bell, an investment platform, said: \u201cM&amp;G\u2019s decision to suspend the fund comes at a time when there is heightened concern about liquidity in funds, with investors understandably jittery after Woodford\u2019s fund closure. \u201d</p> <p>The cash level in the M&amp;G fund, used to pay for withdrawals, had fallen to just 5%, leaving little spare to meet further demands from investors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fund\u2019s performance has been weak for several years.

      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s biggest property funds, which owns shopping centres across the country, has alarmed investors by banning withdrawals and blaming both Brexit and the retail downturn for its problems. The \u00a32.5bn M&amp;G Property Portfolio was suspended after \u201cunusually high and sustained outflows\u201d \u2013 demand from investors for their money back \u2013 prompted by \u201cBrexit-related political uncertainty and ongoing structural shifts in the UK retail sector\u201d. Nearly \u00a31bn has been withdrawn by investors from the fund over the last year. M&amp;G admitted it had been unable to sell commercial property fast enough to fund the rush for the door by investors, leaving it with no choice but to block further withdrawals. The fund\u2019s biggest holdings include shopping centres such as Fremlin Walk in Maidstone, Kent, where House of Fraser is one of the biggest tenants, the Gracechurch centre in Sutton Coldfield, where stores include House of Fraser, Topshop and New Look and the Wales designer Outlet in Bridgend, home to retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Next. Investors may now have to wait months to see their cash again. In the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in 2016, M&amp;G\u2019s fund was shut from July to November, as panicked investors fearing a collapse in values were prevented from withdrawing their cash. There will now be concern of a domino effect in a repeat of the 2016 experience, when funds worth a total of \u00a335bn were forced to close their doors. M&amp;G said the suspension would give it time to sell property to raise cash to repay investors. While the fund is suspended, M&amp;G will cut the fees it charges to manage the fund. M&amp;G did not give a timeline for when the fund would be reopened, saying it was monitoring the situation daily. The fund is the latest victim of Britain\u2019s ailing high streets and shopping centres. Last month, the independent valuers Knight Frank knocked \u00a376m off the value of the fund\u2019s retail assets, after what Knight Frank described as a marked deterioration in the retail sector since the summer. It warned of falling rents even in highly sought after locations. The suspension of the fund is highly embarrassing for the M&amp;G group, one of the world\u2019s largest property investors with \u00a333.5bn invested on behalf of small investors and pension funds alike. Its property investments are largely focused on retail parks, which have been hit particularly hard by the problems facing bricks and mortar retailers, which include cost increases driven by the higher minimum wage and business rates bills and the switch by shoppers to buying more goods online. According to the Local Data Company retail parks had the biggest rise in store vacancies, up 2.3%, in the first half of this year. That compares with a 0.5% rise of high streets. Many retailers, including New Look, Monsoon and Debenhams have used a legal insolvency procedure to force rent cuts \u2013 which hit the value of property \u2013 while House of Fraser, which is owned by Sports Direct, has agreed many low or no rent deals with its landlords as the department store chain struggles to stay afloat. Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner who also manages an investment firm, SCM Direct, said M&amp;G\u2019s decision to partly blame Brexit was a distraction as there had been related uncertainty since the 2016 EU referendum. \u201cThe real question is why did M&amp;G decide to invest as much as 36.4% of the fund in retail,\u201d said Miller. \u201cWhy on earth did the regulator, the FCA, and M&amp;G allow these direct property funds to be marketed to retail investors given the fundamental mismatch between the underlying liquidity of its assets and the daily dealing of the fund?\u201d The suspension of the fund is likely to raise further alarm among investors as it comes so soon after the debacle at Woodford funds, which was also unable to finance withdrawals from investors. Ryan Hughes of AJ Bell, an investment platform, said: \u201cM&amp;G\u2019s decision to suspend the fund comes at a time when there is heightened concern about liquidity in funds, with investors understandably jittery after Woodford\u2019s fund closure. \u201d The cash level in the M&amp;G fund, used to pay for withdrawals, had fallen to just 5%, leaving little spare to meet further demands from investors. The fund\u2019s performance has been weak for several years. It is showing a loss of 7.8% for investors over the past year and is the second-worst performer of 15 funds in its sector over that period. Other large property funds, including those from Aberdeen Standard, Threadneedle and Aviva, are also showing losses similar to those at M&amp;G. \u201cThis news will unnerve them, because it may spark some additional selling from large holders,\u201d said Jason Hollands, a fund adviser at Tilney Investment Management Services. A spokesperson for Aberdeen Standard said its two major property funds, SLI UK Real Estate and Aberdeen UK Property, had cash positions of 15.7% and 12.7% respectively, so there was no immediate need to block withdrawals. It said: \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and in particular any impact M&amp;G\u2019s decision has on investor sentiment towards the sector.\u201d One fund adviser blamed fears of a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn.

In a surprise result, two little-known leftwingers, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, caused an upset at the weekend when they won the leadership vote of the world\u2019s oldest social democratic party, a move that seemed to signal a rejection of the party\u2019s centrist \u201cthird way\u201d phase initiated under the former chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. The result came as a shock not only to the widely expected winner, Germany\u2019s deputy chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, but also to the victorious pair and their supporters. The new leaders, both critics of the SPD\u2019s \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with Merkel\u2019s centre-right party, had said throughout their leadership campaign that a decision on the future of the governing alliance would be made at this weekend\u2019s party conference in Berlin. But the latest draft for Friday\u2019s main motion, agreed between Esken, Walter-Borjans, Scholz and the interim leader, Malu Dreyer, seems designed to put the break on a rushed exit by tasking the new leadership merely to \u201cseek a dialogue\u201d with Merkel\u2019s CDU about measures to stabilise Germany\u2019s slowing economy and amend an already agreed climate package. In a move designed to mend relations between leftwing and centrist factions in the SPD, the Guardian understands the wording of the motion could lead to Scholz and other ministers being invited to join the talks. Kevin K\u00fchnert, the hoodie-wearing leader of the SPD youth wing, who is seen as one of the architects of Esken and Walter-Borjan\u2019s shock victory, has also appeared to cool on the prospect of an exit from the grand coalition, known as \u201cGroKo\u201d. \u201cIf you leave a coalition, you end up giving up a degree of control,\u201d K\u00fchnert told the Rheinische Post newspaper in an interview. \u201cSPD delegates should bear that in mind too when they made up their mind.\u201d \u201cIf need be, I am not afraid to go into an election with the SPD in the next three months,\u201d said K\u00fchnert, who is in the running to be voted deputy leader at the weekend.

The review will be launched under the chairmanship of Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, and will involve diplomatic and security experts. Macron admitted his intervention had rocked the boat, but insisted it was his duty to push for change.</p> \n<p>Under heavy political pressure, Turkey abandoned its warning to derail the summit by blocking plans for a new defence of the Baltics and Poland against Russia until Nato collectively agreed that the Kurdish YPG militia were terrorists. In the communique the leaders instead condemned all forms of terrorism and agreed to \u201ca forward-looking reflection process\u201d \u2013 a mechanism that allowed Turkey to lift its threat.</p> \n<p>Macron admitted that leaders had agreed to disagree on the definition of the YPG, but added the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had clarified that Ankara would not undermine the continued allied efforts to crush Islamic State in Syria.</p> \n<p>Macron claims Isis is regrouping in Syria since Turkey invaded the north-east of the country in October in an attempt to weaken the YPG. Turkey regards the YPG as one and the same as the Turkish Kurdish group the PKK, which it views as a terrorist organisation. Most Nato states do not accept that the YPG and the PKK are effectively the same group.</p> \n<p>Macron also revealed Erdo\u011fan had agreed to hold regular further consultations about its Syrian interventionwith France, Germany and the UK, a means of increasing European leverage on the subject, especially over Turkey\u2019s plans to press as many as 2 million Syrian refugees based in Turkey to return to their homeleands.</p> \n<p>Macron\u2019s description of Nato as brain-dead had in part been prompted by the Turkish invasion. He believes the Syrian Kurds formed the backbone of the western fight against Islamic State in Syria, and was furious Donald Trump gave a green light to Ankara to invade.<br><br>The Nato review is likely to last a year, by which time it will be clear whether Trump, seen by many as a disruptive force within the alliance, will have been re-elected.<br><br>Macron insisted the strategic review would have to study the implications of a gradual American disengagement from the protection of Europe. \u201cWe have to draw conclusions from this American realignment not only from a budgetary point of view, but also from an operational capacity point of view. Europe has to be more involved.

For the third summit in a row, Donald Trump is expected to renew demands that European allies and Canada step up defence spending. He is also unhappy with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, over a tax on American tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p>\n    <p>For his part Macron has lamented Nato's \"brain death\" due to a lack of US leadership, and said the organisation needs a wake-up call. He insists that strategic questions must be addressed, like improving ties with Russia and how to handle an unpredictable ally like Turkey.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In turn, Erdo\u011fan has lashed out at Macron. Their very public argument bodes ill for the summit, which is being hosted by the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. Johnson will want who to smooth things over and downplay any links to Trump, who is unpopular in the UK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Nato leaders have agreed to undergo a review on the alliance\u2019s future direction, attempting a show of unity at the end of a summit characterised by public spats and open divisions on policy. As the two-day summit in London drew to a close, the members vowed to stand together against threats from Russia and terrorism and the challenge of a rising China. President Emmanuel Macron of France claimed the summit in London had taken on board his call to launch a fundamental strategic review about the alliance\u2019s purpose, including an agreed definition of the terrorist threat and the possibility of a new strategic partnership with Moscow. Macron\u2019s earlier comments that Nato was suffering a \u201cbrain death\u201d dominated discussions and led to a decision to hold an experts\u2019 inquiry into the modern threats facing Nato. The review will be launched under the chairmanship of Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, and will involve diplomatic and security experts. Macron admitted his intervention had rocked the boat, but insisted it was his duty to push for change. Under heavy political pressure, Turkey abandoned its warning to derail the summit by blocking plans for a new defence of the Baltics and Poland against Russia until Nato collectively agreed that the Kurdish YPG militia were terrorists. In the communique the leaders instead condemned all forms of terrorism and agreed to \u201ca forward-looking reflection process\u201d \u2013 a mechanism that allowed Turkey to lift its threat. Macron admitted that leaders had agreed to disagree on the definition of the YPG, but added the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, had clarified that Ankara would not undermine the continued allied efforts to crush Islamic State in Syria. Macron claims Isis is regrouping in Syria since Turkey invaded the north-east of the country in October in an attempt to weaken the YPG. Turkey regards the YPG as one and the same as the Turkish Kurdish group the PKK, which it views as a terrorist organisation. Most Nato states do not accept that the YPG and the PKK are effectively the same group. Macron also revealed Erdo\u011fan had agreed to hold regular further consultations about its Syrian interventionwith France, Germany and the UK, a means of increasing European leverage on the subject, especially over Turkey\u2019s plans to press as many as 2 million Syrian refugees based in Turkey to return to their homeleands. Macron\u2019s description of Nato as brain-dead had in part been prompted by the Turkish invasion. He believes the Syrian Kurds formed the backbone of the western fight against Islamic State in Syria, and was furious Donald Trump gave a green light to Ankara to invade. The Nato review is likely to last a year, by which time it will be clear whether Trump, seen by many as a disruptive force within the alliance, will have been re-elected. Macron insisted the strategic review would have to study the implications of a gradual American disengagement from the protection of Europe. \u201cWe have to draw conclusions from this American realignment not only from a budgetary point of view, but also from an operational capacity point of view. Europe has to be more involved. This is not an alternative to Nato, but it is a pillar within Nato.\u201d Nato needed to identify its common enemy, the French president added. \u201cToday would everyone around the table define Russia as an enemy? I do not think so\u201d. Signalling the divisions, his comments came as the alliance issued a joint declaration saying: \u201cRussia\u2019s aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security; terrorism in all its forms and manifestations remains a persistent threat to us all.\u201d Aware that his approach has already led to fierce pushback in the Baltic States and Poland, Macron insisted he was not naive about Russia, and acknowledged there had been many violations of international law by Vladimir Putin, including over Ukraine. He said he intended first to open discussions with Germany about Russia, before broadening the discussion to the whole of Europe. Despite the open disagreements between France and the US at the summit over Syria and the role of Turkey within the alliance, Macron believes Trump is open to his initiatives since the US president agrees that European levels of defence spending need to rise and Russia has the potential to become a partner, particularly against China. But many other European states, notably Poland, the Baltics, Germany and the UK do not share Macron\u2019s optimism about Russia. Those doubts were underlined by the German decision to expel two Russian diplomats in protest over what it said was Moscow\u2019s lack of cooperation in an investigation into the murder of a Georgian man in Berlin, in which prosecutors suspect Russian or Chechen involvement. In its statement Nato reflected the Baltic states\u2019 concerns by claiming Russia\u2019s \u201caggressive actions\u201d constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Macron also announced he was seeking a fresh show of solidarity by the Sahel states of west Africa for the French intervention in the region. He revealed he had asked leaders from the five Sahel states \u2013 Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger \u2013 to Paris to clarify whether they wished French and other nations\u2019 troops troops to remain.

      "body": "<p>Wang Xiaoshuai navigates an ocean of sadness in this film. It can finally be watched only through a blur of tears and with a terrible, futile need to reach into the screen and hug the two ageing lead characters. So Long, My Son is an epic generational drama of two families in China, from the 1980s to the present day; directed and shot with clarity and calm, audaciously structured in terms of flashback and flashforward \u2013 and acted superbly.</p> <p>There is also touch of melodrama in it, if such a thing can be said to exist in the unshowy walking pace of Wang\u2019s storytelling style, with some influences from classic Japanese family drama perhaps, and gestures of soap-operatic melancholy, largely in the repeated (and unexpected) use of the plaintive tune Auld Lang Syne.

      "bodyText": "Wang Xiaoshuai navigates an ocean of sadness in this film. It can finally be watched only through a blur of tears and with a terrible, futile need to reach into the screen and hug the two ageing lead characters. So Long, My Son is an epic generational drama of two families in China, from the 1980s to the present day; directed and shot with clarity and calm, audaciously structured in terms of flashback and flashforward \u2013 and acted superbly. There is also touch of melodrama in it, if such a thing can be said to exist in the unshowy walking pace of Wang\u2019s storytelling style, with some influences from classic Japanese family drama perhaps, and gestures of soap-operatic melancholy, largely in the repeated (and unexpected) use of the plaintive tune Auld Lang Syne. This is a film that doesn\u2019t signpost its relevant facts very emphatically and you have to stay alert for shifts in the timeline, and for important details that are only revealed later. But, once you have mentally readjusted away from traditional linear expectations, this movie opens up like a flower. It is about the terrible burden of grief, rage and guilt, and the greater burden of forgiveness; it is also about an emotional wound that only gets worse with the years. That wound has been inflicted on two levels: by the ordinary, arbitrary heartbreak of life and by the malign agencies of the Chinese state, with its draconian one-child policy to control population and boost economic growth, begun in the late 70s and not completely abandoned until 2015. Liyun (Yong Mei) and Yaojun (Wang Jingchun) are an obedient, hardworking married couple in the big city with an eight-year-old boy Xingxing.

      "body": "<p>Italian producers of balsamic vinegar have lambasted the EU\u2019s top court after losing a legal challenge to prevent a German company from using the names \u201c<em>aceto</em>\u201d or \u201c<em>aceto balsamico</em>\u201d to market its vinegar products.</p> <p>The Consortium for Balsamic Vinegar of Modena sued the company, Balema, on the premise that it had violated the use of the geographical food designation term <em>aceto </em><em>balsamico di Modena</em> (balsamic vinegar of Modena), which has been in place since 2009 and can only be used by producers in Modena and the Emilia-Romagna region.</p> <p>The German firm, based in Baden, had been labelling its products with the terms \u201c<em>balsamico</em>\u201d and \u201c<em>Deutscher </em><em>balsamico</em>\u201d (German balsamico).</p> <p>But judges at the court of justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled on Wednesday that the protected term <em>aceto </em><em>balsamico di Modena</em> \u201cdoes not extend to the use of non-geographical individual terms\u201d. The court determined that the name <em>aceto</em> is common and that <em>balsamico</em> is an adjective commonly used as a reference to a vinegar with a bitter-sweet flavour. Therefore, while the trademark <em>aceto </em><em>balsamico di Modena</em> can only be used by producers within a specific geographical area, there are no such restrictions on <em>aceto balsamico</em> alone.</p> <p>Mariangela Grosoli, the president of the Consortium for Protection of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, said in a statement: \u201cWe consider this decision to be totally unjust. The reality is that many European countries have partly wanted to appropriate the worldwide success achieved by Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - this is the only vinegar to be sweet-and-sour and to use the word \u2018balsamic\u2019, a word that was attributed to it many centuries ago by the Este dukes, who thought it was medicinal.\u201d</p> <p>The legal battle had dragged on for years, with Balema appealing to Germany\u2019s federal court of justice to clarify whether the Modena designation also applied to non-geographical terms. The German court then referred to the case to the CJEU last year.</p> <p>There are two further geographically-protected varieties of balsamic vinegar: the Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena<em> </em>and the Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia. The traditional methods use a reduction of pressed grape varieties including trebbiano, sangiovese and lambrusco and the resulting thick syrup, called <em>mosto cotto</em>, is aged for a minimum of 12 years, sometimes for more than 100, in cherrywood, chestnut or ash barrels. Bottles can cost up to \u20ac300 (\u00a3260).</p> <p>The less expensive Balsamic Vinegar of Modena can be blended with up to 80% wine vinegar by volume and must be aged in wooden containers for a minimum of 60 days.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Italian producers of balsamic vinegar have lambasted the EU\u2019s top court after losing a legal challenge to prevent a German company from using the names \u201caceto\u201d or \u201caceto balsamico\u201d to market its vinegar products. The Consortium for Balsamic Vinegar of Modena sued the company, Balema, on the premise that it had violated the use of the geographical food designation term aceto balsamico di Modena (balsamic vinegar of Modena), which has been in place since 2009 and can only be used by producers in Modena and the Emilia-Romagna region. The German firm, based in Baden, had been labelling its products with the terms \u201cbalsamico\u201d and \u201cDeutscher balsamico\u201d (German balsamico). But judges at the court of justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled on Wednesday that the protected term aceto balsamico di Modena \u201cdoes not extend to the use of non-geographical individual terms\u201d. The court determined that the name aceto is common and that balsamico is an adjective commonly used as a reference to a vinegar with a bitter-sweet flavour. Therefore, while the trademark aceto balsamico di Modena can only be used by producers within a specific geographical area, there are no such restrictions on aceto balsamico alone. Mariangela Grosoli, the president of the Consortium for Protection of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena, said in a statement: \u201cWe consider this decision to be totally unjust. The reality is that many European countries have partly wanted to appropriate the worldwide success achieved by Balsamic Vinegar of Modena - this is the only vinegar to be sweet-and-sour and to use the word \u2018balsamic\u2019, a word that was attributed to it many centuries ago by the Este dukes, who thought it was medicinal.\u201d The legal battle had dragged on for years, with Balema appealing to Germany\u2019s federal court of justice to clarify whether the Modena designation also applied to non-geographical terms. The German court then referred to the case to the CJEU last year. There are two further geographically-protected varieties of balsamic vinegar: the Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena and the Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia. The traditional methods use a reduction of pressed grape varieties including trebbiano, sangiovese and lambrusco and the resulting thick syrup, called mosto cotto, is aged for a minimum of 12 years, sometimes for more than 100, in cherrywood, chestnut or ash barrels. Bottles can cost up to \u20ac300 (\u00a3260). The less expensive Balsamic Vinegar of Modena can be blended with up to 80% wine vinegar by volume and must be aged in wooden containers for a minimum of 60 days.",

Nakamura, who was seriously wounded in the chest, died shortly after, while being airlifted to the Bagram airfield hospital in the capital, Kabul, said Gulzada Sanger, the hospital spokesman. Nakamura had headed Peace Medical Services, a Japanese charity based in Nangarhar, since 2008. He came to Afghanistan after a Japanese colleague, Kazuya Ito, was abducted and killed. In April, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, granted Nakamura honorary citizenship of Afghanistan. Nakamura had worked in the region since 1984, initially providing aid in Peshawar, in north-west Pakistan, before opening a clinic in Afghanistan in 1991. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, the second in as many weeks targeting aid workers in Afghanistan. In late November, an American working for the UN mission in Afghanistan was killed and five Afghans, including two staff members of the mission, were wounded when a grenade hit a UN vehicle in Kabul. On Monday, a gunman opened fire on a vehicle in Kabul, killing two intelligence officials and wounding three others. No one claimed responsibility for that attack, but both the Taliban and the Islamic State affiliate have been behind such attacks.",

They have also challenged concerns in the Jewish community about the speed of the police response to the incident last week, which left the rabbi bruised and traumatised. The images from Stamford Hill overground station show two young men in black hooded jackets, one wearing dark jeans and light trainers and carrying a rucksack, and the other with light torn jeans and black trainers. The Metropolitan police are also keen to trace a woman who intervened to stop the attack last Friday night in Amhurst Park. Shomrim, a Jewish neighbourhood watch group that reported the incident, said the unnamed rabbi was on a visit from Israel for a family wedding when he was attacked. The police have since verified Shomrim\u2019s account by talking to the 54-year-old victim after he returned home to Israel and then travelled on to the US.

Proxy vote forms are <a href=\"https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/sites/default/files/2019-09/Particular-election-proxy-vote-application-form.pdf\">available on our website</a> and must be returned to your local authority by 5pm today,\u201d said a spokesman for the commission.</p> <p>Tom Dempster, a British national who recently moved to North Carolina, in the US, said he had received a communication in the past few days from his West Worcestershire constituency after applying for a postal vote.</p> <p>\u201cPostal votes are being dispatched around 4 December and I note you are in America. We are advising overseas electors that you may wish to consider a proxy vote as relying on international service to get a postal vote to you and returned in time is a risk.

This dwarves the 35,000 overseas voters who were registered in 2015.</p> <p>The total number of overseas voters is likely to be closer to 300,000, reflecting the rise in the desire to vote since the Brexit referendum, when 264,0000 overseas Britons were registered. This increased to 285,000 for the 2017 election and researchers believe the last-minute search will lead to new records for 2019.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are seeing is a level of engagement from British nationals living abroad that we have never seen before,\u201d said Michaela Benson, the research lead for BrExpats, a research project examining what Brexit means for the 1.2 million Britons living in the EU27.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Electoral Commission is urging voters who cannot make it home on election day to urgently nominate a trusted friend to vote on their behalf before Wednesday\u2019s 5pm deadline. In an attempt to avoid a repeat of the debacle at the European elections in May when thousands were denied a vote, the commission, along with councils, is heavily promoting the availability of a proxy vote to all voters \u2013 domestic and overseas. \u201cIf you\u2019re unable to get to your polling station on 12 December, you\u2019ve got until 5pm to appoint someone you trust to vote on your behalf. Proxy vote forms are available on our website and must be returned to your local authority by 5pm today,\u201d said a spokesman for the commission. Tom Dempster, a British national who recently moved to North Carolina, in the US, said he had received a communication in the past few days from his West Worcestershire constituency after applying for a postal vote. \u201cPostal votes are being dispatched around 4 December and I note you are in America. We are advising overseas electors that you may wish to consider a proxy vote as relying on international service to get a postal vote to you and returned in time is a risk. I have attached a proxy vote form for you to consider too,\u201d the council told him in a letter. A spokeswoman for the Association of Electoral Administrators said the proxy forms could be emailed. \u201cAll electoral registration officers will accept a correctly completed and scanned proxy vote application sent via email as long as the signature is clear,\u201d she said. The Electoral Commission points out that proxy votes are available to anyone registered to vote, including those in the UK. The official encouragement to nominate a friend or family member to vote on their behalf comes as data shows a rise in the number of overseas voters registering for the election. Since the general election was called on 24 October, 132,000 Britons overseas have registered to vote. This dwarves the 35,000 overseas voters who were registered in 2015. The total number of overseas voters is likely to be closer to 300,000, reflecting the rise in the desire to vote since the Brexit referendum, when 264,0000 overseas Britons were registered. This increased to 285,000 for the 2017 election and researchers believe the last-minute search will lead to new records for 2019. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a level of engagement from British nationals living abroad that we have never seen before,\u201d said Michaela Benson, the research lead for BrExpats, a research project examining what Brexit means for the 1.2 million Britons living in the EU27.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson made claims that children of working mothers in low-income families were \u201cunloved and undisciplined\u201d and more likely to \u201cmug you on the street corner\u201d, it has emerged. In a 2006 collection of journalism, entitled Have I Got Views for You, Johnson bemoaned the increasing tendency of women to work, saying they had been \u201csocially gestapoed into the workplace\u201d. \u201cIn the last 30 years an ever-growing proportion of British women have been \u2018incentivised\u2019 or socially gestapoed into the workplace, on what seems to me to be the dubious assumption that the harder a woman works the happier she will be, when I am not sure that is true of women or anyone else,\u201d he wrote. In the book, published before he became mayor of London, Johnson said an increasing number of female graduates tended to pair up with male graduates \u2013 a process known by economists as \u201cassortative mating\u201d \u2013 and that they then pool their advantages. \u201cThe result is that in families on lower incomes the women have absolutely no choice but to work, often with adverse consequences for family life and society as a whole \u2013 in that unloved and undisciplined children are more likely to become hoodies, Neets [not in education, employment or training] and mug you on the street corner.\u201d Labour seized on the remarks. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, herself a working mother, said: \u201cIt is obvious that Boris Johnson has nothing but contempt for women and working-class people. \u201cFor him to speak about us in such a disgusting manner shows just how out of touch he is. It is clear he only ever stands up for the privileged few.\u201d The remarks were the latest that have come to light during the election campaign, as the prime minister\u2019s attitudes, including to migrants and low-income households, as well as women, have come under scrutiny. The book\u2019s title is a play on Have I Got News For You, the satirical BBC quiz show that Johnson appeared on several times, helping to build his public profile outside Westminster. In his introduction to the collection, which is laced with anecdotes about his time as Brussels correspondent for the Telegraph, he says of his journalism: \u201cYou may sometimes think that\u2019s not how it is. But never mind, buster: this is how I see it.\u201d He has repeatedly been challenged during the campaign about his past remarks \u2013 including on a special edition of the BBC\u2019s Question Time, which saw audience members press him about whether some of his writings had fuelled racism. In past columns for the Daily Telegraph, which paid him \u00a3275,000 a year for his work until he became prime minister, Johnson said Muslim women wearing the burqa looked like \u201cletterboxes\u201d. He has also been criticised in the past for using the phrases, \u201cpiccaninnies,\u201d and \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. \u201cRacist rhetoric is completely rife in this country, will you admit that you have personally contributed to this, and say the words: \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019,\u201d the questioner asked. Johnson replied that he had, \u201cgenuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody and that is my intention.\u201d But he went on to defend his right to \u201cspeak out\u201d. \u201cIf you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive and of course I understand that,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Greenpeace has been banned from carrying out climate protests on North Sea oil rigs after the oil giant Shell won a Scottish court order. A judge in Edinburgh granted Shell an interim interdict, similar to an injunction, banning Greenpeace from occupying four of its rigs in the Brent field 85 miles north-east of Shetland, after its activists boarded two decommissioned rigs in October. Lady Carmichael, sitting in the court of session in Edinburgh, said Greenpeace was unlawfully breaching Shell\u2019s property rights and also putting its own activists\u2019 safety at risk. In a significant legal victory for Shell, Carmichael banned the campaign group from going within 500 metres of any of its installations in the Brent field, and ordered Greenpeace to pay Shell\u2019s legal costs. She said campaigners had no absolute right to choose where they protested and that Greenpeace ships could have mounted a protest 500 metres away from the rigs. Greenpeace is deciding whether to appeal, but environment campaigners said this decision could have significant implications for climate activists by limiting where and how they could protest. Greenpeace also occupied a BP oil rig twice earlier this year, leading to the arrests of 14 activists in the Cromarty Firth. Richard Dixon, chief executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said a trend was emerging. The Metropolitan police had won a blanket ban against street occupations by Extinction Rebellion in London, while the chemicals firm Ineos won a ban on anti-fracking protests at any of its sites in England. Both bans were overturned on appeal, but Dixon said orders restricting how and where people could protest had a chilling effect. \u201cThis is a challenge for Greenpeace: it is taking away its opportunities to do something strong enough to draw attention to the climate crisis, a vital issue it\u2019s rightly trying to highlight,\u201d Dixon said. Shell sought the interdict after Greenpeace occupied the Brent Alpha and Bravo platforms in October in protest at its decision to leave 11,000 tonnes of oil sediment in the legs of three of its four platforms in the Brent field, which are being decommissioned. Greenpeace told the court Shell was trying to get an exemption from strict international rules on marine pollution, which the UK is a party to, which prevent oil firms from leaving installations at sea after they are decommissioned. Shell has asked the UK government to support its application under the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic, known as the Ospar convention, to leave the disused concrete legs of the four rigs at sea. Greenpeace says they will eventually corrode, releasing all that oil into the environment, a claim Shell has rejected. Carmichael said allowing protests at such exposed and dangerous sites put the safety of protesters and potential rescue personnel at unjustified risk. She ruled that Shell\u2019s rights to protect its property outweighed Greenpeace\u2019s rights under European human rights law to demonstrate peacefully.

This was promised to be a COP with a difference, set to update the 1997 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">Kyoto protocol</a> (not least because the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1248757.stm\" title=\"\">US had pulled out</a> of it) and build global climate action fit for the 21st century. Climate change was, not unlike today, high on the list of public concerns. Campaign rhetoric was heavy with phrases such as \u201cthe time is now\u201d and graphics of ticking clocks. There were new protest movements cropping up, warm words from politicians, as well as hand wringing over the ethics of flying, celeb-fronted concerts to raise awareness and even an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/02_february/14/climate.shtml\" title=\"\">Attenborough special on the BBC</a>.</p> <p>We called it climate chaos back then, rather than a crisis, and it seemed ever so slightly further off still, even if we knew it was already biting. We didn\u2019t have the boost of the youth strikers. Plus, as it was the late noughties, people were still buoyed by the Obama campaign (one PR push was even called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jun/23/hopenhagen-climate-change-campaign\" title=\"\">Hopenhagen</a>\u201d). For some reason, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2009/dec/06/protest-climate-change\" title=\"\">lots of people painted themselves blue</a>. But in many ways, it was achingly similar to the past year.</p> <p>And then it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\" title=\"\">crashed and burned</a>. Eight draft texts and days of talks between 115 world leaders ended with Barack Obama and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, brokering a loose accord which recognised the scientific case for keeping temperature rises to no more than 2C \u2013 but, crucially, didn\u2019t contain commitments to cutting the emissions needed to get there.</p> <p>The climate movement retreated to lick its wounds. Things weren\u2019t helped by the economic crash, which temporarily sapped energy from the cause. Climate activism, like most ongoing protest movements, relies on a steady flow of new blood but much of this was absorbed fighting austerity.</p> <p>The UN managed to pull things back with the 2015 Paris talks, carefully rebuilding momentum in the preceding years with talk of the \u201cunstoppable\u201d rise of clean energy. These talks even got people talking about the possibility of keeping global heating to 1.5C \u2013 perhaps its most important legacy being the commissioning of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/global-warming-must-not-exceed-15c-warns-landmark-un-report\" title=\"\">IPCC\u2019s 1.5 degrees report</a>. Climate activism had been on the ascendancy before this was published in October last year, but it offered a powerful catalyst, scaring many into taking notice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"097a42f36929d13422e5178c7ed048ddd50331fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/097a42f36929d13422e5178c7ed048ddd50331fd/0_132_6660_3996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sydney skyline on 22 November: climate change has been blamed for exacerbating Australia\u2019s bushfire season.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sydney skyline on 22 November: climate change has been blamed for exacerbating Australia\u2019s bushfire season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Coker/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To look now to the ghost of climate politics future, next year\u2019s Glasgow\u2019s talks are scheduled to be a bumper event; as big as the Copenhagen, Paris or Kyoto talks. They will involve a global stocktake of countries\u2019 emissions reductions targets, and discussions over what action will need to be taken to stay anywhere below 2C warming.</p> <p>Will the energy we\u2019ve seen globally over the last year and a half maintain itself until then?</p> <p>Public concern over climate change seems to bubble up every five to 10 years or so, with increasing levels of intensity, and has done since the 1950s. It\u2019s vital that we keep this bubble going not just all the way until the Glasgow talks, but afterwards too.</p> <p>Climate politics is characterised by short bursts of activism heading towards short-term and often slightly arbitrary deadlines. We\u2019ve been told again and again that the time is now, or at least within a few years, or the planet gets it. It\u2019s understandable in some ways. Global climate action has been dragging its heels for so many decades that climate activists are tired of waiting. And, frankly, we\u2019re scared of the consequences of further inaction.</p> <p>Yet the nature of the climate fight is that it\u2019s one that will be with us for the long term, and so our activism has to be too. This is partly because we\u2019ve left it so long that we have to deal with the warming we\u2019ve already cooked up for ourselves as well as radical action to avoid more, but it\u2019s also partly the nature of the beast.

      "bodyText": "Here we go. A nip in the air, the Christmas lights are up, Black Friday deals are still hanging around, and it is time once again for another international climate conference. The COP, or conference of the parties to give it its full name (the \u201cparties\u201d being the signatories to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is the UN\u2019s annual climate talks. This year it\u2019s in Madrid, next year it\u2019s Glasgow\u2019s turn. They\u2019ve been going since 1995 and although they are covered by journalists, they tend to run pretty inconspicuously. But this time it feels that things might be different. That this is a special COP. Why not, when we\u2019ve had the climate strikes, parliament calling a climate emergency and the advocacy of the inspirational Greta Thunberg? The world might finally be watching. Except, we\u2019ve been here before. Wind back a decade to visit the ghost of climate politics past, when COP15 was in Copenhagen. This was promised to be a COP with a difference, set to update the 1997 Kyoto protocol (not least because the US had pulled out of it) and build global climate action fit for the 21st century. Climate change was, not unlike today, high on the list of public concerns. Campaign rhetoric was heavy with phrases such as \u201cthe time is now\u201d and graphics of ticking clocks. There were new protest movements cropping up, warm words from politicians, as well as hand wringing over the ethics of flying, celeb-fronted concerts to raise awareness and even an Attenborough special on the BBC. We called it climate chaos back then, rather than a crisis, and it seemed ever so slightly further off still, even if we knew it was already biting. We didn\u2019t have the boost of the youth strikers. Plus, as it was the late noughties, people were still buoyed by the Obama campaign (one PR push was even called \u201cHopenhagen\u201d). For some reason, lots of people painted themselves blue. But in many ways, it was achingly similar to the past year. And then it crashed and burned. Eight draft texts and days of talks between 115 world leaders ended with Barack Obama and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, brokering a loose accord which recognised the scientific case for keeping temperature rises to no more than 2C \u2013 but, crucially, didn\u2019t contain commitments to cutting the emissions needed to get there. The climate movement retreated to lick its wounds. Things weren\u2019t helped by the economic crash, which temporarily sapped energy from the cause. Climate activism, like most ongoing protest movements, relies on a steady flow of new blood but much of this was absorbed fighting austerity. The UN managed to pull things back with the 2015 Paris talks, carefully rebuilding momentum in the preceding years with talk of the \u201cunstoppable\u201d rise of clean energy. These talks even got people talking about the possibility of keeping global heating to 1.5C \u2013 perhaps its most important legacy being the commissioning of the IPCC\u2019s 1.5 degrees report. Climate activism had been on the ascendancy before this was published in October last year, but it offered a powerful catalyst, scaring many into taking notice. To look now to the ghost of climate politics future, next year\u2019s Glasgow\u2019s talks are scheduled to be a bumper event; as big as the Copenhagen, Paris or Kyoto talks. They will involve a global stocktake of countries\u2019 emissions reductions targets, and discussions over what action will need to be taken to stay anywhere below 2C warming. Will the energy we\u2019ve seen globally over the last year and a half maintain itself until then? Public concern over climate change seems to bubble up every five to 10 years or so, with increasing levels of intensity, and has done since the 1950s. It\u2019s vital that we keep this bubble going not just all the way until the Glasgow talks, but afterwards too. Climate politics is characterised by short bursts of activism heading towards short-term and often slightly arbitrary deadlines. We\u2019ve been told again and again that the time is now, or at least within a few years, or the planet gets it. It\u2019s understandable in some ways. Global climate action has been dragging its heels for so many decades that climate activists are tired of waiting. And, frankly, we\u2019re scared of the consequences of further inaction. Yet the nature of the climate fight is that it\u2019s one that will be with us for the long term, and so our activism has to be too. This is partly because we\u2019ve left it so long that we have to deal with the warming we\u2019ve already cooked up for ourselves as well as radical action to avoid more, but it\u2019s also partly the nature of the beast. As climate scientist Kate Marvel neatly puts it, climate change isn\u2019t a cliff you fall off at some particular stop on a thermometer or date in the calendar, it\u2019s more a slope you slide down. As yet another decade of inaction on the climate crisis comes to an end and we look fresh-faced and hopeful to the next, we need to be ready to look far ahead. The climate movement as a whole must build sustained, long-term relationships with the public rather than bubbles of activity, so that politicians can\u2019t let it drop off their radar. We also need to build resilience, including care of one another, and have strategies for long-term sustained action. At the Paris talks, for example, some NGOs split teams between people who worked on the summit (who could then fall asleep in a heap at the close) and those ready to clean up after. This is the sort of approach that will keep us going. We don\u2019t have time to wait for the phoenix of climate action to burn out and rise again \u2013 2020 has to be the year we don\u2019t just battle the climate crisis but ensure it\u2019s a fight we stick with. \u2022 Alice Bell is co-director at climate change charity, Possible, and is writing a book on the history of the climate crisis.",

Anton Chekhov\u2019s symphonic realism has never been better caught than in Peter Stein\u2019s production, with Jutta Lampe as Ranevskaya. 7 The Weir in 1997: Conor McPherson\u2019s tale-spinning spellbinder was unveiled by an exiled Royal Court in a room over the Ambassadors theatre to general astonishment. 8 Julius Caesar at the Royal Shakespeare theatre in 2012: an all-black British cast injected new life into this Roman tragedy and provided an object lesson in verse speaking. 9 The Masque of Anarchy at Albert Hall, Manchester, in 2013. Maxine Peake performed Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s response to the Peterloo Massacre with such vigour that it felt like a call to political action. 10 The Watsons at the Minerva, Chichester, in 2018. Laura Wade\u2019s version of an unfinished Jane Austen novel was a miracle of wit, invention and intelligence. Five things I won\u2019t miss 1 The ritual standing ovation \u2013 a filthy habit imported from the US \u2013 for even the most modest piece of theatre. 2 The sense of being pushed and shoved in cramped West End foyers by air-kissing, B-list celebrities on fashionable West End first nights. 3 The sound of plastic glasses being crunched under foot at the most crucial moments of a play by spectators who will apparently expire if they are not allowed to drink. 4 The growing use of mics, even in medium-sized theatres, to compensate for the failure of actors to learn how to project. 5 The delay in turning off mobile phones until the first words of a play have been spoken or the first bars of a musical score have been played. Michael Billington will be talking to Arifa Akbar at a Guardian Live event at Kings Place, London, on 3 February",

      "body": "<p>What has changed? Are things better or worse? These are the questions I am asked constantly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/05/guardian-theatre-critic-michael-billington-to-step-down\" title=\"\">as I prepare to give up my job as a nightly aisle-squatter</a> after some 10,000 nights at the theatre. They are difficult to answer. British theatre is incredibly resilient, yet radically different from when I took up my post at the Guardian in 1971. Even the job of being a critic has altered in all sorts of ways.</p> <p>When I joined the paper, a review was normally transmitted in one of two ways. Either you rushed back to the office straight after a show and banged out your copy on a typewriter by 11pm, or you frantically sought a working phone box and spelled out your 350 words to an easily bored copy-taker. (This helps to explain why my predecessor woke up one morning to find his review of The Merchant of Venice featured a character called Skylark.) Now, you tap out the review on a laptop and it whizzes through the ether in a fraction of a second. The deadline has also shifted \u2013 unless the show is extremely hot news, as when a Cumberbatch or Branagh plays Hamlet \u2013 to 9.30am the morning after the first night. That means I seem to write much of the review in my sleep, something that may not come as a surprise to regular readers.</p> <p>But if the process \u2013 and the people who get to write the reviews \u2013 has changed, the role of the critic remains much the same: you still have to describe, interpret and evaluate a theatrical event for readers who were not there and may have no chance of going. You are not writing for scholars, posterity or the cast of the show, although it would be nice if they all read your words. You are addressing that morning\u2019s reader with as much clarity and elegance as you can muster, and seeking to put a transient event in its theatrical and social context. It is a constant challenge that has kept me going for nearly half a century and that has left me feeling that all you can do, in Samuel Beckett\u2019s words, is \u201cfail better\u201d.</p> <p>If the critic\u2019s role has several constants but has changed in multiple ways, the same goes for the theatre. Some things have got better, some worse. If I had to pick out one thing I regret, it would be the virtual disappearance of the regional rep company. Time was when many theatres boasted a permanent ensemble: the most famous was the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/13/liverpool-everyman-theatre-roger-mcgough-jonathan-pryce-alison-steadman\" title=\"\">Liverpool Everyman of the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/13/liverpool-everyman-theatre-roger-mcgough-jonathan-pryce-alison-steadman\" title=\"\">70s</a>, when Julie Walters, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce, Antony Sher and Pete Postlethwaite were part of a dazzling troupe. Financial constraints and cultural fragmentation make it hard to assemble and retain that kind of team today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"378309a1266242f1a1c1585e8d897bdb4b1f4231\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378309a1266242f1a1c1585e8d897bdb4b1f4231/0_0_759_706/500.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Billington\u2019s first review for the Guardian, from 2 October 1971\" width=\"500\" height=\"465\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The role of the critic remains much the same: you still have to describe, interpret and evaluate a theatrical event for readers who were not there\u2019 ... an extract from Billington\u2019s first review for the Guardian, from 2 October 1971.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Nelsson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I would rather, however, accentuate the positive. One thing that has emerged in my lifetime is the move towards gender equality. In the first year of my job, I salivated at the prospect of reviewing new plays by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/stoppard\" title=\"\">Tom Stoppard</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edwardbond\" title=\"\">Edward Bond</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanbennett\" title=\"\">Alan Bennett</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/27/david-storey-obituary\" title=\"\">David Storey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanayckbourn\" title=\"\">Alan Ayckbourn</a>. One fact was obvious: they were all men. One of the first features I wrote asked why there were so few female playwrights. I blush now to reread the piece, which offered all kinds of phoney explanations, but at least I felt I was posing the right question.</p> <p>It is one that seems redundant today. I would attribute that partly to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/carylchurchill\" title=\"\">Caryl Churchill</a>, who, from early work such as Owners and Objections to Sex and Violence, has acted as a guiding light to aspiring dramatists. Where she led, others followed, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/may/16/pam-gems-obituary\" title=\"\">Pam Gems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/17/my-mother-said-i-never-should-crucible-sheffield-review\" title=\"\">Charlotte Keatley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/08/the-memory-of-water-nottingham-playhouse-shelagh-stephenson\" title=\"\">Shelagh Stephenson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/bryonylavery\" title=\"\">Bryony Lavery</a>, Catherine Johnson and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/23/winsome-pinnock-leave-taking-bush-theatre\" title=\"\">Winsome Pinnock</a>. Surveying the scene today, what strikes me is that many of the most ambitious, rule-bending plays are by women. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/25/children-review-lucy-kirkwood-royal-court\" title=\"\">Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s The Children</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/08/the-watsons-review-minerva-chichester-jane-austen-laura-wade\" title=\"\">Laura Wade\u2019s The Watsons</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/06/a-very-expensive-poison-review-lucy-prebble-litvinenko\" title=\"\">Lucy Prebble\u2019s A Very Expensive Poison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/16/oil-review-almeida-theatre-london-anne-marie-duff-ella-hickson-empire-energy-parenthood\" title=\"\">Ella Hickson\u2019s Oil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/01/nine-night-review-dorfman-national-theatre-london\" title=\"\">Natasha Gordon\u2019s Nine Night</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/02/red-velvet-review-adrian-lester-lolita-chakrabarti-garrick-theatre\" title=\"\">Lolita Chakrabarti\u2019s Red Velvet</a> are works that tackle a huge range of social, political and historical issues. They also experiment with form in a way that echoes the example of Churchill.</p> <p>Gender equality now affects casting, too. There have long been striking examples of gender-flipping. I saw Frances de la Tour play Hamlet in 1980; other performers of the moody Dane include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2014/sep/26/female-hamlets-sarah-bernhardt-maxine-peake-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Angela Winkler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/17/hamlet-review-maxine-peake-caustic-prince\" title=\"\">Maxine Peake</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/07/hamlet-richard-iii-review-gate-abbey-theatre-dublin-ruth-negga\" title=\"\">Ruth Negga</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/29/cush-jumbo-hamlet-young-vic-london-the-good-fight\" title=\"\">Cush Jumbo still to come</a>. I have also seen, and admired, Kathryn Hunter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/05/king-lear-review-glenda-jackson-old-vic\" title=\"\">Glenda Jackson as King Lear</a>, as well as a number of single-sex productions, such as the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/07/richard-ii-review-lynette-linton-adjoa-andoh-sam-wanamaker-playhouse\" title=\"\">Richard II</a> at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London, cast entirely with women of colour.</p> <p>It may be a reflection of my age, but I find an inflexible quota system, with a 50/50 gender split, more problematic, especially in Shakespeare. A play such as Troilus and Cressida, which explores the latent homoeroticism of male combat, loses more than it gains from gender parity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/19/troilus-and-cressida-review-royal-shakespeare-theatre\" title=\"\">as a recent RSC production proved</a>. I am, however, always open to persuasion.</p> <p>What I have no hesitation in saying is that greater sexual equality has given criticism a long-overdue shake-up. When I started out, the theatre critics were like a travelling male club, trundling from stall to stall in baggy, egg-stained suits. Today, on any first night, you will see as many female critics as men. I once had the temerity to ask a female colleague if she thought gender made a difference: she suggested that reviews by women were more impressionistic, those by men more conventionally linear. Be that as it may, the glass ceiling in criticism has cracked irrevocably. What is sorely lacking is critics of colour, which is why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/08/arifa-akbar-appointed-as-guardian-chief-theatre-critic\" title=\"\">the appointment of Arifa Akbar as my successor</a> takes on extra significance.</p> <p>In the theatre at large, diversity has made huge advances. There have always been outstanding plays by writers of colour: take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/mar/15/moon-rainbow-shawl-review\" title=\"\">Moon on a Rainbow Shawl by Errol John</a>, Skyvers by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jan/16/barry-reckord\" title=\"\">Barry Reckord</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/15/play-mas-orange-tree-review\" title=\"\">Play Mas by Mustapha Matura</a>. What is striking today is that plays by BAME writers are taking place on main stages, are wide-ranging in theme and derive from a large talent pool: I could make a long list, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/29/gonetoofar\" title=\"\">Bola Agbaje</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/02/gurpreet-kaur-bhatti-a-kind-of-people-royal-court\" title=\"\">Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/tanika-gupta\" title=\"\">Tanika Gupta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/01/ear-for-eye-review-debbie-tucker-green-racial-injustice\" title=\"\">debbie tucker green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kwame-kwei-armah\" title=\"\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/roy-williams\" title=\"\">Roy Williams</a> represent a rising new generation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72cf08b7277debd0d8fadaea3b11bd6fa819aeb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72cf08b7277debd0d8fadaea3b11bd6fa819aeb5/0_0_6444_4774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Billington outside the Globe theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue, London, in 1977\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Who today can say, with total and unshakeable confidence, what a play is?\u2019 ...

The days when black actors were confined, in Shakespeare, to playing Othello or Aaron the Moor in Titus Andronicus are long gone. I have seen actors such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sophie-okonedo\" title=\"\">Sophie Okonedo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/13/sharon-d-clarke-interview-death-of-a-salesman-blues-in-the-night\" title=\"\">Sharon </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/13/sharon-d-clarke-interview-death-of-a-salesman-blues-in-the-night\" title=\"\">D Clarke</a>, Cecilia Noble, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/12/othello-rsc-stratford-hugh-quarshie-lucian-msamati-joanna-vanderham\" title=\"\">Hugh Quarshie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/adrian-lester\" title=\"\">Adrian Lester</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/20/david-oyelowo-moonlight-black-hollywood-theyve-gotta-have-us-simon-frederick\" title=\"\">David Oyelowo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/25/chiwetel-ejiofor-boy-who-harnessed-wind-interview-bryan-mealer\" title=\"\">Chiwetel Ejiofor</a> prove they can play anything and everything. All this represents real progress. </p> <p>The mantra of all self-respecting companies right now is, of course, to create a theatre that represents the infinite variety of the British public. Who could argue with that? But I get nervous when I hear an Arts Council desk-wallah say that, when it comes to funding, \u201crelevance takes precedence over excellence\u201d. That strikes me as a ludicrous false dichotomy. No amount of outreach, community or educational activity will be of any use if the work itself is not first-rate.</p> <p>I am often asked how playwriting has changed in my time. One thing I have learned over the years is that politics and aesthetics are theatrically indivisible and that the plays that make the most impact are invariably the best written. A few examples will have to suffice. David Edgar\u2019s Destiny (1976) memorably caught what Dennis Potter called \u201cthe nostalgia, the disappointment, the dumbly aching resentments\u201d of the extreme right in Britain. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/04/top-girls-review-caryl-churchill-revival-lyttelton-national-theatre\" title=\"\">Churchill\u2019s Top Girls</a> (1982) pinned down the contradictions of a Thatcherite philosophy where public advance was achieved at private cost. Pravda (1985), by Howard Brenton and David Hare, not only exposed the newspaper industry\u2019s craven submission to Rupert Murdoch, but the perilous isolation of power. The Colour of Justice (1999), edited by Richard Norton-Taylor from the transcripts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have\" title=\"\">the Macpherson report</a> into the killing of Stephen Lawrence, revealed the layers of institutional racism within the Metropolitan police as inexorably as a Greek tragedy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/nov/30/this-house-five-star-review-james-graham-national-theatre-garrick\" title=\"\">James Graham\u2019s This House</a> (2012) grippingly portrayed the daily machinations of Westminster politics while implicitly putting the case for electoral reform.</p> <p>What fascinates me is the way plays uncannily reflect the temper of the times; you can chart Britain since the second world war through the history of its theatre. That is still true: the social divisions created by Brexit, the problems of identity politics and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/sep/15/nhs-mental-health-crisis-staff-quit\" title=\"\">the exponential rise in mental illness</a> are constant dramatic themes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I believe passionately in criticism's unending mission to record, interpret and evaluate what happens on stages</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The most radical change has been in dramatic form. When I started out, there was a rough consensus as to what constituted a play. Admittedly, some writers were pushing the envelope: Ayckbourn showed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/01/how-the-other-half-loves-review-theatre-royal-haymarket-london-alan-ayckbourn\" title=\"\">How </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/01/how-the-other-half-loves-review-theatre-royal-haymarket-london-alan-ayckbourn\" title=\"\">the Other Half Loves</a> that you could put overlapping action in two households on to a single stage; John McGrath in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/21/the-cheviot-the-stag-and-the-black-black-oil-review-john-mcgrath\" title=\"\">The Cheviot, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/21/the-cheviot-the-stag-and-the-black-black-oil-review-john-mcgrath\" title=\"\">the Stag and the Black, Black Oil</a> used the form of a ceilidh to promote a message about the exploitation of Scotland\u2019s resources.</p> <p>Who today can say, with total and unshakeable confidence, what a play is? Harold Pinter pointed the way, showing in One for the Road (1984) that in slightly more than 30 minutes you could offer as powerful a portrait of tyranny as anything in Arthur Koestler. Now, the pungent one-act piece that provides a metaphor for the wider world is everywhere: Churchill\u2019s Far Away, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/nov/18/michael-billington-review\" title=\"\">Mike Bartlett\u2019s Cock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/11/448-psychosis-sarah-kane-new-opera-philip-venables-royal-opera-house\" title=\"\">Sarah Kane\u2019s 4.48 Psychosis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/27/the-river-jez-butterworth-review\" title=\"\">Jez Butterworth\u2019s The River</a>, to name just a few. What is true of Britain is also true of the US. F Scott Fitzgerald said there are no second acts in American lives and now there are few second acts in American plays.</p> <p>Yet you can immediately contradict that by pointing to our corresponding appetite for the inordinate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/29/the-inheritance-review-stephen-daldry\" title=\"\">Matthew Lopez\u2019s The Inheritance</a> is in two parts, lasting six and a half hours. Butterworth can also write long, as he proved in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/16/jerusalem-review\" title=\"\">Jerusalem</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/03/the-ferryman-review-jez-butterworth-sam-mendes-paddy-considine-royal-court\" title=\"\">The Ferryman</a>. Right now, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/14/my-brilliant-friend-review-elena-ferrante-quartet-rose-theatre\" title=\"\">April De Angelis\u2019s two-part version of Elena Ferrante\u2019s My Brilliant Friend is playing at the National Theatre</a>. The old rule that a play was an event lasting 150 minutes, with an interval, has been thrown out of the window. Today, form follows function; a play can be as long or as short as its subject dictates.</p> <p>I have dwelled so long on playwriting that I have said too little about other aspects of theatre. Has acting significantly altered during my tenure? I would say it has, in accordance with changes in taste, technology and dramaturgy. One of the first pieces I wrote for the Guardian was a celebration of three great performances: Laurence Olivier in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night, Paul Scofield in Carl Zuckmayer\u2019s The Captain of K\u00f6penick and Ralph Richardson in John Osborne\u2019s West of Suez. Great acting still exists, but in a different form. Classics are often re-gendered. Living dramatists tend to write, with obvious exceptions, democratically structured plays rather than ones built around star parts. The influence of the TV camera, as well as the ubiquity of studio theatres, means actors are trained to communicate through small gestures. To put it simply, the ironic has replaced the heroic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc54989d1e599f32fbe8f77acbc2a85b4ed1ba01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc54989d1e599f32fbe8f77acbc2a85b4ed1ba01/0_0_4756_3057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billington in conversation with David Hare in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One thing I have learned over the years is that politics and aesthetics are theatrically indivisible\u2019 ...

      "bodyText": "What has changed? Are things better or worse? These are the questions I am asked constantly as I prepare to give up my job as a nightly aisle-squatter after some 10,000 nights at the theatre. They are difficult to answer. British theatre is incredibly resilient, yet radically different from when I took up my post at the Guardian in 1971. Even the job of being a critic has altered in all sorts of ways. When I joined the paper, a review was normally transmitted in one of two ways. Either you rushed back to the office straight after a show and banged out your copy on a typewriter by 11pm, or you frantically sought a working phone box and spelled out your 350 words to an easily bored copy-taker. (This helps to explain why my predecessor woke up one morning to find his review of The Merchant of Venice featured a character called Skylark.) Now, you tap out the review on a laptop and it whizzes through the ether in a fraction of a second. The deadline has also shifted \u2013 unless the show is extremely hot news, as when a Cumberbatch or Branagh plays Hamlet \u2013 to 9.30am the morning after the first night. That means I seem to write much of the review in my sleep, something that may not come as a surprise to regular readers. But if the process \u2013 and the people who get to write the reviews \u2013 has changed, the role of the critic remains much the same: you still have to describe, interpret and evaluate a theatrical event for readers who were not there and may have no chance of going. You are not writing for scholars, posterity or the cast of the show, although it would be nice if they all read your words. You are addressing that morning\u2019s reader with as much clarity and elegance as you can muster, and seeking to put a transient event in its theatrical and social context. It is a constant challenge that has kept me going for nearly half a century and that has left me feeling that all you can do, in Samuel Beckett\u2019s words, is \u201cfail better\u201d. If the critic\u2019s role has several constants but has changed in multiple ways, the same goes for the theatre. Some things have got better, some worse. If I had to pick out one thing I regret, it would be the virtual disappearance of the regional rep company. Time was when many theatres boasted a permanent ensemble: the most famous was the Liverpool Everyman of the 70s, when Julie Walters, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce, Antony Sher and Pete Postlethwaite were part of a dazzling troupe. Financial constraints and cultural fragmentation make it hard to assemble and retain that kind of team today. I would rather, however, accentuate the positive. One thing that has emerged in my lifetime is the move towards gender equality. In the first year of my job, I salivated at the prospect of reviewing new plays by Tom Stoppard, Edward Bond, Alan Bennett, David Storey and Alan Ayckbourn. One fact was obvious: they were all men. One of the first features I wrote asked why there were so few female playwrights. I blush now to reread the piece, which offered all kinds of phoney explanations, but at least I felt I was posing the right question. It is one that seems redundant today. I would attribute that partly to Caryl Churchill, who, from early work such as Owners and Objections to Sex and Violence, has acted as a guiding light to aspiring dramatists. Where she led, others followed, including Pam Gems, Charlotte Keatley, Shelagh Stephenson, Bryony Lavery, Catherine Johnson and Winsome Pinnock. Surveying the scene today, what strikes me is that many of the most ambitious, rule-bending plays are by women. Lucy Kirkwood\u2019s The Children, Laura Wade\u2019s The Watsons, Lucy Prebble\u2019s A Very Expensive Poison, Ella Hickson\u2019s Oil, Natasha Gordon\u2019s Nine Night and Lolita Chakrabarti\u2019s Red Velvet are works that tackle a huge range of social, political and historical issues. They also experiment with form in a way that echoes the example of Churchill. Gender equality now affects casting, too. There have long been striking examples of gender-flipping. I saw Frances de la Tour play Hamlet in 1980; other performers of the moody Dane include Angela Winkler, Maxine Peake and Ruth Negga, with Cush Jumbo still to come. I have also seen, and admired, Kathryn Hunter and Glenda Jackson as King Lear, as well as a number of single-sex productions, such as the recent Richard II at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London, cast entirely with women of colour. It may be a reflection of my age, but I find an inflexible quota system, with a 50/50 gender split, more problematic, especially in Shakespeare. A play such as Troilus and Cressida, which explores the latent homoeroticism of male combat, loses more than it gains from gender parity, as a recent RSC production proved. I am, however, always open to persuasion. What I have no hesitation in saying is that greater sexual equality has given criticism a long-overdue shake-up. When I started out, the theatre critics were like a travelling male club, trundling from stall to stall in baggy, egg-stained suits. Today, on any first night, you will see as many female critics as men. I once had the temerity to ask a female colleague if she thought gender made a difference: she suggested that reviews by women were more impressionistic, those by men more conventionally linear. Be that as it may, the glass ceiling in criticism has cracked irrevocably. What is sorely lacking is critics of colour, which is why the appointment of Arifa Akbar as my successor takes on extra significance. In the theatre at large, diversity has made huge advances. There have always been outstanding plays by writers of colour: take Moon on a Rainbow Shawl by Errol John, Skyvers by Barry Reckord and Play Mas by Mustapha Matura. What is striking today is that plays by BAME writers are taking place on main stages, are wide-ranging in theme and derive from a large talent pool: I could make a long list, but Bola Agbaje, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, Tanika Gupta, debbie tucker green, Kwame Kwei-Armah and Roy Williams represent a rising new generation. There would be shock and outrage today if you saw a classic revival with an all-white cast. The days when black actors were confined, in Shakespeare, to playing Othello or Aaron the Moor in Titus Andronicus are long gone. I have seen actors such as Sophie Okonedo, Sharon D Clarke, Cecilia Noble, Hugh Quarshie, Adrian Lester, David Oyelowo and Chiwetel Ejiofor prove they can play anything and everything. All this represents real progress. The mantra of all self-respecting companies right now is, of course, to create a theatre that represents the infinite variety of the British public. Who could argue with that? But I get nervous when I hear an Arts Council desk-wallah say that, when it comes to funding, \u201crelevance takes precedence over excellence\u201d. That strikes me as a ludicrous false dichotomy. No amount of outreach, community or educational activity will be of any use if the work itself is not first-rate. I am often asked how playwriting has changed in my time. One thing I have learned over the years is that politics and aesthetics are theatrically indivisible and that the plays that make the most impact are invariably the best written. A few examples will have to suffice. David Edgar\u2019s Destiny (1976) memorably caught what Dennis Potter called \u201cthe nostalgia, the disappointment, the dumbly aching resentments\u201d of the extreme right in Britain. Churchill\u2019s Top Girls (1982) pinned down the contradictions of a Thatcherite philosophy where public advance was achieved at private cost. Pravda (1985), by Howard Brenton and David Hare, not only exposed the newspaper industry\u2019s craven submission to Rupert Murdoch, but the perilous isolation of power. The Colour of Justice (1999), edited by Richard Norton-Taylor from the transcripts of the Macpherson report into the killing of Stephen Lawrence, revealed the layers of institutional racism within the Metropolitan police as inexorably as a Greek tragedy. James Graham\u2019s This House (2012) grippingly portrayed the daily machinations of Westminster politics while implicitly putting the case for electoral reform. What fascinates me is the way plays uncannily reflect the temper of the times; you can chart Britain since the second world war through the history of its theatre. That is still true: the social divisions created by Brexit, the problems of identity politics and the exponential rise in mental illness are constant dramatic themes. The most radical change has been in dramatic form. When I started out, there was a rough consensus as to what constituted a play. Admittedly, some writers were pushing the envelope: Ayckbourn showed in How the Other Half Loves that you could put overlapping action in two households on to a single stage; John McGrath in The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil used the form of a ceilidh to promote a message about the exploitation of Scotland\u2019s resources. Who today can say, with total and unshakeable confidence, what a play is? Harold Pinter pointed the way, showing in One for the Road (1984) that in slightly more than 30 minutes you could offer as powerful a portrait of tyranny as anything in Arthur Koestler. Now, the pungent one-act piece that provides a metaphor for the wider world is everywhere: Churchill\u2019s Far Away, Mike Bartlett\u2019s Cock, Sarah Kane\u2019s 4.48 Psychosis and Jez Butterworth\u2019s The River, to name just a few. What is true of Britain is also true of the US. F Scott Fitzgerald said there are no second acts in American lives and now there are few second acts in American plays. Yet you can immediately contradict that by pointing to our corresponding appetite for the inordinate. Matthew Lopez\u2019s The Inheritance is in two parts, lasting six and a half hours. Butterworth can also write long, as he proved in Jerusalem and The Ferryman. Right now, April De Angelis\u2019s two-part version of Elena Ferrante\u2019s My Brilliant Friend is playing at the National Theatre. The old rule that a play was an event lasting 150 minutes, with an interval, has been thrown out of the window. Today, form follows function; a play can be as long or as short as its subject dictates. I have dwelled so long on playwriting that I have said too little about other aspects of theatre. Has acting significantly altered during my tenure? I would say it has, in accordance with changes in taste, technology and dramaturgy. One of the first pieces I wrote for the Guardian was a celebration of three great performances: Laurence Olivier in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night, Paul Scofield in Carl Zuckmayer\u2019s The Captain of K\u00f6penick and Ralph Richardson in John Osborne\u2019s West of Suez. Great acting still exists, but in a different form. Classics are often re-gendered. Living dramatists tend to write, with obvious exceptions, democratically structured plays rather than ones built around star parts. The influence of the TV camera, as well as the ubiquity of studio theatres, means actors are trained to communicate through small gestures. To put it simply, the ironic has replaced the heroic. One of the pleasures of a critic\u2019s job \u2013 as well as one of its greatest challenges \u2013 is trying to describe performances. I have been lucky to have seen some unforgettable ones. It is impossible to list them all, but I would like to mention a few that remain part of my imperishable memory: John Wood, and later Tom Hollander, relishing the intellectual acrobatics of Henry Carr in Stoppard\u2019s Travesties; Ian McKellen and Judi Dench as the Macbeths in Trevor Nunn\u2019s grippingly intimate production; Eileen Atkins as the fiercely independent Maddy Rooney in Beckett\u2019s All That Fall; Maggie Smith capturing the piercing recollections, as well as the moral evasiveness, of the heroine in A German Life; Simon Russell Beale conveying the troubled testiness of Shakespeare\u2019s Prospero and Mark Rylance the whimsical passion of Olivia; Paapa Essiedu and David Tennant both highlighting the quick-wittedness and humour of Hamlet in different RSC productions. I could go on and on. One of British theatre\u2019s prime assets is its ability to produce, decade after decade, new generations of exciting actors. If there is an aspect of theatre of which I have been critical in recent years, it lies in the elevation of the director to the role of supreme creative artist.

All power to Bernadine Evaristo who should have won outright.\u201d Author Winnie M Li, winner of the Guardian\u2019s Not the Booker prize, said she was fuming and called for an apology for a writer \u201cwho has been a champion for \u2018Othered\u2019 writers for decades &amp; a serious acknowledgment of how much this mistake of yours says about media erasures &amp; public recognition\u201d. A spokesperson for BBC News said: \u201cOur presenter was speaking live when he made the comparison between the Turner and Booker prize results \u2013 this part of the item was unscripted and he didn\u2019t say Bernardine Evaristo\u2019s name at the time. We apologise to her for the offence caused.\u201d",

And the reader gets to share some of that warmth. We were so lucky they existed and met. 8. The Late Shift by Bill Carter (1994) This book, by a New York Times correspondent, is an engrossing and hilarious account of the squabbles and politics involved in choosing a successor to Johnny Carson as host of a chatshow that was also the US\u2019s leading showcase for standup comedy. It was a showcase that on one occasion sat Richard Pryor next to Rod Hull and Emu, so how could you fault it? 9. A Card for the Clubs by Les Dawson (1974) The great Les, of mobile face and mother-in-law-joke fame, always craved serious attention as a writer, and his debut novel, the noirish tale of a struggling club comic who makes it big only for his life to unravel, is his best. It\u2019s not autobiographical, but Dawson was writing of a world he knew intimately. 10. Now That\u2019s Funny by David Bradbury and Joe McGrath (1998) An essential collection of interviews with comedy luminaries ranging from Denis Norden \u2013 with his writing partner Frank Muir, one of the founders of modern British comedy \u2013 to Victoria Wood and Paul Merton. Here Morecambe and Wise/Ken Dodd writer Eddie Braben compares his work to \u201cchipping granite with a spoon\u201d. As a young hack, I went to the launch party for this book and they were all there. Norden, Galton and Simpson, Barry Cryer. A colleague organised a group photo on the sweeping staircase, and quietly murmured to me: \u201cIf that gives way under the weight, that\u2019s all of comedy history, gone.\u201d \u2022 Happiness and Tears: The Ken Dodd Story by Louis Barfe is published by Head of Zeus.

The billionaire, who lives in Switzerland but has an office in Dubai and a castle in Cumbria, owns about 1,100 high street stores under brands including Peacocks, Jaeger and Austin Reed. Accounts recently filed at Companies House show his sprawling empire made a profit after tax of just over \u00a323m in the six months to March, on sales of \u00a3327m. The group also has \u00a3118m of cash, no bank debt and a \u00a3100m borrowing facility. A spokesman said the group was continuing to search for major acquisitions that would expand its high street presence. Day\u2019s Peacocks group has recently been named as the preferred bidder for the ailing Bonmarch\u00e9 fashion chain. He bought Bonmarch\u00e9, using an investment vehicle called Spectre, in August before it went into administration in October. Day has a long history of buying brands out of administration and integrating them into his group. Over the 27-week period, EWM opened 18 new standalone stores and 21 concessions. Seven of the new stores and four of the concessions were for Jaeger, which Day bought out of administration in 2017. The brand is now expanding after it reduced losses in the period to just over \u00a31m, compared with a more than \u00a37m loss in the year before its collapse. Accounts filed at Companies House this week show the brand has been integrated into a luxury tailoring division with Austin Reed, Jacques Vert and smaller brands such as Windsmoor at one headquarters in London. It is not possible to directly compare profit and sales figures for the EWM group with the previous year because it reported on a 78-week period in 2018.

      "bodyText": "This documentary from writer-director Adam Bolt and co-writer Regina Sobel is about a revolution that has been quietly taking place in molecular biology and medicine: a revolution compared here to the invention of the internet but gaining a fraction of the attention. (The more pertinent comparison may be with nuclear energy.) It is the innovation of gene editing and Crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), a crucial pattern of DNA sequences in micro-organisms that allows them to resist viral infection by replicating a section of the virus\u2019s DNA and using it as a kind of \u201cwanted\u201d poster to fight off the invader. This mechanism can be used to cut, copy and replace pieces of DNA \u2013 to \u201cedit\u201d it, like changing a piece of written text \u2013 and the technology has enormous implications for treating genetic diseases. Incredibly, it appears to have been developed first not by academic researchers or biotech geniuses, but a yoghurt and cheese manufacturer. Philippe Horvath and Rodolphe Barrangou of the food firm Danisco developed Crispr while figuring out how to make their product less susceptible to bacteria. Now Crispr is opening up exciting new avenues of medical thinking but at the same time reopening the debate on eugenics and the ethical implications of altering DNA, particularly the \u201cgermline\u201d DNA that theoretically modifies your children\u2019s genetic makeup. The film is at its most intriguing in its earlier half, when it simply takes you through the growing excitement within the scientific community as the reality of Crispr emerges.

      "body": "<p>When Claire Horn went for a sexual health check in April 2005, the last thing she expected was to be diagnosed with HIV. She was 22 and studying for a nursing degree in Leeds, and the check was part of the process for having a contraceptive implant placed in her arm. The diagnosis floored her.</p> <p>\u201cI probably smoked and drank far too much over the next year,\u201d says Horn, who is now 36. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good time.\u201d She says she knew a little bit more about HIV than the average person but not enough to allay her fears about its impact on her life. \u201cDid I know that the outlook for somebody in the UK with HIV was as positive as it turns out it is? Probably not.\u201d</p> <p>Horn spent the year that followed learning as much as she could about the condition. She decided not to let it get in the way of leading a normal life, and has, for the most part, succeeded.</p> <p>Five years after her diagnosis, Horn met the man who would become her husband. They exchanged numbers and, after a few weeks of dating, she knew it was time for the conversation she had been dreading. \u201cI sat him down to tell him that I\u2019ve got HIV and he sat me down to tell me that he was married \u2013 although separated \u2013 with three kids,\u201d she says. After the conversation, he was \u201cgobsmacked, floored, didn\u2019t know anything about it. He let me talk him through everything.\u201d They carried on dating and, a few years later, they started to discuss the possibility of having children.</p> <p>Today in the UK, when someone is diagnosed with HIV, <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hiv-and-aids/treatment/\" title=\"\">they will start taking antiretroviral drugs</a> immediately, to stop the virus replicating in the body. These drugs (usually one to four pills a day) stop HIV from damaging the immune system and reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream \u2013 known as a person\u2019s viral load. When HIV can no longer be measured (a process that normally takes six months), the patient is said to be undetectable \u2013 <a href=\"http://i-base.info/htb/32308\" title=\"\">they cannot pass on the virus through sex</a> and can have children without passing on the virus. (Last week, the world\u2019s first sperm bank for HIV-positive donors opened in New Zealand to fight stigma against the virus, with three undetectable men signing up as donors.)</p> <p>In 2012, when Horn and her husband decided to start trying for a baby, the policy of starting patients on antiretrovirals immediately after diagnosis was yet to be adopted (<a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/10/f03pc-tasp-oct15.pdf\" title=\"\">it became standard practice in 2015</a>). But Horn had met other HIV-positive women who\u2019d had children and knew that safely giving birth was possible. \u201cI pushed the medical staff to start treatment as prevention, even though it wasn\u2019t the norm,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter a couple of months, I settled on to the antiretrovirals absolutely fine, and I became undetectable. I went on to conceive naturally and have three children that I breastfed, which, again, was not heard of.\u201d</p> <p>There is little data on the risks of breastfeeding while undetectable. <a href=\"https://www.bhiva.org/pregnancy-guidelines\" title=\"\">UK clinical guidelines</a> recommend that parents living with HIV should exclusively formula feed, as it eliminates the risk of HIV transmission, although they also state that undetectable women adherent to their treatment who choose to breastfeed should be supported to do so.</p> <p>Horn says all three of her children have \u201cstrong, healthy immune systems supported by breastfeeding\u201d. Not everyone was happy with her decision, however. \u201cMy mum was really against it,\u201d Horn says.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure some people still think I did the wrong thing. Did I? The bond it gave me and my children, the healthy start in life it gave them, the benefits of breastfeeding over formula feeding \u2013 I don\u2019t think I did the wrong thing.\u201d</p> <p>As for her status, Horn says: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect me day to day, month to month, week to week, year to year, I take three tablets every day when I go to bed and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Horn\u2019s story demonstrates what life should be like today for HIV-positive people in the UK: once on treatment, leading a normal, healthy life is not only possible, but expected.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People living with HIV who are diagnosed in good time can expect the same life expectancy as anyone else</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPeople living with HIV who are diagnosed in good time and on effective treatment can expect the same life expectancy as anyone else,\u201d says Kat Smithson, director of policy at the <a href=\"https://www.nat.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsIzzy7iZ5gIVRLDtCh1bawMjEAAYASAAEgKPlPD_BwE\" title=\"\">National Aids Trust</a> (NAT). \u201cHIV is now a long-term, manageable condition. Quality of life is, of course, complex, but the impact of an HIV diagnosis on this is as likely, if not more likely, to be personal or social rather than related to the health impact of HIV.\u201d</p> <p>This is because while treatment has progressed, negative attitudes towards HIV are harder to shift; it is still a heavily stigmatised, misunderstood condition. When the former Wales rugby captain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/14/welsh-rugby-legend-gareth-thomas-reveals-hiv-diagnosis\" title=\"\">Gareth Thomas came out</a> as HIV positive earlier this year, he did so to tackle the taboo and challenge the misconception that people with HIV are \u201cwalking around with walking sticks [and] are close to dying\u201d.</p> <p>But Thomas said his disclosure was also a result of media pressure, after a <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/welsh-rugby-star-gareth-thomas-says-journalist-revealed-his-hiv-status-to-his-parents/\" title=\"\">tabloid journalist revealed his status</a> to his parents. As his experiences demonstrate, in the UK at least, perhaps the biggest issue with HIV isn\u2019t the health impact on individuals, but people\u2019s attitudes.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had people \u2013 actual mates \u2013 who, when I\u2019ve told them, were like: \u2018Well, we just don\u2019t want to hang out with someone like you,\u2019\u201d says Stephen, a 33-year old communications officer in Birmingham who was diagnosed with HIV in 2012. As a result of the stigma he has faced since his diagnosis he has asked not to use his full name.</p> <p>Stephen says he spent a month crying after his diagnosis. He struggled mentally, developing both anger issues and extreme paranoia about passing the virus on \u2013 for instance, he was afraid of holding children in case he transmitted HIV to them through cuts (according to Smithson, in this instance as HIV does not survive outside of the body transmission would require sustained blood to blood contact and therefore this is not possible.).</p> <p>With the help of a counsellor, Stephen has come to terms with it but finds other people\u2019s reactions harder to reconcile. \u201cI am scared to tell people even now,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not surprising: in a <a href=\"http://www.stigmaindexuk.org/reports/2016/NationalReport.pdf\" title=\"\">2015 survey into the stigma of HIV</a>, people reported experiencing harassment (9%), gossiping (20%), physical assault (9%) or exclusion from social gatherings (5%).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I tell someone now I just assume that they\u2019re going to be all right with it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Under the Equality Act 2010 it is illegal to discriminate against a person living with HIV, yet Stephen says that, three years ago, he was subject to a petition to have him removed from his job by a colleague who had found out about his status (the petition was unsuccessful, and the colleague was forced to do a 20-minute training package on diversity). According to Smithson, NAT still encounters many cases of direct discrimination against HIV-positive people.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I tell someone now I just assume that they\u2019re going to be all right with it,\u201d says Stephen. \u201cWhen they\u2019re not, it pushes you sideways.\u201d Dating has proven especially difficult, although he is now in a long-term relationship. The law says <a href=\"https://www.tht.org.uk/hiv-and-sexual-health/being-diagnosed-hiv/telling-people/sexual-partners\" title=\"\">it isn\u2019t necessary to</a> tell someone you are HIV positive if you are having protected sex, but Stephen prefers to disclose. Recalling one third date, he says: \u201cI told her and she stood up at the restaurant table and she shouted out: \u2018You are disgusting. I can\u2019t believe that you wouldn\u2019t tell me this.\u2019 After having that happen, it gives you a really thick skin.\u201d</p> <p>When Ibrahim*, a 37-year-old IT engineer based in High Wycombe, received his diagnosis in 2007, he says he wasn\u2019t that worried; as a bisexual man, he was well educated on the condition and knew it wasn\u2019t the death sentence it once was.</p> <p>\u201cI find that straight people still think it\u2019s a condition that only affects the LGBT community,\u201d he says. \u201cThe LGBT community are more educated. There seems to be more awareness of the <a href=\"http://i-base.info/u-equals-u/\" title=\"\">U=U campaign</a> [undetectable = untransmittable] in the gay community. When I disclose to my close straight friends, one of the first questions I get asked is: \u2018Are you going to die?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s one of the more intrusive, unwelcome questions posed to people living with HIV, the other being how they contracted it in the first place. Even if it\u2019s borne out of innocent curiosity, campaigners say asking this plays into the blame culture and stigma associated with the virus and sexual health more generally: because it can come loaded with the assumption that there are acceptable and unacceptable ways to contract HIV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65ebbd70726241159996c46152f177db54c27886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65ebbd70726241159996c46152f177db54c27886/2033_377_2024_1215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Allan Batcock, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allan Batcock: \u2018If we don\u2019t educate the next generation, we will have a never-ending cycle.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Allan Batcock, a straight 43-year-old man based in Cheshire, the ignorance around HIV took its toll on his mental health and his social life. When he was diagnosed in 2011, his entire knowledge of HIV consisted of \u201cFreddie Mercury dying and that HIV tombstone advert of the 1980s\u201d. After the diagnosis, he says, he fell to \u201ccomplete and utter bits\u201d. When he told his then girlfriend, the relationship broke down, while people in his local pub refused to sit with him.</p> <p>Eight years on, he is in a much better place \u2013 healthy, comfortable and happily married \u2013 although his status still leaves him feeling lonely (as it does <a href=\"https://www.nat.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/web_PV_Changing%20Perceptions-needs-report.pdf\" title=\"\">one in five people living with HIV</a>). \u201cI feel very isolated a lot of the time,\u201d says Batcock. \u201cWe used to have a HIV group in Cheshire with support groups and there was a drop-in every week and complementary therapies. Well, that\u2019s all gone.\u201d He says it closed as a result of a lack of funding and that there are no similar services available in the county.</p> <p>According to Smithson, it\u2019s not an uncommon problem, particularly away from cities where access to services is much harder. \u201cWe know that people living with HIV are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to the general population,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd while satisfaction with HIV clinical services is generally very high, there are a lot of unmet needs, particularly around peer support and advice services.\u201d</p> <p>It was the peer support services that helped Batcock learn about the condition from others and accept his status. \u201cThe drop-ins were great,\u201d he says. \u201cJust somewhere where you can have a cup of tea with a group of people who understand. You\u2019ve got people who are newly diagnosed, and people who have been diagnosed for years, all in the same room. And you can see that life goes on.\u201d</p> <p>The lack of knowledge not only drives stigma and discrimination, but perpetuates the number of transmissions every year. For Batcock, the way forward is obvious. <strong>\u201c</strong>If we don\u2019t educate the next generation, we\u2019re going to have this never-ending cycle, because they\u2019re not going to use protection,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that when I was that age, I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to put a condom on. I\u2019m a heterosexual male. It\u2019s only gay people that die of Aids.\u2019 They\u2019re not being taught in school that anybody can get it. And if we don\u2019t educate the youth, what hope have we got of stopping this cycle and trying to end HIV completely?\u201d</p> <p><em>* Name has been changed</em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 4 December 2019 to clarify comments made by Kat Smithson about HIV transmission. </p></li> </ul>",

Quality of life is, of course, complex, but the impact of an HIV diagnosis on this is as likely, if not more likely, to be personal or social rather than related to the health impact of HIV.\u201d This is because while treatment has progressed, negative attitudes towards HIV are harder to shift; it is still a heavily stigmatised, misunderstood condition. When the former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas came out as HIV positive earlier this year, he did so to tackle the taboo and challenge the misconception that people with HIV are \u201cwalking around with walking sticks [and] are close to dying\u201d. But Thomas said his disclosure was also a result of media pressure, after a tabloid journalist revealed his status to his parents. As his experiences demonstrate, in the UK at least, perhaps the biggest issue with HIV isn\u2019t the health impact on individuals, but people\u2019s attitudes. \u201cI\u2019ve had people \u2013 actual mates \u2013 who, when I\u2019ve told them, were like: \u2018Well, we just don\u2019t want to hang out with someone like you,\u2019\u201d says Stephen, a 33-year old communications officer in Birmingham who was diagnosed with HIV in 2012. As a result of the stigma he has faced since his diagnosis he has asked not to use his full name. Stephen says he spent a month crying after his diagnosis. He struggled mentally, developing both anger issues and extreme paranoia about passing the virus on \u2013 for instance, he was afraid of holding children in case he transmitted HIV to them through cuts (according to Smithson, in this instance as HIV does not survive outside of the body transmission would require sustained blood to blood contact and therefore this is not possible.). With the help of a counsellor, Stephen has come to terms with it but finds other people\u2019s reactions harder to reconcile. \u201cI am scared to tell people even now,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not surprising: in a 2015 survey into the stigma of HIV, people reported experiencing harassment (9%), gossiping (20%), physical assault (9%) or exclusion from social gatherings (5%). Under the Equality Act 2010 it is illegal to discriminate against a person living with HIV, yet Stephen says that, three years ago, he was subject to a petition to have him removed from his job by a colleague who had found out about his status (the petition was unsuccessful, and the colleague was forced to do a 20-minute training package on diversity). According to Smithson, NAT still encounters many cases of direct discrimination against HIV-positive people. \u201cWhen I tell someone now I just assume that they\u2019re going to be all right with it,\u201d says Stephen. \u201cWhen they\u2019re not, it pushes you sideways.\u201d Dating has proven especially difficult, although he is now in a long-term relationship. The law says it isn\u2019t necessary to tell someone you are HIV positive if you are having protected sex, but Stephen prefers to disclose. Recalling one third date, he says: \u201cI told her and she stood up at the restaurant table and she shouted out: \u2018You are disgusting. I can\u2019t believe that you wouldn\u2019t tell me this.\u2019 After having that happen, it gives you a really thick skin.\u201d When Ibrahim*, a 37-year-old IT engineer based in High Wycombe, received his diagnosis in 2007, he says he wasn\u2019t that worried; as a bisexual man, he was well educated on the condition and knew it wasn\u2019t the death sentence it once was. \u201cI find that straight people still think it\u2019s a condition that only affects the LGBT community,\u201d he says. \u201cThe LGBT community are more educated. There seems to be more awareness of the U=U campaign [undetectable = untransmittable] in the gay community. When I disclose to my close straight friends, one of the first questions I get asked is: \u2018Are you going to die?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s one of the more intrusive, unwelcome questions posed to people living with HIV, the other being how they contracted it in the first place. Even if it\u2019s borne out of innocent curiosity, campaigners say asking this plays into the blame culture and stigma associated with the virus and sexual health more generally: because it can come loaded with the assumption that there are acceptable and unacceptable ways to contract HIV. For Allan Batcock, a straight 43-year-old man based in Cheshire, the ignorance around HIV took its toll on his mental health and his social life. When he was diagnosed in 2011, his entire knowledge of HIV consisted of \u201cFreddie Mercury dying and that HIV tombstone advert of the 1980s\u201d. After the diagnosis, he says, he fell to \u201ccomplete and utter bits\u201d. When he told his then girlfriend, the relationship broke down, while people in his local pub refused to sit with him. Eight years on, he is in a much better place \u2013 healthy, comfortable and happily married \u2013 although his status still leaves him feeling lonely (as it does one in five people living with HIV). \u201cI feel very isolated a lot of the time,\u201d says Batcock. \u201cWe used to have a HIV group in Cheshire with support groups and there was a drop-in every week and complementary therapies. Well, that\u2019s all gone.\u201d He says it closed as a result of a lack of funding and that there are no similar services available in the county. According to Smithson, it\u2019s not an uncommon problem, particularly away from cities where access to services is much harder. \u201cWe know that people living with HIV are more likely to experience poor mental health compared to the general population,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd while satisfaction with HIV clinical services is generally very high, there are a lot of unmet needs, particularly around peer support and advice services.\u201d It was the peer support services that helped Batcock learn about the condition from others and accept his status. \u201cThe drop-ins were great,\u201d he says. \u201cJust somewhere where you can have a cup of tea with a group of people who understand. You\u2019ve got people who are newly diagnosed, and people who have been diagnosed for years, all in the same room. And you can see that life goes on.\u201d The lack of knowledge not only drives stigma and discrimination, but perpetuates the number of transmissions every year. For Batcock, the way forward is obvious. \u201cIf we don\u2019t educate the next generation, we\u2019re going to have this never-ending cycle, because they\u2019re not going to use protection,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that when I was that age, I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to put a condom on. I\u2019m a heterosexual male. It\u2019s only gay people that die of Aids.\u2019 They\u2019re not being taught in school that anybody can get it. And if we don\u2019t educate the youth, what hope have we got of stopping this cycle and trying to end HIV completely?\u201d * Name has been changed This article was amended on 4 December 2019 to clarify comments made by Kat Smithson about HIV transmission.",

      "bodyText": "Germany has expelled two Russian diplomats after state prosecutors announced they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d that Moscow or the Chechen government sanctioned the assassination of a a Chechen separatist in Berlin. The federal prosecutor in Karlsruhe, which deals with crimes against the state, on Wednesday declared the shooting of Zelimkhan Khangoshvili in broad daylight in August a deed of \u201chighest relevance to state security\u201d and said it would take over investigations. The German foreign office on Wednesday morning informed the Russian ambassador to Berlin, Sergei Netschajew, that two of his employees were considered personae non gratae with immediate effect, citing the Kremlin\u2019s refusal to cooperate in investigations into Khangoshvili\u2019s murder. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry described the expulsions as \u201cunfriendly and unfounded\u201d, and promised it would respond in due course. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday denied any Russian involvement: \u201cThis is absolutely groundless speculation\u201d, he told Russian reporters. \u201cThis topic is being somehow whipped up by German media, but this does not mean that this is how things are\u201d In what has been called a \u201csecond Skripal case\u201d after the 2018 attack on the former Russian spy in Salisbury, 40-year-old Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park just before midday on 23 August. The killing fits a pattern of hits on Chechen separatists who fought Russian forces that have often had signs of Russian state involvement. Russian intelligence had classified Khangoshvili, an ethnic Chechen from Georgia\u2019s Pankisi Gorge, as a member of the terrorist organisation \u201cCaucasian Emirates\u201d, the German federal prosecutor said on Wednesday. The suspected assassin was arrested by police after disposing of a handgun and his mountain bike into a canal, and before trying to escape from the crime scene on an electric scooter, apparently wearing a wig to disguise himself as a tourist. He is currently being held in a Berlin prison cell but has so far refused to cooperate during questioning. The Russian passport with which the hitman had travelled to Germany names him as Vadim Sokolov, but experts have questioned the authenticity of the document. The federal prosecutor said on Wednesday he decided to take on the case after forensics experts identified the assassin as the same person, Vadim Krasikov, who was sought over the murder of a Russian businessman in Moscow in June 2013. As in the Berlin case, the murderer of restaurant entrepreneur Albert Nazranov had approached his target on a bicycle before firing lethal shots from a Makarov pistol. The incident was filmed by security cameras and broadcast by several Russian TV channels. Investigative outfit Bellingcat, which has also independently matched the Vadim Sokolov alias to Vadim Krasikov, reported on Tuesday that Russia had issued an international search warrant for the then 49-year-old in 2014 only to silently withdraw it only a year later, as well as purging his records from state databases. Another detail that had raised the suspicions of German investigators was Krasikov had flown from Moscow to Paris\u2019 Charles de Gaulles airport on a work visa which stated that he worked as a structural engineer for the St Petersburg-based company ZAO RUST. Research by German prosecutors, however, found that the same company only had a single employee and that a fax number linked the business to the Russian defence ministry. The German federal prosecutor said there were no signs the killing had been commissioned by a non-state actor and that investigations had not found a personal motive or links to terrorism or organised crime. Patrick Sensburg, an MP from Angela Merkel\u2019s CDU party, told the Guardian that Germany would take further diplomatic steps to put pressure on Russia to cooperate with investigations. \u201cFor now, we need to further investigate the motives behind the murder. But if Russia continues to stonewall our efforts, then we need to consider further sanctions, such as expelling even more senior diplomats or putting talks about joint economic projects on hold. If Russia merely retaliates, we could easily end up in a situation we haven\u2019t seen since the Cold War\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "A person is being treated for monkeypox in England, a rare viral infection similar to the eradicated disease smallpox, public health authorities have confirmed. Public Health England (PHE) says monkeypox is not very transmissible and the patient is not thought to pose a risk to other people. He or she \u2013 their identity has not been revealed \u2013 is thought to have contracted it during a visit to Nigeria. PHE is getting in touch with people who may have been in contact with the patient as a precautionary measure, including those who travelled to the UK on the same flight. It says they will be given appropriate advice and be monitored if necessary. \u201cMonkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low. We are following up with those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary,\u201d said Dr Meera Chand, consultant microbiologist at PHE. \u201cPHE and the NHS have well established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed to minimise the risk of transmission,\u201d she said. The individual was in south-west England when they fell ill and was transferred to the high consequence infectious disease centre at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust in London. There were three cases of monkeypox in the UK in September last year. The first was a resident of Nigeria who was staying at a naval base in Cornwall. There was no link to the second case, it was said at the time, even though that person had also spent time in Nigeria. The third was a healthcare worker involved in the care of one of the patients at Blackpool Victoria hospital before the infection was identified. Last year PHE said there had been a sustained outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017 and that it was expected the virus would continue to circulate there. Monkeypox is a rare viral disease which does not easily spread between humans and is usually self-limiting, meaning people recover within a few weeks. Sometimes, however, they become severely ill and it can be fatal in up to 10% of cases. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body. The rash changes and goes through different stages before finally forming a scab, which later falls off.",

You get the deposit back if you get at least 5% of the vote in the constituency. It is meant to deter novelty candidates. It doesn't., 2:A - Candidates and agents must be given the provisional results before any formal declaration, and given time to decide if they want to ask for a recount before the official result is declared. A returning officer is able to refuse an 'unreasonable' request for a recount., 3:C - Although UK elections are meant to be a secret ballot, in theory if you can get hold of the number on a ballot paper, and the list of who was assigned that ballot paper, you could trace a vote back to an individual. The security around the ballot boxes is to ensure that votes aren't tampered with, and that voters aren't identified., 4:C - If you don't start the count within four hours of polls closing you are obliged to report back to the Electoral Commission as to why. Due to geographic restrictions, some constituencies habitually don't start their count until the next day though, and are always on the naughty step., 5:A - Accept as a vote for Barber. The cross is in the box so the voting intention is clear, even if it has spilled a little into the box below., 6:A - The official guidance says accept this as a vote for Boots. I guess if you were Windy Miller's election agent you could try and argue they were giving Windy a 6/6 endorsement\u2026, 7:A - Houghton and Sunderland South constituency (and its Sunderland South predecessor) was the first constituency to declare the result for six consecutive general elections, then in 2017\u2019s election Newcastle Central pipped it by about seven minutes. Literally nobody in the country knows why this has become a thing. , 8:C - The rules explicitly state: \"You must send any forfeited deposits to Her Majesty\". In actual fact they end up in the Treasury's general all-purpose consolidated fund bank account. In 2017 some 1,568 candidates lost their deposit, netting the government \u00a3784,000., 9:B - This looks like a positive intention for two candidates, so it gets rejected., 10:B - While it seems clear that a vote for Barber was intended, the ballot paper contains personally identifying information, and so must be rejected., 11:A - It is perfectly fine for people to reveal themselves how they have voted in an election. It is only a problem if they reveal how somebody else has voted., 12:B - As well as other documentation generated by an election, you must store the ballot papers themselves for a year., 13:B - Reject this. You can see the point the voter is making though, feel bad about the lack of options in a first-past-the-post winner-takes-all electoral system, and then just quietly move on, 14:A - There's a lot going on here, but the Electoral Commission's doubtful ballot paper guidance says this should be accepted as a vote for Boots. , 15:A - The guidance says this is a clear indication that the voter wanted to elect Barber. The caveat - this would not be valid if there were two candidates called Barber on the ballot paper., 16:A - They get 35 days, unless the 35th day falls on a weekend or bank holiday, in which case they get the extra days to take it to a working day., 17:B - This is a rejection. It seems pretty clear that they've treated Barber differently to all the other candidates so probably intended to elect them - but they've used the voting mark for all the other candidates, so it shouldn't be accepted., 18:B - Official guidelines state that horses should be tethered outside polling stations. Spoilsports. Dogs are welcome inside, provided they do not cause a disturbance to the voting process. There doesn't appear to be any official guidance about other types of animals, so, you know, if you want to take your hamster to vote, it's fine.

It is never said whom the group are talking about, but the exchange appears to refer to the US president, who is known for his long, rambling press conferences and who had an unscripted 50-minute back and forth with reporters on Tuesday. As he did at last year\u2019s Nato meeting, Trump has thrown out normal summit protocol and used his appearances with allied leaders to field dozens of questions from the world\u2019s media. Top of the agenda on Wednesday is Turkey\u2019s threat to block a Nato plan for the defence of the Baltics and Poland unless Nato denounces the Syrian Kurds, and by extension endorses the Turkish incursion in October into north-east Syria. The Queen hosted world leaders at a reception at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday night to mark 70 years of Nato cooperation, as protesters gathered outside, rallying against Trump and his perceived interest in the NHS in a US-UK trade deal and Nato. After an edited cut in the film, the footage later shows an incredulous Trudeau telling the group, which also included Mark Rutte, the prime minister of the Netherlands, and Princess Anne: \u201cYou just watched his team\u2019s jaws drop to the floor.\u201d Again, it is not known whom the group are talking about, and none of the world leaders appeared to realise the conversation was being recorded. The pool footage available to all broadcasters was posted online and then edited by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to focus on the interactions between the leaders, with the audio cleaned up and subtitles added. The footage emerged after a day when Nato disunity was on full display, as Macron accused Turkey of colluding with Islamic State proxies, and Trump described Macron\u2019s criticisms of Nato\u2019s \u201cbrain death\u201d as insulting and \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d. On Wednesday, Trump is scheduled to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the prime minsters of Denmark and Italy. He is also due to give another news conference, this time on his own, after the 29 Nato leaders hold a full three-hour closed-door summit session and issue a statement to celebrate their supposed unity. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has threatened to hold up Nato efforts to bolster the protection of the Baltic republics against Russia unless the allies brand the Kurdish militias who defeated Isis in Syria as \u201cterrorists\u201d. Amid fears Erdo\u011fan could even veto the summit declaration and with barely two hours to go before the leaders sat down for their sole roundtable discussions, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, admitted a solution to the issue had still not been found. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we will be able to find a solution to the issue related to updating the revised defence plans,\u201d Stoltenberg said as he arrived for the summit at a luxury golf hotel on the outskirts of London. \u201cI discussed this with President Erdo\u011fan last night and we are working on the issue as we speak.\u201d Johnson played down the dispute. \u201cThere is far, far more that unites us than divides us, and I think one thing every leader here is absolutely resolved upon is the vital importance of Nato for our collective security,\u201d the prime minister said as he arrived. \u2022 Note added 11 December 2019.

Stakes rise as impeachment inquiry enters new phase The US House intelligence committee voted on Tuesday to adopt the damning, 300-page Trump-Ukraine impeachment report produced by congressional Democrats, which concludes that the president \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d. The 13-9 vote along party lines launches the inquiry into its next phase at the judiciary committee, where Republicans are expected to resort to procedural objections in their efforts to protect Trump. What now? Tom McCarthy breaks down the Democrats\u2019 report into five key takeaways, while Maanvi Singh explains what comes next in the impeachment process. Stephen Miller. Trump is standing by his aide Stephen Miller, despite the damaging fallout from leaked emails that revealed his white nationalist views. Amanda Holpuch asks why Miller\u2019s White House position seems as secure as ever. World leaders appear to joke about Trump at Nato summit It seems world leaders are as shocked and bemused by Trump as the rest of us. A video has emerged from the Nato summit in London, which appears to show Boris Johnson, Justin Trudeau, Emmanuel Macron, Princess Anne and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, laughing about the US president during a reception at Buckingham Palace.

Prince Andrew. As a former navy pilot, Prince Andrew would normally be present at a Nato shindig, but the disgraced duke has been stripped of his duties, leaving his mother to host the reception. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s claim not to know Andrew is contradicted by extensive photographic evidence.

As a black woman, Derecka Purnell is more than ready for a black female president. And yet, she says, she felt less solidarity with Harris than with those who suffered under her watch when she was California\u2019s attorney general. China trade deal imperiled by US human rights legislation The House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a bill demanding the Trump administration toughen its response to human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the Chinese province where more than a million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are believed to be detained in internment and political \u201cre-education\u201d camps. The Uighur Act of 2019, a stronger version of a bill that raised Beijing\u2019s hackles when it passed the Senate in September, calls for sanctions on senior Chinese officials. Market tailspin. Asian markets plunged after the bill\u2019s passage, which it is feared will jeopardise the US-China trade talks, just as they were thought to be on the verge of a deal. Cheat sheet At the first day of his defamation trial in Los Angeles, Elon Musk has insisted that when he called Vernon Unsworth a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter during the Tham Luang cave rescue effort in 2018, he simply meant the British caver was a \u201ccreepy old guy,\u201d not a literal pedophile. The Chicago police chief, Eddie Johnson, has been fired for \u201cethical lapses\u201d just weeks before his retirement, having been found asleep behind the wheel of his SUV after several hours of drinking at a downtown restaurant with a female member of his security detail. The co-founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are stepping down as, respectively, the CEO and president of the search engine\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, leaving the Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, in charge of both Google and Alphabet. The gene editing performed on a pair of Chinese twins in 2018, which the biophysicist He Jiankui claimed would immunise them against HIV, might instead have created unintended mutations, future effects of which on the children are unclear. Must-reads Giorgio Armani: \u2018My values have always been sustainable\u2019 The 85-year-old fashion titan Giorgio Armani is still running his own company, where the search for his successor goes on. And in an era when sustainability is prized, his trend-free approach is at last on-trend. \u201cI\u2019d love for us all to slow down the cycle of collections, and produce less, but of better quality,\u201d he tells Hannah Marriott.

      "body": "<p>The Pogues\u2019 Fairytale of New York has been voted the most popular Christmas song in the UK in a survey by PRS for Music, and was also the most played Christmas song on British radio last year \u2013 despite ongoing controversy around its lyrics.</p> <p>The song has been subject to criticism in recent years for its lyric, sung by Kirsty MacColl: \u201cYou scumbag, you maggot, you cheap lousy faggot.\u201d In 2018, Eoghan McDermott, a DJ for Irish national broadcaster RTE, had called for the lyric to be censored, arguing: \u201cEnough vitriol out there without gay people having to feel uncomfortable so people that aren\u2019t affected by an insult can tap their toe.\u201d Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan responded, saying it was \u201cnot intended to offend \u2026 The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character \u2026 She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history, and she is down on her luck and desperate.\u201d</p> <p>The furore hasn\u2019t damaged the song\u2019s popularity. PRS for Music found that it was the most played seasonal track across 50 regional UK radio stations in 2018. Furthermore, in a new survey of 2,000 people asked for their favourite Christmas songs, Fairytale of New York topped the chart. It was followed by Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas, Slade\u2019s Merry Christmas Everybody and Bing Crosby\u2019s White Christmas.

      "bodyText": "The Pogues\u2019 Fairytale of New York has been voted the most popular Christmas song in the UK in a survey by PRS for Music, and was also the most played Christmas song on British radio last year \u2013 despite ongoing controversy around its lyrics. The song has been subject to criticism in recent years for its lyric, sung by Kirsty MacColl: \u201cYou scumbag, you maggot, you cheap lousy faggot.\u201d In 2018, Eoghan McDermott, a DJ for Irish national broadcaster RTE, had called for the lyric to be censored, arguing: \u201cEnough vitriol out there without gay people having to feel uncomfortable so people that aren\u2019t affected by an insult can tap their toe.\u201d Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan responded, saying it was \u201cnot intended to offend \u2026 The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character \u2026 She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history, and she is down on her luck and desperate.\u201d The furore hasn\u2019t damaged the song\u2019s popularity. PRS for Music found that it was the most played seasonal track across 50 regional UK radio stations in 2018. Furthermore, in a new survey of 2,000 people asked for their favourite Christmas songs, Fairytale of New York topped the chart. It was followed by Wham!\u2019s Last Christmas, Slade\u2019s Merry Christmas Everybody and Bing Crosby\u2019s White Christmas. Per the lyrics to Slade\u2019s hit, those surveyed clearly thought \u201cthe old songs are the best\u201d \u2013 none of the top 20 songs are from this century, with Cliff Richard\u2019s The Millennium Prayer, released in November 1999, the most recent choice at No 20. In 2007, the BBC censored Fairytale of New York to remove the words \u201cfaggot\u201d and \u201cslut\u201d, though reversed the decision shortly afterwards. Radio 1 boss Andy Parfitt said at the time the decision was \u201cwrong \u2026 an embarrassing day for Radio 1\u201d. This week, Alex Dyke, a DJ for local radio station BBC Radio Solent, said he was \u201cno longer comfortable\u201d playing the song on his show.

      "body": "<p>Twelve months is a long time in football. This time last season Fulham were sinking without trace, bottom of the Premier League after a run of eight defeats in nine matches and on their second manager of the season. A year on, and after a long look in the mirror, the team are almost unrecognisable \u2013 only four players started Friday\u2019s win over Swansea and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/12/fulham-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">the final day of last season at Craven Cottage</a>. But some things never change: Aleksandar Mitrovic is still scoring goals, and lots of them. Since August the Serbia striker has scored 23 times in 24 appearances for club and country.</p> <p>For Aboubakar Kamara, the turnaround has been even more remarkable. Banned indefinitely from the club\u2019s Motspur Park training base and sent on loan to the Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor after an altercation with a member of security staff in January, Kamara was reintegrated into the first-team squad in the summer and has seemingly put a turbulent start to the year behind him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/02/preston-west-brom-championship-match-report\">Charlie Austin\u2019s late penalty sinks Preston to put West Brom back on top</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those at Fulham feel the forward has matured since that incident and he has been influential this season, notably scoring twice against Queens Park Rangers last month in the absence of Mitrovic, with whom he clashed with during a yoga session last season. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to manage Abou differently \u2013 it\u2019s not the same as how you manage some of the others,\u201d said the Fulham head coach, Scott Parker. \u201cAbou\u2019s not been a problem since I stepped into this role. Maybe the perception on the outside is very different to the reality and the reality is he\u2019s a well-respected, appreciated member of this squad.\u201d</p> <p>There are few remnants of the supermarket sweep of two summers ago, with Fabri, Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri and Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa sent on loan and Ryan Babel\u2019s red hair and Lazar Markovic\u2019s long locks a distant memory. Those four survivors from that 4-0 defeat by Newcastle United in May \u2013 Mitrovic, Alfie Mawson, Joe Bryan and the captain Tom Cairney \u2013 are key pillars of Parker\u2019s side. Mawson, who spent most of last season injured, has been ever-present this season, while Bryan, who excelled in the second tier with Bristol City, visitors to Fulham on Saturday, has proved a consistent performer.</p> <p>Tying Cairney and, more pertinently, Mitrovic to long-term contracts in the summer has proved a masterstroke. \u201cHe is motivated by goals,\u201d Parker said of the Serb. \u201cHis general all-round play is first class. We can mix our game up, go up to him and he can give us a platform because of his physical presence; we can also play it into his feet and build around him. I think he enjoys being at this club \u2013 it\u2019s a place where he is comfortable.

      "bodyText": "Twelve months is a long time in football. This time last season Fulham were sinking without trace, bottom of the Premier League after a run of eight defeats in nine matches and on their second manager of the season. A year on, and after a long look in the mirror, the team are almost unrecognisable \u2013 only four players started Friday\u2019s win over Swansea and the final day of last season at Craven Cottage. But some things never change: Aleksandar Mitrovic is still scoring goals, and lots of them. Since August the Serbia striker has scored 23 times in 24 appearances for club and country. For Aboubakar Kamara, the turnaround has been even more remarkable. Banned indefinitely from the club\u2019s Motspur Park training base and sent on loan to the Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor after an altercation with a member of security staff in January, Kamara was reintegrated into the first-team squad in the summer and has seemingly put a turbulent start to the year behind him. Those at Fulham feel the forward has matured since that incident and he has been influential this season, notably scoring twice against Queens Park Rangers last month in the absence of Mitrovic, with whom he clashed with during a yoga session last season. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to manage Abou differently \u2013 it\u2019s not the same as how you manage some of the others,\u201d said the Fulham head coach, Scott Parker. \u201cAbou\u2019s not been a problem since I stepped into this role. Maybe the perception on the outside is very different to the reality and the reality is he\u2019s a well-respected, appreciated member of this squad.\u201d There are few remnants of the supermarket sweep of two summers ago, with Fabri, Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri and Andr\u00e9-Frank Zambo Anguissa sent on loan and Ryan Babel\u2019s red hair and Lazar Markovic\u2019s long locks a distant memory. Those four survivors from that 4-0 defeat by Newcastle United in May \u2013 Mitrovic, Alfie Mawson, Joe Bryan and the captain Tom Cairney \u2013 are key pillars of Parker\u2019s side. Mawson, who spent most of last season injured, has been ever-present this season, while Bryan, who excelled in the second tier with Bristol City, visitors to Fulham on Saturday, has proved a consistent performer. Tying Cairney and, more pertinently, Mitrovic to long-term contracts in the summer has proved a masterstroke. \u201cHe is motivated by goals,\u201d Parker said of the Serb. \u201cHis general all-round play is first class. We can mix our game up, go up to him and he can give us a platform because of his physical presence; we can also play it into his feet and build around him. I think he enjoys being at this club \u2013 it\u2019s a place where he is comfortable. We are delighted we have him on our books and he is scoring the goals for us.\u201d Only the league leaders, West Bromwich Albion, have more goals than Fulham\u2019s 31 goals this season, a haul matched by Bristol City and Preston. Keeping the ball out of their net was Fulham\u2019s undoing last season \u2013 they conceded 81 times, the worst by any club in the Premier League since the club\u2019s relegation in 2015.

And it\u2019s dystopian \u2013 a sign of the disturbing push from the \u201cpro-life\u201d right to treat women\u2019s bodies as incubators, no matter what the physical toll.</p> <p>The law would criminalize abortion and make it punishable by life in prison; \u201caggravated abortion murder\u201d would carry the death penalty. That\u2019s right: \u201cpro-life\u201d lawmakers in Ohio want to throw women and girls in jail for life, and even execute them, for ending their pregnancies.</p> <p>It\u2019s troubling that this even needs to be said, but because legislators in Ohio apparently don\u2019t know: you cannot re-implant an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies are potentially life-threatening complications where a fertilized egg implants itself somewhere outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. As the cells multiply and the embryo grows, it can burst the tube, causing serious and potentially deadly complications. As a result, the standard of care for ectopic pregnancies is to dissolve the fertilized egg. Some self-styled <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health-environment-science/religious-hospitals-restrictions-sparking-conflicts-scrutiny/2011/01/03/ABVVxmD_story.html\">\u201cpro-life\u201d healthcare providers</a> refuse to do even this, and will <a href=\"https://www.ncbcenter.org/files/1514/4916/3469/NCBCsummFAQ_EctopicPregnancy.pdf\">instead remove part or all</a> of a woman\u2019s fallopian tube. The embryo still dies, and the procedure is more complicated, but hey, they didn\u2019t directly \u201ckill\u201d a fertilized egg.</p> <p>It\u2019s this logic that Ohio\u2019s anti-abortion legislators seem to be following: that a fertilized egg is a life, and therefore, it\u2019s impermissible to remove it. So why not have a doctor scoop it out and stick it in a woman\u2019s uterus?</p> <p>Because, well, you can\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s no procedure for it, and it\u2019s not so easy to move microscopic fertilized eggs around, especially when they are implanted and growing in a woman\u2019s body.

      "bodyText": "It would almost be funny if it weren\u2019t real: a bill introduced in Ohio that would require doctors to attempt to re-implant ectopic pregnancies \u2013 a medical impossibility \u2013 or face charges of \u201cabortion murder\u201d (a legal invention). But it is real. And it\u2019s dystopian \u2013 a sign of the disturbing push from the \u201cpro-life\u201d right to treat women\u2019s bodies as incubators, no matter what the physical toll. The law would criminalize abortion and make it punishable by life in prison; \u201caggravated abortion murder\u201d would carry the death penalty. That\u2019s right: \u201cpro-life\u201d lawmakers in Ohio want to throw women and girls in jail for life, and even execute them, for ending their pregnancies. It\u2019s troubling that this even needs to be said, but because legislators in Ohio apparently don\u2019t know: you cannot re-implant an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies are potentially life-threatening complications where a fertilized egg implants itself somewhere outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. As the cells multiply and the embryo grows, it can burst the tube, causing serious and potentially deadly complications. As a result, the standard of care for ectopic pregnancies is to dissolve the fertilized egg. Some self-styled \u201cpro-life\u201d healthcare providers refuse to do even this, and will instead remove part or all of a woman\u2019s fallopian tube. The embryo still dies, and the procedure is more complicated, but hey, they didn\u2019t directly \u201ckill\u201d a fertilized egg. It\u2019s this logic that Ohio\u2019s anti-abortion legislators seem to be following: that a fertilized egg is a life, and therefore, it\u2019s impermissible to remove it. So why not have a doctor scoop it out and stick it in a woman\u2019s uterus? Because, well, you can\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s no procedure for it, and it\u2019s not so easy to move microscopic fertilized eggs around, especially when they are implanted and growing in a woman\u2019s body. Doctors can certainly try \u2013 and in doing so, put their patients through serious and unnecessary surgery, and put them at risk for catastrophic hemorrhage. That\u2019s the choice that these Ohio legislators would force on healthcare providers: put your patients at risk for a made-up procedure that cannot and will not work, or face the rest of your life in jail. As for women, well, the bill treats them as mere incubators, not fully-fledged human beings who may object to having their organs sliced open and their lives put on the line so a doctor can go through the motions of pretending to save an egg. Under the terms of this bill, a person may also face execution for \u201caggravated abortion,\u201d which more or less means performing an abortion while also committing another serious crime. Bad news, I suppose, for anyone who enjoys combining abortion and bank robbery. And lest you think that this is the invention of one or two deranged imbeciles in Ohio\u2019s legislature, the bill has 19 co-sponsors \u2013 one-fifth of Ohio\u2019s house. Even if this bill passes and is signed into law, it\u2019s so blatantly unconstitutional that it won\u2019t go into effect \u2013 at least not until Roe v Wade is overturned.

      "body": "<p>A woman stands alone in an empty landscape, poised before a precipice. Her face is daubed with thick white paint, and she is looking back over her shoulder. On her head is a beaver-skin hat, tangled with feathers and blood-red ribbon. In front of her, the Canadian prairie stretches off into the distance.</p> <p>This photograph, shot at the evocatively named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump in Alberta, is the work of Meryl McMaster, one of a new generation of indigenous North American artists. Edge of a Moment, as the work is called, shows McMaster at the site where, for thousands of years, the indigenous inhabitants of the prairies drove entire herds of buffalo over the cliffs, producing meat and material at a scale unequalled anywhere else on the continent. Here, the remains of tens of millions of animals lie closely packed under the soil, a tangled vein of broken bones stretching 12 metres down.</p> <p>As Immense As the Sky, McMaster\u2019s first UK solo show,<em> </em>is about to open at Birmingham\u2019s Ikon Gallery, starting a string of exhibitions aiming to wake the UK up to indigenous and Native American art. Like the landscape she captures, McMaster\u2019s photographs feel loaded with meaning, her meticulously constructed outfits and props suggesting complex stories of exploitation, migration, place and heritage. They\u2019re performance, fable, self-portrait and landscape photography all rolled into one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d91e6e8b88dcfd1fa5c3d6cb8929614abd5f58f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d91e6e8b88dcfd1fa5c3d6cb8929614abd5f58f7/0_0_7079_4500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leap of death \u2026 McMaster at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, in the work titled Edge of a Moment, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leap of death \u2026 McMaster at Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, in the work titled Edge of a Moment, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meryl McMaster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWith the titles,\u201d she says, \u201cI try to hint at a direction the viewer could think about. It\u2019s not a secretive process. I\u2019m creating dreamlike, theatrical imagery.\u201d McMaster is of Plains Cree heritage and a member of the Siksika First Nation. The Cree, with 220,000 members, are the largest group of First Nations in Canada, with territories ranging from east of Hudson Bay to the far west of Alberta, where they adopted the buffalo-hunting culture of the Plains in the early 1700s.</p> <p>Although she was born and raised in Ottawa, McMaster\u2019s roots lie in the western prairie near Saskatoon. Her father, Gerald, is an artist and curator who grew up in the Red Pheasant Nation reserve in Saskatchewan; her mother is of European-Canadian heritage. \u201cI feel like I have two homes, very different landscapes that inform my sense of self. That connection to the outdoors has found its way into my work.\u201d</p> <p>Captured across Canada, including at early settlements in Ontario and Newfoundland, her work revolves around landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an equal subject within my images,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be listening to stories in my home community, from knowledge-keepers or family members, and it\u2019ll be about a specific landscape. Then that story will influence a costume. With my Cree heritage, I was brought up to respect the land we stand on and everything that lives among us.\u201d</p> <p>The Ikon show comes at a time of increasing awareness of how indigenous peoples are represented in museums. In April, the Bristol Museum returned human remains to representatives of the Tongva, who originally lived on the Channel Islands off California. Meanwhile, the American Museum near Bath is adding to its collection of contemporary Native American art \u2013 and next year will see Settlement come to fruition, a vast project aiming to mark the 400th anniversary of the pilgrims\u2019 journey from Plymouth to the New World.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f2e670bc249e93bc0b74a6b585a966638dd390e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f2e670bc249e93bc0b74a6b585a966638dd390e/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cartography of the Unseen, Meryl McMaster, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cartography of the Unseen, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meryl McMaster</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From July, 27 North American indigenous artists will occupy Pounds House and the surrounding grounds in Plymouth\u2019s Central Park for four weeks. The project takes its inspiration from the word settlement: the fact that it can mean a habitation, but also a resolution to a dispute or conflict.

      "bodyText": "A woman stands alone in an empty landscape, poised before a precipice. Her face is daubed with thick white paint, and she is looking back over her shoulder. On her head is a beaver-skin hat, tangled with feathers and blood-red ribbon. In front of her, the Canadian prairie stretches off into the distance. This photograph, shot at the evocatively named Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump in Alberta, is the work of Meryl McMaster, one of a new generation of indigenous North American artists. Edge of a Moment, as the work is called, shows McMaster at the site where, for thousands of years, the indigenous inhabitants of the prairies drove entire herds of buffalo over the cliffs, producing meat and material at a scale unequalled anywhere else on the continent. Here, the remains of tens of millions of animals lie closely packed under the soil, a tangled vein of broken bones stretching 12 metres down. As Immense As the Sky, McMaster\u2019s first UK solo show, is about to open at Birmingham\u2019s Ikon Gallery, starting a string of exhibitions aiming to wake the UK up to indigenous and Native American art. Like the landscape she captures, McMaster\u2019s photographs feel loaded with meaning, her meticulously constructed outfits and props suggesting complex stories of exploitation, migration, place and heritage. They\u2019re performance, fable, self-portrait and landscape photography all rolled into one. \u201cWith the titles,\u201d she says, \u201cI try to hint at a direction the viewer could think about. It\u2019s not a secretive process. I\u2019m creating dreamlike, theatrical imagery.\u201d McMaster is of Plains Cree heritage and a member of the Siksika First Nation. The Cree, with 220,000 members, are the largest group of First Nations in Canada, with territories ranging from east of Hudson Bay to the far west of Alberta, where they adopted the buffalo-hunting culture of the Plains in the early 1700s. Although she was born and raised in Ottawa, McMaster\u2019s roots lie in the western prairie near Saskatoon. Her father, Gerald, is an artist and curator who grew up in the Red Pheasant Nation reserve in Saskatchewan; her mother is of European-Canadian heritage. \u201cI feel like I have two homes, very different landscapes that inform my sense of self. That connection to the outdoors has found its way into my work.\u201d Captured across Canada, including at early settlements in Ontario and Newfoundland, her work revolves around landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an equal subject within my images,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be listening to stories in my home community, from knowledge-keepers or family members, and it\u2019ll be about a specific landscape. Then that story will influence a costume. With my Cree heritage, I was brought up to respect the land we stand on and everything that lives among us.\u201d The Ikon show comes at a time of increasing awareness of how indigenous peoples are represented in museums. In April, the Bristol Museum returned human remains to representatives of the Tongva, who originally lived on the Channel Islands off California. Meanwhile, the American Museum near Bath is adding to its collection of contemporary Native American art \u2013 and next year will see Settlement come to fruition, a vast project aiming to mark the 400th anniversary of the pilgrims\u2019 journey from Plymouth to the New World. From July, 27 North American indigenous artists will occupy Pounds House and the surrounding grounds in Plymouth\u2019s Central Park for four weeks. The project takes its inspiration from the word settlement: the fact that it can mean a habitation, but also a resolution to a dispute or conflict. The work of these artists will provide a timely echo of a protest made by the American Indian Movement on the 350th anniversary of the pilgrims\u2019 journey. Led by the activist, actor and writer Russell Means, AIM members seized a replica of the Mayflower in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on Thanksgiving Day 1970. \u201cWe\u2019re literally building a settlement,\u201d says Cannupa Hanska Luger, the artist behind the event, which will blend performance, installation, film, poetry and dance to form a \u201creverse colonial experience\u201d intended to make the inhabitants of a colonising country think about the effect this has on the colonised. Raised on the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota, Luger is of Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, Lakota, Austrian and Norwegian descent. He uses ceramics, video, sound, steel and paper to tell stories about modern indigenous life. A show from 2013 involved the creation of ornate clay models of boomboxes themed around cliches of indigenous America, which were then publicly smashed and the fragments put on display. Luger is best known, however, for his Mirror Shield Project, which provided instructions, via a video tutorial, for creating shields for protestors at Standing Rock during the Dakota Pipeline controversy.

      "body": "<p>Giorgio Armani has yet to arrive for our interview, in his office in Milan, but already I am caught in his steely gaze. Five portraits of the designer hang from the walls; five pairs of ice-blue eyes staring intensely. In one almost life-sized Aaron Shikler oil painting, his arms are crossed, his biceps visibly sculpted. In another, an Andy Warhol screen print, he is suited and slick-haired, the epitome of the 1980s power-dressing aesthetic he created.</p> <p>The imposing decor adds to the sense of occasion as I wait, with two of his team, for the 85-year-old to arrive. I am shown to the seat opposite Armani\u2019s empty leather chair. Then the man himself \u2013 a little shorter and whiter-haired than the Masters of the Universe vibe might suggest \u2013 pops his head around the door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b93a2ce44d746d22bcfb71688a156384d301a7f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b93a2ce44d746d22bcfb71688a156384d301a7f6/0_354_1181_896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Armani: \u2018I really believe the English were the first to create a new fashion.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"759\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Armani: \u2018I really believe the English were the first to create a new fashion.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Giorgio Armani</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday night, Armani was given the Fashion Award for outstanding achievement at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall. Cheering him on was an impressive squad \u2013 including Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Tom Cruise. The recognition means a lot, he says in Italian, speaking through a translator, \u201cand thank God, because getting used to beautiful things is not positive\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to say,\u201d he volunteers, \u201cthat I really believe the English were the first to create a new fashion. The designers of the 1970s were really innovative. When I decided to do a suit in a different way, it was thanks to English fashion.\u201d He pays particular respect to Mary Quant (\u201cShe really invented a new fashion \u2013 she had courage,\u201d) and Vivienne Westwood.</p> <p>Armani\u2019s style, on the other hand, is very Milanese. For 44 years, he has stuck to sleek, understated design \u2013 think beige linen and navy-blue velvet \u2013 an aesthetic reproduced across an empire of hotels, florists, perfumes, interiors and cosmetics. Today he employs 8,000 people across the globe. Last year\u2019s revenue was \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.8bn); Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/giorgio-armani/#76d889cc2c5b\" title=\"\">puts his worth at $10.7</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/giorgio-armani/#76d889cc2c5b\" title=\"\">b</a><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/giorgio-armani/#76d889cc2c5b\" title=\"\">n (\u00a38.2bn)</a>.</p> <p>Armani customers rhapsodise about the<strong> </strong>cut of his tailoring, claiming it looks current even 20 years after purchase. The secret to this, he says, is \u201crestraint. Trying not to exaggerate in my idea \u2013 even if my fantasy sometimes goes further I take a step back.\u201d</p> <p>The fashion critics sometimes have other ideas, knocking his shows for being predictable \u2013 when they simply present another collection of nice suits \u2013 or complaining he has distracted from the nice suits if he jazzes things up with natty accessories.</p> <p>In many ways, Armani has set himself apart from fashion, whether criticising its lofty side (he described Prada\u2019s conceptual style as \u201celite, snob fashion\u201d) or becoming embroiled in the odd spat (his 2009 contretemps with Dolce &amp; Gabbana <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/19/giorgio-armani-accuses-dolce-gabbana\" title=\"\">about a pair of quilted trousers</a> was particularly enjoyable). Unlike any other designer operating at his level, he styles all of his shows himself, sometimes teaching models \u201cthe Armani walk\u201d backstage and \u2013 as legend would have it \u2013 even touching up their makeup.</p> <p>Counterintuitively, Armani\u2019s trend-free approach is now on trend, as fashion grapples with its status as one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries. I ask him how it feels to hear his competitors suddenly talking about longevity of design? He gives an entertainingly Bond-villain response, pausing for dramatic effect, laughing heartily then saying: \u201cFinally!\u201d</p> <p>What he is doing about sustainability? \u201cI am obviously aligned,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all desperately, us in fashion, trying to find solutions, [trying to] provide something that is more sustainable, with every moment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d618f86cc5047d9711220cbe948d6e88182bcb66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d618f86cc5047d9711220cbe948d6e88182bcb66/1_0_2998_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carla Bruni modeling for Armani in 1992 (left) and the designer\u2019s prefall 2020 collection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carla Bruni modeling for Armani in 1992 (left) and the designer\u2019s prefall 2020 collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images/Guardian composite</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy values have always been in a way sustainable \u2013 I\u2019ve never done things to be thrown away after one season.\u201d Later, over email, he adds: \u201cI\u2019d love for us all to slow down the cycle of collections, and produce less, but of better quality. It seems that designers are locked into a system of renewal that, for me, often seems arbitrary.\u201d</p> <p>Though the Armani Group has signed <a href=\"https://www.kering.com/en/news/24-new-companies-join-the-fashion-pact\" title=\"\">the Fashion Pact</a>, a series of pledges aiming to make the industry greener, he would like to do something more direct, he says, such as dealing with \u201cthe pollution, the trash that is left out in Rome \u2013 it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d He brings up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/venice-closes-st-marks-square-as-high-water-threatens-again\" title=\"\">the flooding in Venice</a>, and \u201cbig boats crashing in front of San Marco \u2013 impossible. It\u2019s a very impossible world at the moment,\u201d he continues. \u201cChildren dying because they haven\u2019t got food, wars still happening. Obviously, every now and then I myself have a doubt if what I am doing is correct, if I should be pushing the pedal or accelerating to provide luxury when all of this is happening.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a fair point. Like most businesses, the Armani Group is <a href=\"https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/armani-sales-fall-again-as-founder-pushes-to-restructure-brand\" title=\"\">pushing for growth</a>, launching a pre-fall collection and new high jewellery range the day before we meet. \u201cThe press and the clients always want more,\u201d he says, \u201cand me, too. At the top of the pyramid is me.\u201d</p> <p>I ask about Extinction Rebellion\u2019s recent protests, of which he says: \u201cI\u2019m against exaggeration, by nature, in everything. I don\u2019t like exhibition, though there is a basis which is justified.\u201d He flirts with the conspiracy theories about Greta Thunberg, seeming reluctant to endorse her unequivocally: \u201cI don\u2019t know enough of her history to know if there is somebody moving her, behind her, but I must say she is strong.\u201d He says she has \u201cuna faccia di bronzo\u201d \u2013 a phrase similar to \u201cbold as brass\u201d in English. Of the media\u2019s response to her, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t like it when [there is] too much shouting.\u201d</p> <p>He raises the issue of exaggeration, again, when I ask whether he feels targeted by the billionaire bashing that has become key to the rhetoric of the US and UK elections. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he says, but says I should take the Forbes listings with a pinch of salt. Once they had him as the third richest person in Italy, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. There are some people who are hiding.\u201d That said, it has been beneficial: \u201cIn a way, being known for what I earn has helped the brand and made it the pinnacle of luxury.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever his bank balance, it is safe to say Armani has quite a lifestyle.

      "bodyText": "Giorgio Armani has yet to arrive for our interview, in his office in Milan, but already I am caught in his steely gaze. Five portraits of the designer hang from the walls; five pairs of ice-blue eyes staring intensely. In one almost life-sized Aaron Shikler oil painting, his arms are crossed, his biceps visibly sculpted. In another, an Andy Warhol screen print, he is suited and slick-haired, the epitome of the 1980s power-dressing aesthetic he created. The imposing decor adds to the sense of occasion as I wait, with two of his team, for the 85-year-old to arrive. I am shown to the seat opposite Armani\u2019s empty leather chair. Then the man himself \u2013 a little shorter and whiter-haired than the Masters of the Universe vibe might suggest \u2013 pops his head around the door. On Monday night, Armani was given the Fashion Award for outstanding achievement at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall. Cheering him on was an impressive squad \u2013 including Julia Roberts, Cate Blanchett and Tom Cruise. The recognition means a lot, he says in Italian, speaking through a translator, \u201cand thank God, because getting used to beautiful things is not positive\u201d. \u201cI would like to say,\u201d he volunteers, \u201cthat I really believe the English were the first to create a new fashion. The designers of the 1970s were really innovative. When I decided to do a suit in a different way, it was thanks to English fashion.\u201d He pays particular respect to Mary Quant (\u201cShe really invented a new fashion \u2013 she had courage,\u201d) and Vivienne Westwood. Armani\u2019s style, on the other hand, is very Milanese. For 44 years, he has stuck to sleek, understated design \u2013 think beige linen and navy-blue velvet \u2013 an aesthetic reproduced across an empire of hotels, florists, perfumes, interiors and cosmetics. Today he employs 8,000 people across the globe. Last year\u2019s revenue was \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.8bn); Forbes puts his worth at $10.7bn (\u00a38.2bn). Armani customers rhapsodise about the cut of his tailoring, claiming it looks current even 20 years after purchase. The secret to this, he says, is \u201crestraint. Trying not to exaggerate in my idea \u2013 even if my fantasy sometimes goes further I take a step back.\u201d The fashion critics sometimes have other ideas, knocking his shows for being predictable \u2013 when they simply present another collection of nice suits \u2013 or complaining he has distracted from the nice suits if he jazzes things up with natty accessories. In many ways, Armani has set himself apart from fashion, whether criticising its lofty side (he described Prada\u2019s conceptual style as \u201celite, snob fashion\u201d) or becoming embroiled in the odd spat (his 2009 contretemps with Dolce &amp; Gabbana about a pair of quilted trousers was particularly enjoyable). Unlike any other designer operating at his level, he styles all of his shows himself, sometimes teaching models \u201cthe Armani walk\u201d backstage and \u2013 as legend would have it \u2013 even touching up their makeup. Counterintuitively, Armani\u2019s trend-free approach is now on trend, as fashion grapples with its status as one of the world\u2019s most polluting industries. I ask him how it feels to hear his competitors suddenly talking about longevity of design? He gives an entertainingly Bond-villain response, pausing for dramatic effect, laughing heartily then saying: \u201cFinally!\u201d What he is doing about sustainability? \u201cI am obviously aligned,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all desperately, us in fashion, trying to find solutions, [trying to] provide something that is more sustainable, with every moment.\u201d \u201cMy values have always been in a way sustainable \u2013 I\u2019ve never done things to be thrown away after one season.\u201d Later, over email, he adds: \u201cI\u2019d love for us all to slow down the cycle of collections, and produce less, but of better quality. It seems that designers are locked into a system of renewal that, for me, often seems arbitrary.\u201d Though the Armani Group has signed the Fashion Pact, a series of pledges aiming to make the industry greener, he would like to do something more direct, he says, such as dealing with \u201cthe pollution, the trash that is left out in Rome \u2013 it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d He brings up the flooding in Venice, and \u201cbig boats crashing in front of San Marco \u2013 impossible. It\u2019s a very impossible world at the moment,\u201d he continues. \u201cChildren dying because they haven\u2019t got food, wars still happening. Obviously, every now and then I myself have a doubt if what I am doing is correct, if I should be pushing the pedal or accelerating to provide luxury when all of this is happening.\u201d It\u2019s a fair point. Like most businesses, the Armani Group is pushing for growth, launching a pre-fall collection and new high jewellery range the day before we meet. \u201cThe press and the clients always want more,\u201d he says, \u201cand me, too. At the top of the pyramid is me.\u201d I ask about Extinction Rebellion\u2019s recent protests, of which he says: \u201cI\u2019m against exaggeration, by nature, in everything. I don\u2019t like exhibition, though there is a basis which is justified.\u201d He flirts with the conspiracy theories about Greta Thunberg, seeming reluctant to endorse her unequivocally: \u201cI don\u2019t know enough of her history to know if there is somebody moving her, behind her, but I must say she is strong.\u201d He says she has \u201cuna faccia di bronzo\u201d \u2013 a phrase similar to \u201cbold as brass\u201d in English. Of the media\u2019s response to her, he says: \u201cI don\u2019t like it when [there is] too much shouting.\u201d He raises the issue of exaggeration, again, when I ask whether he feels targeted by the billionaire bashing that has become key to the rhetoric of the US and UK elections. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d he says, but says I should take the Forbes listings with a pinch of salt. Once they had him as the third richest person in Italy, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. There are some people who are hiding.\u201d That said, it has been beneficial: \u201cIn a way, being known for what I earn has helped the brand and made it the pinnacle of luxury.\u201d Whatever his bank balance, it is safe to say Armani has quite a lifestyle. He just spent his 85th birthday \u201cin my house in St Tropez, just before starting the summer holidays on my yacht\u201d. He has more modest hobbies, too, such as watching Downton Abbey. I am surprised by the strength of his views on its film adaptation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see the film. It was stupid, in a way, to put together in two hours everything that took time to see over series and series [for a] commercial reason.\u201d A decade ago, Armani said it would be \u201cridiculous to still be in charge at 85,\u201d but here we are, and he has still yet to announce a successor. Today he tells me: \u201cI don\u2019t think one person will work \u2013 I think it\u2019s somebody on fashion, somebody on commercial, someone on financial.\u201d \u201cObviously, nowadays, it\u2019s my decision what will happen,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut when I won\u2019t be here any more they will decide what\u2019s best.\u201d Does that worry him? \u201cIt\u2019s my first thought every morning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling.\u201d \u201cBut you have to be strong,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe company has to go on, aside from my person. But I don\u2019t see the alter ego of Armani out there. I also think it\u2019s not fashionable any more. Now companies are done by good people working together.\u201d The night before our interview I attend a dinner after Armani\u2019s pre-fall show. The velvet-clad guests applaud him on arrival; the significance of the seating plan (at dinner, he sits between the menswear head Pantaleo Dell\u2019Orco, and his niece Silvana Armani) is analysed by the media table: \u201cIt\u2019s like Versailles,\u201d proclaims one Italian journalist as necks crane to see who the boss is talking to. For me, it is impossible not to draw parallels with the Logan Roy birthday party scene in the HBO show about a media clan jostling for power, Succession. Armani leaves at about 9pm and the guests applaud again; the atmosphere immediately flattens. The next day, I ask Armani whether he watches Succession. \u201cNo. On purpose. Because then I would think about it in the morning but also in the evening when I am watching TV to relax.\u201d Plus, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be influenced by a TV series \u2013 and [nor do I want] my influencers [to be].\u201d \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a big boss,\u201d he says, and gestures towards one of the oil paintings on the wall. \u201cMaybe the future won\u2019t be like that.\u201d Travel to Milan was paid for by Armani.",

At Meadow Park that was true; the crisp instinctive passing, the movement of the midfield diamond, the high line and searing passes of the back three, made you drool.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/dec/03/the-100-best-female-footballers-in-the-world-2019\">The 100 best female footballers in the world 2019: 100-71</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there was a bigger story. An individual performance from the Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema that defies logic. By the 65th minute she had scored six goals and provided four assists. Yet she is a headline stealer who hates the headlines.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve played like that before,\u201d she said after her double hat-trick. \u201cI felt really good today and I was probably happier with my assists today. I felt really good and I\u2019m happy that I could help the team.\u201d</p> <p>Miedema is happier resting up for the next game than sitting alongside the footballing elite and being recognised as one of the best players in the world at the Ballon d\u2019Or awards.</p> <p>It is not just a shyness that prompts that attitude but an active dislike of individual awards. Ask her, as <a href=\"https://arseblog.news/2019/09/vivianne-miedema-reacts-to-victory-over-brighton/?utm_campaign=autotwitter&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter\">Arseblog\u2019s Tim Stillman did</a> regarding her omission from the Fifpro World XI. \u201cI think we all know it\u2019s all about popularity and I don\u2019t post much on Instagram or Twitter, so that\u2019s probably what went wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about individual awards to be honest, but I think it\u2019s a joke.\u201d</p> <p>She had scored 22 goals in 20 games, 31 across all competitions. After eight league games this season she has 10 goals, 22 in all competitions. Atthe age of 23 she is the Netherlands\u2019 record goalscorer.</p> <p>She is fascinating to watch. The goals defy appearance. Miedema has a nonchalance that almost makes her look uninterested or lazy. It is a theme perpetuated by a dry wit and somewhat lackadaisical attitude to training and life in general. A photo of Miedema sitting on the floor, sunglasses on, in front of a group of Netherlands players powering away on exercise bikes drew amusement during the World Cup.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday, in north London, records were smashed. Arsenal\u2019s 11-1 pounding of Bristol City became the highest-scoring game in Women\u2019s Super League history \u2013 surpassing Liverpool\u2019s 9-0 defeat of Doncaster Belles in 2014. A scoreline that emphatic often prompts talk of the collective clicking like never before, of teamwork triumphing. At Meadow Park that was true; the crisp instinctive passing, the movement of the midfield diamond, the high line and searing passes of the back three, made you drool. But there was a bigger story. An individual performance from the Dutch forward Vivianne Miedema that defies logic. By the 65th minute she had scored six goals and provided four assists. Yet she is a headline stealer who hates the headlines. \u201cI don\u2019t really think I\u2019ve played like that before,\u201d she said after her double hat-trick. \u201cI felt really good today and I was probably happier with my assists today. I felt really good and I\u2019m happy that I could help the team.\u201d Miedema is happier resting up for the next game than sitting alongside the footballing elite and being recognised as one of the best players in the world at the Ballon d\u2019Or awards. It is not just a shyness that prompts that attitude but an active dislike of individual awards. Ask her, as Arseblog\u2019s Tim Stillman did regarding her omission from the Fifpro World XI. \u201cI think we all know it\u2019s all about popularity and I don\u2019t post much on Instagram or Twitter, so that\u2019s probably what went wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about individual awards to be honest, but I think it\u2019s a joke.\u201d She had scored 22 goals in 20 games, 31 across all competitions. After eight league games this season she has 10 goals, 22 in all competitions. Atthe age of 23 she is the Netherlands\u2019 record goalscorer. She is fascinating to watch. The goals defy appearance. Miedema has a nonchalance that almost makes her look uninterested or lazy. It is a theme perpetuated by a dry wit and somewhat lackadaisical attitude to training and life in general. A photo of Miedema sitting on the floor, sunglasses on, in front of a group of Netherlands players powering away on exercise bikes drew amusement during the World Cup. Interviewers are often left bemused by her darkly honest sense of humour. Except she is anything but lazy.

Unless it manages to get both sides of the party out of the trenches and to take on new challenges with all its remaining strength, the SPD runs the risk of being swept away by new political dynamics. \u2022 Anke Hassel is professor of public policy at the Hertie School, Berlin",

Those views ultimately ended in a mass shooting and a meticulously assembled hitlist of 19 accomplished women he would have killed if not for a \u201clack of time\u201d. L\u00e9pine targeted Polytechnique specifically because the women there were pursuing careers in engineering \u2013 a discipline he believed should be reserved for men. Nathalie Provost was 23 when L\u00e9pine shot her. Four bullets from his legally obtained rifle entered her body and changed her life forever. L\u00e9pine had entered her classroom and sent the 50 men and nine women to opposite sides of the room. Then he ordered the men to leave. \u201cHe told us that we were there because he was against feminists,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI answered back, \u2018We are not feminists. We are just engineering students, and if you want to study at Polytechnique you just have to apply and you\u2019ll be welcomed.\u2019 And then he shot.\u201d Six of the nine women in that room were killed. Provost believes the same forces that radicalised the Polytechnique shooter were at work with Minassian and Alexandre Bissonnette, the young man who killed six people inside a Quebec City mosque in 2017. Both young men were radicalised online in communities that legitimized their hatred; in Bissonnette\u2019s case, his online search history revealed he had researched feminism before deciding to kill Muslims. A woman or girl is killed every 2.5 days in Canada, yet the issue went unaddressed during the country\u2019s 2019 federal election. Lalonde and M\u00e9lissa Blais, a Montreal university professor and expert on the Polytechnique shooting, both say that a major obstacle to solving the issue is a widespread unwillingness to call violence against women what it is: an act of hatred. \u201cMarc L\u00e9pine was not the last of the dinosaurs; it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s worrying. We absolutely need to renew our view of current forms of antifeminism, and to be able to speak about it without being afraid,\u201d said Blais. That\u2019s why she campaigned to have the city change a commemorative plaque hanging outside of a Montreal park honouring the women killed at Polytechnique. Instead of ambiguously reminding visitors to contemplate the \u201cvictims of the Polytechnique tragedy\u201d, the brand-new sign speaks in no uncertain terms: \u201cThis park is named in the memory of 14 women assassinated in an antifeminist attack.\u201d For Blais and Liz, it\u2019s critical to recognize that misogyny and antifeminism are often not ends in themselves, but rather strings that people can follow to the most extreme, violent forms of hatred. And there\u2019s no doubt that if L\u00e9pine existed at the same time as online hate groups and YouTube extremism, he would have used the internet to feed and shape his ideology and plan the shooting, said Liz. \u201cThe only difference now is that he would have live-streamed it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In 2000, the US Soccer Federation was on shaky financial ground. A <a href=\"https://www.ussoccer.com/governance/board-of-directors/business-plans\">couple of business plans</a> list ambitious ideas to build the sport in America while reining in expenses to balance against projected revenues around of $30m. The effort worked, and the sport\u2019s American overseers doubled their assets to $14m.</p> <p>As of March 2018, according to the Form 990 filing required of nonprofits, the federation\u2019s assets are $162.7m. Roughly a third of that money is from the one-time windfall of hosting the 2016 Copa America Centenario, but US Soccer still brought in more than $120m in revenue in the fiscal year ending 31 March 2018, the same fiscal year that the men\u2019s national team flopped in World Cup qualifying.</p> <p>So where is that revenue going? And where will those assets go? And can US Soccer even make substantial spending plans while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">facing lawsuits</a> that cost plenty of money to defend and may cost more to settle?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/24/usa-women-soccer-equal-pay-bonus-questions\">Does revenue explain the USWNT's World Cup bonus shortfall?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday in Chicago, the federation\u2019s board will tackle those questions in earnest.

She\u2019ll likely face John Motta, who has an outsider\u2019s reputation despite holding the VP job from 1998 to 2000 and serving on the federation board in recent years. The election won\u2019t attract the same frenzy as the 2018 free-for-all, but it will be a gauge of how members feel halfway through Cordeiro\u2019s first term.</p> <p>Also looming is a pivotal decision on a replacement for longtime CEO Dan Flynn, who saw the federation build that giant nest egg while maintaining the world\u2019s best women\u2019s soccer team, partnering with Major League Soccer from near-extinction to hundreds of millions of dollars in expansion fees, and having sporadic successes in men\u2019s soccer.</p> <p>But the men\u2019s team is fighting to regain the public\u2019s faith after missing out on the 2018 World Cup, youth soccer is stagnant, and the youth national teams are struggling (yes, even in the vaunted women\u2019s program). Naming a new CEO to tackle those problems and oversee new spending should have been easy \u2013 Flynn has been planning to retire for quite a while, and he had a longtime deputy who seemed ready to assume the role.

The federation has increased spending in several areas \u2013 referee programs, the US Open Cup, other national teams such as disability soccer and a new <a href=\"https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2019/09/us-womens-beach-soccer-national-team-to-compete-in-anoc-world-beach-games\">women\u2019s beach soccer team</a> \u2013 but they don\u2019t add up to tens of millions.

      "bodyText": "Claim John McDonnell claims a Labour government would save families more than \u00a36,700 a year. Background In a speech in Birmingham on Wednesday, the shadow chancellor will claim most households have been hit by the rising cost of living under the Tories. He will say households would save about \u00a36,700 a year on their utility bills, rail fares and childcare under a Labour government. It breaks down into savings of \u00a3559 on energy bills, \u00a3113 on water, \u00a3364 on broadband, \u00a32,194 on a pair of rail season tickets, \u00a32,941 per child on average for childcare, \u00a3108 on yearly prescription charges and \u00a3437 on free school meals. At the heart of the plan is Labour\u2019s renationalisation of mail, water, energy and rail, as well as the free public provision of broadband. Reality Much of the savings rely on nationalisation, though the exact price of taking utilities into public ownership has yet to be determined and the path to acquiring them might not be smooth. Labour says that parliament would decide, though questions remain. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that overpaying would be bad value for taxpayers\u2019 money, yet underpaying could damage international investment in Britain. Some of the Labour analysis stems from a Greenwich University report published last month, which recommended that a Labour government pay about \u00a330bn less than the combined market value of the water companies, energy firms and Royal Mail. Such a move could result in legal challenges from private investors. Business lobby groups and the Tories argue paying below market value would dent the value of pension funds, costing households money. Many investors are, however, based outside Britain, while pension and financial asset wealth is not evenly distributed. Efforts to assess the price Labour might pay have also been over-inflated. Public utilities are common across Europe, while scrapping dividends for private investors could enable cuts to bills. According to Greenwich University, almost \u00a36bn is paid in dividends each year that could be passed on in savings to consumers. Much, though, would depend on how efficiently the state can run them. Some of the savings depend on Labour hitting targets by 2030, rather than being available to households immediately. Labour says about \u00a3400 a year could be saved by upgrading the 27m homes in the UK to the highest energy-efficiency standards, a target it has set for 2030. However, experts warn such a plan would be extremely challenging. Around \u00a3364 relies on Labour bringing full-fibre broadband to every home in the country, another potentially difficult project with a target date of 2030. Verdict Nationalisation could save households money that would otherwise go to private investors, but is reliant on the smooth execution of Labour\u2019s plan. The party could face difficulties and unintended consequences, putting savings at risk. Some of the savings are also not open to families until 2030.",

I never said a word. When they finished singing they started throwing sausage rolls. It was the last show of the Christmas period so I said: \u2018I\u2019ve been Dave Johns. You\u2019ve been two weeks in the Maldives!\u2019 And I went on my holidays.\u201d</p> <p>Christmas gigs are dreaded by many comedians. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nish-kumar\">Nish Kumar</a> had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/03/nish-kumar-gets-frosty-reception-at-lords-taverners-charity-feast\">cut short</a> his unpaid performance at a charity do after his jokes about Conservative politicians and Brexit drew heckles. I was a standup for several years and the festive period was one of the reasons I chose to stop performing as my diary seemed to be full of unplayable venues. The worst gig was at a golf club where a man in a Santa hat threw peas at me throughout my set. All comedians have stories such as this.</p> <p>In the festive season, comedy clubs can get hijacked by audiences who see standup as on the periphery to their big night out with work. They\u2019re distracted, drunk and unaware of the etiquette. Some corporate gigs, such as an awards dinner, pay well but comedy clubs are not as flooded with funds as they were in the 90s when Johns was paid well enough to afford his Maldives trip. And comedy is often far from the audience\u2019s thoughts. \u201cMost of them want to chat and get off with Debbie from accounts,\u201d reckons Johns, who realised that these sorts of gigs weren\u2019t worth the cash boost and decided to refuse bookings years ago.</p> <p>The Jongleurs chain of comedy clubs, which <a href=\"https://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/10/17/38176/jongleurs_clubs_all_close\">went into administration</a> two years ago, were known for a bear-pit atmosphere and for welcoming Christmas work parties.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We would sometimes bet to see how long a comic would last on stage. We amused ourselves but they were never joyful \u2013 they were horrendous!\u201d Dave Johns, standup and star of the film I, Daniel Blake, is detailing his experiences of a string of lucrative but excruciating shows at Christmas time. \u201cThe minute I went on, 300 drunk people started singing I Will Survive,\u201d he adds. \u201cI stood on stage. I never said a word. When they finished singing they started throwing sausage rolls. It was the last show of the Christmas period so I said: \u2018I\u2019ve been Dave Johns. You\u2019ve been two weeks in the Maldives!\u2019 And I went on my holidays.\u201d Christmas gigs are dreaded by many comedians. Earlier this week, Nish Kumar had to cut short his unpaid performance at a charity do after his jokes about Conservative politicians and Brexit drew heckles. I was a standup for several years and the festive period was one of the reasons I chose to stop performing as my diary seemed to be full of unplayable venues. The worst gig was at a golf club where a man in a Santa hat threw peas at me throughout my set. All comedians have stories such as this. In the festive season, comedy clubs can get hijacked by audiences who see standup as on the periphery to their big night out with work. They\u2019re distracted, drunk and unaware of the etiquette. Some corporate gigs, such as an awards dinner, pay well but comedy clubs are not as flooded with funds as they were in the 90s when Johns was paid well enough to afford his Maldives trip. And comedy is often far from the audience\u2019s thoughts. \u201cMost of them want to chat and get off with Debbie from accounts,\u201d reckons Johns, who realised that these sorts of gigs weren\u2019t worth the cash boost and decided to refuse bookings years ago. The Jongleurs chain of comedy clubs, which went into administration two years ago, were known for a bear-pit atmosphere and for welcoming Christmas work parties. Standup circuit regular Maff Brown has a diary full of festive gigs, or \u201cloomers\u201d as he calls them, including one corporate gig where he will earn a four-figure sum. He worked regularly at Jongleurs. \u201cThey phoned me to say: \u2018It\u2019s not happening, we\u2019ve gone broke, but you\u2019re still getting paid.\u2019 I was delighted. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better situation!\u201d But at least one standup is celebrating this year. After success at the Edinburgh festival and with a recent appearance on Live at the Apollo and a Soho theatre run booked for next year, Jessica Fostekew can afford to turn down these sorts of gigs for the first time in an 11-year career. She did a Christmas night in her first week of standup. \u201cIt was a gig that\u2019s normally completely lovely,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was entirely taken over by 60 teachers.

After the runaway success of her directorial debut, The Babadook, Kent\u2019s colonial revenge drama drew controversy \u2013 and wide acclaim \u2013 for its confronting depiction of rape and violence during the frontier war massacres in Tasmania. The Nightingale already nabbed two awards at the Aactas\u2019 first celebration earlier in the week: for best casting and best supporting actress for Magnolia Maymuru. Kent was one of many winners who did not attend the ceremony; Uncle Jim Everett, a Tasmanian Indigenous elder who consulted on the film, accepted on her behalf. Aisling Franciosi won best lead actress for her role in the film. A tearful Stan Grant accepted the award for best documentary for The Australian Dream, directed by Daniel Gordon. Grant, who wrote the screenplay and features in the film, paid tribute to its subject, the former AFL player Adam Goodes, for having the courage to go through some of his life\u2019s darkest moments for the film. \u201cThis was not just about Adam Goodes,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt was about the two centuries that led up to the booing of Adam Goodes.\u201d Deborah Mailman took out the first Aacta award of the night for best lead in a television drama for her role in ABC political series Total Control, which also won best drama. Already a five-time Aacta/AFI winner, including for her supporting role in Mystery Road last year, Mailman said this was a particularly significant win given it was her first in the category. \u201cI\u2019m actually really emotional, this show has meant everything to me, it\u2019s my first lead role in a drama series,\u201d Mailman said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing in terms of the diversity of people, I\u2019ve had so many people stop me on the street, saying that they\u2019re loving the show, that they\u2019re watching it \u2013 it\u2019s been fantastic.\u201d Mailman\u2019s co-star Rachel Griffiths won best supporting actress for her part in the series, but it was Lambs of God that dominated this year\u2019s TV categories, receiving eight awards in total, including for best miniseries, best direction, best cinematography, best original score and best sound. Sam Neill was visibly emotional when he was honoured with the Longford Lyell lifetime achievement award \u2013 with Meryl Streep, Jane Campion, Nicole Kidman and Liam Neeson among those offering tributes. \u201cThe lifetime thing sounds a little terminal and I hope they don\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end because I\u2019m not done, I would still like to put a few more runs on the board,\u201d Neill said. ABC parenting comedy The Letdown won in two categories \u2013 best comedy series, and best performance in a comedy, for its lead and co-creator Alison Bell. Damon Herriman, who broke Aacta history with the most nominations across four different performance categories in a year, won best lead actor for the film Judy &amp; Punch, saying it was the best script he had ever read. Herriman was twice nominated as best supporting actor in a TV drama for his roles in Lambs of God and Mr Inbetween, but was beaten by Richard Roxburgh for The Hunting. Best lead actor in a TV drama went to Herriman\u2019s Mr Inbetween co-star Scott Ryan; the ABC\u2019s You Can\u2019t Ask That won best factual entertainment program, and Parasite continued its early sweep of awards season, winning best Asian film for its director, Bong Joon-ho.

The majority of the Labor-Greens dominated committee want the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to investigate the energy minister and treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s handling of the grasslands saga after finding it amounted to a major breach of ministerial standards. \u201cIt is inconceivable that Mr Taylor was unaware that he and his family stood to benefit directly from his actions,\u201d the interim report of the Senate\u2019s faunal extinctions inquiry states. It was tabled on Wednesday with backing from the Greens and Labor, but not from government senators, who said the opposition and the Greens had used the inquiry to make \u201cparty political attacks\u201d. In a dissenting report, Coalition senators said the \u201cevidence provided by the department confirms Mr Taylor had acted appropriately and in accordance with the rules.\u201d \u201cIn submitting this dissenting report, Coalition senators note and deplore the blatant abuse and misuse of the Senate\u2019s committee process.\u201d They said the Senate had voted multiple times against holding an inquiry into the matters detailed in the report. In July, government and One Nation senators blocked two attempts to launch an inquiry into the conduct of Frydenberg and Taylor. \u201cIt is disappointing that Labor and the Greens have seen fit to ignore the will of the Senate to hijack this inquiry for a clearly partisan political purpose,\u201d they said. The government senators said Taylor had made detailed statements to the House of Representatives and the department had confirmed compliance matters were not discussed at the March 2017 meeting. The report examines whether Taylor, when he was the assistant minister for cities, acted improperly when he asked for briefings on the listing protections for the critically endangered natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. Taylor\u2019s family are major landholders on the Monaro plains, where the majority of these ecological communities are located, and at the time a company in which Taylor and his brothers had interests was under investigation by the federal environment department for poisoning grasslands at Corrowong. The company, Jam Land, faces potential fines of more than $10m if proved. Taylor has a shareholding through his family company Gufee and his brother Richard is a director. A Guardian Australia investigation revealed Taylor requested and was given briefings from the environment department on the grasslands protections in March 2017 and that compliance officers were asked to attend by the office of Frydenberg, the then environment minister. Frydenberg\u2019s office later sought advice on whether protections for the grasslands could be weakened and whether that could be done without making such a decision public. In its report, the committee considered evidence given by the department in public hearings, as well as email correspondence between the department and Frydenberg\u2019s office, which was released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws. \u201cIn considering the evidence, the committee has reached the conclusion that Mr Taylor consciously used his position as an MP and minister to make representations to minister Frydenberg that were aimed at affecting the outcome of the Jam Land compliance case,\u201d the committee states. \u201cIn doing so, Mr Taylor repeatedly failed to disclose his family and personal financial interests in Jam Land in an appropriate and transparent manner, not only to minister Frydenberg and his department but also the parliament.\u201d The committee said Taylor\u2019s behaviour constituted \u201cclear breaches\u201d of ministerial standards. It also noted that Frydenberg made no declaration to his department about Taylor\u2019s interest in Jam Land. \u201cEvidence indicates that Mr Taylor did not only fail to disclose his vested interests, but also sought to use his ministerial office and parliamentary connections to obtain special treatment for himself and his family, which is not offered to any other landholder in Australia,\u201d the report states. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It says that Taylor\u2019s claims he was acting in the interest of farmers in his electorate appear to be overstated and that individuals Taylor claimed had raised concerns, such as an unnamed farmer near Yass, \u201chave never been identified\u201d. In addition to recommending both ministers be investigated, the committee said Morrison should \u201cenforce disclosure obligations\u201d with respect to Taylor\u2019s personal and pecuniary interests and \u201cremind\u201d ministers that their office \u201cmust not be used to advance private interests\u201d. The committee has also recommended the national audit office conduct a performance audit of compliance actions undertaken by the environment department. Forty-one investigations into alleged breaches of environment law were launched by the department in 2016-17. The investigation into Jam Land has not concluded and is one of only four cases launched that year that are still ongoing. In their dissenting report, the Coalition senators labelled the recommendations blatantly partisan. \u201cThe evidence provided by the department confirms that Mr Taylor has acted appropriately and in accordance with the rules. Labor and Greens senators continuing to repeat claims and assertions for partisan political reasons do not change this fact,\u201d it said. \u201cCoalition senators deplore this inappropriate misuse of a Senate committee with a valid environmental terms of reference to be subverted for partisan political purposes.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Throughout most millennia, people were too busy avoiding sudden death themselves to worry about which sports teams made the playoffs. In those long years, a good season meant food. \u201cTrack\u201d meant food and \u201cfield\u201d meant food. Rooting, of course, meant a carrot. Prehistoric peoples didn\u2019t waste words on sports, let alone billions of their hard-earned dollars.</p> <p>Skipping over ancient times, when amphitheaters teemed with fans of blood sport, a survey of athletic events lands on the gaggles of spectators in more recent centuries who watched local athletes play games on the village green. It was in the late 1700s that horse racing and boxing led the way into professional sports, producing stars known far and wide. Those sports then veered into the even longer history of cheating, as professionals were readily presumed to fix outcomes. Rich people tugged on the ethics from the other direction by encouraging amateurism. The assumption was that while an amateur <em>might </em>cheat, a professional did so as a matter of course. Not every time or all the time, but the possibility was in the air. A professional would weigh the factors.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.baseball-almanac.com/ruletown.shtml\">Townball</a> was one of the sports seen on the village greens, having been played by either that name or the more modern \u201cbaseball\u201d for at least 500 years. It is apparently intrinsic to human physiology to throw a ball and hit a ball, catch a ball, chase a grounder and miss the cutoff. In the mid-1800s teams represented cities and played one another. That was one new wrinkle, and after the Civil War there was another: professionals took over. One of them was a Philadelphia-born pitcher named <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/devliji01.shtml\">Jim Devlin</a>, who was born in obscurity in 1849 and died in oblivion in 1883. In between, he was a man of his century.</p> <p>Devlin\u2019s education had been rudimentary. He was unsophisticated but well-liked, as he established a solid reputation as a pitcher. His trademark was the toothpick wagging around in his mouth while he played. Hired by the Louisville Grays, Devlin pitched 685 innings in his first full season, with an earned run average of 1.50. A pitcher with a pale version of those stats today is considered a beast and will receive at least $12m per year. The word in that assessment that would have made Devlin jealous is not \u201cmillion,\u201d however. It is \u201creceive.\u201d In 1876 he was promised a fantastic amount of money, $2,000 a year. Except that the Louisville team abruptly stopped paying its players midway through the season. Devlin tried to switch to St Louis, but thanks to rules instituted by the brand new National League, he was bound to Louisville. The world is not an excuse. However, the one in which Devlin arose to play ball was rife with cheats. </p> <p>In the summer of 1876, a Brooklyn bookie by the name of Fred Seibert tried with his partner, a man named McCloud, to enlist Jim Devlin in throwing a game or two.</p> <p>Devlin flatly rejected Seibert\u2019s overture. The next year, though, on a road trip to New York City, he was introduced to McCloud by the newsstand operator at the hotel in which he was staying. Devlin changed his mind and with that, the Grays lost to Cincinnati ... and then Indianapolis. And so on in the summer of \u201977. In Devlin\u2019s defense, cheating on baseball teams wasn\u2019t well-coordinated. Others on the Grays were also known or suspected to be manipulating the games. Then again, there was the opposing team and whatever its players were doing for whichever bookies <em>they </em>secretly worked for. The wonder is that anyone knew for sure which way to run on the bases.</p> <p>Whoever made it happen, the vaunted Grays blew an enormous lead in the standings and lost the pennant. An investigation followed. None of that presented a new chapter in the short history of professional baseball. Following the usual script, Devlin humbly confessed, leaving out few if any details. Other suspected Grays did the same. Devlin then awaited his fate, anticipating that he\u2019d be sacked from the Grays and go on to St Louis, his heart\u2019s desire. He had reason for optimism when the matter was ultimately handed over to his good friend William Hulbert, the new president of the two-year-old National League. A bearish Chicagoan with a thriving brokerage, Hulbert, quite significantly, hadn\u2019t been involved in baseball before buying into the White Stockings as a civic gesture. To him, the Louisville scandal had absolutely nothing to do with friendship. On the contrary, it presented an opportunity \u201cto strike an effective blow.\u201d With great fanfare, Hulbert expelled Devlin and the others \u2013 not just from the Grays, but from every team in the League and not just for the season, but forever. </p> <p>That was it. Forever.</p> <p>The others complained, but soon eased past baseball into regular jobs. Devlin, however, was affected more deeply. For two years, a man with subpar attainments in almost every field had been called the best of the best for something. It barely matters what it was, because as of 15 December 1877, it was gone. Though released from the narrow world of baseball into the wider world, Devlin responded as though he couldn\u2019t move: a fox in a trap, kicking out and writhing without ceasing, even though the only one he was hurting was himself. He tried to express the circumstances of his cheating and the ways that he was different, but when he did, he was using the language of all that he had known before. Baseball wasn\u2019t going to speak that language anymore. He swore that when he promised never to cheat again, he was telling the <em>absolute </em>truth. When it comes to cheating, though, truth isn\u2019t absolute \u2013 a fact that William Hulbert, for one, chose not to ignore.</p> <p>Devlin wrote tortured letters to Hulbert for the rest of his life; every day, according to some reports. Albert Spalding, <a href=\"https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b99355e0\">later known for his sporting goods company</a>, started as a ballplayer and happened to be in Hulbert\u2019s outer office sometime after the scandal:</p> <p><em>The outer door opened and a sorry-looking specimen entered. It was midwinter and very cold, but the poor fellow had no overcoat. His dust covered garments were threadbare and seedy. His shoes were worn through with much tramping, while the red flesh showing in places indicated that if stockings were present they afforded not much protection ... The visitor passed me without a glance in my direction. His eyes were fixed upon the occupant of the farther room. He walked straight to the chair where Mr Hulbert sat, and, dropping to his knees at the big man\u2019s feet, lifted his eyes in prayerful entreaty, while his frame shook with the emotion so long restrained ... The man was Devlin, one of the Louisville players. The situation, as he kneeled there in abject humiliation, was beyond the realm of pathos. It was a scene of heartrending tragedy. Devlin was in tears, Hulbert was in tears, and if the mists of a tearful sympathy filled my eyes I have no excuse.</em></p> <p>Hulbert pulled a $50 bill from his pocket, gave it to Devlin, and with an eye grown steely sent him away with the assurance that he could never and would never be forgiven for having \u201csold a game.\u201d Devlin returned home to Philadelphia, where he kept on writing letters to Hulbert. Living at poverty\u2019s very end, Devlin died at 33. Spalding was correct, the whole affair, all the way along, was a tableau of heartrending tragedy; the only question was which kind.</p> <p>Devlin\u2019s story was often told during the first 25 years of the National League. He provided the dividing line and if he didn\u2019t exactly die for the sins of baseball cheaters before and since, he certainly served as a vivid warning. His case continues to present its mixture of triumph and regret. Because the rules, or their enforcement, changed under his feet, one is tempted to feel sorry for the poor guy. He was a martyr, but one of convenience, not conscience. On that point, his fate was epic as his spirit toppled into dust.</p> <p>In the present day, Devlin is rarely remembered in baseball, but across the arc of cheating history, he lives on as the symbol of every honest effort to give a reset to the world (or any slice of it). He didn\u2019t get a second chance when he was caught because of the prevailing opinion that a cheater is stamped for life, unable to resist the temptation to betray again. Since the dawn of man, only two routes have been available to those wishing to start the world over as a haven free from cheating. The first is to get rid of the cheater. That was Hulbert\u2019s verdict for Devlin. The second route is to rehabilitate the cheater.</p> <p>\u2022 Excerpted from <a href=\"https://www.twelvebooks.com/titles/j-m-fenster/cheaters-always-win/9781538732618/\">Cheaters Always Win: The Story of America</a><em><strong> </strong></em>by JM Fenster.

      "body": "<p>Nora arrived from north-east Africa in 2001 when she was 17. Desperate for their daughter to escape civil war, Nora\u2019s family managed to sell enough of their valuables to buy her a one-way ticket to the UK. Not long after her 18th birthday, her application for asylum was rejected for the fifth time. Without a work permit, any form of identification or state support, she became homeless for the first 10 years of her adult life. About five years in, she realised that her only means of survival was to return to the place that had jeopardised it in the first place. But when Nora arrived at the embassy, she was told that she could not return without the relevant asylum status proving where she came from \u2013 the very status she had been denied. It turned out that the Home Office was not telling her to \u201cgo home\u201d. They were telling Nora to disappear, condemning her to a life of statelessness and invisibility.</p> <p>This is just one of many raw experiences that Maya Goodfellow sensitively navigates with explosive effect in <em>Hostile Environment</em>. From Winston Churchill to Windrush and Tony Blair to Brexit, this archival critique and collection of interviews is one of the most profound deconstructions of UK immigration policy that exists.</p> <p>Goodfellow teaches us that racism does not just arise out of thin air. When a country gets high on the global enslavement of black and brown people, the least you can expect is a stinking colonial hangover. Clement Attlee signed the 1948 British Nationality Act; nationals of British colonies were given the right to live in Britain as citizens. Hailed by many as an end to the colonial treatment of labourers, in reality this was a desperate attempt to hold together what remained of the British empire. Citizenship was extended primarily as a means of facilitating free movement between \u201cold\u201d Commonwealth countries \u2013 the \u201cWhite Dominions\u201d such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

      "bodyText": "Nora arrived from north-east Africa in 2001 when she was 17. Desperate for their daughter to escape civil war, Nora\u2019s family managed to sell enough of their valuables to buy her a one-way ticket to the UK. Not long after her 18th birthday, her application for asylum was rejected for the fifth time. Without a work permit, any form of identification or state support, she became homeless for the first 10 years of her adult life. About five years in, she realised that her only means of survival was to return to the place that had jeopardised it in the first place. But when Nora arrived at the embassy, she was told that she could not return without the relevant asylum status proving where she came from \u2013 the very status she had been denied. It turned out that the Home Office was not telling her to \u201cgo home\u201d. They were telling Nora to disappear, condemning her to a life of statelessness and invisibility. This is just one of many raw experiences that Maya Goodfellow sensitively navigates with explosive effect in Hostile Environment. From Winston Churchill to Windrush and Tony Blair to Brexit, this archival critique and collection of interviews is one of the most profound deconstructions of UK immigration policy that exists. Goodfellow teaches us that racism does not just arise out of thin air. When a country gets high on the global enslavement of black and brown people, the least you can expect is a stinking colonial hangover. Clement Attlee signed the 1948 British Nationality Act; nationals of British colonies were given the right to live in Britain as citizens.

By the time Theresa May said she wanted to make Britain a \u201chostile environment\u201d for those whom she called \u201cillegal migrants\u201d, the legislation was already in place. Goodfellow forcefully dismantles the idea that the Windrush scandal was a deviance from the norm. Rather, it was the latest chapter in a longstanding quest to \u201cKeep England White\u201d. In explaining how the history of modern Britain is, in part, a history of white supremacy, her book is both brave and powerful.

      "bodyText": "The embattled emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, says he has established \u201can administrative point of contact\u201d with the New South Wales police, but has declined to say whether he has handed over relevant metadata and download logs to Strike Force Garrad. Taylor told parliament on Wednesday he had not yet been interviewed by detectives investigating a doctored City of Sydney council document but on Wednesday reported his office had established an administrative point of contact with the NSW police. \u201cI will always cooperate with matters of this sort,\u201d the minister said. Taylor said he did not intend to make any further comment \u201cwhile police inquiries are continuing\u201d. The City of Sydney council has confirmed the lord mayor, Clover Moore, has been asked to provide a statement. A council spokesman said: \u201cShe will cooperate with the police request. We have nothing further to add at this time.\u201d The government declined on Wednesday to comply with a Senate order to produce evidence that the document with the inflated travel figures was downloaded from the council website. Taylor also declined to provide that evidence to the House on Wednesday. The minister said he had tabled a statement in the House of Representatives last week, and he categorically rejected Labor\u2019s \u201csmear\u201d. \u201cI reject absolutely the scurrilous accusations of those opposite,\u201d Taylor said. Taylor has denied consistently and categorically that either he, or anyone in his office, altered the City of Sydney document to inflate travel expenditure as a means of attacking Moore. Taylor has said the document with the incorrect numbers was obtained from the council website. But the council has produced evidence showing that its publicly available annual reports has only ever contained accurate figures. Metadata and screenshots from the council\u2019s content management system showed the annual reports on its website had not been changed since they were uploaded with the accurate figures 11 months ago. The differing accounts prompted Labor to refer the matter to NSW police, asking for an investigation into whether a forgery had been created to influence the mayor in her public duties. The Australian on Wednesday named one of Taylor\u2019s staff, Josh Manuatu, a former Young Liberal president, as the person who allegedly obtained false travel figures about Clover Moore and sent them to the Daily Telegraph. Guardian Australia has no evidence that Manuatu was involved in the incident in question, but there has been talk around the government that he might have been the staffer who handled the material. The letter that went to Moore on 30 September went out under the minister\u2019s signature, and Taylor has already issued an unreserved apology to the lord mayor. \u201cIt is now clear to me that the correspondence I sent you on 29 September 2019 included numbers that were not correct,\u201d Taylor wrote to Moore. \u201cGiven this, I regret not clarifying those figures with you before writing, and relying on those figures in media commentary, I apologise unreservedly.\u201d Manuatu remains on Taylor\u2019s staff. In response to the naming of the staffer, Taylor\u2019s office repeated what the minister has said consistently. \u201cI reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the document in question.\u201d In the Senate on Wednesday night, the Labor frontbencher Murray Watt pointed to the news report in the Australian. He declared Taylor needed to take responsibility, and not \u201cblame [his] staff\u201d. \u201cIt is time to show a shred of dignity, do the right thing and resign,\u201d Watt said. \u201cIf he won\u2019t, the prime minister must finally show an ounce of leadership and sack this disgraced minister.\u201d",

Dave Merritt wrote in the Guardian that the death of his son, who worked as a coordinator for the Learning Together prison rehabilitation and education programme, run by the University of Cambridge\u2019s Institute of Criminology, was being used to reinforce the world-view his son had fought against. \u201cUnlike many of us, Jack did not just go to work. He lived and breathed fire in his pursuit of a better world for all humanity, particularly those most in need,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Jack could comment on his death \u2013 and the tragic incident on Friday 29 November \u2013 he would be livid. We would see him ticking it over in his mind before a word was uttered between us. Jack would understand the political timing with visceral clarity.\u201d The family of Saskia Jones, also a volunteer on the programme, praised her for having a \u201cgreat passion\u201d for supporting victims of crime. \u201cShe was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be,\u201d a family statement said. Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, attended a vigil on Monday in memory of the victims at Guildhall Yard in central London, near the scene of the attack. The attacker, who had been living in Stafford, was given permission to travel to London by the police and probation service. He was wearing a fake suicide vest and was shot dead by police on London Bridge after he was tackled by members of the public, including ex-prisoners from the conference.",

Then a much larger number saying they are old men who were huge decades before Eilish was even born! What\u2019s more interesting, perhaps, is why she (and most other 17-year-olds) hasn\u2019t heard of them, whereas she had heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/cyndi-lauper\">Cyndi Lauper</a>, and every teenager I know (I\u2019ve got a 16-year-old and a 19-year-old) has some selection of long-departed heritage acts that they adore.</p> <p>Often knowledge of older music comes through parents (my kids, I\u2019m afraid, do know who Van Halen are; my son is irritated that he doesn\u2019t know any <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/27/internet-guide-oasis-swearing-brothers-gallagher\">Oasis</a> songs because I\u2019ve never played them, but all his friends do), but that has always been the way. Other music survives because it continues to talk across generations, and not necessarily because of its greatness \u2013 more because it is still part of a wider cultural narrative. And, looking at the sphere in which Van Halen exist \u2013 rock music \u2013 you can see that most clearly, perhaps when you look at the bands who can fill stadiums with crowds in which there are lots of teenagers and who still get booked to headline festivals for those same teenagers: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/foofighters\">Foo Fighters</a>, the double bill of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/greenday\">Green Day</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/weezer\">Weezer</a> that is touring next year; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/redhotchilipeppers\">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/quiz/2015/jan/27/popandrock-punk\">Blink-182</a> (when they\u2019re all talking to each other), and in the way it\u2019s not just the old folks who turn out to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/liam-gallagher\">Liam Gallagher</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/05/noel-gallagher-i-liked-my-mum-until-she-gave-birth-to-liam\">Noel Gallagher</a> or U2. I\u2019ve never seen Pearl Jam, so I don\u2019t know whether they can still bring out a younger audience, but I wouldn\u2019t bet against it.</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting is that, with rock music at least, the bands who have a place in the consciousness of a younger audience tend to be those who postdate the rise of \u201calternative\u201d music, or those who, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/u2\">U2</a> and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, had their roots in the alternative music of an earlier generation.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfTampjlba8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DfTampjlba8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Billie Eilish and Green Day\u2019s Billie Joe Armstrong interview one another for Rolling Stone.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>One might expect that streaming culture, by making all music available to everyone, would have revived lots of bands who were hugely popular in the past.

More than 100 members of Congress, dozens of civil rights groups and at least 130,800 others have called on Miller to step down, or be fired, but the White House, and the broader Republican party, has still supported Miller after it was revealed he promoted racist fears such as a conspiracy theory about the demographic replacement of white people in America. Ruth Ben-Ghiat, who studies the history of fascism in Europe, said Miller was safe in the White House because he was the perfect combination of ideology and behind-the-scenes personality to appease Trump, an \u201cattention-hungry leader\u201d pushing far-right policies. \u201cMiller is a quiet extremist and they are the most dangerous kind,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. A series of reports released by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) last month revealed the White House aide endorsing white nationalist websites and books in emails to a writer at Breitbart and injecting that agenda into the website. The architect of many Trump administration immigration policies, Miller has a powerful influence in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), where he has helped quietly reshape US immigration policy through small bureaucratic changes, as well as big policies such as the Muslim ban, which was pushed out without undergoing the traditional review process. Miller ascended to the White House as the Republican party abandons moderate positions in favor of appealing to the fringe-right figures stacked in the presidential administration. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for Americans to get their head around this kind of dismaying idea, that those emails are positive for the people Trump wants to please,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. One of the only Republicans to criticize Miller after the email scandal was the Utah senator Mitt Romney. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear him more fully describe his involvement with that movement,\u201d Romney told HuffPost when asked about Miller\u2019s ties to white nationalism. \u201cI know the president gets to choose who\u2019s around him, but I don\u2019t think that reflects as well as it might.\u201d The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), an advocacy group for American Muslims, was one of the dozens of civil rights groups to call for Miller\u2019s resignation in the wake of the email scandal.

In 2016, Trump appointed Steve Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, as White House chief strategist, despite Bannon\u2019s website being associated with efforts to preserve \u201cwhite identity\u201d and defend \u201cwestern values\u201d. Trump\u2019s former deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka was photographed wearing a medal from Vit\u00e9zi Rend, a group with historical links to Nazi Germany and the murder of Jews during the Holocaust. Gorka claimed that he only wore the medal to honour his father. Like Bannon, he no longer works in the White House.

His staying power is that the president liked his anti-immigrant programs and shares his white supremacist beliefs.\u201d This administration has also shown itself to be nearly immune to criticism. \u201cSomeone who is so overtly white supremacist and promotes such draconian, anti-immigrant, anti-person-of-color policies could not have survived in a Bush or Reagan administration,\u201d said McCaw. Miller\u2019s continued presence in the White House has led some to raise broader questions about what it means for the United States. The New Jersey Star-Ledger\u2019s editorial board wrote an opinion piece calling for Miller\u2019s resignation last week, conceding that Trump \u201cis sure to disregard this advice\u201d and adding: \u201cWhen his presidency finally comes to an end, and its political cult is deprogrammed, let\u2019s hope that basic standards of decency are revived in North America.\u201d In a segment called Fire Stephen Miller Right F**king Now, late-night television host Samantha Bee, was just as blunt: \u201cIf we can\u2019t all agree that a white supremacist has no business in the White House, then we should probably just turn out the lights on this grand American experiment.\u201d",

Obama, he said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t sell\u201d it.</p> \n<p>In fact the Obama administration offered the weapon to Turkey repeatedly but Erdo\u011fan refused because the US deal did not include the Patriot\u2019s underlying technology.</p> \n<p>After Trump\u2019s defence of the Turkish position, Macron interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s their own decision,\u201d he said of Turkey, adding that Europe had also offered to sell Erdo\u011fan an air-defence system. \u201cEven having a European option, totally compliant with Nato, they decided not to be compliant with Nato.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump then asked Macron whether he would take any of the foreign fighters that America had captured in Syria and Iraq. Trump said \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of captured fighters in Syria under lock and key, mainly from Europe. Would you like some nice Isis fighters? I could give them to you. You can take everyone you want.\u201d</p> \n<p>When Macron replied in a generality about the future status of Isis terrorists, Trump said: \u201cThat is why he is such a great politician. That is one of the greatest non-answers I have heard and that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the tense exchanges continued Macron said: \u201cLet\u2019s be serious. It is true you have fighters coming from Europe. But it\u2019s a minority problem of the overall problem we have. And I think the number one priority because it is not yet finished is to get rid of Isis.\u201d</p> \n<p>At an earlier press conference Trump had been ruder about Macron, saying his remarks about Nato being brain dead were \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d comments.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s insulting to a lot of different forces,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go around making statements like that about Nato. It\u2019s very disrespectful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has himself once called Nato obsolete.</p> \n<p>Macron has argued ever since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/11/syria-turkey-conflict-kurds-border-fighting-trump-deaths\">Turkish invasion of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/11/syria-turkey-conflict-kurds-border-fighting-trump-deaths\">north-east Syria in October </a>that the move was a disastrous distraction from the continuing priority of defeating Isis. He was also furious that the US started to withdraw all its remaining 500 troops from the area, effectively handing over airbases to Russia.</p> \n<p>In an attempt to show his solidarity with the Syrian Kurds, Macron has also hosted political leaders of the Syrian YPD in Paris, praising them for the sacrifices they had made to defeat Isis.</p> \n<p>Although Trump frequently praises Erdo\u011fan, other members of the administration are more critical. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, in an interview with Reuters agreed with Macron that Nato cannot label the YPD as a terrorist group. He said: \u201cThe message to Turkey \u2026 is we need to move forward on these response plans and it can\u2019t be held up by their own particular concerns,\u201d Esper said as he flew to London.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlliance unity, alliance readiness, means that you focus on the bigger issues \u2013 the bigger issue being the readiness of the [Nato] alliance. And not everybody\u2019s willing to sign up to their agenda. Not everybody sees the threats that they see.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nato disunity was on full display on the opening day of the alliance\u2019s summit in London as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, accused Turkey of colluding with Islamic State proxies while Donald Trump described Macron\u2019s criticisms of Nato\u2019s \u201cbrain death\u201d as insulting and \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for his part threatened again to veto Nato\u2019s defence plan for the Baltics unless Nato endorsed its own assessment that Syrian Kurdish fighters on Turkey\u2019s borders were terrorists, a definition that Macron and the Pentagon rejected. Trump also kept up his demand that \u201cdelinquent\u201d Nato states boost their defence spending, warning if they did not do so he would consider imposing US trade sanctions. The sense of disarray, reflecting wider differences about Nato\u2019s future post-cold war purpose, emerged through a series of revealing rolling press conferences hosted by Trump. Late on Tuesday, in a further sign of disunity, footage emerged from a Buckingham Palace reception of leaders including Macron, the British summit host, Boris Johnson, and the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau appearing to mock Trump\u2019s lengthy media appearances. Johnson largely kept a low profile, but convened a meeting in Downing Street in an effort to forge a common European-Turkish approach to the crisis in north-east Syria where tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds have been displaced because of the October invasion by Turkey and its proxies. Macron\u2019s original condemnation of Nato\u2019s \u201cbrain death\u201d stemmed from his anger at the lack of any Turkish cooperation with the rest of Nato over the invasion. Only Trump was consulted; he gave a green light that led to a massive political backlash in the US. Macron on Tuesday repeatedly warned that Isis was making a comeback in Syria because of the Turkish invasion since it had weakened the mainly Kurdish Syrian Defence Forces, including the YPD fighters, that have formed the backbone of the fight against Isis. At one point Macron accused Turkey of sometimes working with Isis proxies. Macron said he supported Nato developing wider goals including combating terrorism but said: \u201cI am sorry we do not have the same definition of terrorism around the table. When I look at Turkey, they now are fighting against those who fight with us, who fought with us, shoulder to shoulder, against Isis. And sometimes they work with Isis proxies.\u201d Turkey has to end its ambiguities towards these groups, he said. He added: \u201cI understand they now want to block all the declarations of this summit unless we agree their definition of terrorism. It is not our definition.\u201d The French president asked how it was possible to be a member of the Nato alliance and for Turkey to purchase the Russian S-400 air defence system. \u201cTechnically it is not possible,\u201d he said. Macron, in common with most Nato states\u2019 leaders, maintains that a Russian defence system inside Nato will expose its military hardware, including the F-35 fighter jets, to Russian military intelligence. Pressed by a reporter about whether the US was going to sanction Turkey for buying the S-400 as the US Congress was demanding, Trump said he was looking at the issue. He then claimed, incorrectly, that Turkey had been forced into looking at the S-400 because Barack Obama had refused to let Turkey buy the US patriot defence system. \u201cTurkey for a long period of time wanted very much to buy the Patriot system,\u201d Trump said. Obama, he said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t sell\u201d it. In fact the Obama administration offered the weapon to Turkey repeatedly but Erdo\u011fan refused because the US deal did not include the Patriot\u2019s underlying technology. After Trump\u2019s defence of the Turkish position, Macron interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s their own decision,\u201d he said of Turkey, adding that Europe had also offered to sell Erdo\u011fan an air-defence system. \u201cEven having a European option, totally compliant with Nato, they decided not to be compliant with Nato.\u201d Trump then asked Macron whether he would take any of the foreign fighters that America had captured in Syria and Iraq. Trump said \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of captured fighters in Syria under lock and key, mainly from Europe. Would you like some nice Isis fighters? I could give them to you. You can take everyone you want.\u201d When Macron replied in a generality about the future status of Isis terrorists, Trump said: \u201cThat is why he is such a great politician. That is one of the greatest non-answers I have heard and that\u2019s OK.\u201d As the tense exchanges continued Macron said: \u201cLet\u2019s be serious. It is true you have fighters coming from Europe. But it\u2019s a minority problem of the overall problem we have. And I think the number one priority because it is not yet finished is to get rid of Isis.\u201d At an earlier press conference Trump had been ruder about Macron, saying his remarks about Nato being brain dead were \u201cvery, very nasty\u201d comments. \u201cI think that\u2019s insulting to a lot of different forces,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go around making statements like that about Nato. It\u2019s very disrespectful.\u201d Trump has himself once called Nato obsolete. Macron has argued ever since the Turkish invasion of north-east Syria in October that the move was a disastrous distraction from the continuing priority of defeating Isis. He was also furious that the US started to withdraw all its remaining 500 troops from the area, effectively handing over airbases to Russia. In an attempt to show his solidarity with the Syrian Kurds, Macron has also hosted political leaders of the Syrian YPD in Paris, praising them for the sacrifices they had made to defeat Isis. Although Trump frequently praises Erdo\u011fan, other members of the administration are more critical. The US defence secretary, Mark Esper, in an interview with Reuters agreed with Macron that Nato cannot label the YPD as a terrorist group. He said: \u201cThe message to Turkey \u2026 is we need to move forward on these response plans and it can\u2019t be held up by their own particular concerns,\u201d Esper said as he flew to London. \u201cAlliance unity, alliance readiness, means that you focus on the bigger issues \u2013 the bigger issue being the readiness of the [Nato] alliance. And not everybody\u2019s willing to sign up to their agenda. Not everybody sees the threats that they see.\u201d",

He now wants to go further, with another app that will allow users to scan thousands of non-CQLP products and check them against the cooperative\u2019s standards, as assessed by volunteer panels of expert consumers. Even if the process can necessarily only work with firms that agree to it, many \u2013 given the brand\u2019s success \u2013 appear likely to do so. Long-term, Chabanne hopes the app will change big food\u2019s behaviour. \u201cThey will learn clearly, unambiguously, what consumers want and expect of their products,\u201d Chabanne said. \u201cIt\u2019s a logical next step, because what drives CQLP is this goodwill army of consumers, hundreds and thousands of active volunteer ambassadors, who share, inform, pass on, visit stores, talk to managers, hang out with producers \u2013 who, basically, have decided, together, that things have to change.\u201d This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

Thanks for following along. </p> <p>It\u2019s been <strong>another messy day</strong>. Many say the <strong>medevac repeal</strong> has made it one of <strong>parliament\u2019s darkest</strong>. </p> <p>If it helps, I\u2019ve been silently chanting \u2018one more day, one more day, one more day\u2019 for the past three hours. It\u2019s no real comfort, to be honest. But it does busy the mind. Feel free to give it a go. Don\u2019t blame me if you go insane. </p> <p>This is what we learned today: </p> <ul> <li>The government won <strong>Jacqui Lambie\u2019s vote using unknown promises</strong>, thereby securing the passage of its medevac repeal bill. We suspect they promised to give new energy to their efforts to resettle the refugees on Nauru. But the <strong>repeal means the effective end of doctor-led decisions</strong> on healthcare transfers for asylum seekers and refugees. The decision has been condemned by GPs, refugee advocates, human rights groups, the opposition, the Greens and Centre Alliance. There is real anger that the vote took place without anyone truly knowing what the Lambie-Coalition deal actually entailed.</li> <li>On the <strong>Angus Taylor</strong> front, there was an unconfirmed report in the Australian naming one of Taylor\u2019s staff, <strong>Josh Manuatu</strong>, as the person who obtained false travel figures about Clover Moore and sent them to the Daily Telegraph. The Guardian also reported that <strong>police have asked Clover Moore for a statement</strong>, and Taylor revealed in question time that he had set up a \u201cpoint of contact\u201d with New South Wales police. </li> <li>Also on Taylor, the US author <strong>Naomi Wolf</strong> has challenged Taylor to correct \u201cdisinformation\u201d about her in his<strong> maiden speech to parliament</strong>. So that\u2019s still bubbling along.</li> <li>Senator<strong> Cory Bernardi</strong> gave his valedictory speech, speaking of the difficulty of defecting from the Liberals.</li> <li><strong>GDP figures</strong> were released late this morning, <strong>showing a 0.4% quarterly growth</strong> in the economy. It\u2019s still well below the long-term growth average. The treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, said there were reasons to be positive. Others weren\u2019t so rosy. </li> <li><strong>Malarndirri McCarthy</strong> gave an emotional speech to the Senate about the<strong> vile death and rape threats</strong> she has endured in office. The threats were truly horrific and McCarthy\u2019s speech gave a powerful insight of what it\u2019s like for victims of such abuse. </li> <li>Early on in the day, <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> called for changes to allow more of the commonwealth\u2019s <strong>environmental water holdings</strong> to meet critical human need. The Nationals have been placed in a tricky position by all of this. They are <strong>bearing the brunt of farmer anger</strong> over water arrangements, and risk losing their traditional constituents to minor parties or elsewhere. </li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T07:38:35.492Z\">at 7.38am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de755938f0829bc521b6263\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T06:46:27.408Z\">6.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Police ask Clover Moore for statement on Taylor</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another development on the <strong>Angus Taylor front</strong>. </p> <p>The <strong>City of Sydney\u2019s</strong> lord mayor, <strong>Clover Moore</strong>, has been <strong>approached by police to provide a statement</strong> for their investigation into accusations Taylor relied on a falsified document to attack her travel-related emissions.

If you can end your time here with more firm friendships than when you began, that too is a good measure of success.

again. </p> <p>This is what we learned: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> has established a<strong> \u201c</strong><strong>point of contact\u201d with NSW police</strong> over its investigation of his office\u2019s reliance on a falsified document to attack Clover Moore. So we\u2019re <strong>not yet at the stage of a police interview</strong>. But there is contact, of some description. Taylor continued to duck questions on why he hasn\u2019t produced evidence to back up his claim that he downloaded the document with erroneous figures from the council\u2019s own website. <strong>Mark Butler</strong> pointed out that the document had accurate figures at four points in March, April, June and October. That would make Taylor\u2019s version unlikely, to say the least. </li> <li>The <strong>repeal of the medevac</strong> <strong>bill</strong> dominated many of the questions. Labor asked why the government was claiming it had not done a deal with <strong>Jacqui Lambie</strong>, when she intimated that they had. <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> said Lambie had simply supported government policy. He then attacked Labor for <strong>sending women and children to Manus Island</strong>, prompting an uproar in parliament. </li> <li>In the Senate, <strong>Richard Di Natale</strong> asked a more targeted question than Deal or No Deal \u2013 was there an exchange of letters with Jacqui Lambie?<br></li> <li>There was another angry exchange between <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> and <strong>Joel Fitzgibbon</strong>, who seem to be having quite a week. McCormack said Fitzgibbon was a disgrace and \u201cwouldn\u2019t know a farmer if he met one\u201d. Take that. </li> <li><strong>Timothy Weeks</strong>, a freed Taliban prisoner, was in the house and received a standing ovation from the chamber. Weeks had been a Taliban prisoner for three years since he was taken hostage in 2016. </li> <li>Labor led its attack on the <strong>poor school performance</strong> results released overnight, which show Australian school students are falling behind the rest of the world. Scott Morrison said \u201cfunding is at record levels\u201d. <strong>Dan Tehan</strong> said funding wasn\u2019t everything and Australia needed to find other ways to improve performance.<br></li> </ul> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T04:34:37.070Z\">at 4.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de730b68f08f78465b4a8d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T04:12:59.255Z\">4.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Taylor again. <strong>Mark Butler</strong> points out that publicly available internet archives show the <strong>annual report on the council\u2019s website</strong> contained accurate figures on four dates in March, April, June and October. How does that square with Taylor\u2019s claim that his office downloaded a version of the report with inaccurate figures from the council\u2019s website? Butler asks:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Does the minister seriously expect Australians to believe the report with the correct figures was on the website on each of those dates, then inexplicably replaced with a report with incorrect figures, which only his office downloaded, then the report with the correct figures was put back up again, for only him to see?</p> </blockquote> <p>The question prompts some wry smiles from the Labor benches. It does all seem, er, rather improbable. </p> <p>There\u2019s some scuttlebutt about whether the question would interfere with an active police investigation. </p> <p>Eventually, Taylor says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I made a statement on this which I have tabled in the house, while there are ongoing police inquiries as a result of those opposite, I have nothing more to add. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T04:25:09.693Z\">at 4.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5de72fba8f0829bc521b61b1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T04:04:08.184Z\">4.04am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Taylor has established 'point of contact' with NSW police</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another question to Taylor. <strong>Mark Butler</strong> asks if he has provided metadata and download logs to police.</p> <p>Taylor reveals he has <strong>established a point of contact with NSW police</strong>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As I said, I will always cooperate with matters of this sort. </p> <p>My office has established an administrative point of contact with the NSW police, and I don\u2019t propose to say anything more while police inquiries are continuing. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5de72dbd8f08bf648cb236e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-12-04T04:00:16.370Z\">4.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Labor shifts to <strong>Angus Taylor</strong>.

Oy Senate, bugger off. I\u2019m paraphrasing slightly, but you get the drift. </p> <p>Taylor gets up: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I will always cooperate with matters of this sort.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave the live blog for the day. Thanks for following along. It\u2019s been another messy day. Many say the medevac repeal has made it one of parliament\u2019s darkest. If it helps, I\u2019ve been silently chanting \u2018one more day, one more day, one more day\u2019 for the past three hours. It\u2019s no real comfort, to be honest. But it does busy the mind. Feel free to give it a go. Don\u2019t blame me if you go insane. This is what we learned today: The government won Jacqui Lambie\u2019s vote using unknown promises, thereby securing the passage of its medevac repeal bill. We suspect they promised to give new energy to their efforts to resettle the refugees on Nauru. But the repeal means the effective end of doctor-led decisions on healthcare transfers for asylum seekers and refugees. The decision has been condemned by GPs, refugee advocates, human rights groups, the opposition, the Greens and Centre Alliance. There is real anger that the vote took place without anyone truly knowing what the Lambie-Coalition deal actually entailed. On the Angus Taylor front, there was an unconfirmed report in the Australian naming one of Taylor\u2019s staff, Josh Manuatu, as the person who obtained false travel figures about Clover Moore and sent them to the Daily Telegraph. The Guardian also reported that police have asked Clover Moore for a statement, and Taylor revealed in question time that he had set up a \u201cpoint of contact\u201d with New South Wales police. Also on Taylor, the US author Naomi Wolf has challenged Taylor to correct \u201cdisinformation\u201d about her in his maiden speech to parliament. So that\u2019s still bubbling along. Senator Cory Bernardi gave his valedictory speech, speaking of the difficulty of defecting from the Liberals. GDP figures were released late this morning, showing a 0.4% quarterly growth in the economy. It\u2019s still well below the long-term growth average. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said there were reasons to be positive. Others weren\u2019t so rosy. Malarndirri McCarthy gave an emotional speech to the Senate about the vile death and rape threats she has endured in office. The threats were truly horrific and McCarthy\u2019s speech gave a powerful insight of what it\u2019s like for victims of such abuse. Early on in the day, Barnaby Joyce called for changes to allow more of the commonwealth\u2019s environmental water holdings to meet critical human need. The Nationals have been placed in a tricky position by all of this. They are bearing the brunt of farmer anger over water arrangements, and risk losing their traditional constituents to minor parties or elsewhere. Another development on the Angus Taylor front. The City of Sydney\u2019s lord mayor, Clover Moore, has been approached by police to provide a statement for their investigation into accusations Taylor relied on a falsified document to attack her travel-related emissions. The council said in a statement: \u201cNSW police have asked the lord mayor for a statement. She will cooperate with the police request.\u201d Naomi Wolf has called on Angus Taylor to correct the record after it emerged his first speech to parliament wrongly stated that she had attempted to have a Christmas tree removed from their student accommodation at Oxford University, which Taylor used as a gross example of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. Bernardi becomes emotional when he talks about his family and wife, Sin\u00e9ad. He concludes by saying he wanted to live life in politics \u201cwalking lightly through these corridors, wondering, \u2018what if?\u2019\u201d. Looking back, I\u2019d like to think I took Kipling\u2019s words to heart in that here I met both triumph and disaster, and treated those two imposters just the same. That said it isn\u2019t for me to pass judgment on my contribution over the years. However, I want to conclude on reflecting on the very nature of success. Each of us will have different measures of what it means to be a success. But when I think of the difficult life of modern politics, if you can get through it without harbouring malice or discontent you have achieved success. If you can end your time here with more firm friendships than when you began, that too is a good measure of success. If you can leave the Canberra bubble with your marriage stronger, a family you are truly proud of, and completely at peace with yourself, then that to me is the ultimate measure of success. Bernardi talks about the focus directed to him from the press. To the troops of the fourth estate \u2013 where do I start? I naively thought that knowing so many of you from my days as a publican might give me an easy ride. Fat lot of good that did me though. In fact, I think that you, knowing that I knew what you were really like, simply seemed to focus your aim at me. Conservative senator Cory Bernardi is giving his valedictory speech in the Senate. He praises the Liberal senators Nick Minchin and former Senate president Alan Ferguson for their guidance. He speaks of Jeannie Ferris, a senator who died of ovarian cancer in October 2005. Bernardi says a day after Ferris\u2019s death, the Senate machinery kicked back into gear. That was my greatest and most important political lesson. That experience taught me that none of us here are indispensable. Bernardi speaks of defecting from the Liberal party. He says he lost many friends and colleagues. Suffice to say, I made choices that I thought were necessary and in the best interests of the country. Those choices were very difficult for me and my family. They were painful. He speaks of the \u201cawesome foursome\u201d who united in their opposition to the carbon pollution reduction scheme 10 years ago. That group included Mathias Cormann, Michaelia Cash, Bernardi and David Bushby. We had an enormous amount of fun and I think we really did change the course of political history. He jokes about his friendship with Labor senator Don Farrell, who lost his seat in 2013, but has since returned to parliament. He says he was the sole keeper of \u201cthe Farrell flame\u201d in the Senate. As a cheer squad of one, I have to tell you even I was surprised when he got back. But it has been good to have you back Don, and I only wish some on your own side felt the same way I do. GPs have slammed the government\u2019s repeal of medevac laws, saying it will increase the risk of further deaths and compromise patient care. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners refugee health network chair, Kate Walker, said the heads of 12 prominent medical colleges were united in their support for medevac for \u201cgood reason\u201d. \u201cLast week I expressed concern that the repeal of the legislation would compromise patient care and increase the risk of further deaths. I stand by that statement,\u201d Walker said. She said 12 refugees and asylum seekers had died in offshore processing in the five years prior to medevac. None had died since. Without medevac, the government must take urgent action to ensure patient safety. They must be transparent in their processes and accept medical advice. Australia has a duty of care for those most vulnerable who remain offshore. Border protection is important but so is our duty of care to the health and safety of those in offshore detention. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has welcomed news that Behrouz Boochani has applied for asylum in New Zealand. We\u2019ve known for some time that this was likely. Di Natale tells the ABC: We wish him all the best, we hope that he\u2019s able to put this trauma behind him. Most people don\u2019t. On behalf of the many decent Australians, we are so sorry for what Behrouz has had to endure. Our political editor, Katharine Murphy, has written this report on the events of today. Murphy reports Jacqui Lambie wanted a re-energised pursuit of the New Zealand resettlement deal from the government in exchange for her support. She may have gotten a letter of assurance from the government to that end. The talk around parliament on Wednesday is Lambie emerged from the tortuous medevac tussle with a letter from Morrison indicating the government will pursue resettlement with New Zealand after the current deal with the United States is exhausted \u2013 but I haven\u2019t seen the letter. I am entirely confident Lambie has been pursuing the New Zealand resettlement option in her protracted talks with the government about medevac repeal, but the rest is speculative, and the government claims no deals have been made. Still, there is an obvious way to square this \u201cI\u2019ve got a deal, sort of\u201d/\u201cno deal\u201d circle. Despite appearing reluctant to pursue New Zealand\u2019s kind offer to resettle the asylum seekers Australia sent to moulder in offshore detention, the home affairs minister hasn\u2019t really ruled out doing that. The line has been that now is not the time. Assuming that New Zealand remains willing, perhaps a more convenient time to pursue resettlement will materialise soon. Perhaps the government signalled this to Lambie, or some other viable resettlement plan involving another country \u2013 a plan to slowly dismantle the life-force sapping apparatus of offshore detention. Not a deal so much, as a sharing of (as yet unannounced) government policy (if you will). The Australian has just named one of Angus Taylor\u2019s staff, Josh Manuatu, as the person who obtained false travel figures about Clover Moore and sent them to the Daily Telegraph. I have no evidence that Manuatu was involved in this at all, but there has been talk around the government that he might have been the staffer who handled the material. But even if he did (and I said I don\u2019t know if he did or not), the letter did go out under the signature of the minister. Old fashioned to reference the concept of ministerial responsibility I know. Taylor\u2019s office has told my colleague Anne Davies when she made inquiries about this yesterday: \u201cI reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the document in question.\u201d The Labor MP Andrew Giles, like many of us, cannot understand how the deal between Jacqui Lambie and the Coalition came to be. On Sunday, Lambie said she had given the government a choice: I have given the government a choice, it can either pick A or B. Out of all due respect to the prime minister and Peter Dutton, and to make sure those talks continue over the week, I don\u2019t want to be saying too much about this. Today it sounded simply like Lambie had accepted the government\u2019s assurance that it would continue to implement its resettlement policies. Though that\u2019s still not entirely clear. Giles: It doesn\u2019t sound like any of the things Jacqui was talking about last week or even on Sunday. What an awful way to make law. What an awful way to make law. Where even cabinet ministers wander into the Senate without even knowing what they\u2019re voting for. A new report shows inadequate Centrelink payments are driving people into poverty and heightening their risk of homelessness. The Homeward Bound report, authored by the lawyer Sophie Trevitt with the National Social Security Rights Network and Canberra Community Law, examined the experiences of 567 clients in Canberra. It found Centrelink recipients are struggling to meet their basic daily needs, including food and housing. It found women, single parents, Indigenous Australians and people with disabilities are suffering the most, and are most at risk of homelessness. The report called for an increase in Newstart, reforms to the social security system and additional social housing. \u201cPeople on the Newstart allowance are struggling to live on less than $40 a day. They are entirely cut off from the private rental market; and with extremely long wait times for public housing, many were forced to sleep in their cars, in the living rooms of friends and families, in parks, caravans and refuges,\u201d Trevitt said. Nick Martin, a GP and former senior medical officer on Nauru, has written on the repeal of the medevac laws for the Guardian. It\u2019s pretty strong stuff. Today Australia became just a little crueller, just a little more sadistic. A bill that was working well was repealed because a self-professed Christian thought that his values aligned with denying care to the vulnerable. Absolutely nothing to do with border protection \u2013 boat turnbacks provide the assurance that boats will be stopped. I saw firsthand the damage to people kept in indefinite detention. It was why I spoke out in the first place. I am not a politician; I simply wanted correct and timely medical care to be given to those in need of it. To see the politicians engage in this carnival of cruelty, dressing up their arguments with consistently debunked statements on stopping drownings at sea has been demoralising. God only knows what the refugees stuck offshore must think. Australia has yet again signalled to the world that we are prepared to inflict suffering on those who flee terror and risk dangerous journeys to seek asylum. Question time, as seen through the eyes of Mike Bowers. Lovely shot from Mike Bowers of Timothy Weeks, a recently freed Taliban hostage, getting a standing ovation during question time this afternoon. Question time has ended with a sustained attack on Angus Taylor, yet again. This is what we learned: Angus Taylor has established a \u201cpoint of contact\u201d with NSW police over its investigation of his office\u2019s reliance on a falsified document to attack Clover Moore. So we\u2019re not yet at the stage of a police interview. But there is contact, of some description. Taylor continued to duck questions on why he hasn\u2019t produced evidence to back up his claim that he downloaded the document with erroneous figures from the council\u2019s own website. Mark Butler pointed out that the document had accurate figures at four points in March, April, June and October. That would make Taylor\u2019s version unlikely, to say the least. The repeal of the medevac bill dominated many of the questions. Labor asked why the government was claiming it had not done a deal with Jacqui Lambie, when she intimated that they had. Scott Morrison said Lambie had simply supported government policy. He then attacked Labor for sending women and children to Manus Island, prompting an uproar in parliament. In the Senate, Richard Di Natale asked a more targeted question than Deal or No Deal \u2013 was there an exchange of letters with Jacqui Lambie? There was another angry exchange between Michael McCormack and Joel Fitzgibbon, who seem to be having quite a week. McCormack said Fitzgibbon was a disgrace and \u201cwouldn\u2019t know a farmer if he met one\u201d. Take that. Timothy Weeks, a freed Taliban prisoner, was in the house and received a standing ovation from the chamber. Weeks had been a Taliban prisoner for three years since he was taken hostage in 2016. Labor led its attack on the poor school performance results released overnight, which show Australian school students are falling behind the rest of the world. Scott Morrison said \u201cfunding is at record levels\u201d. Dan Tehan said funding wasn\u2019t everything and Australia needed to find other ways to improve performance. Taylor again. Mark Butler points out that publicly available internet archives show the annual report on the council\u2019s website contained accurate figures on four dates in March, April, June and October. How does that square with Taylor\u2019s claim that his office downloaded a version of the report with inaccurate figures from the council\u2019s website? Butler asks: Does the minister seriously expect Australians to believe the report with the correct figures was on the website on each of those dates, then inexplicably replaced with a report with incorrect figures, which only his office downloaded, then the report with the correct figures was put back up again, for only him to see? The question prompts some wry smiles from the Labor benches. It does all seem, er, rather improbable. There\u2019s some scuttlebutt about whether the question would interfere with an active police investigation. Eventually, Taylor says: I made a statement on this which I have tabled in the house, while there are ongoing police inquiries as a result of those opposite, I have nothing more to add. Another question to Taylor. Mark Butler asks if he has provided metadata and download logs to police. Taylor reveals he has established a point of contact with NSW police. As I said, I will always cooperate with matters of this sort. My office has established an administrative point of contact with the NSW police, and I don\u2019t propose to say anything more while police inquiries are continuing. Labor shifts to Angus Taylor. They ask why he hasn\u2019t complied with a Senate order to produce evidence to back his claims that he downloaded a false document from the City of Sydney council\u2019s website, which he then used to attack the lord mayor, Clover Moore. The Speaker, Tony Smith, makes his position on the matter fairly clear. Oy Senate, bugger off. I\u2019m paraphrasing slightly, but you get the drift. Taylor gets up: I will always cooperate with matters of this sort. I tabled a statement in this House last week... as I have repeatedly told the House I reject absolutely the scurrilous accusations of those opposite. They are so transparent. They seek to distract from their own failings with smear. That\u2019s fine and all, but he still hasn\u2019t provided any evidence that he downloaded the dodgy document from the council\u2019s website. Senator Cory Bernardi \u2013 who is due to give his valedictory speech this afternoon \u2013 got what is likely to be his final question in Senate question time. Bernardi asked the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, to explain the evils of socialism and why the government has not implemented such policies. It was all very Auspol101, and a bit of a nostalgia lap for the Australian Conservatives senator who started his career as a Liberal. Kim Carr interjected \u201cthey have\u201d (implemented socialism) \u2013 asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the big stick all about\u201d. Green Peter Whish-Wilson also got in on the action suggesting \u201cthe question should have been directed to Matt Canavan, the minister for nationalising coal-fired power stations\u201d. Cormann then expounded on the different growth rates in East and West Germany \u2013 which Tim Ayres suggested hardly proved his point because West Germany was a social democracy. The first supplementary question was about Marxism, which Cormann described as \u201csocialism on steroids\u201d. In his final supplementary, Bernardi asked if Cormann was aware of a certain senator standing 6 foot 5 inches who had consistently railed against socialism (himself). Cormann responded: I once knew a guy who was in the Liberal party party room, sadly he left us. In more recent times I feel that senator has been coming back closer to the bosom of the Liberal party. Scott Morrison is asked how the government can claim it has done no deal with Jacqui Lambie, when she herself claimed such a deal was brokered. I\u2019m not aware of what the member is referring to. I have before me Jacqui Lambie\u2019s comments... and it makes no mention of it. Morrison says Lambie simply confirmed her support for government policies, including its policy on medevac. He then prompts an uproar when he accuses Labor of sending women and children to Manus, which he says was a new low. This mob on this side Mr Speaker, this Labor party were the party that sent children to Manus Island. So I will not take lectures from the Labor party that showed themselves to be the most outrageous treatment of women and children in sending them to Manus Island and then did nothing while we sought to stop the deaths at sea. On the topic of border protection, the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at the University of New South Wales said the repeal of medevac and the Independent Health Advice Panel \u201cin no way extinguishes Australia\u2019s duty of care\u201d to those held in offshore processing. It said medevac saved lives and de-politicised the health care of refugees and asylum seekers. Under both international and domestic law, Australia has a duty of care with respect to the health and well-being of people transferred offshore to Nauru and PNG. The medevac system assisted the Government meet this duty of care, by ensuring that there was a clear, transparent and effective process for people in need of transfer to be brought to the attention of the Minister, and for urgent medical decisions to be made by people with the requisite qualifications and expertise, within appropriate clinical timeframes. It minimised the risks of delay, uncertainty, and politicisation of medical decisions. It was a measure designed to save lives, and did so without compromising the ultimate power of the Minister to exclude any person who he or she deems to be a safety or security risk to the Australian public. The Kaldor Centre told a Senate inquiry in August that medevac was a \u201cnecessary, reasonable and appropriate\u201d measure. Peter Dutton gets an energetic dixer from the backbencher Vince Connelly. Hands were flurrying. Dramatic pauses. Gesticulation, emphasis abound. The dixer is on border protection, which leads Dutton down a well-worn path. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, quotes Scott Morrison\u2019s words back to him on the economy. At the end of the last quarter, Morrison said \u201cyou\u2019d expect that things would improve in the next quarter\u201d. Albanese says: Given economic growth has slowed in the September quarter ... how did the prime minister get it so wrong? Morrison responds: September quarter this year was higher than September quarter last year. Now I note that the leader of the opposition is not even economically literate, Mr Speaker ... Albanese protests on relevance. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gets a dixer on the economy. He says despite the drought and other economic headwinds, the Australian economy has shown great \u201cresilience\u201d and continues to grow. In the first time in more than 40 years, we have seen a current account surplus... it\u2019s a result in part of the free trade agreements that this side of the House have supported. In Senate question time, Richard Di Natale has asked a more targeted question than Deal or No Deal \u2013 was there an exchange of letters with Jacqui Lambie? The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, refused to rule it out: I won\u2019t go into private conversations \u2026 What I can say is there has been no deal to change our stance on border protection or anything else. We provided briefings, we did not provide any undertakings to change policy ... We provided detailed information about what the policies of the government are. The supplementaries are all the same question \u2013 and now all the Greens are interjecting \u201cany letters?\u201d A nice moment in the House, for a change. Timothy Weeks, the Australian man who was held hostage by the Taliban for three years, is in the chamber. His presence is noted by the Speaker, Tony Smith, and the lower house rises united in standing applause. Weeks was freed after a prisoner swap deal earlier this year. Weeks was teaching English at a Kabul university when he and an American colleague were abducted at gunpoint in 2016. Fireworks again in the lower house between Michael McCormack and Joel Fitzgibbon. The pair have got some odd competition going on this week about who knows more about farmers. McCormack said: He wouldn\u2019t know a farmer if he met one, quite frankly. Over in the Senate, it looks like Mathias Cormann is explaining his \u201cno secret deal\u201d comment by claiming nothing in government policy has changed as a result of its negotiations with Jacqui Lambie. Righto. We get a dixer to the PM on the economy. Then Labor asks the education minister, Dan Tehan, about the Pisa results. Tanya Plibersek asks when the government\u2019s education reforms are going to start to work. Tehan says: We want to ensure that there are progressions in place so that we can map for every student across the nation the progressions they are making on literacy and numeracy. That is something that was never done on the other side. He then objects to criticism. You\u2019re in the wrong business, mate. Rather than coming in here and lecturing us about this and that, why don\u2019t you actually encourage the state and territory ministers to come to that meeting next week and be bold. Morrison continues: The outcomes of the Pisa 2018 results today are deeply concerning to the government, they are deeply concerning to the government. Labor kicks off question time with a question on the Pisa results, which show Australian school students are falling behind the rest of the world. Scott Morrison responds: Our education funding is at record levels, and the reason we can fund our schools at record levels, Mr Speaker, is because we know how to manage money. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has told Guardian Australia that the resources minister, Matt Canavan, \u201cdoesn\u2019t even pretend to care about our international commitments\u201d on climate change after the minister gave two interviews to the climate science denier Alan Jones on Monday. Jones asked the Queensland senator if he would be going to the UN climate talks that are under way in Madrid, but Canavan joked he had \u201cgot some better things to do\u201d and that he had \u201cnot committed enough sins\u201d to have been sent there. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, accused Canavan of engaging in \u201csmug mockery\u201d. Canavan claimed terms like \u201cclimate emergency\u201d were being forced upon members of the public, which he said was \u201cOrwellian\u201d and an attempt to shut down \u201calternative viewpoints\u201d. When asked on radio by Jones why he was not in Spain, a laughing Canavan said: \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovely this time of year but I\u2019ve got some better things to do. I haven\u2019t committed enough sins in my life to be sent there yet, Alan.\u201d Later on Sky, Jones again asked Canavan why he wasn\u2019t in Madrid. \u201cHa!\u201d said Canavan. \u201cWell, Alan, it would not exactly be how I would like to spend my Christmas let\u2019s just say that, but good luck to all those beautiful people who aggregate there. \u201cObviously we need to have international meetings to discuss these things, but then there are all these hangers on who seem to use this as a PR exercise to preen their moral vanity.\u201d In each interview Jones, who has described human-caused climate change as a hoax, promoted a climate science denial group known as Clintel, before then introducing the minister. Clintel is promoting a declaration that \u201cthere is no climate emergency\u201d and that \u201cCO2 is plant food\u201d. Canavan did not comment on the Clintel group, which has signed support from more than 100 Australians, including Hugh Morgan, a former president of the Business Council of Australia, and Ian Plimer, a director on Gina Rinehart\u2019s Roy Hill Holdings iron ore project. The Queensland state MP Colin Boyce, of the LNP, is the only Australian elected official to have his name appear on the Clintel declaration. Later in the Sky interview, Canavan said: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this agenda that\u2019s being pushed by some people going to these conferences is that they want to regulate what we say and do.\u201d He added there was an attempt to \u201cshut down debate\u201d. He said: \u201cThey are worried about alternative viewpoints. As you said in your intro we now have to call it a climate emergency. \u201cIt is not enough to call it climate change or global warming or greenhouse gases of the ozone layer \u2013 it\u2019s now a climate emergency. This is true Orwellian stuff that we have to use these kinds of terms.\u201d Canavan also used the interviews to heavily promote coal-fired power and coal generally, claiming coal generation was growing in other parts of Asia. \u201cWe are as a government backing coal-fired power,\u201d he told Jones on 4BC, adding the government was \u201cprogressing an option\u201d for a new coal-fired power station at Collinsville in north Queensland. Canavan said the renewable energy target had \u201cdestroyed our energy systems\u201d and had been a \u201cmassive mistake\u201d. Butler told Guardian Australia Canavan\u2019s comments on the climate talks \u201ctells us everything we need to know about the government\u2019s attitude to action on climate change. \u201cMatt Canavan doesn\u2019t even pretend to care about our international commitments under the Paris agreement. The hard-right of the Coalition dictates Australia\u2019s climate policy, as a result emissions are continuing to go up and our children will pay the price.\u201d Bandt said anyone attending the Madrid talks should be applauded, adding: \u201cThis smug mockery from the minister for coal is part of a broader assault on climate action by a government in the pocket of the polluters.\u201d The Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy has revealed she has suffered \u201cthreats of violence, graphic threats of being gang-raped and beaten, being killed for doing [her] job\u201d which she described as \u201creprehensible\u201d. These included \u201cthreats of executing me in the federal parliament\u201d that were taken seriously by the Senate president, the speaker of the House, and the Australian federal police \u2013 which served a personal protection order against the person making the threats. She told the Senate: Today I share my experience of what threats of violence in the workplace can feel like and how it has been a long and often times paralysing shadow over all that I do \u2026 Next month it will be two years when the first abusive phone calls began \u2026 the tone of constituent calls took a turn for the worse, call after call, message after message on my answering machine both my Canberra and Darwin office became an obsessive focus for the caller so fixated on wanting to inflict pain until finally I said enough. In my nearly 15 years since becoming Labor member in NT and now federal parliament I have never had to be concerned daily for my personal safety until now. McCarthy said she suffered anxiety about safety when she attended public events and even attending rallies now requires AFP protection. She said the threats are \u201cdesigned to maximise fear, render them incapable of doing their job\u201d and to put the target in \u201ca prison of impending danger\u201d. McCarthy also revealed that Pat Dodson was \u201calso now a focus for similar threats\u201d and thanked police in the NT and the AFP for taking the threats seriously. Scott Morrison says he has \u201cfulfilled a promise\u201d to the Australian people by repealing medevac laws. We\u2019ve always understood that that type of loophole doesn\u2019t strengthen our borders, it only weakens them. A year ago, we were defeated in the parliaments but we stood firm. And we stood firm and went to an election and said, support the Coalition and we will repeal those laws and so today, we fulfilled that promise to the Australian people. Peter Dutton says the law was always about getting people here through a \u201cback door\u201d. He pays tribute to the \u201cindependent senators\u201d \u2013 read Jacqui Lambie \u2013 and says medevac was \u201cbad policy\u201d. Morrison will not be drawn on what deal the Coalition struck with Lambie. He says the only condition he gave was to implement the government\u2019s policies. One of those policies, he says, is to resettle those on Nauru. Asked whether that would include accepting the New Zealand deal, he responded: The government is always looking at ways to resettle those who are on Nauru. Morrison is choosing his words very carefully here. He is not saying anything about accepting the New Zealand refugee resettlement deal. We\u2019ve just published this story on a whistleblower complaint concerning Peter Dutton and statements he made about the case of a convicted drug trafficker who was spared deportation. Andrew Wilkie says parliament has \u201csunk to a new low\u201d with the repeal of medevac laws. He has just issued this statement: The people marooned on Manus Island and Nauru are Australia\u2019s responsibility and it is a basic human right that every person has access to appropriate medical care. What have we come to as a nation when we are prepared to treat human beings so cruelly? Clearly medevac has not started the boats again and has not created a national security problem. The government is hiding behind the term \u201cnational security\u201d because they know there is no legitimate reason to have repealed the legislation. They are simply intent on punishing innocent people in the name of ideology. Medevac has reduced the preventable suffering of ill asylum seekers and refugees and is supported by medical experts. There are many politicians who should be ashamed of their willingness to throw innocent people to the wolves. Labor is continuing its pursuit of Angus Taylor through all of this. Penny Wong spoke in the Senate a little earlier. Labor had ordered Taylor\u2019s representatives to table documents explaining how he came to rely on a falsified document to attack Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. Wong says Labor was giving Taylor a chance to provide evidence to support his position that the falsified document came from the City of Sydney website. He failed. This motion was a test for the government and it has failed that test. It was a motion that required the government to table any evidence that it had to support Mr Taylor\u2019s repeated claims he didn\u2019t doctor a document to attack his political opponent. Because this is a scandal ... which started with a dodgy trick by a mediocre minister and it\u2019s ended with the integrity of the entire government in tatters. Mr Taylor has labelled this fiasco a \u201cgrubby smear\u201d. Well, if that were true he\u2019d be able to prove it but he refuses to put forward any evidence to clear his name. And the only reason you would choose not to clear your name is because you can\u2019t. GetUp and the Human Rights Law Centre are holding a press conference right now. GetUp\u2019s human rights director Shen Narayanasamy said what is needed, more than anything, is a solution for the refugees still on Nauru and Manus. There is a reason that they are getting sick, and it is because we are holding them there, in conditions that we know are inhumane, that will cause them to be sick. She said she can only hope that the deal struck by Lambie does something for their lives. We saw today incredible scenes in our senate as senator Lambie got to her feet with tears in her eyes to say that she had done some sort of deal with the government. We can only hope what that may be. The prime minister Scott Morrison has called a press conference for 1pm. We\u2019ll bring that to you as it happens. One question he may well be asked is: was there a secret deal with Jacqui Lambie? She seemed to think there was. It seemed pretty obvious to everyone watching that there was. Yet Mathias Cormann said categorically that there was not. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is speaking on the GDP figures out today. He\u2019s got slides. The figures were softer than expected at 0.4% quarterly growth for the September quarter, which remains below the long-term average. \u201cAustralia is back in black and back on track,\u201d Frydenberg says to kick things off. Frydenberg says the labour market remains strong, with annual jobs growth at 2%, more than double the OECD average. He said the overall growth was broad-based, contributed to by household consumption, net exports and public final demand. Household consumption has only increased by 0.1%, just so you know. He says household disposable income grew by 2.5%, the fastest quarterly rise in a decade, leading to an increase in household savings . But Frydenberg said the drought was having a significant impact on the Australian economy. Farm GDP are at record lows and rural exports are down. Mining investment is down 7.8% in the quarter. Total new business investment fell by 2%. In conclusion, Australia is not alone in facing significant domestic and global economic headwinds, but there are reasons to be positive about our economic future. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res says the medevac repeal will endanger patients and is \u201cunethical and harmful to vulnerable people and the entire medical profession\u201d. \u201cAsylum seekers and refugees who remain indefinitely contained on Nauru and PNG have been blocked again from accessing treatment for critical health conditions where adequate care is not available locally,\u201d said Paul McPhun, executive director of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Australia. MSF noted there was still no access to proper psychiatric care on Nauru, a problem that has existed for almost a year. \u201cDuring our time working with patients on Nauru, MSF psychiatrists and psychologists determined that the majority had their lives impaired by mental illness,\u201d McPhun said. \u201cTo now deny medical professionals from taking decisions in patients\u2019 best interests \u2013 and to effectively hand that power back to unqualified officials \u2013 entrenches dangerous precedents set in the last years and puts those most sick and vulnerable at risk. \u201cPreventing access to medical care as a policy tool is unethical and harmful to vulnerable people and the entire medical profession.\u201d We\u2019ve got some vision now of Jacqui Lambie\u2019s speech to the Senate. The Human Rights Law Centre has issued a statement on the repeal of medevac. It says the government stripped away \u201ca humane, transparent and doctor-led process for the refugees in its care\u201d. David Burke, the centre\u2019s legal director, said it was a \u201cshameful day\u201d for the government and the senators who voted with them. \u201cFear and lies have dominated at the expense of men and women who need medical care,\u201d Burke said. \u201cPeter Dutton and the Morrison government have today played cruel, bloody-minded politics with peoples\u2019 lives. The Morrison government has stripped away the basic shred of humanity that meant that when someone was sick they could get the care they needed.\u201d The centre said since the laws came into effect in March 2019, about 200 people have been evacuated to get medical care. More than 500 people remained in PNG and Nauru, Burke said. \u201cNow that the government has robbed these people of the medevac laws, it is more urgent than ever that they ensure every single person is resettled to safety. We will continue to challenge these cruel policies.\u201d The near-universal reaction to those GDP figures? They\u2019re softer than expected and of concern. Mike Bowers was in the chamber for that vote to repeal medevac, where Lambie used her critical vote to side with the government. Refugee advocates, Labor, the Greens, and human rights groups say it is a \u201cdark day\u201d for Australia. Here\u2019s how it unfolded in the chamber: The Australian Bureau of Statistics have updated GDP figures for the September quarter. The Australian economy grew 0.4% in seasonally adjusted chain volume terms in the September quarter 2019 and 1.7% through the year. Growth of 0.4% this quarter is down from 0.6% in the June quarter. ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said: The economy has continued to grow, however the rate of growth remains well below the long run average. The government had held out hope that the September quarter would produce a bounce on the back of tax cuts for middle income earners of up to $1,080. Household gross disposable income increased by 2.5% due to the tax cuts and lower mortgage repayments after three interest rate cuts this year. But the results show household expenditure increased by just 0.1%, with weakness in spending on discretionary goods and services. The household saving ratio rose to 4.8. Hockman said: The reduction to tax payable did not translate to a rise in discretionary spending, which led to a visible impact to household saving. While mining investment declined 7.8% this quarter and 11.2% through the year, the public sector was again the saviour: Government final consumption expenditure rose 0.9% in the quarter and remains strong through the year at 6.0%. The New Zealand government has refused to confirm whether they have recently been approached by the Australian government on the Manus deal, only reiterating that the offer remained live. \u201cThe offer to take 150 refugees is still on the table,\u201d immigration minister Iain Lees-Galloway said in a statement to the Guardian. In November last year, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, reiterated her government\u2019s offer to take up to 150 refugees after a weeks-long standoff at Manus Island detention facility led to a desperate humanitarian situation for the remaining detainees. New Zealand has made the same offer to the Australian government since 2013, but it has been strongly and repeatedly refused. The Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, described it as a \u201cbad option\u201d and suggested it may encourage people-smuggling boats to intensify their efforts to reach Australia. There is a precedent for New Zealand accepting refugees that Australia does not want. In 2001 Helen Clark\u2019s Labour government offered asylum to 130 refugees who were rescued from the Tampa after it sunk off the Australian coast. Twenty of the 130 asylum seekers were young boys and adolescents, and became known as the \u201cTampa boys\u201d. Abbas Nazari, 23, a Tampa refugee who resettled in New Zealand, recently won a Fullbright scholarship to study in the US. He says the country welcomed him with open arms. \u201cI can\u2019t recall any instances of racism and that\u2019s the same experience for the vast majority of my family and community,\u201d says Nazari. \u201cWe wove naturally into the fabric of New Zealand society. So when I hear stories of prejudice and racism, I know for sure that it exists but my experience in New Zealand has been amazingly warm and welcoming.\u201d Reactions are flowing thick and fast after that vote. Shamindan, a refugee still in Papua New Guinea, said it was a \u201cvery dark day\u201d that would allow politicians to deliberately deny medical care to those who need it. Anthony Albanese said \u201cyou can be strong on borders without being weak on humanity\u201d. Richard Di Natale said it was clear someone had lied about the deal struck between Lambie and the Coalition. He just held a press conference: Someone\u2019s lying here. Either senator Lambie is lying, or the government is lying. It\u2019s very clear. According to senator Lambie there was a proposal put to the government that was negotiated in secret, yet the government denies it. It is cruel, it is heartless, it is absolutely an assault on the parliament. Amnesty International Australia has described it as a \u201cshameful day\u201d for Australia. Advisor Graham Thom said: It\u2019s a shameful day when the Australian parliament turns its back on sick people in desperate need of medical attention. Let\u2019s not forget that this offshore detention system is the one under which 12 innocent people have died. Although one Labor amendment was voted on (to continue the medevac process for those with existing applications), I\u2019m advised the rest weren\u2019t circulated in time so the gag motion effectively prevented them being voted on. Jacqui Lambie leaves the chamber alone. She walked past Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick, without making eye contact. The medevac repeal bill is passed 37 votes to 35. This is effectively the end of the medevac laws. As they vote, Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff has sent us this statement: A government that has no empathy for people in need of critical medical care is a government that doesn\u2019t deserve to govern. This repeal is all about a government desperate for a win \u2013 any win \u2013 ahead of the summer break. Prior to medevac there were many deaths in detention. There have been none since medevac came into force. This repeal will damage lives. It is a heartless action that shows complete disdain for humanity. We\u2019re now up to the final vote on this bill. This is it. We\u2019re expecting the repeal bill to be passed. Division in progress. Lambie is voting against this amendment and it is defeated by one vote. That\u2019s a pretty grim forecast for the rest of Labor\u2019s proposed amendments. We\u2019re currently voting on an amendment to allow people already in the medevac process to remain in the medevac process. Seems sane. Let\u2019s see what our Senate thinks. Pauline Hanson is shepherding Jacqui Lambie through these divisions. At the moment, Lambie is penned between Hanson and the Liberal frontbencher Anne Ruston. It must be pretty intense, sitting between Hanson and Ruston right now. We\u2019re now into a series of votes on the second reading of the medevac repeal bill. Labor is attempting now to move its amendments. The amendments are unlikely to be passed, but if they are, the bill will need to return to the lower house. Kristina Keneally is using the amendments to call for government backbenchers \u201cwith some semblance of a beating heart\u201d for support. Labor has put in a whole bunch of amendments to the medevac bill. If Jacqui Lambie continues voting with the government they may not be successful, but they will trigger a series of votes after 11am that will delay its final passage. These amendments would: Require home affairs minister Peter Dutton to make a detailed report every time a refugee or asylum seeker is settled in a third country. Allow minors to continue to come to Australia for psychiatric and medical assessments. Continue the work of the Independent Health Advice Panel in making independent health assessments which then must be tabled in parliament Stipulate that where the minister fails to make a decision about a proposed transfer, the more generous medevac provisions will continue to apply. These would, in effect, soften the blow of repeal and try to set new rules to prevent the government refusing to deal with proposed medical transfers, as occurred before the medevac provisions were introduced. Lambie was obviously emotional during that speech. There is fury in the chamber. The Greens who sit close to Lambie, heckled her throughout. A Labor senator shouted \u201cthis is undemocratic\u201d as Lambie apologised for not revealing the detail of her conversation with the government. As Lambie spoke, Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher stood at the front of the chamber, in conclave, arms folded. Richard Di Natale is furious. Mathias Cormann has just insisted there was no \u201csecret deal\u201d. But Lambie has just confirmed, clearly, that there is a secret deal. Di Natale: Who on earth is misleading this parliament? Someone is misleading the Senate about one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been before this parliament. Lambie: I get that this vote will disappoint many, and I apologise for that. This is a matter of conscience. She says she cannot allow the border protection system to unravel again and have people drown. Lambie is breaking down in tears as she says she still cannot explain why she has given her vote to the government. She again cites national security for her lack of reasoning. I\u2019m not being coy or silly when I say I genuinely can\u2019t say what I proposed. I know that\u2019s frustrating to people and I accept that. When I say I can\u2019t discuss it for national security concerns, I am being 100% honest with you. Jacqui Lambie finally gets up to speak. She says the decision was not easy and apologises for taking so long. Medevac isn\u2019t a national security threat, but there are real problems with the way it is operating. They cannot be amended away. The Labor party and the Greens might think it\u2019s a-OK, but I\u2019m not comfortable with it. She says the system is not as perfect as the activists would have you believe but not as bad as the \u201cmedia loudmouths\u201d would have you believe either. Kristina Keneally points out 62% of Australians support medevac. She\u2019s referring to this Guardian Essential Poll. \u201cBoy they don\u2019t like hearing that, do they?\u201d she says. Keneally continues: \u201cWhat you\u2019re voting on today will deny sick people treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will deny sick people the opportunity to see a doctor and get treatment.\u201d A bit more activity at the back of the chamber. Penny Wong has just paid a visit to the Greens advisers. Pauline Hanson is also heckling Nick McKim. Jacqui Lambie is looking straight ahead. Nick McKim says it is a \u201cdark day for the Senate\u201d. But it\u2019s darker still for those still on Manus and Nauru. It\u2019s the darkest day for those people who remain on Manus and Nauru. That\u2019s who this is the darkest day for. Pauline Hanson is repeating the fact (which we\u2019re also seeing in a lot of newspapers) that people brought here under medevac aren\u2019t in hospital. It\u2019s worth noting (again) that the purpose of medevac is to bring people to Australia for medical care or assessment which is unavailable in PNG and Nauru. That does not necessarily equal hospitalisation. And a lack of hospitalisation does not equal a scammed medevac. Hanson then says a bunch of stuff that are not facts. Pauline Hanson is on her feet. She doesn\u2019t seem perturbed about not knowing the nature of the deal between Lambie and the Coalition. Instead, she\u2019s attacking Labor and claiming medevac repeal is wanted by most Australians. Katharine Murphy, who\u2019s in the chamber, reports that a Labor interjector has given her a handy fact. \u201cThe majority of Australian support medevac, you silly woman.\u201d The current debate is on Labor\u2019s attempt to force the government to table all documents about its deal with Jacqui Lambie before the repeal bill is voted on. It\u2019s expected to go for about half an hour. Labor will need an absolute majority, but if it wins, it would effectively mean the bill cannot pass until those documents are provided to the Senate. Finance minister Mathias Cormann is up on his feet. There is no secret deal. There is no secret deal. There is no secret. the Australian people know extremely well the work that we have done to strengthen our border protection arrangements. He continues: Obviously the Labor party doesn\u2019t believe anybody can ever be persuaded by argument. While Penny Wong is in full flight, Mathias Cormann makes a brief check on Lambie, who has resumed her seat. Jacqui Lambie is now wandering, at large, at the back of the chamber. The government wins the vote and we\u2019re now debating the bill. Labor is attempting to move amendments to force the government to disclose its deal with Jacqui Lambie. Penny Wong is attempting to suspend standing orders. She wants debate delayed until \u201call documents relating to negotiations between the government and Jacqui Lambie\u201d are laid on the table. At the moment we have cabinet ministers coming in here like lemming, voting on a legislation based on a deal you haven\u2019t seen. What sort of cabinet government is that? What sort of process of democracy is that? She continues: You should require of this government some disclosure. You should require of this government some disclosure. You should require something more than secret deals done in the shadows. We\u2019re now voting to bring on consideration of the bill immediately. The government wins the vote to limit debate 38-36. Mike Bowers is in the chamber. The government wins the vote to suspend standing orders 38-37, with Lambie\u2019s vote critical. It is now bringing on a vote to limit the debate. Lambie is voting with the government in this division. There is much bonohomie on that side of the chamber. Over the other side, the two Centre Alliance senators Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick are boxed in by Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher. Jacqui Lambie has just entered the chamber. She looks cheerful. Malcolm Roberts from One Nation meanwhile is engaged in conversation with the Greens senator Janet Rice. There is some speculation from senators that Scott Morrison has agreed with Lambie to pursue the New Zealand deal but only after the US deal has been fully executed. That\u2019s what people think. The government\u2019s deputy Senate leader Simon Birmingham has dismissed Labor\u2019s position that medevac is needed to ensure sick people are brought to Australia, saying the government has had its own system where people are assessed and brought here if needed. Which is true \u2013 they do have such a policy. But it was been widely criticised as inadequate. Data reported earlier this year showed that some people on Manus Island had waited as long as five years for treatment to start after the government\u2019s contracted doctors recommended it. We\u2019re now voting on the suspension of standing orders. A division is required and the bells are ringing. If this passes, the government will be able to effectively guillotine debate and force a vote on the medevac repeal bill. Penny Wong is on her feet. It appears there\u2019s been a deal done to repeal medevac. Well the Australian people wants to see the deal, this Senate wants to see the deal. Wong says it\u2019s consistent with the government\u2019s attitude to scrutiny and transparency. It\u2019s not a government that likes scrutiny. It\u2019s not a government that likes transparency. Jacqui Lambie is now in the chamber. Wong says to Lambie: Do not make them to require you to vote for legislation with the requirement of secrecy around it. It is not a reasonable proposition. Di Natale continues: If this government had a shred of integrity, it would allow this parliament to scrutinise the basis for the repeal of a law that protects what is a fundamental human right. In the chamber, while Richard Di Natale is speaking, Penny Wong is engaged in a conversation with Mathias Cormann across the table. Kristina Keneally is camped beside the advisers box. Jacqui Lambie is not in the chamber. Greens leader Richard Di Natale says the Senate is being asked to repeal laws that enshrine a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d on the basis of a secret deal. So what we\u2019ve got is we\u2019ve got a government working with senator Lambie to repeal laws that provide people access to healthcare, that\u2019s all this does. Medevac says if you are sick, you have a right to see a doctor, and it is a doctor who has the right to decide what kind of healthcare you receive. That is a fundamental human right. That\u2019s all the medevac laws do. Now we know that those laws that enshrine what we all understand to be a basic right afforded to every citizen, are going to be repealed but repealed on the basis of a secret deal. Labor senator Katy Gallagher is slamming the Lambie-Coalition deal, saying they were \u201cobsessed with getting a win after a shocking week\u201d. \u201cTrying to get a win off the back of more than 500 people,\u201d she said. Gallagher said Labor is hearing \u201con the grape vine\u201d that the Senate will have no opportunity to see the deal before the vote. This chamber has every right to stand up and demand that any detail of the deal that\u2019s been done should be provided to this chamber. We should be allowed to debate it, we should be allowed to disagree with it. Greens senator Nick McKim says there are lives at real risk. He says doing secret deals on such a critical piece of legislation is one of \u201cthe most reprehensible things you could do as a member of parliament\u201d. The debate we are currently having is literally a life-or-death debate. It is literally a debate that will make such a difference, will have such an impact on so many people. He says such a critical debate cannot be allowed without senators knowing what deal Lambie and the government have done. I can only urge both parties of that deal to come clean on what they have agreed on. How can we have this debate when the majority of the Senate is in the dark about what that agreement is? How can we actually have a debate that is going to determine whether some people die or some people live without the full facts at our disposal? He continues: Don\u2019t do a secret deal when people\u2019s lives are in the balance. Because that\u2019s what I fear has occurred ... playing through people\u2019s lives through some secret arrangement is one of the most reprehensible things you could do as a member of parliament. Things are moving rather quickly now. The government is moving a motion to effectively push through the medevac repeal bill as soon as possible this morning. This would suggest it has done a deal with Lambie. The process from here is as follows: There will be a debate on the government\u2019s motion to suspend standing orders. That will last 30 minutes. If they\u2019re successful, debate on medevac will continue until about 11am. If not all speakers are finished by that time, debate will be gagged and the vote will come on. Keneally turns to One Nation, who have already given their support to medevac. She asks: Does senator Hanson know what is in this secret deal? Does senator Roberts know what is in this secret deal? She says Lambie cannot trust whatever promise the government has made to her. Do you trust this prime minister? I say to senator Lambie, think about this prime minister he will say anything to get himself out of a bind. Cormann says it is in the \u201cnational interest\u201d to bring on a vote. That is why I am moving this suspension and of course intend to move the motion circulated in the chamber. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally says it is clear there is a \u201csecret deal\u201d between Lambie and the Coalition. Is this what this government has come to? Secret deals done behind closed doors, and now dragging it in here, guillotining debate. The Senate is sitting and we\u2019re expecting debate on medevac to kick off fairly early. It\u2019s the first item on the government\u2019s business orders of the day. Finance minister Mathias Cormann is suspending standing orders and is up speaking. This suggests they may have come to some arrangement with Jacqui Lambie. Nothing is certain yet. Stay tuned. Jacqui Lambie delivered a fairly damning speech on foreign influence in the Senate last night. She lambasted both parties for not doing enough to combat Chinese government foreign influence. It\u2019s about time the people in this place woke up to China\u2019s attempts to infiltrate our economy and our democracy. I can tell you that the other 25 million Australians out there have. Both sides of politics need to take a good, hard look at themselves and make sure they\u2019re acting in our national interest. Quite obviously, over China, they are not. To be really clear to the Australian-Chinese community: I\u2019m not talking about you. I\u2019ve made that very clear in the past. Chinese-Australians have been here since the gold rushes, and their place in and contribution to Australian life is profound. I\u2019m sure they join all Australians who are watching on in horror at the stories that have come out recently. It\u2019s unbelievable what is being tolerated from inside this chamber. Lambie referred to the NSW Icac\u2019s inquiry into the $100,000 cash allegedly delivered in an Aldi bag to Labor HQ by Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire. She said at least NSW had an integrity commission to investigate and detect that kind of activity. The fact is that there are basically no protections from stopping this happening at a federal level \u2013 not because there can\u2019t be but because there\u2019s no courage to make it happen. There\u2019s no enforcement of the rules and there\u2019s no follow-up if things look off. The scale of the problem is huge, and we\u2019ve just been tinkering around the edges. The fact is that we\u2019d never pick that sort of thing up if it happened at a national branch. Lambie said Australia needed to develop a national strategy to handle the relationship. The crossbench senator is wielding a fair bit of power at the moment, given the government\u2019s desperation to repeal medevac. There\u2019s a few other tidbits around this morning. Channel Nine newspapers have reported that Gladys Liu, the Liberal MP, lobbied on behalf of a Chinese Communist party-endorsed company that was a large Liberal donor and was involved in some fairly shady dealings. The papers have also reported that Kristina Keneally was set to become Australia\u2019s ambassador to the US if Labor won office. Mike Bowers caught Anthony Albanese talking to the media a little earlier. We learned this morning that the government plans to bring back its union-busting bill in the lower house today. That, of course, is the bill that was defeated by One Nation on Friday, despite the government making changes to assuage their concerns. We\u2019re not expecting a vote on the legislation until the new year. Albanese said: This is a government that needs an agenda for the 2020s. We\u2019ve now just got a few weeks of this decade left. Their agenda for next year is that it\u2019s the same as last year ... they\u2019ve just got old stuff, that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. A coalition of legal groups, including the Law Council of Australia, have issued a statement calling on the government to scrap plans to merge the various family courts into a single specialist court. This week, the government reintroduced legislation that would merge the family and federal circuit courts. But the coalition said the legislation was flawed and would do little to \u201calleviate the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of victims of family violence falling through the cracks\u201d. It instead wants the government to act on recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission and retain and enhance specialists courts and consider a \u201ca specialised, standalone family law court system\u201d. To allow this to occur the joint select committee on Australia\u2019s family law system should consider the bill. Its terms of reference are clearly inclusive of this as they require consideration of reform that may be needed to the family law and the current structure of the family court and the federal circuit court. The Nationals remain under considerable pressure from the Murray Darling Basin plan protests in Canberra. Farmers yesterday labelled Nationals leader Michael McCormack spineless and lacking passion, and warned him his party faced looming electoral destruction unless they stood up to the Liberals. NSW threatened to pull out of the basin plan yesterday, and the Coalition announced yesterday it would review water allocation arrangements between states. Barnaby Joyce has been out and about this morning, calling for amendments to free up more of the commonwealth\u2019s environmental water holdings for farmers. He told the ABC: It\u2019s got to deal in a more precise way with critical human and critical economic needs. Just so your listeners understand the biggest irrigator in Australia is you. You hold about 2.848m litres of water ... so you the taxpayer, the Australian government, holds the water that can alleviate some of these problems. There\u2019s got to be a capacity to say well we\u2019re going to use more of that water for the critical needs of the irrigation towns, and deal in some way with the concerns these people raise. Joyce said he was thankful for the protests because they had focused the mind of politicians. He said he understood farmers\u2019 venting. I went down the day before and got a dose of it myself, you know you just accept it. You\u2019ve got to face up to your constituents. You\u2019ve got to make sure you hear their message, that\u2019s what\u2019s a democracy is about. One Nation and Bob Katter have been attempting to win over some of the Nationals\u2019 traditional constituents on the issue. Malcolm Roberts was out the front of parliament yesterday trying to fan the flames of protesters and direct their anger towards the government. Matt Canavan this morning criticised the approach of those with \u201cbig hats and dyed hair\u201d who \u201clike to jump up and down\u201d for their \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not the approach that works, that approach does not work,\u201d he told Sky News. We\u2019ve had a few voices out already today speaking about Australia\u2019s poor school results in the Program for International Student Assessment. Australia recorded the sharpest fall of any nation in the Pisa, which has caused considerable alarm. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has said the results were a \u201cshocker\u201d. \u201cThis is an f for fail in Australia for education,\u201d he said this morning. \u201cWe\u2019re falling so far behind our competitors. We live in a globalised world, we can\u2019t afford to be going backwards.\u201d Education minister Dan Tehan said simply injecting more money into the system was not the answer. \u201cI think we all now realise that equally important is school results and outcomes, that now needs to be the focus,\u201d Tehan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put aside this obsession that some have of money, money, money.\u201d Here\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting from today. The GDP figures are out this morning, about 11.30am. The numbers are expected to be less than rosy for the government, given the last figures put Australia\u2019s growth at the lowest level since 2009. Labor has been leading its attack on the government this week with criticism of its economic mismanagement. Protests over the Murray Darling Basin plan are continuing to spur debate in parliament. The protesters are angry over their lack of access to water under the plan and want it scrapped. There was a little bit of movement yesterday when drought minister David Littleproud announced a review. The Nationals have been having a torrid time with it. Pictures of Michael McCormack being given a healthy serve outside parliament have been played ad nauseam on TV and radio. Not a great look. Debate will continue on the medevac repeal bill. We\u2019re still none the wiser on Jacqui Lambie\u2019s position, which will be critical in deciding the fate of medevac. Lambie\u2019s demands are still unclear, though she did last night make a fiery speech in the Senate about inaction on Chinese government interference. Angus Taylor will be back in some form, I can assure you of that. Whether it\u2019s the grasslands controversy, the forged documents controversy, the Naomi Wolf controversy, the phone call controversy, the pecuniary interests controversy, or some other unknown controversy yet to emerge. I\u2019ve never said controversy so many times in a single sentence and doubt I ever will again. We\u2019re also likely to hear some debate over the terrible school results out today. Australia recorded the sharpest falls in performance of any country in the Program for International Student Assessment. Hello friends and welcome to the last sitting Wednesday of the year. We\u2019re expecting another busy one, likely dominated by economics (GDP figures are out), further debate on the medevac bill, the Murray Darling Basin, Chinese influence and, of course, your man Angus Taylor, who is hard pressed to find a way out of the news at the moment. Grab a cuppa and settle in.",

At more than 900 pages, the book spans the \u201cred century\u201d, reaching into the 21st, from the rare vantage point of a subjugated republic on the fringes of the Russian and Soviet empires, the \u201cbalcony of Europe\u201d. When I was artistic director of the UK\u2019s first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/09/politics-upstages-art-as-georgias-writers-reflect-on-25-years-independence\" title=\"\">festival of Georgian writers</a>, I realised how Georgia\u2019s complex history is often wrongly conflated with Russia\u2019s \u2013 despite having its own language and alphabet. <em>The Eighth Life (for Brilka)</em>, originally published in German in 2014, has the heft and sweep to overturn such misconceptions, while introducing the uninitiated to a beguiling culture. A subtle and compelling translation by Charlotte Collins and Ruth Martin (on the heels of a Georgian version earlier this year) should make this as great a literary phenomenon in English as it has been in German \u2013 most recently winning the 2018 Bertolt Brecht prize.</p> <p>Niza Jashi, in her early 30s, is the fifth of six generations of the Jashi family, whose saga she writes down in Germany (where the Georgian-born Haratischvili lives) for her 12-year-old niece Brilka. Arranged in eight \u201cbooks\u201d, the \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d of family history begins with Niza\u2019s great-great-grandfather, a master chocolatier. Protagonists include her great-grandmother Stasia, an aspiring dancer whose marriage to a White Guard turned Red Lieutenant takes her to St Petersburg; their son Kostya, who follows his father into the navy; and their daughter Kitty, who flees treason charges to become a dissident singer-songwriter in Britain. Kostya\u2019s wayward daughter Elene is mother to Niza and her half-sister Daria.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are echoes down the generations, from dancers' thwarted dreams to devastated loves, and passion between women</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>From Tbilisi and Moscow to London and Berlin, their lives are vividly enmeshed with world events, from the rise and fall of the Soviet empire to the siege of Leningrad and the Prague spring. Yet what has been hailed as a Georgian <em>War and Peace</em> has more in common with G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/oct/07/the-tin-drum-gunter-grass\" title=\"\">The Tin Drum</a></em>. Far from omniscient, Niza\u2019s narrative is an imaginative feat to set against the historical gaps and silences left by state propaganda and trauma, in \u201ca century that cheated and deceived everyone\u201d. All but one of its books centre on women in the family, with their own perspective on the workings of totalitarianism and naked power.</p> <p>Off stage, the \u201cmillionfold murderer\u201d Stalin is not named but referred to as Joseph, Soso, Kobo, Generalissimus. His henchman Lavrenti Beria \u2013 also Georgian \u2013 does appear, as a short man with pince-nez known only as Little Big Man. Head of the secret police or NKVD, he is a sexual predator, torturer and Stalin sycophant down to his taste for Georgian Khvanchkara wine. Little Big Man\u2019s stalking of Stasia\u2019s porcelain-complexioned sister Christine, whom he rapes in a box at the opera, is one of many chilling vignettes on naked power. A perverse, irrevocable act by Christine\u2019s disillusioned utopian husband, to save his wife, illustrates how absolute power not only corrupts those who wield it but corrodes the moral codes of those in their orbit. Some clues indicate that Kostya\u2019s friend Georgi Alani, a Soviet attache in London tasked with \u201crepatriating\u201d fugitives, may be Little Big Man\u2019s illegitimate son. Yet Alani\u2019s ambiguous path explores culpability, atonement and redemption in a novel that is also about fate and free will.</p> <p>There are echoes down the generations, from the thwarted dreams of dancers and poets to devastated loves, and passion between women. Several characters crave Vienna as fervently as Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters pine for Moscow \u2013 a longing that (like the chocolatier\u2019s confections) embodies the European dreams Georgia shelved during 70 years of Soviet rule. Yet Kostya, the patriarch basking in nomenklatura privilege, is scathing about Georgian claims to victimhood: \u201cWhat a comfortable life the Georgian elite \u2013 including the intelligentsia \u2013 had established for themselves in their little piece of paradise.\u201d The less privileged Eristavi family fare worse as fall guys in the Gulag.</p> <p>Moments of melodrama are balanced by the novel\u2019s psychological acuity, intimating, for instance, that torture and rape chambers, like battlefields, can be survived but never left. Of her assault by a Mkhedrioni militiaman, Niza writes: \u201cI remember everything, but I don\u2019t remember what I felt through it all.\u201d Such numbness also afflicts a country trapped in the repetitions of history. The Red Army invasion that curtails Georgia\u2019s first republic of 1918-21 finds a brutal echo in Tbilisi on 9 April 1989, when Soviet troops bludgeon peaceful demonstrators to death with shovels. Stalin\u2019s saviour complex after Nazi defeat (\u201cvictors are forgiven everything\u201d) threatens to live on in a succession of post-communist leaders.But the novel\u2019s eighth book is left blank \u2013 perhaps as a tabula rasa on which Brilke might rewrite her destiny and that of her homeland.</p> <p>Niza\u2019s carnivalesque \u201ccarpet\u201d is knotted together with the aid of such literary conventions as a family recipe for hot chocolate as accursed as it is addictive, and a grandmother visited by spirits. Yet these devices seem less convincing than the finely plotted correspondences and illuminating historical grasp. Patterns in the blood-red rug leap out at the reader long after this momentous book is closed.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Follow Maya Jaggi on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mayajaggi?lang=en\">@MayaJaggi</a>.

When I was artistic director of the UK\u2019s first festival of Georgian writers, I realised how Georgia\u2019s complex history is often wrongly conflated with Russia\u2019s \u2013 despite having its own language and alphabet. The Eighth Life (for Brilka), originally published in German in 2014, has the heft and sweep to overturn such misconceptions, while introducing the uninitiated to a beguiling culture. A subtle and compelling translation by Charlotte Collins and Ruth Martin (on the heels of a Georgian version earlier this year) should make this as great a literary phenomenon in English as it has been in German \u2013 most recently winning the 2018 Bertolt Brecht prize. Niza Jashi, in her early 30s, is the fifth of six generations of the Jashi family, whose saga she writes down in Germany (where the Georgian-born Haratischvili lives) for her 12-year-old niece Brilka. Arranged in eight \u201cbooks\u201d, the \u201cbeautiful puzzle\u201d of family history begins with Niza\u2019s great-great-grandfather, a master chocolatier. Protagonists include her great-grandmother Stasia, an aspiring dancer whose marriage to a White Guard turned Red Lieutenant takes her to St Petersburg; their son Kostya, who follows his father into the navy; and their daughter Kitty, who flees treason charges to become a dissident singer-songwriter in Britain. Kostya\u2019s wayward daughter Elene is mother to Niza and her half-sister Daria. From Tbilisi and Moscow to London and Berlin, their lives are vividly enmeshed with world events, from the rise and fall of the Soviet empire to the siege of Leningrad and the Prague spring. Yet what has been hailed as a Georgian War and Peace has more in common with G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s The Tin Drum. Far from omniscient, Niza\u2019s narrative is an imaginative feat to set against the historical gaps and silences left by state propaganda and trauma, in \u201ca century that cheated and deceived everyone\u201d. All but one of its books centre on women in the family, with their own perspective on the workings of totalitarianism and naked power. Off stage, the \u201cmillionfold murderer\u201d Stalin is not named but referred to as Joseph, Soso, Kobo, Generalissimus. His henchman Lavrenti Beria \u2013 also Georgian \u2013 does appear, as a short man with pince-nez known only as Little Big Man. Head of the secret police or NKVD, he is a sexual predator, torturer and Stalin sycophant down to his taste for Georgian Khvanchkara wine. Little Big Man\u2019s stalking of Stasia\u2019s porcelain-complexioned sister Christine, whom he rapes in a box at the opera, is one of many chilling vignettes on naked power. A perverse, irrevocable act by Christine\u2019s disillusioned utopian husband, to save his wife, illustrates how absolute power not only corrupts those who wield it but corrodes the moral codes of those in their orbit. Some clues indicate that Kostya\u2019s friend Georgi Alani, a Soviet attache in London tasked with \u201crepatriating\u201d fugitives, may be Little Big Man\u2019s illegitimate son. Yet Alani\u2019s ambiguous path explores culpability, atonement and redemption in a novel that is also about fate and free will. There are echoes down the generations, from the thwarted dreams of dancers and poets to devastated loves, and passion between women. Several characters crave Vienna as fervently as Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters pine for Moscow \u2013 a longing that (like the chocolatier\u2019s confections) embodies the European dreams Georgia shelved during 70 years of Soviet rule. Yet Kostya, the patriarch basking in nomenklatura privilege, is scathing about Georgian claims to victimhood: \u201cWhat a comfortable life the Georgian elite \u2013 including the intelligentsia \u2013 had established for themselves in their little piece of paradise.\u201d The less privileged Eristavi family fare worse as fall guys in the Gulag. Moments of melodrama are balanced by the novel\u2019s psychological acuity, intimating, for instance, that torture and rape chambers, like battlefields, can be survived but never left. Of her assault by a Mkhedrioni militiaman, Niza writes: \u201cI remember everything, but I don\u2019t remember what I felt through it all.\u201d Such numbness also afflicts a country trapped in the repetitions of history. The Red Army invasion that curtails Georgia\u2019s first republic of 1918-21 finds a brutal echo in Tbilisi on 9 April 1989, when Soviet troops bludgeon peaceful demonstrators to death with shovels. Stalin\u2019s saviour complex after Nazi defeat (\u201cvictors are forgiven everything\u201d) threatens to live on in a succession of post-communist leaders.But the novel\u2019s eighth book is left blank \u2013 perhaps as a tabula rasa on which Brilke might rewrite her destiny and that of her homeland. Niza\u2019s carnivalesque \u201ccarpet\u201d is knotted together with the aid of such literary conventions as a family recipe for hot chocolate as accursed as it is addictive, and a grandmother visited by spirits. Yet these devices seem less convincing than the finely plotted correspondences and illuminating historical grasp. Patterns in the blood-red rug leap out at the reader long after this momentous book is closed. \u2022 Follow Maya Jaggi on Twitter @MayaJaggi.

The comedian Jacqueline Novak made a solo show about blow jobs and David Cale wrote a one-man musical about the murder of his mother by his father, and each, in diametric opposition, was absolutely exhilarating, as was Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s victory-lap tour of Fleabag, which spotlighted both her character\u2019s pain and her own consummate artistry. In an age and a city where just about everything can be next-day delivered or streamed from the sofa, these were vitalizing reminders that live theater is still worth the trip. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 December 2019.

Nordmann describes the shift as similar to how PowerPoint transformed presentations. \u201cThey\u2019ve now become ubiquitous,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the comparison we\u2019re looking at.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m ushered into what looks like an upright glass coffin, told to fold my hands across my chest in the classic corpse position \u2013 and then push a green button. I\u2019m wondering exactly what I\u2019ve got myself into when the trapdoor falls open and I plummet into a tube of fast-flowing water. It\u2019s up my nose, in my mouth; I can\u2019t see and can hardly breathe for a few tumultuous seconds before the gradient of the water slide reduces from vertical to merely steep and I\u2019m propelled around more bends and spat out at the bottom. I feel like I\u2019ve been flushed down a toilet.</p> <p>The Vildf\u00e5l is one of the more extreme experiences at the new Rulantica indoor water park, which opened on 28 November. Half an hour\u2019s drive north of Freiburg im Breisgau in south-west Germany, it\u2019s next to Europa-Park, the country\u2019s largest theme park. Both are owned by the Mack family, a dynasty of entrepreneurs who have been enticing visitors to this corner of the Black Forest since 1975. In building the \u20ac180m Rulantica, the family has made its biggest single investment to date.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/dec/2019-12-03T15:15:26.html\" data-alt=\"map of Europa Park, Germany, and surrounding area.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/dec/2019-12-03T15:15:26.html\">map of Europa Park, Germany, and surrounding area.</a> </figure>  <p>The idea for a water park came from Europa-Park customers, according to Thomas Mack, co-managing director. In making the suggestion a reality, the family hopes the theme park\u2019s 5.6 million annual visitors (95% are German, French or Swiss) will want to sample Rulantica, too, and will stay a little longer in one of the resort\u2019s hotels. There are now six of these, the Kr\u00f8nas\u00e5r having opened next to Rulantica earlier this year. Ticketed separately, the water park also gives customers a reason to visit year-round \u2013 while Europa-Park closes for a couple of months in winter, Rulantica will remain open all year (online prices: adults \u20ac38.50, 4-11 \u20ac35.50, under-4s free).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"767c9973d27c91d29ee084d27831f211e5e6bb76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/767c9973d27c91d29ee084d27831f211e5e6bb76/0_36_2559_1535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Riders\u2019 prepare for the Vildf\u00e5l experience at Rulantica, Europa-Park, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Riders\u2019 prepare for the Vildf\u00e5l experience.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hans-Joerg Haas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Twenty years in the planning, construction took 26 months and was completed on time by project manager Charles R Botta. The result is a 32,600 sq m shell-shaped indoor space styled as a mythical island, with different activity areas grouped around a central wave pool, and an additional area outdoors. Instead of the usual water park decor of palm trees and pirate ships, Rulantica is inspired by Scandinavia. Waterfalls trickle over rocks, trolls populate a playground for small children, and a lazy river drifts under stalactites through a cave, where mermaids and fish hang out with Snorri \u2013 the park\u2019s octopus mascot \u2013 in a projected animation.</p> <p>It\u2019s an appropriate theme for a park that prides itself on its eco-credentials. Rulantica\u2019s green measures include 3,000 solar modules on the covered car park and a filter system enabling 80% of the wastewater from its pools to be recycled. Steps were taken during construction to protect animal and plant habitats around the park, including creating a bat corridor and a bee pavilion \u2013 the resulting honey is available in the Kr\u00f8nas\u00e5r hotel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3d09a10badea0875e3f71893ca53afe6ca21dc3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d09a10badea0875e3f71893ca53afe6ca21dc3d/93_69_1058_635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of the Rulantica site with the Kr\u00f8nas\u00e5r hotel seen back left.

I climb a stairway and discover a door to some outdoor rapids. A beached steamship turns out to contain a set of family-friendly slides and a swim-up bar in the Skog Lagune (lagoon) is a pleasant spot to sip a cocktail in a whirlpool bed, despite one couple treating it as snog lagoon.</p> <p>There are 17 water slides, from entry-level thrills for tots to the full toilet-flush experience. I try out the Isbrekker, two short slides ending with a 1.5-metre drop into a pool, and the Stormvind, where I sit on a raft on which I\u2019m sucked down a tube into a giant whirlpool.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m ushered into what looks like an upright glass coffin, told to fold my hands across my chest in the classic corpse position \u2013 and then push a green button. I\u2019m wondering exactly what I\u2019ve got myself into when the trapdoor falls open and I plummet into a tube of fast-flowing water. It\u2019s up my nose, in my mouth; I can\u2019t see and can hardly breathe for a few tumultuous seconds before the gradient of the water slide reduces from vertical to merely steep and I\u2019m propelled around more bends and spat out at the bottom. I feel like I\u2019ve been flushed down a toilet. The Vildf\u00e5l is one of the more extreme experiences at the new Rulantica indoor water park, which opened on 28 November. Half an hour\u2019s drive north of Freiburg im Breisgau in south-west Germany, it\u2019s next to Europa-Park, the country\u2019s largest theme park. Both are owned by the Mack family, a dynasty of entrepreneurs who have been enticing visitors to this corner of the Black Forest since 1975. In building the \u20ac180m Rulantica, the family has made its biggest single investment to date. The idea for a water park came from Europa-Park customers, according to Thomas Mack, co-managing director. In making the suggestion a reality, the family hopes the theme park\u2019s 5.6 million annual visitors (95% are German, French or Swiss) will want to sample Rulantica, too, and will stay a little longer in one of the resort\u2019s hotels. There are now six of these, the Kr\u00f8nas\u00e5r having opened next to Rulantica earlier this year. Ticketed separately, the water park also gives customers a reason to visit year-round \u2013 while Europa-Park closes for a couple of months in winter, Rulantica will remain open all year (online prices: adults \u20ac38.50, 4-11 \u20ac35.50, under-4s free). Twenty years in the planning, construction took 26 months and was completed on time by project manager Charles R Botta. The result is a 32,600 sq m shell-shaped indoor space styled as a mythical island, with different activity areas grouped around a central wave pool, and an additional area outdoors. Instead of the usual water park decor of palm trees and pirate ships, Rulantica is inspired by Scandinavia. Waterfalls trickle over rocks, trolls populate a playground for small children, and a lazy river drifts under stalactites through a cave, where mermaids and fish hang out with Snorri \u2013 the park\u2019s octopus mascot \u2013 in a projected animation. It\u2019s an appropriate theme for a park that prides itself on its eco-credentials. Rulantica\u2019s green measures include 3,000 solar modules on the covered car park and a filter system enabling 80% of the wastewater from its pools to be recycled. Steps were taken during construction to protect animal and plant habitats around the park, including creating a bat corridor and a bee pavilion \u2013 the resulting honey is available in the Kr\u00f8nas\u00e5r hotel. I forget to pick up a map but it\u2019s fun to explore without. I climb a stairway and discover a door to some outdoor rapids. A beached steamship turns out to contain a set of family-friendly slides and a swim-up bar in the Skog Lagune (lagoon) is a pleasant spot to sip a cocktail in a whirlpool bed, despite one couple treating it as snog lagoon. There are 17 water slides, from entry-level thrills for tots to the full toilet-flush experience. I try out the Isbrekker, two short slides ending with a 1.5-metre drop into a pool, and the Stormvind, where I sit on a raft on which I\u2019m sucked down a tube into a giant whirlpool. My favourite \u2013 and many others\u2019, judging by the queue \u2013 is the Vinter Rytt, where up to four people cling to an inflatable as it plunges down a vertiginous tunnel before sliding up a sheer wall and back down again, bringing a moment of weightlessness. The park is designed for relaxation as much as adrenaline.

Each person who comes through the door is offered a hot drink and some toast while they tell volunteers their reasons for being there. A teacher has turned up to ask for a package for a young boy\u2019s family. He arrived at school three days in a row without having had breakfast. When she called the child\u2019s parents, she says his mother broke down in tears saying, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to feed my children.\u201d A woman comes in and says she has recently been moved on to universal credit.

She doesn\u2019t know how she will get through the festive period.</p> <p>The closer we get to Christmas, the busier it gets. <a href=\"https://westonfavellcentre.foodbank.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The food bank </a>is only open on a Wednesday morning and at least 10 volunteers turn up every week to help the three part-time staff.

The food bank will be closed from Christmas Eve until the new year but on one of the last days of opening , a man and his son turn up with bags full of food and toiletries. Their family decided to donate to the food bank rather than buying presents for each other. Most donations come from individuals so there are times when supplies run low, especially of particular items such astoilet rolls, nappies and longlife milk.</p> <p><em>Number of parcels issued: 190</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/13/more-people-than-ever-turning-to-food-banks-charity-says\">More people than ever turning to food banks, charity says</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>January 2019<br></h2> <p>Staff thought that things would quieten down after Christmas but the impact of universal credit is starting to be felt and it has become normal for a long queue of people to be waiting outside before the doors open at 10am.

A man in insecure work has rent arrears that he previously paid \u00a35 a week towards clearing. After being moved to universal credit, he now has to pay \u00a3127 a month.

After a run of bad luck, they have ended up sleeping in a car. She says it was so cold one night that there was ice on the inside of the window when they woke up. Volunteers signpost them to various support services and tell them to keep returning until the situation is resolved.

He\u2019s helped down to the bus stop but from there he is alone. The volunteers work incredibly hard. It can be both physically and emotionally tiring. When they are not moving heavy boxes and bags, they are listening to people in crisis.

She\u2019s come to the food bank with her manager from work because she needs some support.</p> <p>She says she\u2019s never been in such a bad position, even when she was unemployed. \u201cThe bills are adding up and I\u2019ve been charged by the bank for unpaid direct debits.

Each person who comes through the door is offered a hot drink and some toast while they tell volunteers their reasons for being there. A teacher has turned up to ask for a package for a young boy\u2019s family. He arrived at school three days in a row without having had breakfast. When she called the child\u2019s parents, she says his mother broke down in tears saying, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to feed my children.\u201d A woman comes in and says she has recently been moved on to universal credit. She received her last payment from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in mid-November and has been told not to expect anything else until 12 January. She doesn\u2019t know how she will get through the festive period. The closer we get to Christmas, the busier it gets. The food bank is only open on a Wednesday morning and at least 10 volunteers turn up every week to help the three part-time staff. During one session a small boy of about five approaches me and asks quietly if there is any turkey so that he can have a Christmas dinner. Amid all the desperation, there are moments of light. The food bank will be closed from Christmas Eve until the new year but on one of the last days of opening , a man and his son turn up with bags full of food and toiletries.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. With just over a week to go, Labour has turned to retail politics, trying to sell the country on the financial benefit of its policies \u2013 while the prime minister does his best to dodge his old friend Donald Trump out of fear the president could say something that might hurt his election chances. We have the best of other news \u2013 including the Trump impeachment report \u2013 and you can read rolling updates of the day\u2019s political news at our live blog. What\u2019s going on? Labour will today try to convince voters of the financial benefit of electing a Corbyn government. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say his party\u2019s policies would save families an average of \u00a36,700 a year by \u201cputting a stop to rip-off Britain\u201d as Labour narrows its focus to bread-and-butter issues. In a dossier to be published alongside the speech, McDonnell will claim that policies including nationalising utilities and reducing the cost of rail season tickets \u2013 as well as free childcare for all two- to four-year-olds, free prescription charges and free school meals \u2013 would help the hip pocket of average households. However, Labour candidates are privately concerned about the scattergun nature of the giveaways, with one saying the manifesto, while good, is \u201cjust long and confusing\u201d and some promises could appear too good to be true. Trump\u2019s presence in the UK for Nato talks continues to loom over the election. The summit started with heated exchanges and further tensions are expected as leaders meet again today. Trump is seen as an electoral liability for the Conservatives over fears that he may be interested in putting the NHS on the table in US-UK trade talks \u2013 though yesterday the president categorically denied the US was interested in the health service. Boris Johnson has so far managed to keep his distance from the US president, with Marina Hyde writing that Johnson will continue to studiously avoid the president because \u201cTories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed\u201d. At a glance Both Labour and Tory migration plans \u201cwould worsen NHS staffing\u201d, says the Nuffield Trust. The Tories have announced \u00a34bn for public transport in the Midlands and north. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Labour member and my family has always voted Labour,\u201d says Michael O\u2019Neill, but he is one of many in Bishop Auckland expected to vote Conservative for the first time. Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for antisemitic incidents in his party, with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby succeeding where Andrew Neil failed. Maybe it was the sofa, writes John Crace. Steve Coogan and Naomi Klein are among cultural figures who say they will be voting Labour, in a letter published in the Guardian. And a story to give you a chuckle over your breakfast: a Tory councillor climbed some bins and scaled a school fence to escape a climate crisis debate after she met with a crowd unimpressed with her answers. The day ahead The prime minister\u2019s time will be split between campaigning in the home counties and hosting leaders for the Nato summit. Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning in the East Midlands, while John McDonnell gives a speech on the economy in the West Midlands outlining how Labour\u2019s policies will save average people money. In the Lib Dem camp, Jo Swinson will visit a youth centre in London and then sit down for her Andrew Neil interview, which will be broadcast at 7.30pm. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, will speak at a public meeting in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire in the morning while the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, will campaign in Edinburgh and the Ulster Unionist party will launch its manifesto in Belfast.

Best of the rest &gt; The US House intelligence committee has voted to adopt Democrats\u2019 damning 300-page impeachment report, moving the inquiry into Donald Trump\u2019s conduct towards its next phase. Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d, the report concludes. It all goes to the judiciary committee next, and then the full House could vote on articles of impeachment by the end of the year. &gt; Thousands of people in the UK are having their appendix removed unnecessarily, surgeons say.

The quartet are Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani. Guardian art critic Adrian Searle says that for an award with a colourful history this year\u2019s result could be the upset to end them all.

Lunchtime read: Attack of the drones The technology of swarming \u2013 drones deployed in squadrons, able to think independently and operate as a pack \u2013 is in its infancy, but armed forces around the world, including in the UK, are investing millions of pounds in its development. Israel is already using hordes of drones to overwhelm Syrian air defences, and they have been directed at Russian forces in Syria as well as oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. According to analysts, drone swarms of the future could have the capacity to assess targets, divide up tasks and execute them with limited human interaction, writes Michael Safi. Sport Pep Guardiola stated it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d for Manchester City to think about retaining the title due to the deficit to Liverpool, which is eight points after Tuesday\u2019s win at Burnley.

The British &amp; Irish Lions are poised to announce the schedule for their eight\u2011match tour to South Africa in 2021 but a proposed warm-up game against the Barbarians at Twickenham remains up in the air. Tiger Woods has said he rejected the opportunity to play in a European Tour event in Saudi Arabia for the second year in succession but defended Phil Mickelson\u2019s decision to travel to the Middle East. For the second time in less than two years England\u2019s Test team have left New Zealand with a 1-0 series defeat to show for their efforts as a supposed new era got off to a flat start. Dozens of Bordeaux fans stormed onto the pitch during their Ligue 1 match against N\u00eemes, forcing the game to be halted for 25 minutes before coming back on and winning 6-0. And the 2019 Formula One Esports series will come to a climax at a shopping centre in west London today, with prize money of $500,000 (\u00a3385,000) up for grabs. Business Asian shares sold off heavily overnight after Donald Trump surprised traders by saying that a trade deal with China could wait until after next year\u2019s presidential election. The uncertainty was compounded when the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could require Trump to sanction members of the politburo for their treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Beijing reacted furiously. The FTSE100 is set open flat despite the excitement in Asia while the pound edged above $1.30 and is sitting at \u20ac1.173. The papers What Donald Trump said about the NHS, and whether you\u2019d believe him, is the theme today. The Sun\u2019s position seems to be that if the president said it, it must be true: \u201cTrump thumps chump over NHS lies\u201d. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want NHS on silver platter\u201d says the Express. \u201cWe have no interest in the NHS\u201d is the Telegraph\u2019s splash headline. The Guardian reports that the Labour leader intends to press the president over his trade machinations. The paper\u2019s headline is \u201cCorbyn ups pressure over NHS as Trump rows back\u201d. The Metro splashes with \u201cCorbyn casts doubt on Trump\u2019s NHS pledge\u201d and adds in a subhead that Tories admit medicines from US drug companies could cost more after Brexit. \u201cWe\u2019ll force tech firms to pay more, says PM\u201d is the take in the Times on Boris Johnson\u2019s pledge to have the Googles and the Facebooks of the world make a \u201cfairer contribution\u201d, which the paper says runs the risk of a rift with Trump who has threatened France with tariffs for doing the same. The Mail sounds the alarm bell over a \u201cDeadly gamble on our health\u201d as an NHS report ties online betting in with social scourges including heavy drinking, obesity and chronic disease. \u201cLabour to put \u00a36,176 in your pocket\u201d says the Mirror as it tots up the benefits of Corbyn\u2019s plans to end \u201crip-off Britain\u201d.

I\u2019ve always wanted to do it, because I think there are not a lot of people like me in film or on TV.\u201d She does believe there are more and more different kinds of women on screen. She loves Orange Is the New Black, for example. \u201cYou see fat women and old women and queer women and butch women. That\u2019s who I am, right? Old, fat, butch, grey-haired.

I believe this wouldn\u2019t have happened in my 20s. It wouldn\u2019t have happened in my 40s.\u201d Much of the story of Work in Progress is about Abby, the character, finding opportunities to live, when she has just about given up hope. \u201cI think the story is really based on my life.\u201d</p> <p>What everybody wants to know, of course, is how much of it is true. \u201cNow, my answer is, it depends what time of day it is, and who\u2019s asking,\u201d McEnany laughs. \u201cEveryone has terrible moments, I\u2019m a human being, but I hope I\u2019m not <em>as</em> terrible.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, the truth comes from what she calls the \u201cmessiness\u201d of Abby. \u201cI have mental illness, I struggle with a bunch of stuff, I try to be an honest person and open, but it\u2019s scary. The character\u2019s been beaten down and has sworn off relationships and is struggling. I\u2019ve had times in my life where I\u2019m so depressed and stuck.\u201d Her parents first took her to therapy when she was in eighth grade. \u201cI had my first panic attack at five, and you don\u2019t have the words at five. When I started exhibiting OCD, it wasn\u2019t really in the lexicon like it is now.

Some of the funniest moments that I\u2019ve had with my family are in that horrible three and a half years that my mom was dying. There was weirdly a lot of healing in that time.\u201d</p> <p>Work In Progress is a deft blend of wry pessimism and tenderness, particularly in its central love story between Abby and a younger trans man, Chris (The Politician\u2019s Theo Germaine). \u201cIt\u2019s based on a real-life romance that I had. I was actually just talking with my ex this morning, and they\u2019re coming to the premiere here in Chicago,\u201d she explains. As the couple\u2019s relationship begins, Chris takes Abby to a queer party. \u201cWhen I was writing it, I was like, this can be a queer wonderland. There\u2019s gonna be performances, art, sex toys, leather, and it\u2019s going to be this wonderful coming together of queerness and diversity and openness and expression. I define myself as a person as a sex-positive prude,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd this is such an opening of the character\u2019s eyes. Her whole life is opening up and other opportunities are coming to the fore, and Chris is the vehicle for that, for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, Saturday Night Live alumnus Julia Sweeney has a recurring role as herself. In the early 90s, Sweeney created the androgynous SNL character, Pat, largely based on the gag that nobody knew Pat\u2019s gender. \u201cOne of my stories in that storytelling show was that Julia Sweeney\u2019s Pat made my life a living hell,\u201d McEnany says. \u201cI was starting to wear a lot of overalls, I was masculine, big, fat \u2013 my weight fluctuates a lot \u2013 and people would be calling me Pat. And if you\u2019re called Pat, nobody\u2019s giving you a compliment.\u201d She remembers being in a lesbian bar in the late 90s, being called Pat. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wow, this is supposed to be a safe space and I\u2019m being judged for what I look like? It\u2019s hateful. Where do I get a break? It really defeated me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbe8160ac659514182d4581d9dc3eb583ee99dc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbe8160ac659514182d4581d9dc3eb583ee99dc8/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cI think the story is really based on my life,\u201d says Abyy McEnany of Work in Progress.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think the story is really based on my life,\u2019 says Abyy McEnany of Work in Progress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of SHOWTIME/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the fictional Abby runs into Julia Sweeney in a bar, the shock of finally confronting her nemesis after so many years causes her to pass out. The real Julia Sweeney used to live in Chicago, and McEnany and Mason reached out to her through a mutual friend. \u201cShe was so supportive, she was on board from the very beginning. And she\u2019s been such a genuine joy,\u201d she says. Did it give her chance to readdress Pat herself? \u201cI think so. I love her openness about it. She had an opportunity, and we had an opportunity.\u201d In fact, they got on so well that when they were unsure whether Work in Progress would be picked up, Sweeney invited McEnany to live with her in Los Angeles. \u201cI cannot tell you how much I love her.\u201d</p> <p>Like McEnany, Work in Progress is a true original, and it marks the arrival of an important new voice. But there is one question left to answer. How close is she to bringing back \u201cwassup?\u201d \u201cOh man! I\u2019ve been working on that for about 10 years,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI would say I\u2019ll start a <a href=\"http://change.org/\">change.org</a> petition to get that back. But I haven\u2019t started it yet.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Work in Progress starts on Showtime in the US on 8 December and in the UK at a later date</p></li> </ul>",

And if you\u2019re called Pat, nobody\u2019s giving you a compliment.\u201d She remembers being in a lesbian bar in the late 90s, being called Pat. \u201cIt\u2019s like, wow, this is supposed to be a safe space and I\u2019m being judged for what I look like? It\u2019s hateful. Where do I get a break? It really defeated me.\u201d When the fictional Abby runs into Julia Sweeney in a bar, the shock of finally confronting her nemesis after so many years causes her to pass out. The real Julia Sweeney used to live in Chicago, and McEnany and Mason reached out to her through a mutual friend. \u201cShe was so supportive, she was on board from the very beginning. And she\u2019s been such a genuine joy,\u201d she says. Did it give her chance to readdress Pat herself? \u201cI think so. I love her openness about it. She had an opportunity, and we had an opportunity.\u201d In fact, they got on so well that when they were unsure whether Work in Progress would be picked up, Sweeney invited McEnany to live with her in Los Angeles. \u201cI cannot tell you how much I love her.\u201d Like McEnany, Work in Progress is a true original, and it marks the arrival of an important new voice. But there is one question left to answer. How close is she to bringing back \u201cwassup?\u201d \u201cOh man! I\u2019ve been working on that for about 10 years,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI would say I\u2019ll start a change.org petition to get that back. But I haven\u2019t started it yet.\u201d Work in Progress starts on Showtime in the US on 8 December and in the UK at a later date",

It was 16 and a half pounds (7.5kg), she says, her<strong> </strong>eyes glittering. \u201cI wrote more,\u201d she says. \u201cWe cut a lot.\u201d Her then editor made her take out a whole chapter \u2013 the one that followed her character Blackie O\u2019Neill through the first world war (he was a friend to the book\u2019s heroine, the kitchen maid turned retail tycoon Emma Harte). \u201cI really fought this. But she took it out, and I was infuriated.\u201d</p> <p>It occurs to Bradford, with the 40th anniversary edition of the book on the table in front of us, that the chapter might have made its way back in. \u201cI never thought of looking,\u201d she says, flicking through the 800-plus pages, then she starts reading aloud. She looks up and says excitedly: \u201cWhat a good beginning!\u201d Then she goes back to it. Goodness, I think, she\u2019s going to read the whole thing. A well-timed waiter comes to our table at the Dorchester hotel to pour tea; she closes the book, greets him by name and they have a chat.</p> <p>Bradford is fantastic company. She fizzes<strong> </strong>with charisma, and because she seems to enjoy talking about herself, she makes a great interviewee, although \u2013 storyteller that she is \u2013 she can go on. Try to get her off a subject and she\u2019ll solicitously pause to answer, then pick up where she left off. She is 86 and looks glorious. Her hair is beautifully styled, her eyes as sparkly as her jewellery. It feels as if there is no subject off-limits. Ask her about the sex scenes in her latest book \u2013 her women are as lustful as the male characters \u2013 and she smiles and says: \u201cOh, I love sex, don\u2019t you?\u201d The only subject she won\u2019t talk about is politics, at the request of her publisher who once received a letter from a reader who said she\u2019d never buy another Barbara Taylor Bradford book again after Bradford said <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/barbara-taylor-bradford-when-i-was-young-almost-every-man-i-ever-met-made-a-pass-at-me-7v2n2c7v9\" title=\"\">nice things about Theresa May</a> in an interview. (Bradford\u2019s heroine is Margaret Thatcher; in the US, where she has lived since the 60s, she is a Republican.) Surely she must have stories about Donald Trump? Didn\u2019t they mix in the same wealthy New York circles? (Bradford is worth a reported \u00a3160m.) \u201cHe lent us his boardroom,\u201d she says, referring to her charity work. \u201cHe was normal, he was nice. I think it\u2019s when he gets in front of a microphone he starts to \u2026\u201d For the first time, she doesn\u2019t finish a sentence.</p> <p>The day we speak, it has been announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/22/barbara-taylor-bradford-writing-prequel-a-woman-of-substance\" title=\"\">Bradford is to revisit A Woman of Substance in the form of a prequel</a>, although we are meeting because she has written another book, In the Lion\u2019s Den, which she wrote in a year. It is Bradford\u2019s 34th book, and the second part of a trilogy, following James Falconer, a barrow boy turned businessman. She was scheduled to write the third book next, but suddenly it was beyond her \u2013 in July, Robert Bradford, her husband of 55 years, died after a stroke. \u201cI knew that he wasn\u2019t going to live and [I was thinking] how would I cope with all that was going to happen?\u201d she says. She sat by his bed, in shock, for the week he was in hospital, and in the quiet of the room worked out the storyline of her prequel to A Woman of Substance. Next month, she will get to work on it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e1fc4ea1291d8aedb632bcfa06631d7748d6683\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e1fc4ea1291d8aedb632bcfa06631d7748d6683/0_63_3336_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With her late husband, Bob, in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her late husband, Bob, in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick McMullan via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In preparation, she reread every book Blackie and Emma appeared in or were mentioned in (there are several). \u201cWhen I read [her 1988 novel] To Be the Best, I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d written it and I couldn\u2019t help but think what a good book this is,\u201d she says with a laugh, then adds, \u201cand very sexy! And all I could think at the end was these women are all working hard. They\u2019re all driven, ambitious and disciplined. I\u2019ve written about myself in every book.\u201d She looks thrilled with the discovery.</p> <p>Bradford was brought up in a suburb of Leeds, a cherished only child (her older brother died before she was born). Her father was an engineer, and her mother took charge of her development, encouraging her to read Dickens and others. A biography of Bradford, published a few years ago, came up with the tantalising idea that her mother was the illegitimate daughter of a local marquis. When Bradford was 10, her mother sent one of Bradford\u2019s stories off to a magazine, and \u2013 after it appeared in print, and she was paid for it \u2013 she was hooked. At 15, she joined the Yorkshire Evening Post as a typist, but persuaded the editor to take her on as a reporter. At 18, she was editing its women\u2019s pages, and at 20 she was a columnist on the London Evening News. \u201cI was very, very driven from the age of 10. That\u2019s what I wanted to be \u2013 a reporter,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She met Bob on a blind date in 1961, and they married two years later. He was \u201cmovie-star gorgeous\u201d, she says, and was already a rich and successful film producer. She moved with him back to New York, and started writing novels. Between them, they amassed a fortune \u2013 Bob turned Bradford\u2019s books into films and miniseries, and, she says, shepherded her career. \u201cHe was building a brand. He believed you promote a book like you promote a movie.\u201d All her books are dedicated to him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02e15ead59f2bf76b0006b80c22a6c0494778c04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02e15ead59f2bf76b0006b80c22a6c0494778c04/0_38_2322_1393/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signing books in 1993.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signing books in 1993.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are fabulous, although untrue, stories about the couple\u2019s lavish lifestyle \u2013 including one that they heated the lake of their Connecticut home to keep their swans warm. Were they driven by making money? \u201cWell, everybody likes money,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to get paid for what you do, but I think it was the enjoyment of working together. I think it was the love of writing and [his] love of making movies.\u201d What was her biggest extravagance? \u201cMaybe at one time when Oscar de la Renta was doing the collections for Balmain, Bob \u2013 having grown up in France \u2013 loved couture, so he thought nothing of buying me some nice things that were very expensive. But I\u2019ve still got them.\u201d He was always buying her jewellery \u2013 some of which she is planning to sell at auction (the last time she did this, in 2013, she made more than \u00a31m).</p> <p>Bradford could have afforded to retire years ago, but says she will write until she can\u2019t do it any longer. She writes in longhand or on an electric typewriter. Since having had a hip replacement in August, she has been told not to spend so much time sitting down so she sets an alarm clock to go off every two hours to remind her to walk around. \u201cWhat happens is I become so immersed in what I\u2019m doing that any pain that I have goes away,\u201d she says. Before that, she would start work at 5.30am and work until lunch, and then again until about 4pm. I tell her that I read the romantic novelist Danielle Steel sometimes works <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shortcuts/2019/may/13/danielle-steel-works-22-hour-days-is-it-possible\" title=\"\">22 hours a day</a>. \u201cOh, bullshit,\u201d says Bradford.</p> <p> She is not dogged by self-doubt, and rarely has writer\u2019s block. If she does, she will simply power through (or perhaps take a break \u201cfor an hour or two\u201d). And she has ideas for books all the time. \u201cI could give you four here out of my head now,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Bradford is a curious mix of staunch feminist \u2013 her heroines are headstrong, independent women \u2013 while admitting that at home, her husband \u201cwore the trousers; he was very much the boss\u201d. This romantic novelist \u2013 she would narrow her eyes at that description \u2013 worries that the #MeToo movement has made men wary of women. \u201cI\u2019m glad somebody had the guts to come and start talking about Harvey Weinstein,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, somehow, it has gone a bit over the top. I can\u2019t explain it. But there are decent men out there \u2013 they\u2019re not all monsters \u2013 and I think a lot of decent men don\u2019t want to be alone with a woman. They think they might get falsely charged. I\u2019m glad it happened, but I think it ought to sort of stop.\u201d</p> <p>In her latest book, Alexis Malvern is an heiress to a property company and, after the death of her fiance, gets back to work. \u201cI do think women work hard, and I think women deserve to \u2013 what is it called? \u2013 break the glass ceiling. I\u2019m a great believer in women being paid the same as men. The problem is, whatever we do and however good we are, somehow, it is still a man\u2019s world.\u201d We know Alexis is suffering because \u2013 horror \u2013 she becomes fat. Does Bradford think it\u2019s important for women to be thin and pretty? \u201cI personally have never been made up and dressed up for a man,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been made up and dressed properly for me, to make the best of what I have. I don\u2019t like to tell women what to do, but I think it\u2019s a good idea to try to look nice. It cheers me up.\u201d</p> <p>Bob liked it, too, she adds. Everything comes back to Bob. They didn\u2019t have children \u2013 Bradford had a couple of miscarriages, but wasn\u2019t interested in seeking medical assistance to become a mother. Why did their marriage survive more than half a century? \u201cI think that you can\u2019t just be in love with someone because that changes, [although] Bob and I never lost any of our sexual drive for many years. I think it\u2019s because we thought alike in many ways. We had different views about some things, but we got along very well, we were very compatible. He was good at giving me my space to write. We liked each other, we loved each other. And I think respect is important.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bob had drilled it into me for 20 years: \u2018If anything happens to me, don\u2019t stop working. You\u2019ve got a\u00a0God-given gift.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How has she coped with losing him? \u201cWhen people ask me that, I do start to cry,\u201d she says and her eyes suddenly brim with tears. \u201cI\u2019m lonely without him.\u201d She takes a breath, her voice airless. \u201cIt\u2019s like half of me has been chopped off. I was married to him for 55 years and I knew him for two years before that, and he was a very dominant presence. He had a great personality and very dry humour. I used to say to him: \u2018You make me laugh every day.\u2019 We were sort of joined at the hip. And he was my best friend. When I went into his den, his face would light up. So I miss that.\u201d</p> <p>His death was shocking \u2013 Bob, who at 94 had been perfectly well, had a stroke one night in July, and went into hospital. Three days later, on a Friday, doctors told Bradford he wouldn\u2019t recover. She talks in great detail about those frantic days, reliving it, from the nights in the hospital room by his bed, to picking out his plot in the cemetery. \u201cI\u2019d do this,\u201d she says, taking my hand, \u201cand he\u2019d do this.\u201d She squeezes my hand. \u201cIt was a tight grip, although not so much by Thursday.\u201d</p> <p>She knew that at some point after his death she would be getting back to work. \u201cBob had drilled it into me for the last 20 years: \u2018If anything happens to me, don\u2019t stop working. You\u2019ve got a God-given gift. You can sit down at your desk and write a book that people want to read. And it gives you great solace.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to talk about that. I\u2019d say: \u2018No, nothing\u2019s going to happen to you.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe it has only been four months since he died. Bradford seems so together. \u201cI\u2019m wearing my public face,\u201d she says with a sad smile. \u201cI always cry a bit when I go to bed at night.\u201d At first, she says, \u201cI was so shocked and so exhausted and I cried myself to sleep at night. And there\u2019s only so many tears in the end, you\u2019ve just got to get on with it. You\u2019ve got to gather your sword, stand up and go out and fight. He wouldn\u2019t want me to crumble like some stupid, silly woman.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder if it has made her more aware of her own mortality and she instantly says, \u201cNo,\u201d as if it\u2019s unthinkable that something as trivial as death could stop her. \u201cI mean yes and no. I say to people: \u2018I\u2019m not going to die yet.\u2019 All I wanted to do was go and lie in his plot next to him for quite a few weeks.

      "bodyText": "So long was Barbara Taylor Bradford\u2019s novel A Woman of Substance \u2013 the book that would launch her career and go on to sell 32m copies \u2013 that she measured it by weight, not number of pages. It was 16 and a half pounds (7.5kg), she says, her eyes glittering. \u201cI wrote more,\u201d she says. \u201cWe cut a lot.\u201d Her then editor made her take out a whole chapter \u2013 the one that followed her character Blackie O\u2019Neill through the first world war (he was a friend to the book\u2019s heroine, the kitchen maid turned retail tycoon Emma Harte). \u201cI really fought this. But she took it out, and I was infuriated.\u201d It occurs to Bradford, with the 40th anniversary edition of the book on the table in front of us, that the chapter might have made its way back in. \u201cI never thought of looking,\u201d she says, flicking through the 800-plus pages, then she starts reading aloud. She looks up and says excitedly: \u201cWhat a good beginning!\u201d Then she goes back to it. Goodness, I think, she\u2019s going to read the whole thing. A well-timed waiter comes to our table at the Dorchester hotel to pour tea; she closes the book, greets him by name and they have a chat. Bradford is fantastic company. She fizzes with charisma, and because she seems to enjoy talking about herself, she makes a great interviewee, although \u2013 storyteller that she is \u2013 she can go on. Try to get her off a subject and she\u2019ll solicitously pause to answer, then pick up where she left off. She is 86 and looks glorious. Her hair is beautifully styled, her eyes as sparkly as her jewellery. It feels as if there is no subject off-limits. Ask her about the sex scenes in her latest book \u2013 her women are as lustful as the male characters \u2013 and she smiles and says: \u201cOh, I love sex, don\u2019t you?\u201d The only subject she won\u2019t talk about is politics, at the request of her publisher who once received a letter from a reader who said she\u2019d never buy another Barbara Taylor Bradford book again after Bradford said nice things about Theresa May in an interview. (Bradford\u2019s heroine is Margaret Thatcher; in the US, where she has lived since the 60s, she is a Republican.) Surely she must have stories about Donald Trump? Didn\u2019t they mix in the same wealthy New York circles? (Bradford is worth a reported \u00a3160m.) \u201cHe lent us his boardroom,\u201d she says, referring to her charity work. \u201cHe was normal, he was nice. I think it\u2019s when he gets in front of a microphone he starts to \u2026\u201d For the first time, she doesn\u2019t finish a sentence. The day we speak, it has been announced that Bradford is to revisit A Woman of Substance in the form of a prequel, although we are meeting because she has written another book, In the Lion\u2019s Den, which she wrote in a year. It is Bradford\u2019s 34th book, and the second part of a trilogy, following James Falconer, a barrow boy turned businessman. She was scheduled to write the third book next, but suddenly it was beyond her \u2013 in July, Robert Bradford, her husband of 55 years, died after a stroke. \u201cI knew that he wasn\u2019t going to live and [I was thinking] how would I cope with all that was going to happen?\u201d she says. She sat by his bed, in shock, for the week he was in hospital, and in the quiet of the room worked out the storyline of her prequel to A Woman of Substance. Next month, she will get to work on it. In preparation, she reread every book Blackie and Emma appeared in or were mentioned in (there are several). \u201cWhen I read [her 1988 novel] To Be the Best, I\u2019d forgotten I\u2019d written it and I couldn\u2019t help but think what a good book this is,\u201d she says with a laugh, then adds, \u201cand very sexy! And all I could think at the end was these women are all working hard. They\u2019re all driven, ambitious and disciplined. I\u2019ve written about myself in every book.\u201d She looks thrilled with the discovery. Bradford was brought up in a suburb of Leeds, a cherished only child (her older brother died before she was born). Her father was an engineer, and her mother took charge of her development, encouraging her to read Dickens and others. A biography of Bradford, published a few years ago, came up with the tantalising idea that her mother was the illegitimate daughter of a local marquis. When Bradford was 10, her mother sent one of Bradford\u2019s stories off to a magazine, and \u2013 after it appeared in print, and she was paid for it \u2013 she was hooked. At 15, she joined the Yorkshire Evening Post as a typist, but persuaded the editor to take her on as a reporter. At 18, she was editing its women\u2019s pages, and at 20 she was a columnist on the London Evening News. \u201cI was very, very driven from the age of 10. That\u2019s what I wanted to be \u2013 a reporter,\u201d she says. She met Bob on a blind date in 1961, and they married two years later. He was \u201cmovie-star gorgeous\u201d, she says, and was already a rich and successful film producer. She moved with him back to New York, and started writing novels. Between them, they amassed a fortune \u2013 Bob turned Bradford\u2019s books into films and miniseries, and, she says, shepherded her career. \u201cHe was building a brand. He believed you promote a book like you promote a movie.\u201d All her books are dedicated to him. There are fabulous, although untrue, stories about the couple\u2019s lavish lifestyle \u2013 including one that they heated the lake of their Connecticut home to keep their swans warm. Were they driven by making money? \u201cWell, everybody likes money,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to get paid for what you do, but I think it was the enjoyment of working together. I think it was the love of writing and [his] love of making movies.\u201d What was her biggest extravagance? \u201cMaybe at one time when Oscar de la Renta was doing the collections for Balmain, Bob \u2013 having grown up in France \u2013 loved couture, so he thought nothing of buying me some nice things that were very expensive. But I\u2019ve still got them.\u201d He was always buying her jewellery \u2013 some of which she is planning to sell at auction (the last time she did this, in 2013, she made more than \u00a31m). Bradford could have afforded to retire years ago, but says she will write until she can\u2019t do it any longer. She writes in longhand or on an electric typewriter. Since having had a hip replacement in August, she has been told not to spend so much time sitting down so she sets an alarm clock to go off every two hours to remind her to walk around. \u201cWhat happens is I become so immersed in what I\u2019m doing that any pain that I have goes away,\u201d she says. Before that, she would start work at 5.30am and work until lunch, and then again until about 4pm. I tell her that I read the romantic novelist Danielle Steel sometimes works 22 hours a day. \u201cOh, bullshit,\u201d says Bradford. She is not dogged by self-doubt, and rarely has writer\u2019s block. If she does, she will simply power through (or perhaps take a break \u201cfor an hour or two\u201d). And she has ideas for books all the time. \u201cI could give you four here out of my head now,\u201d she says. Bradford is a curious mix of staunch feminist \u2013 her heroines are headstrong, independent women \u2013 while admitting that at home, her husband \u201cwore the trousers; he was very much the boss\u201d. This romantic novelist \u2013 she would narrow her eyes at that description \u2013 worries that the #MeToo movement has made men wary of women. \u201cI\u2019m glad somebody had the guts to come and start talking about Harvey Weinstein,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, somehow, it has gone a bit over the top. I can\u2019t explain it. But there are decent men out there \u2013 they\u2019re not all monsters \u2013 and I think a lot of decent men don\u2019t want to be alone with a woman. They think they might get falsely charged. I\u2019m glad it happened, but I think it ought to sort of stop.\u201d In her latest book, Alexis Malvern is an heiress to a property company and, after the death of her fiance, gets back to work. \u201cI do think women work hard, and I think women deserve to \u2013 what is it called? \u2013 break the glass ceiling. I\u2019m a great believer in women being paid the same as men. The problem is, whatever we do and however good we are, somehow, it is still a man\u2019s world.\u201d We know Alexis is suffering because \u2013 horror \u2013 she becomes fat. Does Bradford think it\u2019s important for women to be thin and pretty? \u201cI personally have never been made up and dressed up for a man,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been made up and dressed properly for me, to make the best of what I have. I don\u2019t like to tell women what to do, but I think it\u2019s a good idea to try to look nice. It cheers me up.\u201d Bob liked it, too, she adds. Everything comes back to Bob. They didn\u2019t have children \u2013 Bradford had a couple of miscarriages, but wasn\u2019t interested in seeking medical assistance to become a mother. Why did their marriage survive more than half a century? \u201cI think that you can\u2019t just be in love with someone because that changes, [although] Bob and I never lost any of our sexual drive for many years. I think it\u2019s because we thought alike in many ways. We had different views about some things, but we got along very well, we were very compatible. He was good at giving me my space to write. We liked each other, we loved each other. And I think respect is important.\u201d How has she coped with losing him? \u201cWhen people ask me that, I do start to cry,\u201d she says and her eyes suddenly brim with tears. \u201cI\u2019m lonely without him.\u201d She takes a breath, her voice airless. \u201cIt\u2019s like half of me has been chopped off. I was married to him for 55 years and I knew him for two years before that, and he was a very dominant presence. He had a great personality and very dry humour. I used to say to him: \u2018You make me laugh every day.\u2019 We were sort of joined at the hip. And he was my best friend. When I went into his den, his face would light up. So I miss that.\u201d His death was shocking \u2013 Bob, who at 94 had been perfectly well, had a stroke one night in July, and went into hospital. Three days later, on a Friday, doctors told Bradford he wouldn\u2019t recover. She talks in great detail about those frantic days, reliving it, from the nights in the hospital room by his bed, to picking out his plot in the cemetery. \u201cI\u2019d do this,\u201d she says, taking my hand, \u201cand he\u2019d do this.\u201d She squeezes my hand. \u201cIt was a tight grip, although not so much by Thursday.\u201d She knew that at some point after his death she would be getting back to work. \u201cBob had drilled it into me for the last 20 years: \u2018If anything happens to me, don\u2019t stop working. You\u2019ve got a God-given gift. You can sit down at your desk and write a book that people want to read. And it gives you great solace.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want to talk about that.

Bradford seems so together. \u201cI\u2019m wearing my public face,\u201d she says with a sad smile. \u201cI always cry a bit when I go to bed at night.\u201d At first, she says, \u201cI was so shocked and so exhausted and I cried myself to sleep at night. And there\u2019s only so many tears in the end, you\u2019ve just got to get on with it. You\u2019ve got to gather your sword, stand up and go out and fight. He wouldn\u2019t want me to crumble like some stupid, silly woman.\u201d I wonder if it has made her more aware of her own mortality and she instantly says, \u201cNo,\u201d as if it\u2019s unthinkable that something as trivial as death could stop her. \u201cI mean yes and no. I say to people: \u2018I\u2019m not going to die yet.\u2019 All I wanted to do was go and lie in his plot next to him for quite a few weeks. But I guess if you\u2019re a practical, down-to-earth Yorkshirewoman \u2026 we\u2019re rather stoical, and I\u2019m strong. I\u2019ve always had a backbone of steel. I\u2019ve gone through all sorts of things and come out the other end.\u201d I think about what she had said earlier about how all her irrepressible, tough characters are based on herself, and it feels as if she is writing the end to her own story \u2013 not a happy ending, exactly, but one in which the heroine refuses to give up.

      "body": "<p>A group of climate activists who shut down a lignite coal power plant in Germany said they had no regrets and were prepared to repeat the action, as they awaited the conclusion of their trial.</p> <p>The activists from <a href=\"http://wedontshutup.org/en/\">the group WeShutDown</a> blockaded the <a href=\"https://www.group.rwe/en/our-portfolio/our-sites/weisweiler-power-plant\">Weisweiler power plant </a>near Aachen for several hours on 15 November 2017, by halting its coal-carrying conveyor belts and diggers. The energy company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/rwe-npower\">RWE</a>, which owns the plant, claims the shutdown cost it \u20ac2m.</p> <p>The group has called its action \u201clegitimate and necessary\u201d, claiming that it stopped significant amounts of emissions from entering the atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cWe prevented 26,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which would otherwise have been pumped out in the several hours we shut it down,\u201d one of the activists, going by the alias Wanja, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the amount of electricity used by 2,672 people in Germany in one year, or 104,000 people in Tanzania.\u201d</p> <p>The group, he said, \u201ccreated a moment of effective opposition to this infernal machine \u2013 lignite is also one of the most ineffective fuels there is, only economically viable if produced on a huge scale.</p> <p>\u201cBy bringing it to a halt, we reduced the damaging emissions it produces, so it was legitimate and the opposite of criminal. We are convinced it was worth it.\u201d</p> <p>The 37-year-old Wanja, along with four other activists on trial in Eschweiler, faces charges of trespassing and disturbance of public supply in a case that has received widespread publicity. Their act has been labelled ecoterrorism and industrial sabotage by some, while others consider it a masterstroke in the history of environmental protest in Germany.</p> <p>The accused are unlikely to face prison sentences, but could receive hefty fines when the judge delivers his verdict, expected on Wednesday.</p> <p>The activists said they want the publicity given to their trial to have the effect of putting pressure on the German government to act faster to phase out coal mining, which it has pledged to do over the next 20 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"670e89a16dba93c46d14ddb10d7dffff25dda4ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/670e89a16dba93c46d14ddb10d7dffff25dda4ce/0_0_4765_3235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Weisweiler coal protesters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The five defendants appeared together in the street before their trial</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henning Kaiser/dpa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>RWE, which apart from Weisweiler runs two other large lignite-fired plants and is said by activists to be responsible for about 10% of Germany\u2019s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, has accused the group of criminal activity which cost it millions and forced it to take it off the grid and buy in extra electricity from elsewhere. It is hoping the trial will act as a preventive measure against copycat actions.</p> <p>WeShutDown has said it had made use of the trial, which started on 29 October, to highlight \u201cthe worldwide destruction of livelihoods through lignite coal combustion\u201d.</p> <p>Its lawyers asked the court to hear statements from climate emergency experts to illustrate that their action was justified in Germany and beyond, because \u201cair pollution is local, but climate change is global\u201d.</p> <p>Rosa Gierens, a Finnish meteorologist from the University of Cologne, who is an expert on air pollution and specifically on how fine particles emitted from power plants affect human health, told the court that peer-reviewed statistical data proved that Weisweiler \u201ccaused 280 premature deaths every year\u201d.</p> <p>The global impact was to be illustrated by a Tanzanian farmer, due to give evidence on how the power plant, by contributing to the climate emergency, had affected the livelihoods of people in his country.</p> <p>Seuri Sanare, 28, a member of the Masai community from Monduli in northern Tanzania, was refused the chance to speak.</p> <p>But he told the Guardian that had he been given the chance, he would have explained to the court the devastating effects, including the lack of rain and resultant loss of grass and livestock on his community.</p> <p>\u201cThe knock-on effects are multiple,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are having to go much further for water for both cattle and humans, at considerable risk to both.</p> <p>\u201cLand is splitting due to the parched conditions,\u201d he said, showing photographs of huge rifts that had formed in agricultural land near his home. \u201cIn turn this leads to social unrest as neighbours dispute whose land is whose,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Women in particular were among the most vulnerable, he said. \u201cThey are having to get up earlier and earlier to go further and further for that water for their families, and because it\u2019s often still dark, they regularly face rape en route and are vulnerable to sexual exploitation in exchange for water, particularly in the cities.\u201d</p> <p>Wanja said the court\u2019s refusal to hear Sanare as a witness, illustrated \u201cthat German justice is more interested in German suffering, but not suffering elsewhere in the world\u201d.</p> <p>He recalled the night in November when he and 12 other ecological activists finally embarked on the action they had been planning for months. They had broken the skin on their fingertips sealing the ridges with superglue to avoid leaving fingerprints, and some were wearing nappies in anticipation of a long night\u2019s sit-in.

      "bodyText": "A group of climate activists who shut down a lignite coal power plant in Germany said they had no regrets and were prepared to repeat the action, as they awaited the conclusion of their trial. The activists from the group WeShutDown blockaded the Weisweiler power plant near Aachen for several hours on 15 November 2017, by halting its coal-carrying conveyor belts and diggers. The energy company RWE, which owns the plant, claims the shutdown cost it \u20ac2m. The group has called its action \u201clegitimate and necessary\u201d, claiming that it stopped significant amounts of emissions from entering the atmosphere. \u201cWe prevented 26,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions which would otherwise have been pumped out in the several hours we shut it down,\u201d one of the activists, going by the alias Wanja, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the amount of electricity used by 2,672 people in Germany in one year, or 104,000 people in Tanzania.\u201d The group, he said, \u201ccreated a moment of effective opposition to this infernal machine \u2013 lignite is also one of the most ineffective fuels there is, only economically viable if produced on a huge scale. \u201cBy bringing it to a halt, we reduced the damaging emissions it produces, so it was legitimate and the opposite of criminal. We are convinced it was worth it.\u201d The 37-year-old Wanja, along with four other activists on trial in Eschweiler, faces charges of trespassing and disturbance of public supply in a case that has received widespread publicity. Their act has been labelled ecoterrorism and industrial sabotage by some, while others consider it a masterstroke in the history of environmental protest in Germany. The accused are unlikely to face prison sentences, but could receive hefty fines when the judge delivers his verdict, expected on Wednesday. The activists said they want the publicity given to their trial to have the effect of putting pressure on the German government to act faster to phase out coal mining, which it has pledged to do over the next 20 years. RWE, which apart from Weisweiler runs two other large lignite-fired plants and is said by activists to be responsible for about 10% of Germany\u2019s CO2 emissions, has accused the group of criminal activity which cost it millions and forced it to take it off the grid and buy in extra electricity from elsewhere. It is hoping the trial will act as a preventive measure against copycat actions. WeShutDown has said it had made use of the trial, which started on 29 October, to highlight \u201cthe worldwide destruction of livelihoods through lignite coal combustion\u201d. Its lawyers asked the court to hear statements from climate emergency experts to illustrate that their action was justified in Germany and beyond, because \u201cair pollution is local, but climate change is global\u201d. Rosa Gierens, a Finnish meteorologist from the University of Cologne, who is an expert on air pollution and specifically on how fine particles emitted from power plants affect human health, told the court that peer-reviewed statistical data proved that Weisweiler \u201ccaused 280 premature deaths every year\u201d. The global impact was to be illustrated by a Tanzanian farmer, due to give evidence on how the power plant, by contributing to the climate emergency, had affected the livelihoods of people in his country. Seuri Sanare, 28, a member of the Masai community from Monduli in northern Tanzania, was refused the chance to speak. But he told the Guardian that had he been given the chance, he would have explained to the court the devastating effects, including the lack of rain and resultant loss of grass and livestock on his community. \u201cThe knock-on effects are multiple,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are having to go much further for water for both cattle and humans, at considerable risk to both. \u201cLand is splitting due to the parched conditions,\u201d he said, showing photographs of huge rifts that had formed in agricultural land near his home. \u201cIn turn this leads to social unrest as neighbours dispute whose land is whose,\u201d he said. Women in particular were among the most vulnerable, he said. \u201cThey are having to get up earlier and earlier to go further and further for that water for their families, and because it\u2019s often still dark, they regularly face rape en route and are vulnerable to sexual exploitation in exchange for water, particularly in the cities.\u201d Wanja said the court\u2019s refusal to hear Sanare as a witness, illustrated \u201cthat German justice is more interested in German suffering, but not suffering elsewhere in the world\u201d. He recalled the night in November when he and 12 other ecological activists finally embarked on the action they had been planning for months. They had broken the skin on their fingertips sealing the ridges with superglue to avoid leaving fingerprints, and some were wearing nappies in anticipation of a long night\u2019s sit-in. Wanja said that as he was running towards the power plant, he fell and broke his ankle. \u201cBut I continued, hardly feeling the pain probably because of the adrenalin,\u201d he said. The group climbed over the fence \u201cwith surprising ease \u2013 there was very little to keep us out\u201d, he said. They made it to the plant, activating the emergency stop buttons on the conveyor belts. Some of the activists chained themselves together on the conveyor belts, others on mechanical diggers, while Wanja climbed up on a tripod they had placed five metres above the tracks, unfurled a banner reading \u201cNever Trust a COP\u201d \u2013 a reference to the UN climate change summit that was taking place in Bonn at the same time \u2013 and settled himself into a hammock, listening as the plant literally ground to a halt around him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared,\u201d Wanja recalled. \u201cI was overwhelmed by a sense of intense relief that we had achieved what we\u2019d set out to do, and relished the hours it took for them to extract us, knowing the longer it took, the more effective our action was going to have been.\u201d A spokesman for RWE condemned the activists\u2019 action, saying there was no question that they should be held criminally culpable for what it sees as an act of sabotage. \u201cJust as if someone were to unauthorisedly break into someone\u2019s private house and cause damages there, there would be a demand for compensation, so it\u2019s the same in this case,\u201d he said. He said accusations that the company itself was doing damage by producing energy lacked substance: \u201cThe company is producing electricity with a plant and equipment which have been erected and are being operated in accordance with democratic decisions and state approval.

From the reviews of its original run in the US to the Young Vic\u2019s website and social media channels, information about what actually happens in the play is scant. This is what Sibblies Drury wanted, and Latif (as well as most journalists) has been more than happy to get on board. \u201cNo great thing is about any one thing,\u201d Latif says.

It\u2019s not like you find out that someone was dead the whole time. I think that it\u2019s more allowing oneself the ability to have your own experience watching something. The way that people process things is a really individual thing, and experience is individual in terms of your upbringing, in terms of your class, in terms of your race, in terms of the people that you\u2019ve been friends with, the books that you\u2019ve read, your references.\u201d</p> <p>Latif agrees. \u201cTheatre is not film, or TV, or Netflix.

If we focus on making current technologies more efficient, there are limits. If we stick to what we know, it may seem easy but it doesn\u2019t work in the long term.\u201d</p> <p>The EEA scored 35 key measures of environmental health, from greenhouse gases and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/16/little-progress-made-in-tackling-air-pollution-in-europe-research-says\">air pollution</a>, waste management and climate change to soil condition and birds and butterfly species, and found only six in which Europe was performing adequately.</p> <p>\u201cIncremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals,\u201d said Bruyninckx. Further marginal changes would grow only more expensive, he predicted, making large-scale change necessary. \u201cWe already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>Wholesale changes could include banning internal combustion engines and scaling up public transport, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/02/fossil-fuel-lobbyists-push-to-dilute-eu-anti-greenwash-plan\">abandoning fossil fuels</a> in favour of 100% renewable energy, stipulating that products must be designed and manufactured to create no waste, and changes to our diets and agricultural production. Environmental goals could not be seen as separate to or lesser than economic goals, and accepting environmental damage as an inevitable cost would lead to ecological collapse, Bruyninckx warned.</p> <p>The old system \u2013 of \u201ccontinuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts\u201d \u2013 would not deliver the EU\u2019s long-term vision of \u201cliving well, within the limits of the planet\u201d, the report warned.</p> <p>The report, known as European Environment \u2013 State and Outlook (SOER), is a comprehensive study produced every five years and details the health or otherwise of all natural systems across EU member states and others including Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. The 2020 edition was brought forward to inform the incoming European commission as they discuss a promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/29/first-eu-wide-climate-law-to-set-net-zero-carbon-target-by-2050\">\u201cgreen new deal\u201d</a>, and for delegates at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">COP25, the UN conference on climate change currently taking place in Madrid</a>.</p> <p>There has been little improvement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/03/air-pollution-will-kill-thousands-in-europe-eea-warns\">since the last report in 2015</a>, despite promises, policies and targets, according to SOER 2020. Fewer than a quarter of protected species and only 16% of habitats are in a good state of conservation. Reduced pollution has improved water quality, but Europe will miss by a long way its goal of having a \u201cgood\u201d rating for all water bodies by 2020. Though air quality has improved, about a fifth of the urban population live in areas where concentrations of pollutants exceed at least one EU air quality standard, and 62% of ecosystems are exposed to excessive nitrogen levels.</p> <p>Global heating has added to the risks to health. For instance, Bruyninckx pointed to the melting ice and permafrost in the far north as a little-considered danger. \u201cRussia has buried some very toxic chemicals beneath the ice and we expect melting ice to release some of them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome chemicals are also sensitive to heat, so if we have more heatwaves that is a risk too.\u201d</p> <p>Frans Timmermans, the incoming executive vice-president of the European commission, said: \u201cIn the next five years, we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming.

      "bodyText": "Pursuing economic growth at the expense of the environment is no longer an option as Europe faces \u201cunprecedented\u201d challenges from climate chaos, pollution, biodiversity loss and the overconsumption of natural resources, according to a report from Europe\u2019s environmental watchdog. Europe was reaching the limits of what could be achieved by gradual means, by making efficiencies and small cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, with \u201ctransformational\u201d change now necessary to stave off the impacts of global heating and environmental collapse, warned Hans Bruyninckx, executive director of the European Environment Agency. \u201cMarginal efficiency gains are not enough \u2013 they are not working to bring down emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is also a higher cost to marginal efficiency gains, if we keep investing in that. If we focus on making current technologies more efficient, there are limits. If we stick to what we know, it may seem easy but it doesn\u2019t work in the long term.\u201d The EEA scored 35 key measures of environmental health, from greenhouse gases and air pollution, waste management and climate change to soil condition and birds and butterfly species, and found only six in which Europe was performing adequately. \u201cIncremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals,\u201d said Bruyninckx. Further marginal changes would grow only more expensive, he predicted, making large-scale change necessary. \u201cWe already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable.\u201d Wholesale changes could include banning internal combustion engines and scaling up public transport, abandoning fossil fuels in favour of 100% renewable energy, stipulating that products must be designed and manufactured to create no waste, and changes to our diets and agricultural production. Environmental goals could not be seen as separate to or lesser than economic goals, and accepting environmental damage as an inevitable cost would lead to ecological collapse, Bruyninckx warned. The old system \u2013 of \u201ccontinuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts\u201d \u2013 would not deliver the EU\u2019s long-term vision of \u201cliving well, within the limits of the planet\u201d, the report warned. The report, known as European Environment \u2013 State and Outlook (SOER), is a comprehensive study produced every five years and details the health or otherwise of all natural systems across EU member states and others including Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. The 2020 edition was brought forward to inform the incoming European commission as they discuss a promised \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, and for delegates at COP25, the UN conference on climate change currently taking place in Madrid. There has been little improvement since the last report in 2015, despite promises, policies and targets, according to SOER 2020. Fewer than a quarter of protected species and only 16% of habitats are in a good state of conservation. Reduced pollution has improved water quality, but Europe will miss by a long way its goal of having a \u201cgood\u201d rating for all water bodies by 2020. Though air quality has improved, about a fifth of the urban population live in areas where concentrations of pollutants exceed at least one EU air quality standard, and 62% of ecosystems are exposed to excessive nitrogen levels. Global heating has added to the risks to health. For instance, Bruyninckx pointed to the melting ice and permafrost in the far north as a little-considered danger. \u201cRussia has buried some very toxic chemicals beneath the ice and we expect melting ice to release some of them,\u201d he said. \u201cSome chemicals are also sensitive to heat, so if we have more heatwaves that is a risk too.\u201d Frans Timmermans, the incoming executive vice-president of the European commission, said: \u201cIn the next five years, we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming. There will be multiple benefits for Europeans if we get this right and our economy and our planet will be winners too.\u201d Green campaigners called for urgent radical action. \u201cBanning plastic straws and nudging renewable energy targets is no longer enough,\u201d said Jagoda Muni\u0107, director of Friends of the Earth Europe. \u201cOnly the boldest action to transform our consumption and growth-obsessed economy will do. Every decision [Ursula von der Leyen, the new European commission president] makes must put environment, climate and justice first.\u201d Franziska Achterberg of Greenpeace added: \u201cThe new commission must follow [the EEA] advice and rethink the economic system that for decades has rewarded pollution, environmental destruction and human exploitation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Senate has passed a motion calling on the government to recognise the increased risk it has placed on two gay Saudi journalists by keeping them in detention after they claimed asylum last month. Guardian Australia can reveal that multiple news organisations around the world have called for the release of the men, warning the Australian government they are watching the case closely. The motion, brought by Greens senator Janet Rice, also urged the government to expedite the refugee assessment process for the couple and assure their safety in the interim. Labor, Centre Alliance and independent senator Jacqui Lambie all pledged their support for the motion, which passed on Wednesday afternoon. Last month Guardian Australia revealed the two men were detained at an Australian airport after passing through immigration on valid tourist visas. They have remained in detention or under guard in hospital ever since, and have alleged threats of violence against them as well as fear they could be targeted by Saudi representatives. Sultan* is a former ministry of media employee and a fixer who had worked with multiple international media organisations, and Nassar* is a cameraman. They fled their home country after Sultan was interrogated by Saudi authorities, who ordered him to stop working with foreign media and made veiled threats to out his and his partner\u2019s relationship. Homosexuality is illegal in Saudi Arabia and punishable by death. Sultan told Guardian Australia last month their arrest and \u201carbitrary\u201d detention in Australia was comparable to threats back home. \u201cWe\u2019ve been threatened with it in Saudi but it never actually happened until we came here,\u201d he said. Rice welcomed the Senate\u2019s move. \u201cWhen these journalists liken their treatment in Saudi to the violence they have experienced here in Australia, it should be a wake-up call,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe government should act swiftly to reflect the view of the Senate on this matter and uphold the values of fairness and diversity that our country says we stand for.\u201d \u201cThis motion is an important step to increased public awareness of how dangerous Australian immigration detention centres are,\u201d said the men\u2019s lawyer, Alison Battisson. \u201cI am aware of serious assaults, requiring hospitalisation, taking place on a weekly basis \u2026 When assaults do occur, it appears very difficult for the Australian federal police to access detention to investigate.\u201d Several international media organisations have also written to Australia\u2019s immigration minister, David Coleman, in support of the men. \u201cThis is unjust treatment of two journalists who travelled to Australia seeking protection from the persecution they faced as gay men in Saudi Arabia,\u201d wrote one letter from Mark MacKinnon, of Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail. \u201cI hope you can intervene to ensure they are released from detention \u2013 they have valid visas to visit Australia \u2013 so that they can pursue their asylum claim,\u201d he said.\u201d \u201cPlease trust that I and my colleagues around the world who know and have worked with [Sultan] will be watching the outcome of this process with very keen interest.\u201d Other letters from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious newsrooms, including the BBC and ITN, urged Coleman to grant the pair asylum, saying the pair would \u201cfit in very well in Australia\u201d. Michael Garrod, the founder of freelancer database, World Fixer, said Sultan was driven to help foreign media \u201cin the spirit of progress, driven and inspired by the initiatives of the Crown Prince\u201d, and said if the couple was returned to Saudi Arabia they faced persecution because of both their sexuality and their profession. \u201cI sincerely hope that your department recognises their considerable contribution to our global understanding of their country and stands by Australia\u2019s promise to support LGBT rights globally,\u201d he said.

The ruling means that funders will now have to return to the previous practice of getting individual permission from each person or company participating in a class action in order to get paid. In a decision split five to two, the full bench of the high court overturned a 2016 decision called Money Max that opened the way to what are called \u201ccommon fund orders\u201d, which drag everybody who stands to benefit from a lawsuit into a funding agreement even if they do not sign up to it. Three of the judges, chief justice Susan Kiefel and judges Virginia Bell and Patrick Keane, also mounted an unusually strong attack on a panel of federal court judges, accusing them of stating the law inaccurately and setting up a straw man argument in a decision dealing with the issue. Employer body AI Group, which has been campaigning against class actions, welcomed the decision. But its chief executive, Innes Willox, said that because the decision was split, \u201cthis suggests that a degree of legislative uncertainty remains in this area\u201d. \u201cThis highlights the need for reforms which would give greater protection to class action members against litigation funding arrangements that deliver huge windfall payments to largely unregulated, foreign litigation funders,\u201d he said. Shares in Australia\u2019s largest listed litigation funder, IMF Bentham, fell almost 3.3% on the news, dropping to $3.675 at about 2.30pm on Wednesday. However, IMF\u2019s chief investment officer, Tania Sulan, said the company welcomed \u201cthe certainty that the decision has delivered\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a positive impact on our business,\u201d she said. This was because before the Money Max decision IMF funded cases by signing all class members up to an agreement \u201cand that was a model that worked well for us and it worked well for the clients\u201d. The high court was hearing appeals against the common fund order brought by BMW, which is fighting a class action over allegedly unsafe airbags, and Westpac, which is fighting a class action over allegedly dodgy insurance. In their joint judgment, Kiefel, Bell and Keane said that a full court of the federal court, made up of federal court chief justice James Allsop, John Middleton and Alan Robertson, paraphrased law regarding the court\u2019s powers in a way that was \u201cinaccurate in a significant respect\u201d by leaving out clauses limiting those powers. \u201cThat was, with respect, to set up a straw man and then proceed to demolish it,\u201d they said. They said the law recognised that sometimes it might be too expensive or difficult to gather the names of potential class action members through a \u201cbook-building\u201d process, making a potential lawsuit uneconomic. \u201cIf that is the case, the solution contemplated by the legislation is to halt the representative proceeding, not to make a CFO because the process of book building is proving too expensive or too difficult,\u201d they said. Dissenting, Stephen Gageler said he agreed with the full court\u2019s arguments and dismissed out of hand constitutional objections raised by BMW and Westpac. \u201cThe constitutional objections raised by the appellants do not withstand scrutiny and do not warrant elaborate responses,\u201d he said. Judges Geoffrey Nettle and Michelle Gordon agreed with the majority ruling while James Edelman opposed it.",

After her conversations with Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton, Lambie told the chamber she was now \u201cmore than satisfied\u201d that the conditions were in place to allow for repeal of the medevac procedures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/04/medevac-repeal-bill-passes-after-jacqui-lambie-makes-secret-deal-with-coalition\">Medevac repeal bill passes after Jacqui Lambie makes 'secret deal' with Coalition</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The talk around parliament on Wednesday is Lambie emerged from the tortuous medevac tussle with a letter from Morrison indicating the government will pursue resettlement with New Zealand after the current deal with the United States is exhausted \u2013 but I haven\u2019t seen the letter.</p> <p>I am entirely confident Lambie has been pursuing the New Zealand resettlement option in her protracted talks with the government about medevac repeal, but the rest is speculative, and the government claims no deals have been made.</p> <p>Still, there is an obvious way to square this \u201cI\u2019ve got a deal, sort of\u201d/\u201cno deal\u201d circle.</p> <p>Despite appearing reluctant to pursue New Zealand\u2019s kind offer to resettle the asylum seekers Australia sent to moulder in offshore detention, the home affairs minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/15/peter-dutton-open-to-refugees-on-nauru-being-resettled-in-new-zealand\">hasn\u2019t really ruled out doing that</a>. The line has been that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/01/decision-to-bring-children-from-nauru-an-admission-of-failure-by-government\">now is not the time</a>.</p> <p>Assuming that New Zealand remains willing, perhaps a more convenient time to pursue resettlement will materialise soon. Perhaps the government signalled this to Lambie, or some other viable resettlement plan involving another country \u2013 a plan to slowly dismantle the life-force sapping apparatus of offshore detention. Not a deal so much, as a sharing of (as yet unannounced) government policy (if you will).</p> <p>Morrison gave a broad hint that this may well have been what happened on Wednesday. Asked would the government consider the New Zealand deal once the United States arrangement had been exhausted, Morrison said: \u201cThe government\u2019s policy is that we seek to resettle people who are on Nauru.\u201d</p> <p>Only time will tell if this is a genuine, good faith commitment from the government, or a convenient and transitory bauble dangled before Lambie in order to shepherd her into doing exactly what the government wanted.</p> <p>Because we need to emphasise that Morrison\u2019s immediate wants were great on Wednesday. He wanted an end to a medical evacuations regime that was imposed on his disintegrating government pre-election; and he wanted a political win. Just in case it\u2019s not obvious, securing a win was important after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/28/the-doofus-roll-call-scott-morrisons-worst-week-as-prime-minister\">the abject debacle of the previous sitting week</a>, where the prime minister was fending off a police investigation into one of his ministers, and Pauline Hanson had the last laugh on his union-busting bill.</p> <p>While I am hopeful, genuinely hopeful, that Lambie has helped focus Morrison\u2019s mind on the urgent imperative of dismantling the amoral mess of Australia\u2019s creation \u2013 the banishment of our fellow humans offshore in conditions that have generated an unconscionable crisis in the mental and physical health of asylum seekers \u2013 whether she has remains moot.</p> <p>The repeal of medevac is also more than a setback.

      "bodyText": "As the debate over the future of medevac dragged on unresolved, Jacqui Lambie told colleagues she was looking past that particular issue to the fate of the people in long-term offshore detention. In simple terms, the Tasmanian independent was pursuing a bigger objective than repeal or no repeal: she wanted people off Manus Island and Nauru. Lambie told the Senate on Wednesday she put a \u201cproposal\u201d to the government. She did not call it a deal. In her telling, this proposal (details absent, sorry guys, national security) meant things would not go back to the way they had been before the medevac regime was legislated. After her conversations with Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton, Lambie told the chamber she was now \u201cmore than satisfied\u201d that the conditions were in place to allow for repeal of the medevac procedures. The talk around parliament on Wednesday is Lambie emerged from the tortuous medevac tussle with a letter from Morrison indicating the government will pursue resettlement with New Zealand after the current deal with the United States is exhausted \u2013 but I haven\u2019t seen the letter. I am entirely confident Lambie has been pursuing the New Zealand resettlement option in her protracted talks with the government about medevac repeal, but the rest is speculative, and the government claims no deals have been made. Still, there is an obvious way to square this \u201cI\u2019ve got a deal, sort of\u201d/\u201cno deal\u201d circle. Despite appearing reluctant to pursue New Zealand\u2019s kind offer to resettle the asylum seekers Australia sent to moulder in offshore detention, the home affairs minister hasn\u2019t really ruled out doing that. The line has been that now is not the time. Assuming that New Zealand remains willing, perhaps a more convenient time to pursue resettlement will materialise soon. Perhaps the government signalled this to Lambie, or some other viable resettlement plan involving another country \u2013 a plan to slowly dismantle the life-force sapping apparatus of offshore detention. Not a deal so much, as a sharing of (as yet unannounced) government policy (if you will). Morrison gave a broad hint that this may well have been what happened on Wednesday. Asked would the government consider the New Zealand deal once the United States arrangement had been exhausted, Morrison said: \u201cThe government\u2019s policy is that we seek to resettle people who are on Nauru.\u201d Only time will tell if this is a genuine, good faith commitment from the government, or a convenient and transitory bauble dangled before Lambie in order to shepherd her into doing exactly what the government wanted. Because we need to emphasise that Morrison\u2019s immediate wants were great on Wednesday. He wanted an end to a medical evacuations regime that was imposed on his disintegrating government pre-election; and he wanted a political win. Just in case it\u2019s not obvious, securing a win was important after the abject debacle of the previous sitting week, where the prime minister was fending off a police investigation into one of his ministers, and Pauline Hanson had the last laugh on his union-busting bill. While I am hopeful, genuinely hopeful, that Lambie has helped focus Morrison\u2019s mind on the urgent imperative of dismantling the amoral mess of Australia\u2019s creation \u2013 the banishment of our fellow humans offshore in conditions that have generated an unconscionable crisis in the mental and physical health of asylum seekers \u2013 whether she has remains moot. The repeal of medevac is also more than a setback. It is a shocker. Medevac wasn\u2019t imposed on the government because of a cheap bit of chamber theatrics. It was imposed on the government because the government was failing the people it put on Nauru and Manus; because there was a humanitarian disaster playing out on our watch. That\u2019s why matters were taken out of the government\u2019s hands. That\u2019s why the new system was enacted: because people were ailing, and suffering, and dying, and there was no credible evidence the medevac system was creating significant problems. Unless Lambie has secured a water-tight commitment that all medical transfers now occur expeditiously and without fuss as the precondition of repealing the regime, the terrible suffering offshore will only intensify. That thought is unbearable if you think of this cohort as fellow human beings to whom Australia owes a duty of care. Repealing medevac to speed up third-country resettlement is the working definition of a Faustian pact. Thinking about it prompts intense moral discomfort. Witnessing it in the chamber was discomfiting in the extreme. It seems to me entirely possible to have proper medical evacuation procedures for seriously ill people and, also, the prospect of ending the arbitrary indefinite detention of people exercising their rights under an international convention. The fact these propositions are apparently in competition with one another is Australia\u2019s shame.",

In an interview with CNN that quickly went viral, the cave explorer said Musk should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d.

The Tesla and SpaceX chief downplayed his global influence, noting that he has \u201ctried very hard to convince people to take climate change seriously\u201d with limited effect, and that he has no publicist or PR team.</p> <p>But Musk also conceded that dozens, if not hundreds, of people on Twitter had prodded him to get involved with the weeks-long rescue effort of the stranded Thai football team and that the Thai prime minister had requested to meet him when he arrived in the country on his private plane. The billionaire also admitted that at the time of his contretemps with Unsworth, he had a Google alert set for his own name, and that he watched the video of Unsworth\u2019s interview \u201ctwo or three\u201d times before composing his tweets.</p> <p>\u201cIt was an unprovoked attack on a good-natured attempt to help the kids, and [Unsworth] flat-out lied when he said we were asked to leave,\u201d Musk testified. \u201cI was upset. It was wrong and insulting and so I insulted him back.\u201d</p> <p>Another figure who appeared to have felt insulted by Musk was Wood, who took the cross-examination on a lengthy detour around Musk\u2019s characterization of a letter he sent to Musk. \u201cYou described it as a \u2018shakedown letter from a shakedown lawyer\u2019,\u201d Wood said, noting that Musk was actually unfamiliar with his legal career.

      "bodyText": "When Elon Musk took the stand on Tuesday, the question was whether he defamed a British cave explorer by calling him a \u201cpedo guy\u201d, but at times it seemed the real issue was more fundamental \u2013 the fragility of male egos. \u201cThis is a case about insults between two men,\u201d said Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, in his opening statement to the jury in a federal courthouse in Los Angeles on the first day of the trial. Vernon Unsworth, a British national who was instrumental in coordinating the Tham Luang cave rescue in 2018, insulted the Tesla chief executive and made fun of his attempts to assist by building a miniature submarine. In an interview with CNN that quickly went viral, the cave explorer said Musk should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d. Musk, who admitted that he had no idea who Unsworth was at the time, responded by calling the cave explorer \u201csus[picious]\u201d and a \u201cpedo guy\u201d on Twitter. To Unsworth\u2019s attorneys, Musk\u2019s insult was a libelous allegation that resulted in \u201cshame, mortification, worry and distress\u201d to Unsworth \u201cduring what should have been one of the proudest moments in his life\u201d. To Spiro, Unsworth\u2019s interview represented an \u201cattack\u201d on the \u201cgenuineness of his efforts\u201d. \u201cThat could not go unanswered,\u201d Spiro said. Musk\u2019s conception of himself came under close scrutiny on the trial\u2019s first day, which began with a lengthy cross-examination of Musk by Unsworth\u2019s lead attorney, L Lin Wood. The Tesla and SpaceX chief downplayed his global influence, noting that he has \u201ctried very hard to convince people to take climate change seriously\u201d with limited effect, and that he has no publicist or PR team. But Musk also conceded that dozens, if not hundreds, of people on Twitter had prodded him to get involved with the weeks-long rescue effort of the stranded Thai football team and that the Thai prime minister had requested to meet him when he arrived in the country on his private plane. The billionaire also admitted that at the time of his contretemps with Unsworth, he had a Google alert set for his own name, and that he watched the video of Unsworth\u2019s interview \u201ctwo or three\u201d times before composing his tweets. \u201cIt was an unprovoked attack on a good-natured attempt to help the kids, and [Unsworth] flat-out lied when he said we were asked to leave,\u201d Musk testified. \u201cI was upset. It was wrong and insulting and so I insulted him back.\u201d Another figure who appeared to have felt insulted by Musk was Wood, who took the cross-examination on a lengthy detour around Musk\u2019s characterization of a letter he sent to Musk. \u201cYou described it as a \u2018shakedown letter from a shakedown lawyer\u2019,\u201d Wood said, noting that Musk was actually unfamiliar with his legal career. The ensuing exchange prompted Judge Stephen Wilson to plead: \u201cLet\u2019s constrain ourselves.\u201d Musk\u2019s primary defense, which he reiterated numerous times, was that he did not intend to call Unsworth a pedophile, but instead was using \u201cpedo guy\u201d to mean \u201ccreepy old guy\u201d. \u201cJust as I thought it was obvious that he did not mean to physically sodomize me with a submarine, I thought it was obvious that I didn\u2019t mean he was a pedophile,\u201d Musk said. He argued that he did not retract his statement when he initially apologized to Unsworth because that \u201cwould have been worse\u201d. \u201cIf you call someone a motherf\u2019er, I think it would actually seem sarcastic to say, \u2018I didn\u2019t mean that he committed incest\u2019,\u201d Musk explained. \u201cThat would have seemed disingenuous.\u201d Ultimately, Musk argued, Unsworth\u2019s riposte and his tweet were \u201cequivalent insults\u201d. He added, \u201cAdmittedly, this is not classy.\u201d In another moment of apparent self-awareness, he said: \u201cThere are a lot of things that I say. Not all of them have the same quality of thought. I would say very little at all if I just said sense.\u201d The argument that \u201cpedo guy\u201d does not mean \u201cpedophilia\u201d was complicated by Wood\u2019s questions about Musk\u2019s behavior and statements following the initial tweets. Musk engaged a private investigator to look into Unsworth\u2019s background (the investigator turned out to be a \u201cprofessional conman\u201d), and told a reporter from BuzzFeed News that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d. \u201cI fucking hope he sues me,\u201d Musk wrote to the journalist. After reading the email aloud to the court, he added, \u201cI guess be careful what you wish for.\u201d The trial began with opening statements on Tuesday morning following a jury selection process that demonstrated the extent of Musk\u2019s fame.

A study has found that almost a third of women and 12% of men in the UK who undergo surgery for suspected appendicitis end up having a normal appendix removed. Appendicectomies are the UK\u2019s most common emergency operation; the team behind the research estimate there are about 80,000 hospital admissions a year for suspected appendicitis in people aged 16 to 45. However, the study suggests, about 5,500 people a year have a normal appendix removed.

Then more, until 13 were flashing on radars, speeding towards the airbase and a nearby naval facility. The explosives-armed aircraft were no trouble for Russian air defences, which shot down seven and jammed the remaining six, according to the country\u2019s defence ministry. But the failed attack in January last year was disturbing to close observers of drone warfare. \u201cIt was the first instance of a mass-drone attack and the highest number of drones that I believe we\u2019ve seen non-state actors use simultaneously in a combat operation,\u201d says Paul Scharre, a defence analyst and author who studies the weaponisation of artificial intelligence. The attempted attacks continued and in September the Russian army said it had downed nearly 60 drones around the Khmeimim base so far this year. For now, military drone use is dominated by lightweight surveillance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and larger attack UAVs. This situation is unlikely to change in the near future: according to defence experts at the information group Jane\u2019s, orders for both types of device are expected to increase dramatically in the decade ahead. But the assaults on Khmeimim, as well as September\u2019s successful strike on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, were early flashes of a possible future for aerial warfare: drone swarming. The technology of swarming \u2013 drones deployed in squadrons, able to think independently and operate as a pack \u2013 is in its infancy, but armed forces around the world, including in the UK, are investing millions of pounds in its development. The drones used to attack Khmeimim and the Saudi facilities were likely to have been programmed with the GPS coordinates of their targets and then launched in their direction.

      "body": "<p>Four years ago in Shildon, County Durham, Michael O\u2019Neill stumbled upon a long-forgotten piece of local heritage. In a corner of the small town\u2019s railway museum, tucked away in storage and forgotten, was the old Bishop Auckland railway union banner, believed to date back to 1915. A classic of its genre, this piece of early labour movement iconography depicts smartly uniformed rail workers gazing towards a utopian future. Below there is a version of the final paragraph of the Communist Manifesto: \u201cWorkers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill, 44, is from Bishop Auckland. Over the years he has been involved in numerous community projects, most recently raising funds for a memorial to Cpl Lee Brownson, a local boy <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/fatalities/corporal-lee-brownson-and-rifleman-luke-farmer-killed-in-afghanistan\">who was killed</a> in Afghanistan in 2010. Through O\u2019Neill\u2019s efforts, the railwaymen\u2019s banner is now proudly on display at the Four Clocks Centre in Bishop Auckland, alongside a small exhibition telling the story of the world\u2019s first steam locomotive railway line, which passed through the area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/people_power_fixed_new_link-zip/giv-3902lpVKVfrN0Uh6/\" data-alt=\"Series explainer\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/11/people_power_fixed_new_link-zip/giv-3902lpVKVfrN0Uh6/\">Series explainer</a> </figure>  <p>For a lifelong Labour voter, this was an act of loving commemoration. But in less than two weeks time, O\u2019Neill will vote Conservative in the general election. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Labour member and my family has always voted Labour,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the party around here has turned nasty in my opinion, since the Brexit referendum. I voted to leave, but leave voters are being called racist and far right, which is not how it is. We have a local Labour MP in Helen Goodman who should be standing up for democracy. It shouldn\u2019t matter that she voted remain.\u201d</p> <p>The significance of what would amount to a political revolution in the town everyone calls Bishop is not lost on O\u2019Neill: \u201cTen years ago, a Conservative MP wouldn\u2019t get the time of day on the doorstep around here. This place is steeped in memories of the Thatcher era and the mines and the steelworks. But I\u2019m not alone in turning against Labour.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/nov/27/general-election-leaders-try-to-steer-campaign-away-from-race-and-faith-live\">the most comprehensive poll</a> of the election campaign so far predicted that Goodman\u2019s tiny majority of 502 will be overturned on 12 December, and that 25 year-old Dehenna Davison will become the first Tory to represent the area. Bishop Auckland voted 61% in favour of leave and Davison\u2019s Twitter hashtag incorporates the Boris Johnson mantra: \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Though a Brexit party candidate is standing, the seat is acknowledged to be a two-horse race.</p> <p>In a region which feels its collective voice and concerns have been ignored since the mines closed and other industries went the same way, Labour leave voters saw Brexit as carrying the possibility of social renewal. The failure of the party to fully endorse the referendum result is seen by former supporters like O\u2019Neill as both dishonourable and a sign that the party has moved away from its working-class roots. Goodman\u2019s much-diminished majority \u2013 in 2005, it was over 10,000 - also suggests Labour is paying the price of long-term local incumbency in an era of deepening disillusionment across the region.</p> <p>The mining town of Spennymoor and the surrounding pit villages sit within a constituency that was part of one of the richest, most culturally vibrant coalfields in Europe. Twenty-five years after the last pit closed, there is a palpable longing to restore a lost sense of purpose and cohesion; and an anger at the way that the infrastructure of communal life has been allowed to corrode and decay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"108af3604011b02bfa3c7f6c339735b215cb81f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/108af3604011b02bfa3c7f6c339735b215cb81f6/229_138_3232_1939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernadette Rush\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernadette Rush in her bridal shop: \u2018A lot of places in the high street are owned by absent landlords and they are just left to rot.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Bernadette Rush in her bridal shop: \u2018A lot of places in the high street are owned by absent landlords and they are just left to rot.\u2019 Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</p></li> </ul> <p>In Bishop Auckland, the closure of the local A&amp;E <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-45729482\">has become a major election issue</a>.

But in the Fifteas Vintage Tearoom, in the market square, John Phelan is happy to sing Ruffer\u2019s praises. Phelan is a local historian who lives in the nearby village of Howden-le-Wear, which is in the neighbouring constituency of North West Durham. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Phelan says. \u201cHe\u2019s turning Bishop Auckland into a place of culture. One to rival Durham even. History might be the new thing to bring some hope and a feeling of community back to Bishop.\u201d</p> <p>A sense of renewal is desperately required, Phelan adds. \u201cYou\u2019d like to think as life went on things would get better, but they\u2019ve not.\u201d</p> <p>An inveterate romantic, this year Phelan is sending out Christmas cards which carry a photograph of the FA Amateur Cup final in 1954, when \u2018Bishop\u2019 played local rivals, Crook Town, in front of a Wembley crowd of 100,000. His father took him, aged four, to the match on a train that went directly from Crook to London. But the nostalgia comes with a sharp edge. Echoing a theme that comes up continually in the area, a lack of public transport, Phelan says: \u201cA lack of funding from central government has knocked County Durham back generally. The buses have been cut and you barely get any after 6pm. That impacts on people\u2019s lives. There are villages that are practically cut off in the evening now, for people who don\u2019t drive.</p> <p>\u201cThe cuts to street-lighting have meant that rural areas are pitch black at night. I know a woman who is frightened to walk her dogs because it gets so dark. Austerity has chipped away at the quality of life of communities.\u201d</p> <p>Phelan will vote Labour but is not holding out too much hope. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if the Conservatives tip it their way this time. The Labour vote isn\u2019t as loyal as it once was and some people are not so keen on Helen Goodman.</p> <p>\u201cI tell people who are thinking of voting Conservative, \u2018You\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot. Look at the cuts. The Conservative governments haven\u2019t done anything for this area.\u2019 But the Brexit issue has been very bad. If I\u2019d have voted for Brexit I\u2019d be angry with Labour. They\u2019ve dillied and dallied on it. It\u2019s been weak. A Labour leader should have said: \u2018People have voted to leave and that\u2019s it whether you like it or not.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9282867446cb44e7d0773046403cba5ba2527db0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9282867446cb44e7d0773046403cba5ba2527db0/0_152_5671_3403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Lamb (23).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ryan Lamb (23).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Ryan Lamb (23).

It\u2019s not just the young. It takes a lot to get through to people; to explain what the real problems are. The media don\u2019t help with their bias; people say they don\u2019t like Corbyn.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago in Shildon, County Durham, Michael O\u2019Neill stumbled upon a long-forgotten piece of local heritage. In a corner of the small town\u2019s railway museum, tucked away in storage and forgotten, was the old Bishop Auckland railway union banner, believed to date back to 1915. A classic of its genre, this piece of early labour movement iconography depicts smartly uniformed rail workers gazing towards a utopian future. Below there is a version of the final paragraph of the Communist Manifesto: \u201cWorkers of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win.\u201d O\u2019Neill, 44, is from Bishop Auckland. Over the years he has been involved in numerous community projects, most recently raising funds for a memorial to Cpl Lee Brownson, a local boy who was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. Through O\u2019Neill\u2019s efforts, the railwaymen\u2019s banner is now proudly on display at the Four Clocks Centre in Bishop Auckland, alongside a small exhibition telling the story of the world\u2019s first steam locomotive railway line, which passed through the area. For a lifelong Labour voter, this was an act of loving commemoration. But in less than two weeks time, O\u2019Neill will vote Conservative in the general election. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Labour member and my family has always voted Labour,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the party around here has turned nasty in my opinion, since the Brexit referendum. I voted to leave, but leave voters are being called racist and far right, which is not how it is. We have a local Labour MP in Helen Goodman who should be standing up for democracy. It shouldn\u2019t matter that she voted remain.\u201d The significance of what would amount to a political revolution in the town everyone calls Bishop is not lost on O\u2019Neill: \u201cTen years ago, a Conservative MP wouldn\u2019t get the time of day on the doorstep around here. This place is steeped in memories of the Thatcher era and the mines and the steelworks. But I\u2019m not alone in turning against Labour.\u201d Last week, the most comprehensive poll of the election campaign so far predicted that Goodman\u2019s tiny majority of 502 will be overturned on 12 December, and that 25 year-old Dehenna Davison will become the first Tory to represent the area. Bishop Auckland voted 61% in favour of leave and Davison\u2019s Twitter hashtag incorporates the Boris Johnson mantra: \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d. Though a Brexit party candidate is standing, the seat is acknowledged to be a two-horse race. In a region which feels its collective voice and concerns have been ignored since the mines closed and other industries went the same way, Labour leave voters saw Brexit as carrying the possibility of social renewal. The failure of the party to fully endorse the referendum result is seen by former supporters like O\u2019Neill as both dishonourable and a sign that the party has moved away from its working-class roots. Goodman\u2019s much-diminished majority \u2013 in 2005, it was over 10,000 - also suggests Labour is paying the price of long-term local incumbency in an era of deepening disillusionment across the region. The mining town of Spennymoor and the surrounding pit villages sit within a constituency that was part of one of the richest, most culturally vibrant coalfields in Europe. Twenty-five years after the last pit closed, there is a palpable longing to restore a lost sense of purpose and cohesion; and an anger at the way that the infrastructure of communal life has been allowed to corrode and decay.

Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer Whether that would have won the vote of Ryan Lamb, a 23-year-old labourer from Spennymoor, is doubtful. Lamb voted leave in 2016 and Tory in the general election a year later. He intends to do so again this time round, though he has no faith in the pledges being made on either side of the political spectrum. \u201cThey all talk a load of shite,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Boris Johnson is going to put my wages up. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to put more money into the NHS. But [Jeremy] Corbyn\u2019s crap. Someone sent me a Piers Morgan interview on Facebook. He showed Corbyn up. In the end, we were meant to leave on Halloween and we didn\u2019t. It comes down to that.\u201d Andrew Smith is an 80-year-old former NUM activist who worked at the Mainsforth and Ferryhill pits. He now volunteers at Spennymoor\u2019s mining museum, sometimes assisted byErnie Foster, 81, who was also active in the union. The small museum is an affecting cornucopia of mining memorabilia: there are banners of course, but also detonators, cables and a trophy awarded at the Spennymoor gala pit pony competition in 1956. A detail from a panel in Spennymoor town hall. Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer Smith views the forthcoming election, and the fraying of loyalty to Labour, with sadness and trepidation. \u201cIt makes you angry,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes you frustrated that people who have gone through the times that you went through, are thinking like this. It\u2019s not just the young. It takes a lot to get through to people; to explain what the real problems are. The media don\u2019t help with their bias; people say they don\u2019t like Corbyn. But when you ask them they don\u2019t really know why.\u201d A December election is not ideal for octogenarian activists: \u201cWe\u2019d like to get out leafleting for Labour,\u201d says Smith. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting on now.\u201d Foster chips in: \u201cThe main thing is that we can\u2019t have that lot in round here \u2013 the Tories. That can\u2019t be allowed.\u201d",

Running for office while at the intersection of many identities is not salvific. The activist generation that \u201cvoted for President Obama twice and still got tear gassed\u201d during protests for black freedom felt viscerally the failures of identity politics in the streets, courts, and classrooms.</p> \n<p>No amount of \u201cBlack girl magic,\u201d \u201cRooting for everybody black,\u201d or \u201cTrust Black women\u201d hashtags could convince left leaning voters that Senator Harris could relate to the masses of women of color suffering in this country. Quite contrarily, Harris is criticized for <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-truancy-arrests-2020-progressive-prosecutor_n_5c995789e4b0f7bfa1b57d2e\">expanding their suffering</a> during her time as a prosecutor and a state attorney general.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>James Baldwin, discussing the possibility of the first black president in The Fire Next Time, asked: \u201cWhat I am really curious about is just what kind of country he will be president of.\u201d We live in a country that is, in policy and practice, often militaristic, racist, classist, sexist, and anti-immigrant. Given the recent wave of social movements, from Occupy to Black Lives Matter, from the Women\u2019s March to the March for Our Lives, people are being pushed to think more expansively about how to fundamentally change the country and themselves. And that requires supporting a fundamentally different kind of candidate than Harris \u2013 despite her being undeniably qualified for the job.</p> \n<p>In addition to accusations of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html\">campaign mismanagement </a>and lack of financial resources, Senator Harris also fell short because she committed to a grassroots funded campaign without any serious commitments to grassroots struggle. Senator Bernie Sanders is probably leading the field with the most amount of unique donors because he offers policies most closely aligned with that the most oppressed face: debt, healthcare, justice, and education. Dozens of black women organizers and activists endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren because of her specific plans to help black women. Did these candidates outraise Senator Harris because they are white? Likely. But between these two viable options for progressives, and Biden capturing large voting bases because of his Obama ties and supposed electability, Harris could not maintain a base.</p> \n<p>As a black woman and lawyer, I did not even see myself in Harris, but instead found myself in solidarity with the people who suffered while she was a prosecutor and Attorney General of California and would have suffered under her administration, had she won the election. While she was the little girl who rode the desegregated school buses that Biden threatened, I was the little homeless girl struggling with absenteeism whose parent Harris would have threatened.</p> \n<p>As calls for solidarity, justice and dignity for Palestinians rose, Harris sided with Donald Trump and <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-resolution/6/text\">criticized</a> outgoing President Obama\u2019s refusal to veto a United Nations resolution denouncing illegal Israeli expansion into occupied territory. When she announced refusal to vote for a US border wall, she called for increasing surveillance and drones to increase border security - a virtual wall.</p> \n<p>And when a moderator asked her to reconcile her controversial record as a prosecutor at a town hall hosted by formerly incarcerated people, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/10/30/criminal-justice-town-hall-democratic-candidates/\">she responded</a>, \u201cThere are a lot of people who have language now about it, but I would ask you to challenge them, ask them, what have they actually done to reform the criminal justice system? And then I\u2019ll have more of a conversation with you about my record.\u201d What Harris mastered in racial rhetoric and storytelling during debates, she lacked in substantive policy proposals for people of color.</p> \n<p>Notwithstanding the internal downfall of her campaign, Senator Harris\u2019 absence undoubtedly reinforces racial, gender and financial obstacles that diverse candidates face in presidential races. Without any significant changes, this cycle will repeat, even for left of center candidates like Julian Castro. I predict Senator Cory Booker, Deval Patrick, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard will all drop due to traction or resources, while white or wealthy candidates with equally flat or worse campaign promises remain, including Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden.</p> \n<p>The political system certainly expels candidates of color, but, unfortunately for her, Senator Harris had much more than a resource problem.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a social movement lawyer and writer based in Washington DC</p></li> \n</ul>",

James Baldwin, discussing the possibility of the first black president in The Fire Next Time, asked: \u201cWhat I am really curious about is just what kind of country he will be president of.\u201d We live in a country that is, in policy and practice, often militaristic, racist, classist, sexist, and anti-immigrant. Given the recent wave of social movements, from Occupy to Black Lives Matter, from the Women\u2019s March to the March for Our Lives, people are being pushed to think more expansively about how to fundamentally change the country and themselves. And that requires supporting a fundamentally different kind of candidate than Harris \u2013 despite her being undeniably qualified for the job. In addition to accusations of campaign mismanagement and lack of financial resources, Senator Harris also fell short because she committed to a grassroots funded campaign without any serious commitments to grassroots struggle. Senator Bernie Sanders is probably leading the field with the most amount of unique donors because he offers policies most closely aligned with that the most oppressed face: debt, healthcare, justice, and education. Dozens of black women organizers and activists endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren because of her specific plans to help black women. Did these candidates outraise Senator Harris because they are white? Likely. But between these two viable options for progressives, and Biden capturing large voting bases because of his Obama ties and supposed electability, Harris could not maintain a base. As a black woman and lawyer, I did not even see myself in Harris, but instead found myself in solidarity with the people who suffered while she was a prosecutor and Attorney General of California and would have suffered under her administration, had she won the election. While she was the little girl who rode the desegregated school buses that Biden threatened, I was the little homeless girl struggling with absenteeism whose parent Harris would have threatened. As calls for solidarity, justice and dignity for Palestinians rose, Harris sided with Donald Trump and criticized outgoing President Obama\u2019s refusal to veto a United Nations resolution denouncing illegal Israeli expansion into occupied territory. When she announced refusal to vote for a US border wall, she called for increasing surveillance and drones to increase border security - a virtual wall. And when a moderator asked her to reconcile her controversial record as a prosecutor at a town hall hosted by formerly incarcerated people, she responded, \u201cThere are a lot of people who have language now about it, but I would ask you to challenge them, ask them, what have they actually done to reform the criminal justice system? And then I\u2019ll have more of a conversation with you about my record.\u201d What Harris mastered in racial rhetoric and storytelling during debates, she lacked in substantive policy proposals for people of color. Notwithstanding the internal downfall of her campaign, Senator Harris\u2019 absence undoubtedly reinforces racial, gender and financial obstacles that diverse candidates face in presidential races. Without any significant changes, this cycle will repeat, even for left of center candidates like Julian Castro. I predict Senator Cory Booker, Deval Patrick, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard will all drop due to traction or resources, while white or wealthy candidates with equally flat or worse campaign promises remain, including Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden. The political system certainly expels candidates of color, but, unfortunately for her, Senator Harris had much more than a resource problem.

      "bodyText": "The long-running legal dispute between Rugby Australia and Israel Folau has ended with a settlement reached over the former Wallaby\u2019s sacking in the wake of an anti-gay social media post in April. RA apologised to Folau in a joint statement issued on Wednesday that draws a line under the bitter affair, although the exact terms of the settlement will remain confidential. The parties have been involved in mediation this week over Folau\u2019s $14m compensation claim after the former rugby league and AFL player claimed his dismissal by RA and Rugby NSW was unfair, following his post on Instagram that hell awaits \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers\u201d and others. A statement from RA, RNSW and Folau said the post reflected Folau\u2019s \u201cgenuinely held religious beliefs\u201d and that he \u201cdid not intend to harm or offend any person when he uploaded the post\u201d. \u201cMr Folau wants all Australians to know that he does not condone discrimination of any kind against any person on the grounds of their sexuality and that he shares Rugby Australia\u2019s commitment to inclusiveness and diversity,\u201d the statement read. RA said it did not agree with the content of Folau\u2019s post, before each party wished the other well for the future. \u201cInclusiveness is one of rugby\u2019s core values and it welcomes all people to the game, including all members of the LGBTI community,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWhile it was not Rugby Australia\u2019s intention, Rugby Australia acknowledges and apologises for any hurt or harm caused to the Folaus. Similarly, Mr Folau did not intend to hurt or harm the game of rugby and acknowledges and apologises for any hurt or harm caused.\u201d Folau\u2019s four-year, $4m contract was ripped up in May, after an independent panel hearing found his social media post to have breached the terms of his employment, effectively ending his rugby union career in Australia. The 30-year-old had argued \u201cno Australian of any faith should be fired for practising religion\u201d and sought \u201csubstantial remedies\u201d from his former employers. His initial claim of $10m was increased to $14m last week. On Monday the chief executive of Rugby Australia, Raelene Castle, claimed Folau had admitted his comments caused harm but would not hold back from posting whatever he liked. Folau has continued to court controversy since his sacking, most recently attracting criticism for comments he made during a church sermon when he implied the devastating bush fires on Australia\u2019s east coast were God\u2019s punishment for legalising same-sex marriage and abortion. News of Wednesday\u2019s settlement was welcomed by Equality Australia, who said it put an end to a \u201cdivisive and hurtful period for LGBTIQ+ people in rugby, in sport and more generally\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "As Australia\u2019s bushfires rage, smoke is posing a growing health risk. Bushfire smoke carries PM2.5 particles \u2013 which have a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less \u2013 and can cause long-term health problems. People with asthma, lung disease or cardiovascular disease, and the young and the elderly, are all at particular risk, and New South Wales Health advises them to stay indoors and limit exposure on smoky days. Increasingly, people are turning to face masks. But are they any practical use? Dr Christine Cowie, a respiratory health expert from the Centre for Air Pollution, Energy and Health Research and the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, spoke to Guardian Australia. Will a mask do anything? In most cases, the answer is no. There are very few academic studies about the effectiveness of face masks, and wearing a mask is not the main recommended safety measure. Crucially, a surgeon\u2019s mask (or similar cloth or paper masks) won\u2019t work \u2013 the particles in bushfire smoke are too fine. Cowie says the only effective mask is a P2 mask \u2013 the kind worn by builders and sold in hardware stores. And, it has to seal well around your face. Which means you need to test it out for fit, like shoes or clothes. Different face and nose shapes will need different masks. \u201cIf it is not fitted very carefully over the nose and mouth, people will still be exposed to the smoke,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you need to inspect the package and make sure it will filter out PM2.5.\u201d A spokesperson for the NSW Health reiterated that concern. \u201cP2 face masks can filter out most PM2.5. However, evidence suggests they may not work in practice as they require an extremely good fit.\u201d \u201cThis is difficult for people to achieve outside of an occupational setting where they can be properly fit-checked.\u201d Cowie says a mask is \u201cnot the best public health measure that we can offer\u201d. \u201cWe support the advice from the health department, which is to stay indoors and trying to minimise your exposure as much as possible.\u201d For those at particular risk, \u201cadhering to your medication program is the main messages we want to get out\u201d. Will an air purifier or air conditioner help? Cowie says the research is still \u201cnot sure\u201d about air conditioners. General household air conditioners do not have the filters needed for PM2.5. If one is used, it must be put on a recirculation setting so it is not taking in air from outside. Air purifiers \u2013 with a specific Hepa filter \u2013 could do more. \u201cThere are a few studies that indicate air purifiers are useful in reducing particulate matter indoors, but they do need to be fitted with a Hepa filter,\u201d Cowie says. Be aware that every purifier has a set amount of area it can purify. \u201cOne small air purifier will not do a whole house,\u201d Cowie says. A spokesperson for the NSW Health said in a statement: \u201cUsing air conditioning systems in recirculate mode can help reduce particles from indoor air. \u201cAir purifiers can reduce particles in a smaller indoor area such as a single room that is closed off from other areas, however, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness during bushfire smoke events.\u201d If vulnerable, see a doctor Above all, if in doubt, or if you are particularly vulnerable, see a doctor. This includes anyone with asthma, a cardiovascular or respiratory condition, or vulnerable people such as young children and the elderly. Cowie stresses that asthma attacks can be fatal. Those with asthma medication should have a preventer puffer (separate to a reliever puffer) and should use it every day. Those concerned about overusing their medicine should speak to their doctor and double-check their regime. She also advises that residents should try to check the most specific air quality index they can. The NSW Environmental Protection Agency and NSW Health put out health alerts, and people can subscribe to specific area air quality alerts. Again, pay specific attention to the PM2.5 reading \u2013 and be aware that it can vary widely between regions.",

The 300-page report drew incriminating conclusions from the Democrats\u2019 investigation into Trump, including information gathered from the past two weeks of dramatic public hearings, and laid the groundwork for several possible articles of impeachment.

With Tuesday night\u2019s vote, the intelligence committee, which has led the impeachment inquiry so far, has passed the ball to the judiciary committee, which will conduct its own hearings starting Wednesday.

Who\u2019s testifying next? Four law professors \u2013 Noah Feldman, Pamela Karlan, Michael Gerhardt and Jonathan Turley \u2013 will be testifying at Wednesday\u2019s hearings. Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is expected to question four scholars about the legal framework for impeachment and examine whether Trump\u2019s actions count as the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d spelled out in the constitution as grounds for impeachment. The committee is likely to hold additional hearings, though none have been scheduled yet. Democrats expect that the committee will wrap its work within two weeks and produce articles of impeachment.

      "bodyText": "An ophthalmologists group has hit back at claims the organisation at the centre of an internal complaint in the office of the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, charged double the market rate for its services. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Australian Society of Ophthalmologists said it was \u201cextremely proud\u201d to be associated with the Indigenous and Remote Eye Health Service (Iris), which was treating blinding eye disease among the most disadvantaged populations in Australia. Wyatt has also defended the $2.2m contract, which was awarded without a tender process to an organisation linked to the former Liberal candidate Bill Glasson. The contract became the subject of an internal complaint, according to Tuesday\u2019s report in the Sydney Morning Herald. Dr Ashish Agar, vice-president of the ASO, said the organisation asked eye surgeons to take time away from their city practice to operate on Indigenous Australians in the remotest locations. \u201cIt is hard work, difficult surgery on complex cataracts, and most city surgeons are not willing to commit to such time in these difficult conditions,\u201d Agar said. He said it was \u201cutterly incorrect\u201d for the report to state that the $4,000 fee was double the going rate. He said that fee referred to the whole service provided, including pre-operative clinic and post-operative care, consumables and operative eye fluids, intra-ocular lens implant, medical and nursing team and a concessional surgeon fee. The figure also covered the cost of air transport for people and equipment, staff accommodation and meals for up to a week, a charter plane for very remote locations or other transport to pick up Indigenous patients from remote settlements and bring them into town, and a team trained in cultural sensitivity onsite up to a week before surgery to locate, prepare and care for patients. \u201cBy comparison, the NSW government statewide cost price for cataract surgery used in NSW public hospital budgets is $4,823.\u201d Agar said. The president of the ASO, Peter Sumich, also defended the directors of Iris, Bill Glasson and Kerry Gallagher. Glasson, who ran as the Liberal candidate against Kevin Rudd at the 2013 federal election, was a director of Iris between 2016 and 2019, along with Gallagher, a lobbyist. \u201cDr Bill Glasson AO is a respected peer leader and has for decades performed cataract surgery from Longreach to Birdsville and in other Indigenous communities.

William Sualauvi Betham was convicted of involvement in a drug trafficking syndicate and sentenced to 10 years\u2019 jail by the Queensland supreme court, something that would ordinarily trigger an automatic visa cancellation. But Betham was spared deportation and allowed to live in Australia after the visa cancellation was revoked. The case has prompted investigations by the home affairs department and the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity following claims that Betham had boasted to a fellow detainee that he could get his visa back in exchange for financial payments. Dutton has previously said Betham\u2019s visa matter did not \u201ccome to my office for consideration\u201d. But the whistleblower\u2019s complaint to the commonwealth ombudsman states that Dutton\u2019s department prepared a ministerial briefing on the case \u2013 a claim confirmed by documents seen by Guardian Australia. The whistleblower said he believed Dutton\u2019s statement was \u201cpatently false\u201d, but acknowledged he did not know if the brief was actually provided to the minister\u2019s office. Ministerial briefings on potentially controversial matters are routinely sent to ministers\u2019 offices across all portfolios. The whistleblower said in his complaint: \u201cI have no reason to believe that the department withheld the brief from the minister\u2019s office despite being prepared.\u201d Earlier this year, the home affairs department said it had already investigated the Betham case and found the visa decision \u201cwas not provided to the minister or his office for consideration or decision\u201d. The department said in response to a question on notice in Senate estimates hearings in March: \u201cThe Betham visa decision was determined by an officer of the department, pursuant to their delegated authority. \u201cThe department has assessed the allegation of corruption and in accordance with the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, the matter was referred to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI).\u201d The department reiterated that answer when approached by Guardian Australia this week, saying the case never came before the minister for consideration.

Betham, through his lawyer Jennifer Samuta, has previously denied any suggestion he \u201coffered a monetary payment to any official who might be in a position to reinstate his visa, or to an official who might be able to impact a similar decision\u201d. He also denied bragging to fellow detainees at Christmas Island that he could \u201cget his visa back for a monetary payment after it was mandatorily cancelled\u201d. Dutton has attacked the veracity of the witness who said he overheard Betham\u2019s comment, saying he was a convicted criminal with no credibility. Samuta told the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald that the department returned Betham\u2019s visa following her arguments that he had been rehabilitated and was at low risk of reoffending. In March, the home affairs department secretary, Michael Pezzullo, said the matter was under investigation but there was nothing to suggest the alleged corrupt conduct had occurred. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing before me to suggest that any wrongdoing has occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, there is a serious, particularised, quite specific allegation.

The minister\u2019s office referred the Guardian to the department\u2019s previous responses to questions on notice. The commonwealth ombudsman said it could not comment on whether it had received a whistleblower complaint, but noted disclosures about \u201cthe conduct of members of parliament is not covered\u201d by Australia\u2019s whistleblower laws.

I am loving, caring and supportive with a good sense of humour. However, I have had a 20-year marriage and an eight-year relationship both end. Men (or at least the ones I choose) say they love independent women, but all they really seem to mean is they love women who will support them. How should I be in my next relationship? Should I pretend to be a pathetic helpless female who needs a man to save her? I am so disillusioned, I wonder what I am doing wrong.</strong></em></p> <p>There\u2019s a Japanese folk story about a crane who tricks a man into marrying her by pretending to be a woman. She knows that her beloved won\u2019t want her if he discovers she\u2019s a bird, so at night she stays awake and tears out her feathers with her beak. CJ Hauser wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/07/16/the-crane-wife/\">beautiful memoir</a> recently that called on the story: \u201cTo keep becoming a woman is so much self-erasing work.\u201d</p> <p>It looks like a deal. If you do the self-erasure then in exchange you won\u2019t be alone.</p> <p>You shouldn\u2019t take it. Partly just because it\u2019s so horrifically sad. You say you\u2019re caring, capable, intelligent, and you say these things with an energy that tells me you love them about yourself. Don\u2019t pull them out at night.</p> <p>But the other reason you shouldn\u2019t take the deal is that it doesn\u2019t do what it says it will. Even if you paid up by forfeiting your dignity you wouldn\u2019t get what you thought you were buying.

You\u2019d get love in the same move that would make it worthless.</p> <p>The thing is, I think you already know that. I love how you talk about yourself. You know you\u2019re great. I bet you have a drawer with a bunch of string and tape measures in it and a particular way of banging flour off your hands.

      "bodyText": "I am an energetic, capable, intelligent woman of 50. I earn a good salary, I am good at DIY and all other household chores. I am loving, caring and supportive with a good sense of humour. However, I have had a 20-year marriage and an eight-year relationship both end. Men (or at least the ones I choose) say they love independent women, but all they really seem to mean is they love women who will support them. How should I be in my next relationship? Should I pretend to be a pathetic helpless female who needs a man to save her? I am so disillusioned, I wonder what I am doing wrong. There\u2019s a Japanese folk story about a crane who tricks a man into marrying her by pretending to be a woman. She knows that her beloved won\u2019t want her if he discovers she\u2019s a bird, so at night she stays awake and tears out her feathers with her beak. CJ Hauser wrote a beautiful memoir recently that called on the story: \u201cTo keep becoming a woman is so much self-erasing work.\u201d It looks like a deal. If you do the self-erasure then in exchange you won\u2019t be alone. You shouldn\u2019t take it. Partly just because it\u2019s so horrifically sad. You say you\u2019re caring, capable, intelligent, and you say these things with an energy that tells me you love them about yourself. Don\u2019t pull them out at night. But the other reason you shouldn\u2019t take the deal is that it doesn\u2019t do what it says it will. Even if you paid up by forfeiting your dignity you wouldn\u2019t get what you thought you were buying. Love borne of pretence doesn\u2019t make us any less alone. Whatever love you\u2019d trick someone into giving you would be love for an act, and it\u2019s hard not to feel contempt for people you can trick like that. So you won\u2019t really like them, and what they like won\u2019t really be you. It\u2019s a reverse Midas curse, turning what should be gold into dust. You\u2019d get love in the same move that would make it worthless. The thing is, I think you already know that. I love how you talk about yourself. You know you\u2019re great. I bet you have a drawer with a bunch of string and tape measures in it and a particular way of banging flour off your hands. You know you don\u2019t want to change. The real problem is that when we realise the choice between modifying and being alone was always just a choice between two ways of being alone, we\u2019re left with just being alone. I could say all the usual things about how love comes when you give it to yourself, and how the thoughts that say \u201cno one will ever want me\u201d are liars that speak most loudly in the silence after a recent love has closed the door. But the truth is you might not get the thing you really want. You might not find love with someone who values you as you are. It\u2019s hard. What I do know is that women like you keep me going; remind me of the joy and the strength it takes to spend decades refusing to capitulate to a world that wants you to be less. There\u2019s no way around the fact that it will hurt if being yourself means being unloved, but love has been wildly overstated as the key to a valuable life. It\u2019s disappointing not to get it, but it\u2019s worse to disappoint yourself. Keep your feathers. ************************************* Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Last month cabinet passed the zero-carbon bill, committing to reduce emission to net-zero by 2050.

      "bodyText": "Coalition hopes of an income tax cut led recovery have been deflated by figures showing the Australian economy grew by just 0.4% in the September quarter, for total yearly growth of 1.7%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the gross domestic product figures on Wednesday, confirming that growth has slowed from 0.6% in seasonally adjusted chain volume terms in the June quarter although yearly growth has ticked up from a revised figure of 1.6%. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the figures showed the Australian economy was \u201cremarkably resilient\u201d in the face of global headwinds such as trade tensions,and local conditions including drought. Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra the government would continue to \u201cstay the course\u201d in seeking the first budget surplus in 12 years. Scott Morrison said he was \u201cpleased\u201d by the figures, which Labor\u2019s Jim Chalmers labelled \u201can outrage\u201d. Despite government hopes this quarter would see a bounce off the back of tax cuts for low and middle income earners of up to $1,080, household expenditure increased by just 0.1% due to weak spending on discretionary goods and services. Household gross disposable income increased by 2.5% due to the tax cuts and lower mortgage repayments after three interest rate cuts this year. But households did not chose to boost spending \u2013 instead discretionary spending fell 0.3% and the savings ratio rose to 4.8%. While mining investment declined 7.8% this quarter and 11.2% through the year, government final consumption expenditure rose 0.9% in the quarter and remains strong through the year at 6.0%. ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said: \u201cThe economy has continued to grow, however the rate of growth remains well below the long run average.\u201d \u201cThe reduction to tax payable did not translate to a rise in discretionary spending, which led to a visible impact to household saving.\u201d Frydenberg conceded he would \u201clike consumption to be higher\u201d but put a positive spin on the savings rate, suggesting that households paying down debt would allow them to spend more later. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the government had suffered \u201ctotal humiliation\u201d due to the weaker-than-expected result, telling reporters that \u201cclearly the tax cuts are not doing the job\u201d. \u201cJosh Frydenberg keeps lowering the bar and keeps tripping over it. The test isn\u2019t if there is any growth in the economy at all \u2013 the test is whether there is enough growth to boost wages.\u201d Chalmers suggested the government should consider a business investment tax incentive among other measures to boost growth. Earlier, Frydenberg said the government is in discussions with business about possible initiatives but refused to say if they could be contained in the mid-year economic and fiscal update due later in December. The Reserve Bank has suggested the Australia economy is at a \u201cgentle turning point\u201d after disappointing annual growth figures of just 1.4% in the year to June \u2013 the lowest recorded annual rate since 2009. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that growth will return to 2.3% in 2020. Although the Morrison government has attempted to stimulate the economy by accelerating infrastructure spending, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have persisted with a contractionary fiscal policy in the hope of banking a surplus. Capital Economics senior Australian and New Zealand economist Marcel Thieliant said the \u201csubdued rise in GDP\u201d \u2013 lower than the Bloomberg consensus of 0.5% and a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d from the last quarter of 0.6% \u2013 meant the RBA \u201cwill have to provide more stimulus before long\u201d. \u201cParticularly disappointing was the measly 0.1% [quarter on quarter] increase in private consumption. \u201cThis was the slowest increase since the global financial crisis and underlines that the government\u2019s tax cuts aren\u2019t providing any boost to consumer spending.\u201d \u201cWhile the 0.7% quarterly fall in private investment wasn\u2019t as bad as we had anticipated, the RBA\u2019s forecast that it will be rising by 3.2% by year-end looks wide of the mark.\u201d Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics, agreed that the figures showed \u201cchronic weakness in household spending\u201d and \u201cno sign yet\u201d that the increase in tax offsets and rate cuts are supporting consumption.

      "body": "<p>In Australia\u2019s match against Brazil at July\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, there was a moment that perfectly encapsulated the eye-catching playing style of right-back Ellie Carpenter, who has been voted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/dec/03/the-100-best-female-footballers-in-the-world-2019\">the 88th best women\u2019s footballer on the planet</a>.</p> <p>It was the second half, and Australia had dragged themselves back into the game after conceding twice, largely against the run of play. Carpenter collected the ball in her own half and drove into the empty green space beyond. It was an image anybody who has recently watched the 19-year old is familiar with: her torso upright, her arms slicing through the air, her white-blonde ponytail blazing out behind her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/dec/03/the-100-best-female-footballers-in-the-world-2019\">The 100 best female footballers in the world 2019: 100-71</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But just as she was reaching maximum stride, Carpenter was tackled. She stumbled into the opposition half and whirled around, realising her mistake: she was out of position, and the whole team would have to slide across to cover her, leaving the far flank exposed. But she did not let them. Instead, Carpenter sprinted back the way she had come as though her life depended on it, covering 20 metres in a few breathless seconds. She caught the tackling player, shouldered her off the ball and came away with it at her feet again.</p> <p>It was a recovery reminiscent of Kelley O\u2019Hara of the US or England\u2019s Lucy Bronze, not just in the ability to charge down and make a tackle against a world-class opponent, but to do so soon after trying to spark an attack further upfield.</p> <p>Modern football is defined, in part, by the overlapping full-back. Liverpool\u2019s recent European successes, for example, have come off the boot of their two wide defenders, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. The latter even holds the record for most assists by a defender in the Premier League. It is a position that requires incredible fitness as well as discipline, creativity and a more complex, holistic reading of the field.</p> <p>O\u2019Hara and Bronze fully encapsulate the philosophy of the overlapping full-back in women\u2019s football, though they weren\u2019t the first to do so. Right-back Kerstin Stegemann was part of Germany\u2019s record-breaking World Cup win in 2007. Her team did not concede a single goal throughout the tournament, while Stegemann herself scored in the semi-final against heavyweights Norway after sprinting almost the entire length of the field and chipping the keeper from inside the box.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f451a23393842c87a7e116d6e361d4175ed8e2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f451a23393842c87a7e116d6e361d4175ed8e2a/0_0_4472_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ellie Carpenter of Melbourne City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ellie Carpenter in full flow for Melbourne City this season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Attacking full-backs have now become a staple of the game, with O\u2019Hara and Bronze arguably the two most dominant players still deployed there.

      "bodyText": "In Australia\u2019s match against Brazil at July\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup, there was a moment that perfectly encapsulated the eye-catching playing style of right-back Ellie Carpenter, who has been voted the 88th best women\u2019s footballer on the planet. It was the second half, and Australia had dragged themselves back into the game after conceding twice, largely against the run of play. Carpenter collected the ball in her own half and drove into the empty green space beyond. It was an image anybody who has recently watched the 19-year old is familiar with: her torso upright, her arms slicing through the air, her white-blonde ponytail blazing out behind her. But just as she was reaching maximum stride, Carpenter was tackled. She stumbled into the opposition half and whirled around, realising her mistake: she was out of position, and the whole team would have to slide across to cover her, leaving the far flank exposed. But she did not let them. Instead, Carpenter sprinted back the way she had come as though her life depended on it, covering 20 metres in a few breathless seconds. She caught the tackling player, shouldered her off the ball and came away with it at her feet again. It was a recovery reminiscent of Kelley O\u2019Hara of the US or England\u2019s Lucy Bronze, not just in the ability to charge down and make a tackle against a world-class opponent, but to do so soon after trying to spark an attack further upfield. Modern football is defined, in part, by the overlapping full-back. Liverpool\u2019s recent European successes, for example, have come off the boot of their two wide defenders, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold. The latter even holds the record for most assists by a defender in the Premier League. It is a position that requires incredible fitness as well as discipline, creativity and a more complex, holistic reading of the field. O\u2019Hara and Bronze fully encapsulate the philosophy of the overlapping full-back in women\u2019s football, though they weren\u2019t the first to do so. Right-back Kerstin Stegemann was part of Germany\u2019s record-breaking World Cup win in 2007. Her team did not concede a single goal throughout the tournament, while Stegemann herself scored in the semi-final against heavyweights Norway after sprinting almost the entire length of the field and chipping the keeper from inside the box. Attacking full-backs have now become a staple of the game, with O\u2019Hara and Bronze arguably the two most dominant players still deployed there. But it is the Lioness who first comes to mind when we talk about the model for the modern full-back: her determined forward runs, her physicality on and off the ball, and her play-making abilities saw Bronze finish fourth in last year\u2019s 100 Best Female Footballers list. You had to go down almost 80 more places before finding another specialist full-back in Selma Bacha (they were, coincidentally, the only two full-backs on the list). In the four years that she has been on the senior international scene, Carpenter has shown glimpses of the kinds of qualities these influential full-backs possess: boldness, athleticism and a natural instinct to go forward \u2013 to find space and create opportunities. She also embodies the ideal Australian style of football in her lung-busting, all-or-nothing approach, whether that manifests in a single tackle or across the full 90 minutes. Her first season with NWSL club Portland Thorns in 2018 was a memorable one: not only did she become the youngest player to appear in what many consider the best women\u2019s league in the world, at 18 years and 11 days old, but she also became its youngest goal scorer a few games later. They were some fitting records to break given that Carpenter was already the youngest Australian and youngest female footballer to compete at the Olympics, aged just 15.

Testimony.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary says. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTo compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Wednesday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s a recap of today: The House intelligence committee approved an impeachment report voting 13-9 along party lines. The report accuses Trump of abusing his power for personal gain by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, and obstructing Congress\u2019 investigation into his actions. The impeachment inquiry is now in the hands of the Judiciary Committee, which is holding its first hearings tomorrow and is expected to draft specific articles of impeachment down the line. Kamala Harris ended her presidential campaign. The California senator could still get a chance to face Trump at his trial if the House votes to impeach him. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy says he has \u201cno concerns\u201d over call records in the impeachment report. The report mentioned that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was in contact with Devin Nunes, a Republican representative on the Intelligence Committee leading the impeachment inquiry, as Giuliani began spreading baseless allegations against Joe Biden and his family. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with Devin talking to individuals,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. \u201cI have no concerns.\u201d What now? Next steps in the impeachment process Now that the Intelligence Committee has approved its impeachment report, the proceedings will move over to the House Judiciary Committee, which is holding hearings starting tomorrow. Judiciary is then expected to draft the specific articles of impeachment against Trump, today\u2019s report hints could include charges of obstruction of Congress and allegations that Trump comprised national security for personal gain by asking Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Kamala Harris to Trump: \u2018I\u2019ll see you at your trial\u2019 When Kamala Harris announced she was dropping out of the presidential race earlier today, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign reacted by congratulating Tulsi Gabbard, who often clashed with Harris on the debate stage. Trump tweeted, \u201cToo bad. We will miss you Kamala!\u201d. Harris responded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s still a senator who, if the House votes to impeach the president, will be at the trial deciding whether he should be removed from office. The committee voted 13-9 along party lines to adopt the report. Read key takeaways here: The report alleges that Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of national security\u201d. Though it doesn\u2019t recommend specific articles of impeachment, the document hints at charges of obstruction of justice, among others. Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee also accuse Trump of a cover-up, contending that the president \u201cordered and implemented a campaign to conceal his conduct from the public and frustrate and obstruct the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry\u201d. Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution will question experts at the Judiciary Committee hearing tomorrow, the Washington Post reports. Eisen was the chief ethics lawyer for Barack Obama and US ambassador to the Czech Republic. The judiciary committee is expected to question four law professors during the hearing scheduled for tomorrow. The Republican representative from California pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges relating to his misuse of more than $200,000 in campaign funds. Federal prosecutors had charged him with using campaign money to pay for a $14,000 Italian vacation and other expenses including dog food, groceries, bedding and utilities. \u201cCongressman Duncan D. Hunter violated the trust of his supporters by diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars they donated in good faith to his reelection campaign for personal expenditures,\u201d said assistant U.S. attorney David Leshner said in a statement. Hunter had previously said that he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. In his plea agreement today, the congressman admitted that he knowingly and willfully stole money to fund their lifestye. Well, that was a full day of news, and my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will have more updates in the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Democrats on the House intelligence committee released their report on the impeachment inquiry, which accused Trump of both abusing his power to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and obstructing the investigation into his actions. Kamala Harris suspended her presidential campaign. The California senator was considered a frontrunner in the race earlier this year but saw her polling and fundraising numbers dwindle as she struggled to craft a consistent pitch for her candidacy. A federal appeals court ruled Deutsche Bank and Capitol One must comply with a congressional subpoena seeking Trump\u2019s financial records, but the president\u2019s legal team is likely to appeal the decision. Trump and Emmanuel Macron clashed during a news conference in London, where the French president criticized his US counterpart\u2019s stances on a number of foreign-policy issues -- including outreach to Russia and the state of ISIS. The House judiciary committee will hold its first hearing in the impeachment inquiry tomorrow morning. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. AT&amp;T said in a statement that it was \u201crequired by law\u201d to hand over phone records to the House intelligence committee, which were requested as part of the panel\u2019s impeachment inquiry. The phone records showed Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was in contact with Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, and an official at the office of management and budget as he started to peddle baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. \u201cLike all companies, we are required by law to provide information to government and law enforcement agencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. \u201cIn all cases, we ensure that requests for assistance are valid and that we act in compliance with the law.\u201d Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, dodged a question about why he was calling an official at the office of management and budget as he was simultaneously pushing for the ouster of Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Call records included in the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee indicate Giuliani was in contact with not only the OMB official but also Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee. As Trump combats the impeachment inquiry, his personal lawyers have reportedly been sidelined by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his team of attorneys. The Washington Post reports: In the face of allegations that Trump abused his office for political gain, the White House lawyers are not sharing with his personal attorneys some internal government records central to the inquiry about the pressure the administration put on Ukraine, citing the need to protect executive privilege. The unusual decision to have the White House counsel captain the president\u2019s defense \u2014 at least for now \u2014 departs from how previous presidents have contended with impeachment proceedings and has worried some Trump allies, who believe a multipronged defense would be stronger. It also contrasts sharply with the legal strategy the White House deployed in responding to former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. In that case, Trump\u2019s personal lawyers led his defense in coordination with select White House attorneys. A lawyer for Lev Parnas, the former associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s who aided the Trump lawyer\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into the Democrats, suggested congressman Devin Nunes should have recused himself from the impeachment inquiry. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee showed Parnas and Nunes were in communication as Giuliani began spreading baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of the House oversight committee, suggested the judiciary committee should quickly begin drafting articles of impeachment against Trump following the release of the intelligence committee\u2019s report on the inquiry. The judiciary committee will hold its first public hearing in the inquiry tomorrow, which will focus on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. Adam Schiff has just concluded his news conference following the release of the House intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry. The committee chairman concluded his remarks by answering a reporter\u2019s question about Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the panel who was apparently in contact with Rudy Giuliani as the president\u2019s personal lawyer began to peddle baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. Schiff acknoweldged it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that there \u201cmay have been members of Congres complicit in\u201d trying to dig up dirt on Biden, but the chairman warned there was still much left to uncover about those communications. \u201cOur focus is on the president\u2019s conduct first and foremost,\u201d Schiff said, suggesting it may be up to others -- possibly the House ethics committee? -- to investigate the actions of some of Trump\u2019s allies. Adam Schiff said he would \u201ccontinue to reserve judgement\u201d on whether Trump should be impeached and removed from office, even though his panel just released a report accusing the president of abusing his power to have a political rival investigated. But the intelligence committee chairman did acknowledge he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about the allegations outlined in the impeachment report, warning that Trump\u2019s actions could \u201cinvite further corruption of our elections.\u201d Adam Schiff encouraged his Republican colleagues to seriously consider the allegations against Trump, warning that their dismissal of the inquiry could set a dangerous precedent for future presidents. \u201cTo my Republican colleagues, they need to consider when we have a Democratic president, are they willing to say to their oversight that the president can simply refuse?\u201d the House intelligence committee said. But Schiff emphasized Democrats would not abandon the investigation, despite Republican opposition. \u201cI firmly believe that if one party relinquishes its responsibility to the constitution and to their oath, it does not relieve us of our obligation to the same,\u201d Schiff said. House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff said his panel\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry \u201cchronicles a scheme\u201d by Trump to pressure Ukraine into \u201cdoing the president\u2019s political dirty work.\u201d The California Democrat asserted Trump had leveraged a potential White House meeting and military assistance to pursue his political agenda. \u201cThese were things that Ukraine desperately wanted and needed,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThis is not about Ukraine. This is about our democracy,\u201d the chairman added, accusing Trump of \u201cbetraying that oath that he took to the constitution to protect our country and defend its institutions.\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, is holding a news conference following the release of his panel\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee outlines frequent communication between Rudy Giuliani and the White House as the president\u2019s personal lawyer pushed for the ouster of Maria Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in May, even though the deputy secretary of state told her she had done nothing wrong in the role. The editor-in-chief of the Hill said the newspaper was launching a \u201cmeticulous review\u201d of John Solomon\u2019s columns after the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee revealed the former opinion writer was in frequent contact with former Giuliani associate Lev Parnas. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee lays out the findings from their hearings but does not offer an explicit recommendation on articles of impeachment, instead leaving that matter up to the House judiciary commitee. The judiciary committee will hold its first public hearing of the inquiry tomorrow, and it will focus on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. The White House slammed the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee, saying the document \u201creads like the ramblings of a basement blogger.\u201d \u201cAt the end of a one-sided sham process, Chairman Schiff and the Democrats utterly failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by President Trump,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. \u201cThis report reflects nothing more than their frustrations. Chairman Schiff\u2019s report reads like the ramblings of a basement blogger straining to prove something when there is evidence of nothing.\u201d Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, was repeatedly in contact with Rudy Giulaini as the president\u2019s personal lawyer started spreading baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden, according to the impeachment report. CNN reported late last month that Nunes, who has been one of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders against the impeachment inquiry, met with a former Ukrainian prosecutor in an effort to get dirt on Biden. According to the impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee, John Solomon, a former opinion writer for the Hill newspaper who wrote misleading op-eds about Ukraine, was in frequent contact with Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s who is now facing federal campaign-finance charges. The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee levels two main charges against Trump: that he \u201cConditioned a White House Meeting and Military Aid to Ukraine on a Public Announcement of Investigations Beneficial to his Reelection Campaign\u201d and that he \u201cObstructed the Impeachment Inquiry by Instructing Witnesses and Agencies to Ignore Subpoenas for Documents and Testimony.\u201d \u201cThe President demanded that the newly-elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announce investigations into a political rival that he apparently feared the most, former Vice President Joe Biden, and into a discredited theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary says. \u201cTo compel the Ukrainian President to do his political bidding, President Trump conditioned two official acts on the public announcement of the investigations: a coveted White House visit and critical U.S. military assistance Ukraine needed to fight its Russian adversary.\u201d The impeachment report from Democrats on the House intelligence committee runs 300 pages long and outlines the lawmakers\u2019 argument that Trump abused the power of the presidency to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s scheme subverted U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine and undermined our national security in favor of two politically motivated investigations that would help his presidential reelection campaign,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary says. The Democrats on the House intelligence committee have released their report on the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe impeachment inquiry into Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, uncovered a months-long effort by President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference on his behalf in the 2020 election,\u201d the report says. With the announcement that she is suspending her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris is poised to become a key voice for Senate Democrats during the expected trial on whether to remove Trump from office. Harris serves on the Senate judiciary committee and has become well known for the tough questions she poses to Trump administration officials, including former attorney general Jeff Sessions. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign reacted to the news that Kamala Harris was ending her White House bid by congratulating Tulsi Gabbard, who repeatedly clashed with Harris on the debate stage. Presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who eclipsed Kamala Harris in polling in recent months, celebrated the California senator\u2019s long career and predicted she would continue to play a vital role in the Democratic Party. Kamala Harris\u2019 opponents applauded her as a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d and a \u201clifelong fighter for opportunity and justice\u201d following the California senator\u2019s announcement that she would not continue with her presidential campaign. With Kamala Harris\u2019 withdrawal from the Democratic presidential race, six candidates are now expected to participate in the December debate -- although there are nine days left to qualify. As one commentator pointed out, without Harris on the stage, all the candidates who have already qualified -- Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer -- are white. Kamala Harris has just sent a tweet sharing the email to supporters announcing her decision to withdraw from the presidential race. \u201cI want to be clear: although I am no longer running for President, I will do everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump and fight for the future of our country and the best of who we are,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cI know you will too. So let\u2019s do that together.\u201d In an email to supporters announcing her decision, Kamala Harris said her campaign lacked the financial resources to continue with the bid. The California senator lagged behind fellow candidates like Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg in third-quarter fundraising. Harris wrote in her email: Eleven months ago at the launch of our campaign in Oakland I told you all: \u2018I am not perfect. But I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect. I will lead with integrity. I will speak the truth.\u2019 And that\u2019s what I have tried to do every day of this campaign. So here\u2019s the truth today. I\u2019ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn\u2019t have the financial resources we need to continue. I\u2019m not a billionaire. I can\u2019t fund my own campaign. And as the campaign has gone on, it\u2019s become harder and harder to raise the money we need to compete. In good faith, I can\u2019t tell you, my supporters and volunteers, that I have a path forward if I don\u2019t believe I do. So, to you my supporters, it is with deep regret -- but also with deep gratitude -- that I am suspending my campaign today. The timing of Kamala Harris\u2019 announcement makes more sense in the context of the California presidential primary, given that the senator only had a few days left to drop out without appearing on the state\u2019s primary ballot. The Guardian has confirmed Kamala Harris is ending her presidential campaign, but the California senator has not yet posted a video announcing her decision. Joe Biden, campaigning in Iowa, said he had \u201cmixed emotions\u201d about the news, calling Harris a \u201cfirst-rate candidate.\u201d Harris\u2019 biggest campaign moment came when she criticized Biden\u2019s past opposition to busing during the first Democratic debates. Kamala Harris has not yet confirmed she is dropping out of the presidential race, but her husband just shared this photo as reports indicate the California senator has informed her staff of the decision. Kamala Harris\u2019 niece has just shared this tweet amid reports she is ending her White House campaign. A video announcing the decision is reportedly forthcoming from the California senator. Kamala Harris canceled a fundraiser with major donors in New York earlier today, citing a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d and not elaborating on a possible rescheduling date for the event. CNBC reported: The event, which was scheduled to take place on Tuesday at the Paul Weiss law firm, was suddenly dropped due to what was described by the campaign as a \u2018personal matter,\u2019 according to people familiar with the situation. No date was given for rescheduling. Donors were informed of the decision earlier Tuesday. An invitation shows that the fundraiser was expected to draw some of Harris\u2019 top bundlers, including hedge fund executive Marc Lasry, financier Blair Effron and Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp. All three are listed as members of Harris\u2019 finance committee. Also slated to attend was Citigroup executive Ray McGuire and music industry investor Matt Pincus. Senator Kamala Harris has reportedly dropped out of the presidential race amid dwindling polling and fundraising numbers. The California senator was considered a frontrunner in the race early on, but she struggled to catch fire in a crowded field. Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the panel\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry runs hundreds of pages long, but the Connecticut lawmaker would not say whether it recommends specific articles of impeachment against Trump. The House intelligence committee plans to release its report on the impeachment inquiry, which is backed by the panel\u2019s Democrats, this evening, according to CNN. CNN reports: The report from the House Intelligence Committee makes the Democrats\u2019 case for impeachment, weaving a narrative about Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine, including with exhibits and phone logs, the sources said. The report will also compare Trump\u2019s lack of cooperation with Congress with the cooperation in past administrations to argue that this President has engaged in unprecedented stonewalling. The committee\u2019s report, which is expected to be released publicly Tuesday evening, will serve as the backbone of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings against the President. The committee is expected to vote to approve it on Tuesday evening to send it to the House Judiciary Committee, where it is expected to serve as the basis of articles of impeachment that would be drafted by that panel in the coming days. The report\u2019s public release will come one day after Republicans on the House intelligence committee released their own 123-page report, which defended Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine and claimed the impeachment inquiry was nothing more than a partisan stunt. Meanwhile, it looks like the sentencing of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017, has been pushed back until at least mid-January as a federal judge has granted the former official permission to travel to South Korea later this month. Senator John Kennedy, who has repeatedly suggested that Ukraine may have meddled in the 2016 election, dodged a question about the baseless accusation as he entered an elevator with Mitt Romney, who said in a statement today that he has seen \u201cno evidence\u201d of Ukrainian election interference. Senate Republicans are offering a range of answers on whether they believe the accusation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, a baseless claim peddled by the Kremlin and echoed by Trump and some of his allies. Some GOP senators have argued Ukraine might have meddled in the election alongside other countries like Russia, but a handful of lawmakers -- including Utah senator Mitt Romney -- have placed the blame for 2016 election interference squarely on the Kremlin, as the US intelligence community has. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, has just issued a statement insisting the congressional subpoena for Trump\u2019s financial records is \u201cinvalid as issued.\u201d The statement comes after a federal appeals court ruled that Deutsche Bank and Capitol One must hand over documents in connection to the subpoena, but Sekulow suggested Trump\u2019s legal team may appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. David Hale, the undersecretary of state who testified last month during the public impeachment hearings, told the Senate foreign relations committee that he has seen no evidence of Ukraine having meddled in the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s Republican allies have floated the baseless claim that Ukraine interfered in the election to substantiate the president\u2019s request for an investigation into the conspiracy theory. But Hale pointed out that the US intelligence community has firmly concluded Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and Fiona Hill, the former top White House expert on Russia, testified during the impeachment hearings that this baseless accusation against Ukraine is a \u201cfictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services.\u201d Asked whether he had any reason to disagree with Hill, Hale said, \u201cI do not.\u201d Trump talked to reporters three times today -- appearing alongside Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. All together, the US president spoke to the press for more than two hours today. Meanwhile, Republicans on the House oversight committee are keeping up their messaging campaign against the impeachment inquiry by ... photo-shopping chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s face into a poster for the movie \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d Speaking to reporters just now in London, Trump called Schiff a \u201cmaniac,\u201d a \u201cderanged human being\u201d and a \u201cvery sick man\u201d for his handling of the impeachment inquiry. Trump has now wrapped up his news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, during which the US president announced the June G7 summit would be held at Camp David. The president\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had previously announced the summit would be held at Trump\u2019s resort in Doral, Florida, but that decision was quickly reversed amid intense criticism from Democrats and Republicans. Ironically, when Mulvaney announced the initial choice of Doral, he claimed that the past G7 site of Camp David had been a \u201ccomplete disaster.\u201d \u201cIn fact, I understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G7,\u201d Mulvaney said at the time. Sitting next to the Canadian prime minister in London, Trump railed against the House impeachment inquiry, calling intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff a \u201cderanged human being.\u201d Echoing past comments, the president insisted Democrats have gone \u201ccrazy\u201d over impeachment and said they should be \u201cashamed\u201d of themselves for how they have handled the inquiry. Trump just claimed to reporters that he does not follow the stock market after the Dow hit a one-month low following the president\u2019s comments that he does not have a \u201cdeadline\u201d for reaching a trade deal with China. In reality, Trump has repeatedly boasted about the state of the stock market and has demanded credit for its rallies while shaking off responsibility for its trade-related tumbles. Sitting alongside Justin Trudeau, Trump said Canada must increase its financial contribution to Nato, suggesting the country should be put on a \u201cpayment plan\u201d to up its defense spending for the alliance. The Canadian prime minister pushed back by pointing out his country has increased its Nato spending by 70% in recent years and insisted Canada is a key partner in the alliance. Trump told reporters that he thought the initial question about supporting the protesters in Iran pertained to financial support, hence his surpising answer that he did not back the demonstrators. \u201cWe do support them totally and have supported them from the beginning,\u201d Trump said at the start of his news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in London. Trump\u2019s clean-up of his earlier comments aligns the president with secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has said the US backs the protesters and has tried to keep online communications open in Iran depsite the government\u2019s efforts to shut down the internet. Trump has just sent a tweet saying he supports the protesters in Iran, less than an hour after the US president said during a news conference with Emmanuel Macron that he did not back the demonstrators. During his news conference with the French president, Trump was asked whether he supported the protesters, as his secretary of state has expressed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on that, but the answer\u2019s no. But I don\u2019t want to comment on that,\u201d Trump replied. If the federal appeals court\u2019s ruling stands, House Democrats could have unprecedented insight into Trump\u2019s business dealings. However, the president\u2019s legal team is likely not done trying to fight the order. A federal appeals court has ruled that Deutsche Bank and Capitol One must comply with a congressional subpoena for Trump\u2019s financial records, dealing another legal blow to the president. However, the scope of the banks\u2019 disclosures remains unclear, and Trump\u2019s legal team could still appeal the case to the Supreme Court. Trump\u2019s press conference with Emmanuel Macron has just wrapped up, during which the French president repeatedly challenged the US leader on a number of foreign-policy issues. But Trump stuck by his controversial stances -- arguing, for example, that there was a benefit to communicating with Russia because the idea is popular at his campaign rallies. Sitting next to Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron repeatedly criticized the US leader for his stances on a number of foreign-policy issues, particularly his welcoming of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan after the Turkish president launched a violent military oepration in Syria. Trump shocked reporters in London when he responded to a question about whether he supports the protesters in Iran, who have been violently repressed by their country\u2019s government. The US president initially said he did not want to comment on the situation in Iran but then added offhandedly that he did not support the protesters. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said yesterday that the US was supporting the protesters by trying to keep online communications open, despite the Iranian government\u2019s efforts to shut down the internet. Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are speaking to reporters in London as they meet during the Nato summit, and the two world leaders have repeatedly clashed on everything from Russia to the return of Islamic State fighters who have European citizenship. Trump was insisting European countries need to take back control of those fighters and he joked to Macron, \u201cWould you like some nice ISIS fighters? I could give them to you.\u201d Macron responded by noting only a small percentage of ISIS fighters originally come from Europe. Trump replied, \u201cThis is why he\u2019s a great politician because that was one of the greatest non-answers I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Tom Steyer\u2019s campaign said the billionaire activist has qualified for the December Democratic debate, making him the seventh presidential candidate to meet both the polling and donor requirements to participate. \u201cAfter terrific performances in the last two debates and a tremendous amount of earned media over the last month, Tom continues his surge in the early state polls which has led to an increased amount of donors over the last few weeks,\u201d his campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement. Steyer will join Joe Biden, Elizbaeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar on the debate stage. Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang only needs one more qualifying poll to make the cut, and he has nine days to get it. However, it\u2019s looking increasingly likely that about half of the Democratic presidential field will fail to qualify for the next debate -- which could pressure more candidates to withdraw from the race, as Montana governor Steve Bullock and former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak both did in recent days. Good morning, live blog readers! Donald Trump is at the Nato summit in London striking fear into stockbrokers\u2019 hearts and insulting world leaders (as we\u2019ve come to expect), but the impeachment inquiry is continuing unabated as the president is abroad. The House intelligence committee is expected to publicy release its report on the impeachment inquiry today. The report will convey Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump abused the power of the presidency by trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Republicans on the committee insist the inquiry is just an outgrowth of Democrats\u2019 political animus toward Trump, who did nothing wrong in his communications with Ukraine. This viewpoint was articulated in a report released yesterday by the Republican minority of the intelligence committee. \u201cThe fundamental disagreement apparent in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is a difference of world views and a discomfort with President Trump\u2019s policy decisions,\u201d that report said. The president\u2019s allies are pushing back against the investigations of his administration in other ways as well. The Washington Post reported last night that attorney general William Barr has told associates he does not agree with the justice department inspector general\u2019s finding that the FBI was justified to launch the Russia investigation. However, as the House gets closer and closer to an impeachment vote, Trump\u2019s allies may soon run out of options for protecting the president. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in London before a Nato leaders reception at Buckingham Palace. David Hale, the undersecretary of state who testified during the public impeachment hearings, will appear before the Senate foreign relations committee at 10 a.m. ET. Joe Biden will continue his bus tour in Iowa. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned.",

In response, the company deferred to tradition: \u201cOur genuine intention was to remain true to the original production and its treasured, historical story,\u201d it said in a statement at the time, sent to the Guardian on request. \u201cWe are listening and will be reviewing the feedback with high importance. Our upmost priority is making sure our audiences are comfortable with the material we\u2019re performing.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Morning mail\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now on its last leg, the show reached Sydney last week. How the company would handle the tea dance was the million-dollar question \u2013 at least for ballet tragics. When the curtain went up over the second act, you could almost hear the gasp from the traditionalists in the audience. For the modernisers, a sigh of relief.</p> <p>The tea dance was performed by Beijing Dance Academy-trained Lucien Xu and 2019 Telstra Ballet Dancer award nominee Yichuan Wang. (The cast rotates, and white dancers will continue to appear in these roles through the rest of the Sydney run.)</p> <p>The performers remained in the yellow dragon-emblazoned shirts they had worn in Melbourne and Adelaide. But the moustaches and wigs were replaced with a subtler head cap, and the jaunty choreography toned down.</p> <p>For the modern ballet, the minute-long tea dance presents a dilemma: how to navigate between the demands of a traditional medium, while working to eradicate damaging racial portrayals in the arts. <a href=\"https://australianballet.com.au/corporate/five-year-strategic-plan\">In The Australian Ballet\u2019s latest strategic plan</a>, it outlined innovation, respect and an embrace of diversity as priorities. But the Sydney amendments \u2013 while welcome \u2013 look reactive, rather than proactive. A less inflammatory decision would have been to remove the dance completely while waiting on permission to adapt it.</p> <p>And there are still more questions to be answered. Is it better to cast Chinese dancers for Chinese dances? Should producers be more historically accurate when signposting different cultures? And are diverse voices being heard when these decisions are made?</p> <p>While these discussions loom over ballet as a genre, there is no better place to start answering them than with The Nutcracker \u2014 the world\u2019s most frequently performed classical ballet. And if the Sydney show was anything to go by, audiences are ready for ballet companies to make difficult changes to reflect the times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Australian Ballet\u2019s production of The Nutcracker runs at <a href=\"https://australianballet.com.au/the-ballets/the-nutcracker\">the Sydney Opera House until 18 December</a><br><br></em></p>",

And now in the mix is The Australian Ballet, which \u2013 in the middle of its 2019 Nutcracker tour \u2013 found itself in a strange position. After presenting the same version of Sir Peter Wright\u2019s The Nutcracker for over a decade, this year the company decided to respond to the cultural moment \u2013 and hoped to modify the standard steps before the September premiere at the Arts Centre Melbourne. But they did not get permission from the copyright holder, Birmingham Royal Ballet, in time. \u201cI had a meeting with Sir Peter in January 2019 and we discussed the [choreography] changes,\u201d artistic director David McAllister told the Guardian. \u201cUnfortunately we were unable to get the updated version [for] the Melbourne and Adelaide seasons.\u201d And so, for the first two legs of the show\u2019s run \u2013 September in Melbourne, and October in Adelaide \u2013 the rotating cast of mostly white tea-dancers donned tendrilled Fu Manchu moustaches and oriental wigs, hopping around stage with dippy facial expressions and those notorious pointed fingers. The scene was criticised in reviews, and The Australian Ballet has confirmed to the Guardian that it received audience complaints. In response, the company deferred to tradition: \u201cOur genuine intention was to remain true to the original production and its treasured, historical story,\u201d it said in a statement at the time, sent to the Guardian on request. \u201cWe are listening and will be reviewing the feedback with high importance. Our upmost priority is making sure our audiences are comfortable with the material we\u2019re performing.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Now on its last leg, the show reached Sydney last week. How the company would handle the tea dance was the million-dollar question \u2013 at least for ballet tragics. When the curtain went up over the second act, you could almost hear the gasp from the traditionalists in the audience. For the modernisers, a sigh of relief. The tea dance was performed by Beijing Dance Academy-trained Lucien Xu and 2019 Telstra Ballet Dancer award nominee Yichuan Wang. (The cast rotates, and white dancers will continue to appear in these roles through the rest of the Sydney run.) The performers remained in the yellow dragon-emblazoned shirts they had worn in Melbourne and Adelaide. But the moustaches and wigs were replaced with a subtler head cap, and the jaunty choreography toned down. For the modern ballet, the minute-long tea dance presents a dilemma: how to navigate between the demands of a traditional medium, while working to eradicate damaging racial portrayals in the arts. In The Australian Ballet\u2019s latest strategic plan, it outlined innovation, respect and an embrace of diversity as priorities. But the Sydney amendments \u2013 while welcome \u2013 look reactive, rather than proactive. A less inflammatory decision would have been to remove the dance completely while waiting on permission to adapt it. And there are still more questions to be answered. Is it better to cast Chinese dancers for Chinese dances? Should producers be more historically accurate when signposting different cultures? And are diverse voices being heard when these decisions are made? While these discussions loom over ballet as a genre, there is no better place to start answering them than with The Nutcracker \u2014 the world\u2019s most frequently performed classical ballet. And if the Sydney show was anything to go by, audiences are ready for ballet companies to make difficult changes to reflect the times. \u2022 The Australian Ballet\u2019s production of The Nutcracker runs at the Sydney Opera House until 18 December",

The rise in emissions was much smaller than in the last two years, but the continued increase means the world is still far from being on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, which would require emissions to peak then fall rapidly to reach net-zero by mid-century. Emissions for this year will be 4% higher than those in 2015, when the Paris agreement was signed. Governments are meeting this week and next in Madrid to hammer out some of the final details for implementing the Paris deal and start work on new commitments to cut emissions by 2030. But the new report shows the increasing difficulty of that task. Experts said it was much too early to take the slight slowdown in emissions growth this year as a sign the world was turning a corner in the climate emergency. Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer in climate change at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, said: \u201cCO2 emissions wiggle from year to year, but it is the long-term trend that is important.

Last week, a separate report found emissions would have to fall by 7.6% a year for the next 10 years to stay within the limits advised by scientists. Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a research professor at the University of East Anglia who contributed to the Global Carbon Budget analysis, called for stronger policies from governments to phase out fossil fuels. \u201cCurrent climate and energy policies are too weak to reverse trends in global emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cPolicies have been successful to varying degrees in deploying low-carbon technologies, such as solar and wind power and electric vehicles.

Glen Peters, research director at the Cicero Centre for International Climate Change Research and lead author of the Global Carbon Budget papers, which are published in the journals Nature Climate Change, Environmental Research Letters, and Earth System Science Data, said: \u201cThe weak growth in carbon dioxide emissions in 2019 was due to an unexpected decline in global coal use, but this drop was insufficient to overcome the robust growth in natural gas and oil consumption.\u201d While coal use has declined in the US and Europe, new coal-fired power stations are still being planned in China, India and other countries; developed countries such as Japan are funding their construction overseas. Carbon from the burning of fossil fuels, from industrial processes and from cement manufacture increased by 0.6% in 2019, according to the provisional figures for the year.

The total number of BAME board members, both executive and non-executive, decreased to 7.4%, down from nearly 9% in 2018, while the number of chairs, chief executives and finance directors remained at 3.3%, the recruitment consultancy Green Park found. The firm, which is chaired by the former Equalities Commission head Trevor Phillips, said it was disappointed by the results, which showed the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 companies have been failing to follow their successful US counterparts \u201cby properly resourcing change\u201d. Forty-seven companies still have no BAME people at board and executive director level \u2013 just 14 fewer than in 2014. The study found the pipeline for BAME executives was also squeezed after a year of zero growth in the number below board level, \u201craising significant concerns about the prospects for any future improvement at board and executive committee level\u201d, the report said. It called on firms to appoint a chief diversity officer, as half of US companies have done, or face \u201ccommercial risk, regulatory attention and losing key talent to global competitors\u201d. The report follows a similar exercise by the government to chart the progress of BAME executives that followed the Parker review in 2017. A follow-up review last year found the number of FTSE 100 company directors from BAME backgrounds declined to just 84 out of 1,048 director positions in the 100 biggest companies, down from 85 the year before.
