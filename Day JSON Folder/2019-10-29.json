We know that the release of this report will be harrowing for the bereaved, survivors and relatives, as well as firefighters involved on that night, and we encourage anyone who needs it to reach out to dedicated welfare services.\u201d",

The recommendation is one of a series of urgent reforms needed to improve government integrity, strengthen accountability bodies and address flaws in the whistleblowing regime, according to a paper released by the Centre for Public Integrity on Tuesday. The paper adds to a growing push for major reforms to whistleblowing laws in Australia, which have repeatedly failed to prevent reprisals against those who speak out. A rare coalition of media groups have united through the the Right to Know campaign to call for reform and one of Australia\u2019s leading integrity experts, Griffith University\u2019s AJ Brown, on Saturday delivered a blueprint for the creation of a genuine national whistleblower protection regime. The Centre for Public Integrity on Tuesday called for laws to require mandatory reporting of public sector misconduct to a federal anti-corruption commission. The requirement must be accompanied by a strong integrity commission and consequences for failing to report, it said. The centre\u2019s chairman Anthony Whealy, a former NSW supreme court judge, said the government\u2019s current proposal allows for referrals only from departmental or agency heads. That, he said, creates obvious conflicts if misconduct is occurring at the higher ranks of the agency. Whealy said complaints from lower-ranking public servants were often not acted upon by their superiors. \u201cWhat we know normally is the complaint gets shelved, the whistleblower gets ostracised, the whistleblower gets sacked, and the complaint goes nowhere,\u201d Whealy said. The mandatory reporting requirement would likely lead to large volumes of complaints to a federal integrity body. But Whealy said integrity commissions were well-placed to sift through the complaints and determine which were genuine. \u201cIt\u2019s the one that matters that they\u2019ve got to be able to receive,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think we should call them whistleblowers to be honest, we should call them public servants who are simply doing their duty.\u201d The call comes days after Brown delivered a stark warning about the state of Australia\u2019s whistleblowing laws during his Henry Parkes oration. Brown said the recent raids on the ABC and News Corp had shocked the world and represented regressive steps in Australia\u2019s openness and transparency. \u201cThese events confirmed, more dramatically than before, that alongside all our trends towards more open and accountable government, we have also experienced powerful counter-trends that undermine those advances, increasingly threatening both the health of our democracy and its long-held reputation,\u201d he said. Brown outlined a seven-point plan for restoring public confidence in federal whistleblower protections, which included a \u201ccomprehensive overhaul or replacement\u201d of public sector whistleblowing legislation. He also advocated for reforms to make it simpler for whistleblowers to speak out about misconduct outside of official channels, an option that, under the current system, has led to the prosecution of numerous whistleblowers, including Witness K and Bernard Collaery. Brown also called for better support to whistleblowers, including through the establishment of a whistleblower authority, a greater role for the commonwealth ombudsman, and consideration of a rewards scheme for those who speak out. The government should also make it easier to blow the whistle on intelligence and national security matters if it meets a simplified public interest test and and poses \u201cno actual, real, unacceptable risk of harm to national security, defence or law enforcement interests\u201d. Brown said he continued to have sympathy for threats against journalists and press freedom. \u201cBut importantly, in Australia at least, the threat of criminal prosecutions against journalists is still mainly just that: a cross-fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary targets \u2013 intended and sometimes unintended \u2013 are actually the employees, officials and everyday citizens who might, and do, speak up with concerns about wrongdoing in their organisations.\u201d Former counsel assisting at the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption, Geoffrey Watson, said accountability institutions across the country \u2013 including the audit office, state anti-corruption commissions, journalists and the public service \u2013 were under attack in Australia. \u201cThe prosecution of journalists, the cutting of Icac\u2019s powers, and the personal attacks faced by senior integrity officials are all part of a bigger picture of our accountability institutions being undermined,\u201d Watson said.",

Here are the main points he made.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Robbins suggested he was slow to realise how difficult it would be finding a solution to the post-Brexit border issue for goods in Ireland. </strong>He told the committee:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we had all, to some extent, professionally grown up in a world where the movement of goods was a really very boring and obvious thing. </p> \n   <p>And the movement of people was interesting and politically controversial. And we therefore thought that the central issue in settling our post-Brexit relationship with Ireland was going to be the maintenance of the common travel area, and the mutual sustainment of rights for Irish people and British people in one another\u2019s territories, and the sort of core of the identity problem that the Good Friday agreement had attempted to solve. </p> \n   <p>I think I probably, to only criticise myself, was slower. I had weeks rather than months to come to the realisation that actually the people-side of this, while not being complacent about any of it, was, as a bureaucrat, an easier problem to see one\u2019s way through than the movement of physical goods.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed suggestions that the UK would be better prepared for Brexit if civil servants had planned for a leave vote before the 2016 referendum.</strong> He told MPs:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know debate continues to rage, rightly and understandably, about whether it was the right political decision not to do contingency planning. </p> \n   <p>I do think, as I say, very personal view, you can probably overdo the extent to which a vast Whitehall process of churning out ring-binders full of papers pre-June 2016 would somehow have meant that the British state was far, far better prepared afterwards.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that, if the civil service had tried to flag up post-Brexit problems with the Irish border before the referendum, no one would have taken any notice. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think if my Cabinet Office colleagues, who were in post at the time or more generally across Whitehall - I was in the Home Office at the time - if we\u2019d been asked to produce a paper on what does the border look like after a no vote, a leave vote, I think we would have ended up in a position whereby we would have produced what I hope would have been a good quality piece of work, but I\u2019m not sure anyone would have read it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> \n  <p>My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92988116c1afc92eecee418acf6f9538755eb920\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92988116c1afc92eecee418acf6f9538755eb920/0_81_2509_1505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olly Robbins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olly Robbins.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db87e698f08cb84c60a0e73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T18:01:29.062Z\">6.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From LBC\u2019s <strong>Theo Usherwood</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/theousherwood/status/1189188614632009729\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Prof John Curtice\u2019s election prediction: Tories beware. <br><br>Election will return more than a 100 MPs not from Labour or Conservatives. <br><br>And whilst Corbyn can do a deal with another party to stop Brexit, Johnson cannot to do a deal to deliver Brexit. <a href=\"https://t.co/grwCGSoLSs\">https://t.co/grwCGSoLSs</a></p>\u2014 Theo Usherwood (@theousherwood) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theousherwood/status/1189188614632009729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db87ce88f08d669cdaaf19a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T17:59:51.012Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Oliver Dowden, </strong>the Cabinet Office minister, is responding to Cat Smith.</p> \n  <p>He says that the government needs time to pass a budget for the devolved administration in Northern Ireland before parliament can be prorogued.

The 2019 general election was only confirmed (effectively) about two hours ago, but Boris Johnson has already received his first election setback; in a surprise announcement, the Office for Budget Responsibility has announced that it plans to publish revised economic forecasts on 7 November.</p> \n  <p><strong>Robert Chote</strong>, the OBR chair, has revealed this <a href=\"https://obr.uk/download/letter-robert-chote-sir-tom-scholar-cancellation-6-november-budget/\">in an open letter to the Treasury (pdf).</a></p> \n  <p>Normally the OBR publishes revised economic forecasts twice a year, accompanying the budget and the spring/autumn statement (the timing of the budget determines which it is). Chote says the OBR started working on new forecasts when the Treasury announced a budget for 6 November. But that budget has been cancelled.</p> \n  <p>There were suspicions that one reason for the cancellation of the budget was that it would involve the government having to publish OBR figures showing that there was less scope for tax cuts and spending increases after the election than the Tories might like to admit. Chote does not address this point directly. But he says that, since the OBR last published a forecast in March, government borrowing has increased more than expected and there has been a \u201crapid growth\u201d in public spending.

In brief \u2013 the government seems open to a 10 or 11 December date, but is dead set against amendments extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds or EU nationals.</p> \n  <p>On the date, while the Lib Dem hope for a 9 December poll, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said this would require parliament to dissolve at the start of Friday this week, so as to allow the necessary 25 working days between dissolution and polling.</p> \n  <p>This would make it \u201cvery difficult\u201d for both the election bill and a separate bill on budgets for the suspended Northern Ireland assembly to pass through the Commons and Lords and receive royal assent in time, the spokesman said.</p> \n  <p>Also, 9 December is a Monday, meaning election preparations would take place of the preceding weekend, which would be logistically difficult and costly, he added.</p> \n  <p>However, it seems the government could compromise on 10 or 11 December.</p> \n  <p>In contrast, there seems no possibility of compromise on adding younger voters or EU nationals, with Johnson\u2019s spokesman saying that longstanding convention dictates that changes to the franchise only happen after extensive consultation. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The election law on the franchise should not be changed days before the calling of a general election. The Electoral Commission warns against changing electoral laws less than six months before an election.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Adding 16- and 17-year-olds would be \u201cadministratively impossible to deliver in the time available\u201d, he said, warning also that adding EU nationals would bring \u201cadministrative chaos\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The latter point seems less certain given that EU nationals can already vote in local elections, and so many are registered.</p> \n  <p>But the No 10 spokesman added: \u201cIt would also mean EU nationals in the UK enjoying wider voting rights than UK nationals in any other country other than Ireland.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T12:59:47.933Z\">at 12.59pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db831f28f08c428d893295e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T12:37:27.917Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These are from the Labour MP <strong>Barry Sheerman.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarrySheerman/status/1189144490059194368\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sheer madness to hold a General Election in December &amp; on Boris Johnson\u2019s agenda!</p>\u2014 Barry Sheerman (@BarrySheerman) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarrySheerman/status/1189144490059194368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarrySheerman/status/1189146672640811008\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I hear Labour frontbenchers &amp; whips resigning over decision to vote for December election.</p>\u2014 Barry Sheerman (@BarrySheerman) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarrySheerman/status/1189146672640811008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarrySheerman/status/1189156782775721984\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A clear majority of our Shadow cabinet were against a December election yesterday but Jeremy Corbyn has been persuaded to override them after interventions from Seamus Milne &amp; Karie Murphy!</p>\u2014 Barry Sheerman (@BarrySheerman) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarrySheerman/status/1189156782775721984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>I\u2019ve asked Labour if it can confirm or deny what Sheerman is saying about resignations, but have not had a reply yet.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db8304b8f08d669cdaaee38\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T12:32:42.862Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Heidi Allen to stand down, saying she has had enough of 'nastiness and intimidation' MPs face</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Heidi Allen,</strong> the former Conservative MP who defected to Change UK and then ended up a Liberal Democrat, has announced that she won\u2019t be standing again in her South Cambridgeshire constituency. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/heidiallen75/status/1189155214399623169\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Letter to my constituents explaining why, what ever the outcome tonight, I won't be standing again to be the MP for South Cambridgeshire. <a href=\"https://t.co/g8zxjZD5j4\">https://t.co/g8zxjZD5j4</a></p>\u2014 Heidi Allen MP (@heidiallen75) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/heidiallen75/status/1189155214399623169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 29, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://heidiallen.co.uk/heidi-allen-mp-letter-to-south-cambridgeshire-constituents/\">an open letter to her constituents,</a> she says she is \u201cexhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db82d828f08c428d8932923\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T12:17:16.749Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Financial Times is running its own poll tracker (a chart that incorporates the results of all published polls).

A bill can pass the Commons with a majority of one, and with the Liberal Democrats and the SNP in principle committed to an early election, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/28/boris-johnsons-election-vote-looms-as-eu-decides-on-brexit-delay-politics-live?page=with:block-5db72a798f08d669cdaae7a7#block-5db72a798f08d669cdaae7a7\">even Labour warming to the idea</a>, there is a strong possibility that it will pass, and that by tonight we will be able to plan for an election at some point in the week beginning Monday 9 December.</p> \n  <p>But it is not in the bag yet. The bill has still not been published, and the government and opposition parties are divided over the date of a December poll. Ministers want it on Thursday 12, whereas the Lib Dems and the SNP want it on Monday 9. </p> \n  <p>More importantly, most of the parties are deeply split over the wisdom of an early poll. Even the SNP parliamentary party, which is normally a model of unity and discipline and never normally divides over anything, has got one of its MPs going around saying <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/angus-macneil-on-december-9th-election-1-6344751\">the party\u2019s plan would be like \u201ca birthday present and a Christmas present [for Johnson[ rolled into one\u201d.</a></p> \n  <p>And the reason for this heightened uncertainty? Decisions about whether or not to back an early election are almost always driven by self-interest, but no one knows which party is likely to benefit most from an early poll. The psephologists have already been warning that predicting the election will be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, because <a href=\"https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/bes-resources/press-release-most-volatile-british-electorate-in-modern-times/#.Xbf4Dm_7RHc\">the electorate is more volatile than it has ever been in the post-war period.</a> To add to the complexity, no one can be certain how the electorate will respond to the Brexit delay, whether the campaign will be dominated by Brexit or by domestic issues, and how voters will respond to being asked to go to the polls a fortnight before Christmas. MPs and party leaders may have their own theories as to who would gain most from an early election, but there is no consensus and no rock-solid evidence; basically, it\u2019s all guesswork.</p> \n  <p>The parties are expected to whip the votes this afternoon but, with MPs voting on their own job prospects, we might get more rebellions than usual, which is another reason why the bill could fail. In the Conservative party Johnson is facing a backlash against his decision to go for an election, and this morning there are signs that it is growing. </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Tory MP Simon Hoare told the Commons last night that voters would not understand why Johnson was calling an election now.</strong> Speaking <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-10-28/debates/1CEA3FC9-5440-426F-A4B9-539BF243B608/BusinessOfTheHouse\">during the business statement announcing today\u2019s bill</a>, Hoare said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>May I ask the leader of the house what we are to say to constituents and others about the fact that we may be able to find time for a five to six-week general election campaign and then the rigmarole of forming a government and yet not for bringing back the withdrawal bill? </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Tory MP William Wragg said in the Commons last night that \u201cmany\u201d Conservative MPs supported the plan put forward by Frank Field <a href=\"https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/53410/timetable-for-the-european-union-withdrawal-agreement-bill\">in an early day motion</a>, saying that Johnson should instead set aside 14 days to pass the withdrawal agreement bill.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson is also being told in private by some of his MPs that he should press with the withdrawal agreement bill, and deliver Brexit, before holding an election. </strong>This is from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50215825\">an analysis</a> by the BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One MP told me that a group of them made it clear to the PM in person on Monday night that they were deeply unhappy at what one of them described as him \u201cbeing churlish, and taking his bat and ball home\u201d, when he achieved what was said to be impossible by getting a deal in the first place, only to give up when the timetable for it was rejected last week.</p> \n   <p>Mocking the prime minister\u2019s own slogan, the MP joked \u201cthat doesn\u2019t exactly look like trying to get Brexit done\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>And this morning Philip Hammond, the former Tory chancellor who now sits as an independent having had the whip removed, told the Today programme that he was appalled by Johnson\u2019s decision to go for an election before delivering Brexit. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If [Boris Johnson] has pressed on with a sensible timetable motion, say allowing the Commons five days to consider the bill, it would be out by now and into the House of Lords, and we would be well on our way to being able to leave the European Union, certainly by the end of November, perhaps earlier.</p> \n   <p>But because he insisted that it all had to be done by 31 October, something that we now know can\u2019t happen, it is the government itself that has been blocking Brexit. And the idea that now we would use our precious time to halt all of this process for five or six weeks, and go out and have a general election, frankly appals me. I think the government is trying to create a narrative that parliament is blocking Brexit and therefore we need an election. But that is simply untrue. Parliament signalled very clearly last week that it was prepared to press on with the Brexit bill, provided it had a reasonable timetable to do so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.30am:</em> Boris Johnson chairs cabinet.</p> \n  <p><em>12pm:</em> Downing Street lobby briefing.</p> \n  <p><em>After 12.30pm: </em>MPs begin debating the early parliamentary general election bill.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for today \u2013 thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s main events: The UK was gearing up for a 12 December general election after Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to go to the country received the backing of the Commons. MPs voted through the prime minister\u2019s proposal for a pre-Christmas ballot and rejected an opposition move to hold it three days earlier. Proposed amendments that would have enfranchised 16 and 17-year-olds, as well as EU nationals, were not taken forward. No 10 had said it would pull the bill altogether if the amendments were passed. The Tories restored the whip to 10 of the 21 MPs from whom it was withdrawn last month. The party stressed that the fact the other had not had the whip restored did not mean they would not. The UK might not get a further delay to Brexit if it cannot be sorted by 31 January 2020, Donald Tusk warned. The outgoing president of the European council again urged the UK not to waste the time it had been given. Two prominent MPs announced they were standing down. Heidi Allen, of the Lib Dems, cited the \u201cnastiness and intimidation\u201d she has endured, while the former Labour leadership contender, Owen Smith, referred to both \u201cpolitical and personal reasons\u201d. Theresa May\u2019s former chief Brexit adviser claimed more civil service planning for a leave vote in 2016 would probably not have helped much. Sir Olly Robbins was giving evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee. If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleague Rowena Mason has the full story: A Scottish majority for the SNP after the general election will show an \u201cunequivocal and irresistible demand\u201d for a second independence referendum, the party\u2019s leader has claimed. Nicola Sturgeon is expected to vow to \u201ctake the fight to the Tories\u201d to keep Scotland in the EU and decide whether to remain part of the UK when she joins the party\u2019s candidate for Stirling on the campaign trail on Wednesday. She said: The SNP is ready for an election. We stand ready to take the fight to the Tories, to bring down this undemocratic government, and give Scotland the chance to escape from Brexit and decide our own future. Scotland has been ignored and treated with contempt by Westminster, and this election is an opportunity to bring that to an end. A win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland\u2019s right to choose our own future. Ian Murray, one of seven Labour MPs north of the border, joked that it looks as though it would have to be a \u201cMurray Christmas\u201d after fighting off a deselection attempt spearheaded by Unite the union last week. Jackson Carlaw MSP, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, has claimed voting for his party will keep Scotland in the UK. The choice for voters is this: Vote ScotTories to end the division and keep Scotland in the UK. A vote for anyone else risks Nicola Sturgeon winning and pushing ever harder for her unwanted and damaging independence referendum. We are ready and we are determined. The Scottish Greens have said they will contest several seats, warning it will be \u201cthe most important one we\u2019ve ever faced\u201d. The party\u2019s co-leader, Lorna Slater, has said: We have just 10 years left to prevent climate breakdown but Westminster has been taken over by an authoritarian Tory government obsessed with forcing a disastrous Brexit on the country and doubling down on their climate-wrecking policies. Instead of tackling the greatest risk to human life in history, the main parties at Westminster lurch from one crisis of their own making to another, which is why it is more important than ever that we have Green voices in there who are committed to a Scottish Green new deal, stopping Brexit and building a new progressive future for Scotland. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, appeared to show excitement for the election: The home secretary\u2019s chief of staff was escorted out of a bar in parliamentby armed police earlier \u2013 just as MPs were voting on an election that Boris Johnson wants to make about law and order. Two people who witnessed the incident say James Starkie was ordered out of Strangers bar after swearing loudly in the vicinity of a Tory MP, Col Bob Stewart, being refused service and appearing to punch a door. As police escorted him out of the bar, which is frequented by MPs, witnesses said he apologised for his behaviour. Starkie is a familiar face around Westminster as a former Vote Leave campaigner who went on to work for Michael Gove, before taking up his position as a senior adviser to Priti Patel. A House of Commons spokesperson said: We can confirm there was an incident with an individual in Strangers bar. The individual was asked to leave, and was escorted from the estate by parliamentary security Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, has welcomed a general election being held on 12 December: It is right that the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box. The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain. We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland. At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before. Unionists need their strongest team returned to so that Northern Ireland\u2019s interests are protected in the next parliament. That team is the DUP. Owen Smith, who challenged Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership in 2016, will not seek reelection, he has announced: Dave Ward, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), has tweeted: Earlier this month, CWU members working for Royal Mail backed strikes by 97% in a huge turnout of almost 76%, raising the threat of industrial action in the run-up to Christmas. The former cabinet minister, John Whittingdale, has said the prime minister told the meeting that, while it would be a \u201ctough election\u201d, the Tories have \u201ceverything to play for\u201d. Whittingdale added: He said it wasn\u2019t because we were ahead in the polls or the because of the horror of Corbyn but because we had no alternative; that parliament is deadlocked and the only way to solve that is to have a general election. (He said) we would be taking the deal which he negotiated \u2013 and which defied all expectation in that it got all that we wanted \u2013 and we will be campaigning to ratify that deal and then get on with tackling the big agenda. The senior Tory MP, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the prime minister was \u201cpretty upbeat\u201d about the Conservatives\u2019 chances at an election. Alistair Burt welcomed being one of the 10 Tory rebels readmitted to the parliamentary party. After leaving the 1922 Committee, he told reporters: Back in the fold. It\u2019s a big family and it\u2019s very nice to have them back and I\u2019m very appreciative. [Boris Johnson] is a born campaigner, no doubt about that. Boris Johnson has told reporters it\u2019s time for the country to \u201ccome together to get Brexit done\u201d as he left the Conservative backbench MPs\u2019 meeting. Here\u2019s a little more detail from HuffPost UK: It is worth noting that Rees-Mogg has again declined to explicitly address whether or not the election of a new Commons speaker would go ahead before parliament is dissolved next Wednesday. Asked about the matter for a second time in the Commons, he said he had nothing to add to his previous answer, which we summarised just a few moments ago. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said: This election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country and take on the vested interests holding people back. The choice at this election could not be clearer: A Labour government will be on your side; while Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives, who think they\u2019re born to rule, will only look after the privileged few. We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen. This is our chance to build a country for the many not the few and fit for the next generation. Responding to the vote in parliament for a general election, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, has said: This general election will decide the future of our country for generations. It is our best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit. The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and will be standing on a manifesto to stop Brexit by revoking article 50. This country deserves better than Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and I am excited to take our positive, pro-European, liberal vision to the country as the Liberal Democrat candidate for prime minister. Boris Johnson received a rapturous reception as he arrived at a meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee after his bid for an early general election cleared the Commons. Conservative MPs cheered and banged the table as he arrived for the meeting in parliament. Asked whether the Commons will be electing a new speaker before it dissolves, Rees-Mogg says the dissolution date is Wednesday, so the Commons may be sitting on Monday and Tuesday. The leader of the Commons, Jacob-Rees-Mogg, says he\u2019ll set out tomorrow how the government intends to proceed for the rest of the week. Also tomorrow, he says, the prime minister will address the Commons on the Grenfell inquiry\u2019s report and MPs will discuss the Northern Ireland budget bill. My colleague, Rowena Mason, has just published this on the vote for a general election on 12 December: Boris Johnson\u2019s wish for a general election on 12 December looks set to be granted after MPs voted in favour of it by 438 to 20; a majority of 418. The prime minister had already defeated an attempt to change the date to 9 December (see: 8.01pm) \u2013 the only serious opposition remaining to his proposal \u2013 and the bill that seeks to implement a 12 December general election will now pass to the Lords, who are expected to wave it through. MPs will soon vote on whether or not to hold the early general election, with the date \u2013 assuming they back it \u2013 having now been set as 12 December. The Independent Group for Change MP, Chris Leslie, tried to move an unexpected amendment but was denied by the deputy speaker, Eleanor Laing. She then makes way for the Speaker, John Bercow, who calls for MPs to vote on a third and final reading. The Commons has rejected Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s proposal to hold an early general on 9 December, rather than the government\u2019s plan to do so three days later. MPs voted against amendment 2 by 315 votes to 295; a majority of 20. Just before MPs went off to vote, the Tory backbench MP Steve Baker warned that, if the Lords amended the early parliamentary general election bill, they would be \u201cplaying with their own futures\u201d. Baker, the chairman of the hard Brexit-supporting European Research Group, told the Commons: On a serious note, this bill of course has to go through [the Lords] and I think if the other place were to put in amendments to this simple and straightforward bill, which sought to produce a particular outcome, I think we would have to say they have no right whatever to do that. That it would be quite unconstitutional and I think they would be playing fire and indeed they would be playing with their own futures in that House were they to seek to amend this bill to produce a particular outcome. MPs are now voting on amendment 2, which would change the date of the election from Thursday 12 December to Monday 9 December. Here\u2019s a little more on Labour\u2019s preparations for the likely December election: It\u2019s understood that trigger ballots are to be halted and that Labour MPs will now be automatically reselected \u2013 subject to NEC approval and assuming they haven\u2019t decided to retire. Any selection meetings in key marginals that were scheduled for this week will still go ahead. In those constituencies where no such meeting was planned, the selection will now be handled by panels staffed by NEC members and regional and constituency party representatives. A Labour spokesman said: After the 2017 snap general election, we immediately began democratic selections to ensure Labour members would be able to choose their candidates. Members have selected candidates in almost 200 seats. We\u2019re more prepared than we\u2019ve ever been at this stage in the parliamentary cycle, ready to launch the most ambitious, radical campaign for real change that this country has ever seen. Here\u2019s a little more on the news that the Tory party has welcomed back 10 rebel MPs. The prime minister was said to have told them he always wanted to find a way for them to rejoin the party and the 10 MPs accepted his offer to be readmitted. A party spokesman said: They have had the whip offered back to them, they have accepted the whip: they are Conservative Members of Parliament with the Tory whip. He said the decision was not a comment on those who have not had the whip restored. The former Tory chancellors, Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke, along with former justice secretary, David Gauke, are among those not to have been welcomed back. Their number also includes Sir Oliver Letwin, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve, as well as Rory Stewart, Guto Bebb, Anne Milton and Antoinette Sandbach. Each of them remains an independent MP, while Sam Gyimah joined the Lib Dems. The Tory MP Andrew Percy has called for a \u201cmore civil campaign\u201d during the next general election. The Brigg and Goole MP said: The 2017 election was an appalling campaign for many of us to go through and the abuse and threats and damage to property, damage to constituents\u2019 property perpetrated, in some cases, by people in the name of the leader of the opposition. So I hope the campaign next time in December is a more civil campaign on all sides, because this is not a matter that one side owns particularly. There is a report around that the government has agreed to drop 12 December as the date and go for 9 December: But the Tory backbencher, Steve Baker, has just told MPs: I have just popped out to ask ... an authoritative source whether we\u2019ve given way on the date and I understand the government\u2019s not given way on the date. But who knows what discussions are going on behind the scenes? We\u2019re now getting some reaction to the news that the Tories have restored the whip to those 10 rebel MPs. The prime minister\u2019s brother Jo Johnson, who is not seeking reelection, has welcomed it: As have Damian Green, who was de facto deputy prime minister under Theresa May, and the former education secretary, Nicky Morgan: The backbench MP, Ben Howlett, is somewhat less appeased: As is now being pointed out by some correspondents in Westminster, it\u2019s not entirely clear at this point why the whip has been restored to some of the 21 MPs and not others: It\u2019s now been confirmed that the Conservative party has agreed to welcome back into the fold 10 of the 21 MPs from whom the whip was withdrawn last month. The rebel MPs were expelled after defying Boris Johnson\u2019s orders to oppose efforts to wrest control of the parliamentary agenda from No 10. The prime minister had warned them he considered the matter equivalent to a confidence vote. The party has confirmed that the 10 MPs are: Alistair Burt Caroline Nokes Greg Clark Sir Nicholas Soames Ed Vaizey Margot James Richard Benyon Stephen Hammond Steve Brine Richard Harrington My colleague, Rajeev Syal, has this interesting line from a Labour source on trigger ballots: And there are now multiple reports in Westminster that Boris Johnson is offering to return the whip to some of the 21 MPs from whom it was withdrawn: Sir Olly Robbins, who was Theresa May\u2019s chief Brexit adviser when she was PM, has been giving evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee this afternoon. Here are the main points he made. Robbins suggested he was slow to realise how difficult it would be finding a solution to the post-Brexit border issue for goods in Ireland. He told the committee: I think we had all, to some extent, professionally grown up in a world where the movement of goods was a really very boring and obvious thing. And the movement of people was interesting and politically controversial. And we therefore thought that the central issue in settling our post-Brexit relationship with Ireland was going to be the maintenance of the common travel area, and the mutual sustainment of rights for Irish people and British people in one another\u2019s territories, and the sort of core of the identity problem that the Good Friday agreement had attempted to solve. I think I probably, to only criticise myself, was slower. I had weeks rather than months to come to the realisation that actually the people-side of this, while not being complacent about any of it, was, as a bureaucrat, an easier problem to see one\u2019s way through than the movement of physical goods. He dismissed suggestions that the UK would be better prepared for Brexit if civil servants had planned for a leave vote before the 2016 referendum. He told MPs: I know debate continues to rage, rightly and understandably, about whether it was the right political decision not to do contingency planning. I do think, as I say, very personal view, you can probably overdo the extent to which a vast Whitehall process of churning out ring-binders full of papers pre-June 2016 would somehow have meant that the British state was far, far better prepared afterwards. He suggested that, if the civil service had tried to flag up post-Brexit problems with the Irish border before the referendum, no one would have taken any notice. He said: I think if my Cabinet Office colleagues, who were in post at the time or more generally across Whitehall - I was in the Home Office at the time - if we\u2019d been asked to produce a paper on what does the border look like after a no vote, a leave vote, I think we would have ended up in a position whereby we would have produced what I hope would have been a good quality piece of work, but I\u2019m not sure anyone would have read it. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. From LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood Oliver Dowden, the Cabinet Office minister, is responding to Cat Smith. He says that the government needs time to pass a budget for the devolved administration in Northern Ireland before parliament can be prorogued. If that legislation does not get passed, public sector workers would end up not being paid, he says. And he says he does not accept the argument about students not being able to vote if the poll is on 12 December. He says most of the big universities will not broken up for the Christmas holidays by then. And he says students always have the option of voting by post. Cat Smith, the shadow deputy leader of the Commons, opens the debate, moving amendment 2, the one that would change the date of the election from Thursday 12 December to Monday 9 December. She says Labour wants as many people as possible to participate in the election. Labour fears that students would be less likely to vote on 12 December, because some of them would have gone home at the end of term. MPs have now moved on to the bill\u2019s committee stage. Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker who is chairing this stage of the proceedings, has just read out the amendments selected. They are the same as those on the provisional list issued earlier. (See 5.19pm.) MPs have given the bill its second reading by acclamation. John Bercow, the Speaker, asked MPs to shout aye and no as he called the division. This is how divisions normally start. But only a few MPs shouted \u201cno\u201d, they were clearly outnumbered by the ayes, and so the bill got its second reading on the nod. The Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden is now winding up for the government. He says an election is necessary because parliament has stopped the government implementing Brexit. It voted for the Benn act, which forced the government to request a Brexit delay. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Amendment 2, which is set to be put to a vote (see 5.19pm), is a Jeremy Corbyn amendment that would change the date of the election to Monday 9 December, from Thursday 12 December. It is also been signed by the Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. The government is opposed to this, because it would mean parliament proroguing on Thursday, making it hard for the government to pass legislation needed to approve a budget for Northern Ireland, but it has not said that the passing of this amendment would lead to the bill having to be shelved. The amendments on extending the franchise to give EU nationals and 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote in the general election have not been selected, according to Tony Grew (aka @PARLYapp). This means the prospect of the government facing a defeat on these issues, and then deciding to pull the bill, has probably been removed. Phillips says the current electoral laws are not fit for purpose. She says at the last election someone was able to stand against her whose main claim to fame was that he had threatened to rape her. A one-line bill will not sort out these problems, she says. She says she will happily go back to her constituency for the election, so she can spend six weeks sleeping in her own bed and seeing her children. But she thinks, when it comes to addressing the problems facing democracy, this bill will be \u201cuseless\u201d, she says. The Labour MP Jess Phillips is speaking in the debate now. She says the problem facing parliament is that the government is behaving as if it has got a majority when it hasn\u2019t. The idea of introducing a bill that might attract majority support in the Commons was never considered, she says. She says MPs are in a \u201ctwilight zone\u201d where the government seems to think it only has to write down a proposal and it will pass. That is not the way parliament works, she says. She says she represents a leave seat. But she is not worried about that, even though she voted remain. She says her majority went up at the last parliament. Phillips asks what will happen if there is another hung parliament. The election will be a Rorschach test, she says. MPs will look at the result and draw whatever conclusion from it they want. She says MPs should be honest about the fact that they will interpret the election results to suit their own agendas. The Brexit extension until 31 January has now been officially confirmed, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. Donald Tusk, the outgoing president of the European council, has sent the UK a farewell tweet. He says this extension could be the UK\u2019s last. (Whether that is true or not is another matter. In practice, the EU27 would be reluctant to push the UK out of the EU against its will. If Labour won the election, it would request another extension to allow time for a renegotiation and a referendum.) Tusk also urged the UK not to waste the time granted by an extension when the last one was announced in April. It is hard to argue that his advice was taken to heart, because it was another six months before a new UK government agreed an alternative Brexit plan with the EU. These are from ITV\u2019s Robert Peston. Anne Main, a Conservative Brexiter, is currently speaking in the debate at the moment. She has been going on for a while, arguing that the public want to have the Brexit situation resolved. You will have noticed that I haven\u2019t been giving the speeches minute-by-minute. But you are not missing anything. The whole debate for far has been rambling and rather dull. From ITV\u2019s Joe Pike If anyone had any doubt about this, Downing Street has confirmed it will withdraw the general election bill if MPs attach amendments to extend votes to either 16- and 17-year olds, or EU nationals. Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman had already said such a move would bring \u201cadministrative chaos\u201d, and go against the convention that changes to the franchise are done over time and via consultation, but went no further. However, a No 10 source confirmed such amendments would be fatal to the bill: You cannot honestly argue that you are supporting an election on 12 December and vote for a change in the franchise. It\u2019s quite clear a vote to change the franchise would create a six-month delay. Sam Gyimah, the former Conservative minister who defected to the Liberal Democrats, has used an interview in the Evening Standard to say he will stand for his new party as a candidate in Kensington. It used to be a seat with a decent Tory majority (although not as safe as it was when it was part of the Kensington and Chelsea constituency), but at the 2017 general election Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad pulled off a surprise victory, winning with a majority of 20. The Lib Dems came a poor third in the seat in 2017. Asked why he thought he had a chance, Gyimah told the Standard: You have the Conservative party pursuing a reckless hard Brexit, which has turned its back on business and is out of touch with modern Britain. Then you have a Labour party led by Jeremy Corbyn who is unfit to be the prime minister and stands for an assault on property rights and people\u2019s pensions. What we bring are sensible pragmatic policies and getting things done. Throughout Brexit I\u2019ve shown that I stand for the values that diverse, forward-looking people in Kensington share. Back in the debate Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden is speaking now. He says if something was a bad idea yesterday, it is still a bad idea today. If something was a bad idea yesterday, it might just be a bad idea today. I don\u2019t believe that the prime minister has been pushing for an election because it is impossible in any way to get his deal through, after all the proposal received its second reading last week. This is being done because the prime minister wants to avoid proper scrutiny of his proposals before he calls an election, and he has been desperate since the day he took office to run this election. Boris Johnson has been desperate for an election, he says. And he says there are two reasons why it is a bad idea. An election does not take a no-deal Brexit off the table, he says. And he says Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal is flawed. It would involve two Brexits: one for Northern Ireland, and one for the rest of the UK. These are from ConservativeHome\u2019s Mark Wallace. Labour\u2019s Kevan Jones says he will not be voting for an early election. Here is an extract from the statement he has written explaining his position. Now that a deal has moved past second reading, and time has been afforded to discuss it, the government is now calling a general election, an entirely unnecessary exercise, instead of allowing scrutiny of its own bill. It remains my belief today that this impasse must be overcome by deliberation and cooperation in parliament. As such, I will not vote for an early general election today. And the Labour MP Anna Turley says she won\u2019t vote for an early election either. From ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen The Tory MP Bob Seely is speaking now. He criticises Labour for obstructing Brexit, saying Jeremy Corbyn is someone who can neither oppose nor lead. But Labour\u2019s Kevan Jones says Labour offered to sit down with the government to negotiate a new programme motion, to allow the withdrawal agreement bill to go ahead, but with MPs getting sufficient time to debate it. Seely does not accept the point. But Jones repeatedly says Labour made this offer. Jones says it was Boris Johnson who decided not to press ahead with the withdrawal agreement bill, not Labour. The Labour MP Paul Farrelly told the Commons he would not vote for an early election. Intervening earlier in the debate, Farrelly said: [I\u2019d] encourage as many of my colleagues as possible to defy the threats and blandishments to do so because the reality is that the uncertainty of an outcome of a general election certainly does not take no-deal off the table. Swinson says she would always vote to give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. Anyone sceptical about this should look at what happens in Scotland. She says in Scotland you see sixth-formers leaving school in the afternoon and going to the polling station. It is \u201ca sight to see\u201d, she says. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking now. She says Boris Johnson \u201chad a cheek\u201d talking about the whole UK in his opening speech. Johnson has not been acting in the interests of the whole of the UK. He has let Northern Ireland down. He said no Conservative PM would accept a border in the Irish Sea. But that is exactly what he has done, she says. I\u2019ve beefed up some of the earlier posts from the opening of the debate with direct quotes from speeches, including from Boris Johnson\u2019s. (See 2.41pm.) To get the updates to show, you may need to refresh the page. Blackford is still speaking. He says the government should extend the franchise to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote, and EU nationals to vote in general elections. He says EU nationals are on the electoral register already. At the end of his speech Blackford receives applause from SNP MPs. The full text of the bill is now here (pdf), on the UK parliament website. And the explanatory notes are here (pdf). Amendments to the bill would normally be on this page too, but they are not, because the bill was only published today and the amendments are only going in now. The Labour MP Stephen Doughty says he has tabled an amendment to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. Reminder: just because an amendment has been tabled, that does not mean it will be put to a vote. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, is speaking now. He says the SNP has been accused of trying to obstruct Brexit. \u201cGuilty as charged,\u201d he says. Corbyn is wrapping up now. He says Labour is ready for this election. He wants to give people hope. He will go out there and give that message, whenever the election takes place. Whatever date the house decides the election will be, I\u2019m ready for it, we\u2019re ready for it. Because we want to be able to say to the people of this country there is an alternative to austerity. There is an alternative to inequality. There is an alternative to sweetheart trade deals with Donald Trump. There is an alternative of a government that invests in all parts of the country, a government that\u2019s determined to end injustice in our society. And a government that is determined to give our young people a sense of hope in their society rather than the prospects of indebtedness and insecure employment in the future, which is sadly all the Conservative government and their coalition with the Lib Dems ever brought. I\u2019m very ready to go out there and give that message in any election, whenever it comes. If Sky\u2019s Kate McCann is right, Labour backing for votes from the age 16 and votes for EU nationals (see 2.46pm) will not make any difference because the amendments will not be called. Corbyn says Labour will be supporting votes for people aged 16 and 17, and also supporting the right of EU nationals to vote in the general election. He says, if EU nationals have made their future in this country, they should have the right to vote here too. In response to an intervention from a Scottish MP, Corbyn says the idea of making election day a public holiday, so as to increase turnout, is a good one. He also says he favours extending the franchise to give 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Johnson. He says he is looking forward to campaigning all over the country. And he says he will campaign against Johnson in Johnson\u2019s constituency, Uxbridge and South Ruislip - if Johnson is still the candidate there. Corbyn is referring to rumours that Johnson might switch to a safer seat. Boris Johnson opened the debate. His speech was very like the one he delivered last night, although it also sounded as if he had written it before Labour confirmed that it wanted an early election. I will post some quotes here an an update later. UPDATE: Here are extracts from the speech. It is now a week since parliament voted to delay Brexit, yet again. It is a week since this parliament voted yet again to force Brussels to keep this country in the European Union, for at least another three months, at a cost of \u00a31bn a month ... I\u2019ve twice offered more time for debate, Mr Speaker, I\u2019ve offered more time last week, I made the same offer last night. I said that we were prepared to debate this bill, the withdrawal bill, around the clock, to allow parliament time to scrutinise this bill, to the point of intellectual exhaustion ... Not only has this house been considering this issue for three-and-a-half years, but last week when this bill was being debated there was not a single new idea, there was not a single new suggestion, and all they wanted was more time, more weeks, more months, when they couldn\u2019t even provide the speakers to fill the time allotted. [Labour] just want to spin it out forever, until the 12th of never. And when the 12th of never eventually comes around, they\u2019ll devise one of their complicated parliamentary procedures and move a motion for a further delay and a further extension then ... There is only one way to get Brexit done in the face of this unrelenting parliamentary obstructionism, this endless, wilful, fingers crossed, \u2018not me guv\u2019 refusal to deliver on the mandate of the people and that is to refresh this parliament and give the people a choice. How significant is the government defeat on the Stella Creasy amendment? (See 2.23pm.) At this point it is hard to tell. As ITV\u2019s Robert Peston reports, government sources are saying that, if an amendment to the bill giving EU nationals the right to vote in the general election gets passed, the government will pull the bill, and the December election will not go ahead. Presumably the same would apply if an amendment were passed to give the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds - although enfranchising EU nationals would be easier, because they already can vote in local elections. The fact that the Creasy amendment has been passed means that it is possible that amendments on these topics could now be put to a vote. But we don\u2019t know yet whether they will be put to a vote. The clerks would have to accept that they were \u201cin scope\u201d (ie, relevant to the subject of the bill). And the chair would have to decide to call such amendments (which is never a given). Even if there are votes on these topics, it is not clear that they would pass. Opposition MPs would vote in favour, but the opposition is only winning votes at the moment with the support of the ex-Tory independents, and people in that camp tend not to be the sort of people who favour introducing major constitutional change in a rush. And, finally, if Labour actually does want an early election \u2013 and this morning Jeremy Corbyn looked as if he did (see 11.54am), although many of his colleagues obviously have their doubts \u2013 then it would make sense for the party to let these amendments fail. We will find out later today. The final votes should take place at about 7.45pm. Boris Johnson has lost the first vote. The Stella Creasy amendment has been passed by 312 votes to 295 - a majority of 17. This means that, during the main debate, opposition amendments can be accepted. The business motion as amended goes through on the nod. From the official Labour whips Twitter account MPs are now voting on Stella Creasy\u2019s motion. If passed, this would ensure that during the main debate on the bill MPs can propose amendments in the usual way. Under the government\u2019s plan, only amendments from the government would be put to a vote. Labour\u2019s Stella Creasy is now moving her amendment. (See 11.20am.) She says the government has tried to rig the debate. That is because the programme motion takes away the right of the chair to select any amendment for debate. She says that is \u201cnot cricket\u201d. If this programme motion is allowed to stand, it would set a precedent for future debates, she says. She says if the bill is to pass, it should do so via fair play. The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart says, if Labour is going to oppose this programme motion, this bill might not progress. He says Boris Johnson has failed to deliver his key promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October. He says the \u201cKippers\u201d (Ukip supporters), Faragists and rightwing Tories must feel like mugs. He says a December election is not ideal. He says in parts of his constituency in December it gets dark at 3.30pm. But he says this is a risk worth taking for the sake of having an early election. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, is now speaking. She criticises the way the government has introduced this bill, saying MPs have had very little time to implement it. She says the programme motion is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and deliberately designed to frustrate the Commons. Rees-Mogg says the government wants this bill to get royal assent by 5 November, so that the house can rise on 6 November. He says parliament also has to pass a budget for the Northern Ireland assembly before then. He says this is a short bill, and that the business motion is routine. He says Stella Creasy\u2019s amendment in itself would not wreck the bill, but it would be a \u201cgateway to amendments that could seek to obstruct the bill\u201d, he says. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, is now moving the business motion for the debate, which gets considered before the second reading debate starts. John Bercow, the Speaker, announces that he will call Stella Creasy\u2019s amendment to the business motion, which would block an attempt by the government to limit the ability of MPs to force votes on amendments to the bill. (See 11.20am.) Bercow urges MPs not to spend too much time debating the business motion. He says the second reading vote must take place four hours from now. John Bercow, the Speaker, is responding to the points of order. He says this should be a matter for the candidates to replace him. He says he has no desire to serve beyond Thursday evening. But if people want him to stay on, he would be willing to, he suggests. In the Commons John Bercow, the Speaker, is now taking points of order. Bercow was due to stand down as Speaker on Thursday, with the election of the new Speaker scheduled for Monday. But some MPs are now urging Bercow to stay in office until the end of this session, which will either be on Thursday, or on Monday or Tuesday next week, depending on what gets agreed as to the timing of an election. Chris Bryant, who is one of the candidates to be the next Speaker, said now was not the right time to elect a new Speaker. Newnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt says it is not yet certain that the December election will go ahead. He explains: We will find out shortly, because the debate on the programme motion is about to start. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that drug pricing would not be included in any trade deal with the US after Brexit. Responding to a reference to the Channel 4 Dispatches investigation saying that drug pricing has been discussed in talks between UK and US officials, Hancock said: The NHS is off the table in trade talks and pharmaceutical pricing is off the table and transparency over pharmaceutical pricing would not benefit this country at all because we get the best deals in the world because we can keep them confidential. Here is the Evening Standard\u2019s take on Labour\u2019s decision to back an early election. The Standard, of course, is edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne. One of the joys of an election is the unexpected event that has the potential to derail campaign planning. The 2019 general election was only confirmed (effectively) about two hours ago, but Boris Johnson has already received his first election setback; in a surprise announcement, the Office for Budget Responsibility has announced that it plans to publish revised economic forecasts on 7 November. Robert Chote, the OBR chair, has revealed this in an open letter to the Treasury (pdf). Normally the OBR publishes revised economic forecasts twice a year, accompanying the budget and the spring/autumn statement (the timing of the budget determines which it is). Chote says the OBR started working on new forecasts when the Treasury announced a budget for 6 November. But that budget has been cancelled. There were suspicions that one reason for the cancellation of the budget was that it would involve the government having to publish OBR figures showing that there was less scope for tax cuts and spending increases after the election than the Tories might like to admit. Chote does not address this point directly. But he says that, since the OBR last published a forecast in March, government borrowing has increased more than expected and there has been a \u201crapid growth\u201d in public spending. He goes on: Given the importance of these changes for public understanding of the baseline against which the government will need to judge its fiscal policy options, we believe that it would be useful to explain publicly the impact that they would have had on our March forecast, had they been known at the time. If any of the parties are planning extravagant promises on tax and spending, the new OBR figures may cast extra doubt on their credibility. But the OBR analysis is not likely to undermine the arguments in favour of Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal. One report (pdf) has argued it would be much worse for the economy than Theresa May\u2019s deal over the long term. But Chote says that the OBR forecasts only cover a five-year horizon, and that the impact of the new deal, compared with the previous one, would be \u201crelatively modest\u201d. Downing Street has set out its red lines ahead of the debate on calling a December election. In brief \u2013 the government seems open to a 10 or 11 December date, but is dead set against amendments extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds or EU nationals. On the date, while the Lib Dem hope for a 9 December poll, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said this would require parliament to dissolve at the start of Friday this week, so as to allow the necessary 25 working days between dissolution and polling. This would make it \u201cvery difficult\u201d for both the election bill and a separate bill on budgets for the suspended Northern Ireland assembly to pass through the Commons and Lords and receive royal assent in time, the spokesman said. Also, 9 December is a Monday, meaning election preparations would take place of the preceding weekend, which would be logistically difficult and costly, he added. However, it seems the government could compromise on 10 or 11 December. In contrast, there seems no possibility of compromise on adding younger voters or EU nationals, with Johnson\u2019s spokesman saying that longstanding convention dictates that changes to the franchise only happen after extensive consultation. He said: The election law on the franchise should not be changed days before the calling of a general election. The Electoral Commission warns against changing electoral laws less than six months before an election. Adding 16- and 17-year-olds would be \u201cadministratively impossible to deliver in the time available\u201d, he said, warning also that adding EU nationals would bring \u201cadministrative chaos\u201d. The latter point seems less certain given that EU nationals can already vote in local elections, and so many are registered. But the No 10 spokesman added: \u201cIt would also mean EU nationals in the UK enjoying wider voting rights than UK nationals in any other country other than Ireland.\u201d These are from the Labour MP Barry Sheerman. I\u2019ve asked Labour if it can confirm or deny what Sheerman is saying about resignations, but have not had a reply yet. Heidi Allen, the former Conservative MP who defected to Change UK and then ended up a Liberal Democrat, has announced that she won\u2019t be standing again in her South Cambridgeshire constituency. In an open letter to her constituents, she says she is \u201cexhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace\u201d. The Financial Times is running its own poll tracker (a chart that incorporates the results of all published polls). It has the Conservatives 11 points ahead of Labour. Most general elections get described as the most important the country has faced for a generation or so. Here is the academic Matthew Goodwin making a case for why this might be true this time around. Former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has confirmed that she will not take up her new post at an international communications firm while she continues to sit in the Scottish parliament. Davidson faced a storm of criticism after the announcement last Thursday that she intended to take up an appointment as a senior adviser to Tulchan Communications \u2013 their managing partner is the former Conservative party chair Andrew Feldman, a close ally of David Cameron \u2013 before stepping down as an MSP in 2021. It was reported that Davidson would be paid \u00a350,000 for 24 days\u2019 work a year. In a statement released on Tuesday morning, as the Holyrood parliament returns after its autumn recess, Davidson said: The debate in Scotland about my taking an advisory role with Tulchan Communications has become increasingly contentious. I, and Tulchan, have therefore agreed not to proceed with the appointment. She continues to insist that she does not believe the role amounted to a conflict of interest, continuing: I sat down with Scottish parliamentary officials in advance to go through the code of conduct, in detail, in order to avoid any conflict and to ensure I would be working within the rules at all times. The role reflected this. The consensus view from political opponents and commentators is that working to improve businesses\u2019 understanding of the cares and concerns of people is somehow incompatible with my role as an MSP. So if I am asked to choose between Holyrood and this role, then I choose the parliament I have dedicated the last nine years to, eight as party leader, a decision Tulchan supports. Jeremy Corbyn has just delivered a clip for broadcasters confirming Labour\u2019s decision to back an early election and saying the party is \u201ctotally determined\u201d to win it. He was surrounded by members of his shadow cabinet, most (but not all) of whom looked happy about the decision. Repeating the points he made in the statement released earlier (see 10.52am), Corbyn said the party would not back an early election until a no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table. But following the confirmation from the EU that there will be an extension, the party was now ready to back one, he said. (This marks a discreet climbdown from Sunday, when the party was saying that a Brexit extension on its own would not be enough to persuade it that no deal had been taken off the table.) Corbyn said Labour would fight its biggest campaign ever. He said: So we are going to go out there, with the biggest campaign this party has ever mounted \u2013 totally united, totally determined - and I\u2019m absolutely looking forward to going to every part of the country with my wonderful shadow cabinet team here and all the fantastic Labour activists to give message of hope where there isn\u2019t one with this government. He sidestepped a question about whether the party would insist on any conditions before it backed the government bill, implying it wouldn\u2019t, and instead said he could not wait for the campaign to start. I can\u2019t wait to get out there on the streets. In every town and village in this country, Labour will be there, giving a message of real hope where this government offers nothing. And when asked if any of his team had doubts about the decision, he replied: Do you know what, the Labour party loves a debate. But they also love the end of a debate. And this is the end of the debate, and we are going out there to win. There is one urgent question today. The Labour decision to back an early election means Boris Johnson is going to get his way, and the bill calling for a poll in December is going to pass. Labour is still planning to push various amendments, but it has agreed to an early election in principle and none of these amendments are being described as red lines. But MPs will still have to debate the bill. A complicated business motion (pages 6 to 9 on the order paper) has been tabled, saying the whole process should take six hours, with the second-reading vote coming four hours after the start of proceedings. Unusually, the business motion limits the ability of MPs to amend the bill by saying that that there should be a limit on the number of votes allowed by the Speaker and that amendments moved by ministers should take priority. The Labour MP Stella Creasy has tabled her own amendment to the business motion that would open up the process and allow amendments to be voted on as usual. This means the opening of the proceedings will be dominated by a row about process, because the business motion has to be agreed before the second-reading debate can start. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg Labour has just released this statement from Jeremy Corbyn. This is what he told the shadow cabinet this morning. I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to no-deal Brexit being off the table. We have now heard from the EU that the extension of article 50 to 31 January has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met. We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen. In this statement Corbyn is not saying anything about the conditions he flagged up yesterday for Labour supporting an early election. That implies the party is not insisting on firm red lines, and that it will support the bill \u2013 meaning the early election is definitely on. This is from the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson. This does not necessarily mean Labour will back the bill as it currently stands, because yesterday Jeremy Corbyn signalled that, although he might back an election in December, he had a problem with the proposed date, Thursday 12. From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming More from the People\u2019s Vote campaign, where the Twitter feed seems to be under the control of the anti-Rudd faction. (See 10.16am.) Around 40 members of staff at the People\u2019s Vote campaign have written to Roland Rudd, who effectively runs it, complaining about his decision to dismiss two of its most senior executives, James McGrory and Tom Baldwin. In the letter, which was sent last night, they said: It is utterly absurd that at this critical time for our country, you have started an argument about how our campaign is run. We do not want a public argument, we simply want to get back to work, delivering the people\u2019s vote that our country so desperately needs. Your actions have meant that we have been unable to do that, at this critical juncture for the campaign and the country. As the staff of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, we demand you allow us to continue with our work, under the leadership of James and Tom. My colleagues Rajeev Syal and Rowena Mason have a good article explaining the background to the row here. The gender pay gap for full-time workers in the UK has increased slightly to 8.9%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. As the Press Association reports, the new figure compares with 8.6% last year, which was the lowest since records began in 1997, when it stood at 17.4%. The difference in pay of all male and female workers, including those in part-time jobs, has fallen from 17.8% in 2018 to 17.3% in 2019, and continues to fall, the report said. For people under 40 years of age, the pay gap for full-time employees is now \u201cclose to zero\u201d, the ONS said. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has said his party\u2019s votes \u201cshould not be taken for granted\u201d by the prime minister today, refusing to confirm whether he would support Johnson\u2019s latest attempt to call a December election, but insisting that his party still wanted one \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Of course, Blackford can\u2019t take his own MPs for granted either: yesterday the long-serving Western Isles MP, Angus Brendan MacNeil, broke ranks to criticise SNP support for a winter election. Asked on BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme about his own comments last week that going to the polls in December was \u201cbarking mad\u201d, especially in a northern constituency like his, Blackford insisted that circumstances had now changed because of the EU\u2019s extension. He said: I have no particular relish to have an election over the course of the next weeks but we\u2019re going to have to accept our responsibility. People will still come out. Asked whether he accepted that a potential outcome of a general election could be a Tory majority and a no-deal Brexit, Blackford said it was \u201cup to the Labour party and others in England and Wales to do their job in defeating the Conservatives. We will do that in Scotland. But the simple fact remains that we cannot sit back and allow this prime minister to take us out of Europe.\u201d He added that in Scotland \u201cwe have the insurance policy of having a referendum on independence\u201d, which the SNP intends to make a key election issue. But the party must also be aware of echoes of 1979, when the SNP helped to bring down the minority Labour government, ushering in two decades of Tory rule, a memory that still smarts for some. In his Today interview Philip Hammond, the former Tory chancellor, also said that he thought the Vote Leave faction in Downing Street \u2013 the advisers who used to work with Boris Johnson on the Vote Leave campaign in 2016, of whom the most important is Dominic Cummings \u2013 wanted an early election because they wanted to recast the Conservative party, removing remainers such as Hammond himself. He told the programme: I fear that the real narrative here is that the Vote Leave activists \u2013 the cohort that has seized control in Downing Street and to some extent in the headquarters of the Conservative party \u2013 want this general election to change the shape of the Conservative party in parliament. To get rid of a cohort of MPs it regards as not robust enough on this issue and then replace them with hardliners. As evidence, Hammond cited this tweet last night from Arron Banks, the former Ukip donor and founder of the Leave.EU campaign. My colleague Kate Proctor has written up the Hammond interview in full here. This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield. A government source who would know says this is true, As of this morning there were three days separating the Lib Dems and the SNP, who want the early election on Monday 9 December, and the government, who wanted it on Thursday 12. Now the government is shifting, and the gap is down to two days. We\u2019ll find out later if the opposition parties would accept this. But what is most significant is that the haggling and the compromising has already started. Today MPs are due to debate all stages of the early parliamentary general election bill, the legislation announced by Boris Johnson last night after he failed for the third time to get two thirds of MPs (the threshold) to vote for an early election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act procedure. A bill can pass the Commons with a majority of one, and with the Liberal Democrats and the SNP in principle committed to an early election, and even Labour warming to the idea, there is a strong possibility that it will pass, and that by tonight we will be able to plan for an election at some point in the week beginning Monday 9 December. But it is not in the bag yet. The bill has still not been published, and the government and opposition parties are divided over the date of a December poll. Ministers want it on Thursday 12, whereas the Lib Dems and the SNP want it on Monday 9. More importantly, most of the parties are deeply split over the wisdom of an early poll. Even the SNP parliamentary party, which is normally a model of unity and discipline and never normally divides over anything, has got one of its MPs going around saying the party\u2019s plan would be like \u201ca birthday present and a Christmas present [for Johnson[ rolled into one\u201d. And the reason for this heightened uncertainty? Decisions about whether or not to back an early election are almost always driven by self-interest, but no one knows which party is likely to benefit most from an early poll. The psephologists have already been warning that predicting the election will be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d, because the electorate is more volatile than it has ever been in the post-war period. To add to the complexity, no one can be certain how the electorate will respond to the Brexit delay, whether the campaign will be dominated by Brexit or by domestic issues, and how voters will respond to being asked to go to the polls a fortnight before Christmas. MPs and party leaders may have their own theories as to who would gain most from an early election, but there is no consensus and no rock-solid evidence; basically, it\u2019s all guesswork. The parties are expected to whip the votes this afternoon but, with MPs voting on their own job prospects, we might get more rebellions than usual, which is another reason why the bill could fail. In the Conservative party Johnson is facing a backlash against his decision to go for an election, and this morning there are signs that it is growing. The Tory MP Simon Hoare told the Commons last night that voters would not understand why Johnson was calling an election now. Speaking during the business statement announcing today\u2019s bill, Hoare said: May I ask the leader of the house what we are to say to constituents and others about the fact that we may be able to find time for a five to six-week general election campaign and then the rigmarole of forming a government and yet not for bringing back the withdrawal bill? The Tory MP William Wragg said in the Commons last night that \u201cmany\u201d Conservative MPs supported the plan put forward by Frank Field in an early day motion, saying that Johnson should instead set aside 14 days to pass the withdrawal agreement bill. Johnson is also being told in private by some of his MPs that he should press with the withdrawal agreement bill, and deliver Brexit, before holding an election. This is from an analysis by the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. One MP told me that a group of them made it clear to the PM in person on Monday night that they were deeply unhappy at what one of them described as him \u201cbeing churlish, and taking his bat and ball home\u201d, when he achieved what was said to be impossible by getting a deal in the first place, only to give up when the timetable for it was rejected last week. Mocking the prime minister\u2019s own slogan, the MP joked \u201cthat doesn\u2019t exactly look like trying to get Brexit done\u201d. And this morning Philip Hammond, the former Tory chancellor who now sits as an independent having had the whip removed, told the Today programme that he was appalled by Johnson\u2019s decision to go for an election before delivering Brexit. He said: If [Boris Johnson] has pressed on with a sensible timetable motion, say allowing the Commons five days to consider the bill, it would be out by now and into the House of Lords, and we would be well on our way to being able to leave the European Union, certainly by the end of November, perhaps earlier. But because he insisted that it all had to be done by 31 October, something that we now know can\u2019t happen, it is the government itself that has been blocking Brexit. And the idea that now we would use our precious time to halt all of this process for five or six weeks, and go out and have a general election, frankly appals me. I think the government is trying to create a narrative that parliament is blocking Brexit and therefore we need an election. But that is simply untrue. Parliament signalled very clearly last week that it was prepared to press on with the Brexit bill, provided it had a reasonable timetable to do so. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 12.30pm: MPs begin debating the early parliamentary general election bill. It is due to pass all its Commons stages today. 2.45pm: Philip Rycroft, former permanent secretary at the Brexit department, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on MPs debating the early election bill. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Phil Neville has challenged his younger players to raise their game and claimed the standard required at international level is 10-15% higher than in the Women\u2019s Super League, as he named a small, experienced squad for the prestige friendly against Germany at Wembley. A 1-0 win over a modest Portugal side this month ended a five-match losing streak and Neville knows the match a week on Saturday, in front of a sellout crowd of 90,000, will put him and his team under an intense spotlight. Neville believes England will enjoy the challenge but, after drafting younger players into his squads following the World Cup, he has reverted to the tried and trusted with only four players under the age of 23 in a selection of 21. \u201cI don\u2019t think we feel pressure,\u201d Neville said. \u201cMy experience over the last three or four games is that these players need these kind of occasions; when the pressure is on that\u2019s where my players want to be. They\u2019re going to go out and enjoy it. They\u2019re playing the second-best team in the world. \u201cThis is a game where as players and managers we have got to ... just play football and play football really well. We work really hard in the growing of the sport but there are certain matches where you have just got to win that bloody game. Not win, but perform. From my point of view this is a game where we have to perform.\u201d On the younger generation, Neville said: \u201cWe see a lot of players. We get a lot of players pushed on us. What I would say is the level of the WSL and the level of competition with England is totally different, 10-15% more. When we bring certain players into the environment we find out a lot about them. Some make it up to the grade and some don\u2019t. But when they come into the environment they\u2019ve got to perform. \u201cThe senior nucleus of the squad are the ones who are still performing when they\u2019re on camp and when they\u2019re in the games. Those younger players that are coming through, some of them have got a lot to do. They\u2019ve got to become better professionals, become a Steph Houghton, a Lucy Bronze, an Ellen White. \u201cBeth Mead has been through the grind. We have shown her some real tough love in the summer, in the World Cup, and I was with her at the Pride of Britain Awards; we were laughing about some of the stuff we have said to her, real hard words \u2013 and she has come out of it. That is the key. \u201cLeah Williamson is the same. There was a massive push for Leah. We had to be really hard on her but now she is becoming really top. That is my job as a manager to be honest with the players. They have a lot of people around them that tell them what they want to hear. As a manager you are the only one that tells them the truth.\u201d Mead and Williamson make the cut, with the squad size pared down by Neville to prepare for next year\u2019s Olympics, where he will coach Team GB and only 19 players can be selected. There is also a place for Toni Duggan, recalled after Neville admitted the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winger played through injury during the World Cup, while Manchester City teenager Lauren Hemp is in line for a second cap. Fran Kirby misses out on her return from injury, however, while White and Georgia Stanway were judged fit enough only to join the training camp.",

South Africa were touring New Zealand and played a Waikato side featuring Mitchell. The Springboks won 38-17 and Mitchell said: \u201cI got belted and we got belted as well.

It was the game in those days.\u201d</p> <p>Courtney Lawes is similarly expecting an arm-wrestle but believes keeping calm will be key for England. \u201cAre they one of the best in terms of physicality? Yes certainly.

We will only have 160 minutes training this week and we have a six-day turnaround. There is not a lot you can change in that time, just one or two moves maybe. \u201cI have coached against Eddie\u2019s England four times and we have never had discussions via the media. I am expecting another normal buildup to a Test match, although he might surprise us. \u201cOn the field, I expect a very well coached, fit England team with a great tactical plan. The physicality they brought to New Zealand was the next level and it had been a long time since I had seen an England team turn up with that much physicality. They will be brimming with confidence.\u201d Jones does not name his team until Thursday and does not have the same luxury as Erasmus with Kyle Sinckler\u2019s fitness being monitored and Jonny May and Owen Farrell recovering from dead legs sustained against the All Blacks. Sinckler was given his own individual training programme and was largely restricted to boxing and handling exercises but Mitchell is optimistic all three will be available for selection. The latest indications were that Jones was leaning towards resisting returning to a midfield of Farrell, Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade, despite the physical threat posed by South Africa\u2019s Damian de Allende and instead sticking with George Ford at fly-half. Erasmus accepted the criticism for his side\u2019s attritional approach but insisted the Springboks will not change their ways. After their dogged semi-final win over Wales the second-row Lood de Jager said: \u201cThe only way we know is fighting fire with fire.\u201d On Tuesday Vunipola responded: \u201cThey have already come out and said they want to fight fire with fire and I guess we return it by saying: \u2018Bring it on\u2019. It is a final and [their power] is one of those things you have to front up to and one of their biggest assets and something we have been working on. Like Eddie has mentioned they have many different threats and one is their forward pack.\u201d To illustrate the abrasive threat posed by South Africa, Mitchell recalled an encounter with the Springboks from his playing days in 1994. South Africa were touring New Zealand and played a Waikato side featuring Mitchell. The Springboks won 38-17 and Mitchell said: \u201cI got belted and we got belted as well. It was a guy called Adri Geldenhuys. He had octopus arms I think. He got me a beauty. Then the final whistle went and there was [Springbok] Mark Andrews and myself laughing. It was the game in those days.\u201d Courtney Lawes is similarly expecting an arm-wrestle but believes keeping calm will be key for England. \u201cAre they one of the best in terms of physicality? Yes certainly. It\u2019s a big challenge and it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to front up to. \u201cThey are tough guys, they\u2019re brought up tough and they play tough. So do we. So we\u2019re looking forward to it. We don\u2019t need to do anything special to go out there to win a game, if we all do our jobs we\u2019ve got the quality in the team to beat anyone.\u201d",

While Everton were on top by the time Holgate came up for a corner and stuck around to score the opening goal, they will have to play a lot better against Spurs at the weekend if they are to avoid a sixth league defeat in seven games. The Carabao Cup may not come to Silva\u2019s rescue should that happen, for a side who take over an hour to score against Watford have no business dreaming of Wembley with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City still at large.</p> </blockquote> <p>Much more here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/29/everton-watford-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report\">Everton\u2019s Mason Holgate and Richarlison show Watford the door</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5db8b5068f08d669cdaaf3b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T21:55:52.757Z\">9.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The quarter-final draw </strong>will be held this Thursday, live on Zoe Ball\u2019s Breakfast Show on Radio 2, for some reason, at 8.45am.</p> <p>\u201cI moved to Oxford for uni a couple of years ago,\u201d boasts Alex Yeandle, \u201cbut am originally from Colchester.

On a purely numerical basis, this is the week\u2019s big night of cup action, even if tomorrow\u2019s three games (Liverpool v Arsenal, Chelsea v Manchester United and Aston Villa v Wolverhampton, since you ask) all have just a little bit more stardust twinkling upon them than any of tonight\u2019s five. Still, we must all play the hands we are dealt, and these are our aces this evening (all 7.45pm BMT kick-offs):</p> <p><strong>Burton Albion v Leicester City<br></strong>Burton\u2019s Nigel Clough thinks/hopes that this competition might not be Leicester\u2019s toppermost priority. \u201cIt is a competition that they could win, but they are challenging for the top four as well so there will be different thoughts going through his head,\u201d he said of his opposite number, Brendan Rodgers. Leicester\u2019s Danny Ward is expecting a tough old night. \u201cIt will be another tough game, they will be right at it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve played there before, it\u2019s a small, intimidating ground and they will make it difficult for us, but we know what job we\u2019ve got to go there and do and hopefully we\u2019ll produce another good performance.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Crawley Town v Colchester United</strong><br>Crawley have not won a game since they last played Colchester on 12 October. \u201cI think we will react, I believe in the squad and in what we are doing,\u201d the manager, Gabriele Cioffi, says. \u201cSometimes a fall is healthy and I think it happened in the right moment.\u201d Meanwhile the Colchester midfieler Ben Stevenson is feeling optimistic. \u201cWe are hoping that we can put on a show,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all really looking forward to it for the travelling fans and looking to get through.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Everton v Watford<br></strong>Everton have to cope with the knock-on effects of the weekend defeat at Brighton, in which they sustained damage to their morale and Bernard sustained a knee ligament injury. \u201cThe next game is a different competition and if we have a goal, an ambition to go until the end, to the final, we have to win,\u201d says Marco Silva. Meanwhile Quique Sanchez Flores says success in the cup will not impact on Watford\u2019s miserable league form. \u201cWhat we want is a win,\u201d he says. \u201cTo win is always important, but what we realise is when we won in Swansea, it didn\u2019t affect what happened in the league because we didn\u2019t win the next one. It\u2019s different competitions, different line-ups, different goals. So to win tomorrow is important again but it\u2019s nothing concerned about what is happening in the league. It is a completely different scenario.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Manchester City v Southampton<br></strong>Pep Guardiola insists that Southampton are not completely rubbish despite their 0-9 home thrashing by Leicester last Friday. \u201cThey are incredible professionals,\u201d said the Spaniard. \u201cThe manager will be sad for a moment, for one night, but after that they have to move forward. They will try to do their best.\u201d Indeed Ilkay Gundogan says tonight\u2019s game \u201cis not going to be easy, especially for their last result\u201d. Meanwhile Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg insist the Saints are determined to improve. \u201cWe never want to be in this position again or anywhere near it. We have to get back up and make sure this never happens again,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can put quotes out, apologise and say something, but the only thing that\u2019s the real deal now is actions. Actions that are nowhere near what they were against Leicester. We can never show our faces like this again.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Oxford United v Sunderland</strong><br>Oxford must do without the full-back Chris Cadden and midfielder Cameron Brannagan, who both picked up injuries during Saturday\u2019s 3-0 League One win over Rochdale. Sunderland also lost at the weekend, 1-0 at Shrewsbury. \u201cThis is a different challenge against an in-form team, who are scoring goals,\u201d says their assistant manager, Steve Parkin. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for our lads to progress in a fantastic competition.\u201d </p> <p>So, that\u2019s what\u2019s on our menu. Let\u2019s do this!</p> </div>   </div>",

Here\u2019s Paul Doyle\u2019s report from the Pirelli Stadium: Leicester advanced to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals despite being spooked by Burton. Brendan Rodgers\u2019 men seemed set to dish out another emphatic beating after goals by Kelechi Iheanacho and Youri Tielemans put them 2-0 up after 20 minutes. But rather than lie down like Southampton, the League One side rebelled, halving the deficit thanks to Liam Boyce and forcing Danny Ward to make several fine saves. James Maddison came off the bench to settle the tie in the 89th minute. Much more here: Extraordinary scenes at Oxford tonight: \u201cWe could actually hear the crowd at the Oxford United stadium cheering,\u201d reports Mark Piesing. \u201cWe have never heard any sound from the stadium before.\u201d Paul Wilson was at Goodison Park: Goals from Mason Holgate and Richarlison spared Marco Silva\u2019s blushes against his former club and sent Everton into the last eight of the Carabao Cup, circumstances that will probably prevent the beleaguered manager being sacked in the morning, whatever the Watford fans present might have wished. Everton wore down their opponents in the end, though it was not the convincing performance Silva was seeking to impress his current employer or his old one. While Everton were on top by the time Holgate came up for a corner and stuck around to score the opening goal, they will have to play a lot better against Spurs at the weekend if they are to avoid a sixth league defeat in seven games. The Carabao Cup may not come to Silva\u2019s rescue should that happen, for a side who take over an hour to score against Watford have no business dreaming of Wembley with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City still at large. Much more here: The quarter-final draw will be held this Thursday, live on Zoe Ball\u2019s Breakfast Show on Radio 2, for some reason, at 8.45am. \u201cI moved to Oxford for uni a couple of years ago,\u201d boasts Alex Yeandle, \u201cbut am originally from Colchester. Oxford were promoted from League Two to League One the same season Colchester were relegated from League One to Two, the same season I started uni, meaning I could never watch an Oxford-Colchester derby! Maybe now they\u2019ve both made it to the quarters I\u2019ll finally get my chance!!\u201d Meanwhile in Spain, Lionel Messi has scored another sensational free kick, scored a phenomenal goal from open play (that first touch!) and provided an exquisite assist for Arturo Vidal as Barcelona lead Valladolid 5-1. The match reports are already rolling in. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson at the Etihad: Manchester City took their unbeaten Carabao Cup run to 1,098 days in a near-stroll of a victory over a still-smarting Southampton. This was the visitors\u2019 first game since Leicester trounced them 9-0 and it showed. Southampton did, at least, lose by only two goals and achieve against Pep Guardiola\u2019s men what they failed to do against the Foxes \u2013 score \u2013 but until City slackened off towards the end they were too tentative. Much more here: The keeper goes the right way and makes an easy save! Sunderland are out! Mousinho scores, and Oxford lead 4-2. Crucial moments for Sunderland, who send McNulty up next ... Will Grigg misses from the spot! He sends his effort sailing over the bar and after three penalties each, Oxford lead 3-2! Meanwhile, the tie between Oxford and Sunderland will be decided on penalties. They have so far taken two each, and scored the lot. The final whistle goes at Goodison Park, and Everton have secured what looks from here a most deserved victory! All of the first three Carabao Cup games to end, end 3-1. Leicester ease past Burton Albion and a textbook potential banana skin. Watford push forwards in search of an equaliser, and end up conceding a second. Richarlison is played through a ragged rearguard, and finishes in style! Colchester United come out on top in the all-League Two tie at Crawley, and they are in the final eight! The final whistle goes at the Etihad, where City have beaten Southampton slightly less comfortably than it appeared they would a little earlier in the evening. Sunderland\u2019s Luke O\u2019Nien has just been tripped in the box, but somehow the referee doesn\u2019t give a potentially decisive penalty! Meanwhile at the Pirelli Stadium Demarai Gray is played through, takes the ball round the outrushing keeper, but his left-foot, side-footed shot is feeble and a defender clears. Gray has a hand in another goal, and Leicester wrap up the tie! The winger bursts down the right, gets to the byline and pulls back to Maddison, only recently off the bench, whose first-time shot goes in at the far post. Burton have a chance to equalise, but Sarkic appears to panic as the goalkeeper hares out towards him, and blasts over the bar. A cross from the right, and Luke Gambin controls brilliantly, turns and slams the ball into the roof of the net! An equaliser for Sunderland! It\u2019s a bit messy: a corner is flicked on, bounces off a defender\u2019s back and finds McNulty, who converts from close range! Leicester have a goal disallowed, Barnes converting Gray\u2019s low centre but being ruled narrowly offside. They\u2019ve only gone and scored! It\u2019s a corner on the right which is deliciously flighted to the far post, where Jack Stephens thumps in a header! Everton hit the back of the net! Walcott gets the ball on the left of the area and crosses to Holgate, who is completely unmarked five yards out and can hardly miss! Southampton have had a shot on target! And three shots in total! A massive turnaround in their fortunes at the Etihad. Everton hit the woodwork again! This time it\u2019s Lucas Digne, with a 25-yard free-kick that clips the top of the wall, and then the top of the bar on its way over. How long can Watford survive this onslaught? Now Everton hit the woodwork! The ball falls to Iwobi just inside the area, and he lashes it against the meat of the bar! I read this caption and thought the picture would be of Andre Gray farting. Apologies for being infantile. Anyway, Everton just nearly scored again. This time, Aidy Mariappa cleared off the line! Something happens at Goodison Park! Everton have a free-kick on the left, which is sent arrowing onto Michael Keane\u2019s forehead, but he nods the ball straight at Gomes! Burton nearly equalise! From a corner, the ball is headed towards the far corner, and it was looping in until a defender got in the way, and then it wasn\u2019t. At the other end, Albrighton\u2019s low shot is well saved! Latest tallies from the Etihad: Manchester City Shots: 15 Shots on target: 9 Corners: 5 Goals: 3 Southampton Shots: 0 Shots on target: 0 Corners: 0 Goals: 0 Mahrez\u2019s 30-yarder hits a defender, loops up and drops onto Aguero\u2019s foot six yards out! He hardly makes any contact, but then he doesn\u2019t really need to, particularly with the Southampton defence dozing. Game on! Boyce spears a low shot goalwards from the edge of the area, and Ward in the Leicester goal is so surprised at this turn of events that he haplessly helps it in! A nice free-kick from Cohen Bramall hits the bar, bounces into the goalkeeper\u2019s back and goes in! Our five matches are back under way. On Sky, they are suggesting that only losing to Manchester City by two or three goals might serve to \u201cbuild confidence\u201d. City come close to scoring a third, but Bernardo Silva doesn\u2019t anticipate Mahrez\u2019s through-ball, which was really quite excellent. The Everton match sounds good. Peeeeeep! It\u2019s half-time in our five Carabao Cup matches. A quick scoreline reminder: Burton Albion 0-2 Leicester Crawley 1-1 Colchester Everton 0-0 Watford Manchester City 2-0 Southampton Oxford Uited 1-0 Sunderland Manchester City have had 10 shots, seven on target, and won four corners. Southampton have had no shots and won no corners. Two injuries to report at Goodison Park: Watford have been forced to take off Domingos Quina and bring on Evertonn\u2019s summer target Abdoulaye Doucoure, and Everton have been forced to take off Yerry Mina and bring on Michael Keane. A fine cross from Kyle Walker on the right, and a tap-in for Aguero in the centre! A lovely run from Oxford\u2019s Shandon Baptiste ends in the area with a humiliating left-footed air-shot. Sunderland hit the post and Oxford break at speed and in numbers. It looks to have come to nothing when Fosu-Henry\u2019s pass inside manages to evade both of his nearby team-mates but Hall arrives late to smash it into the corner of the net from the edge of the area! That lead did not last long. Norris equalises with a header that the keeper really should have got a hand to. Finally City get a reward for their domination! A corner is played short, Bernardo Silva chips in a cross from the corner of the area and Otamendi heads in from five yards! City have let it slip a bit of late, with latest statistics having them down at 83% possession. That\u2019s an absolute snorter! Bulman runs towards the area, nobody closes him down, so he lashes a rising shot into the far corner from 20 yards or so! Burton give the ball away in midfield, and again Gray\u2019s pass releases a player on the wing - Praet this time, on the right - whose low centre is converted by Tielemans! \u201cThis ROI supporter would like to know where the heck Michael Obafemi is,\u201d writes JR. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s injured again.Or would that be better than being healthy and not being selected? He seems like he\u2019s injured an awful lot for a seemingly healthy young fella.\u201d Earlier today the Southampton tyro was named in Ireland\u2019s expanded squad for next month\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark, which suggests his fitness is not an issue. After 11 minutes Manchester City have had 89% of possession against Southampton, and two shots on target. Eighty-nine percent! The game remains goalless, though. Sunderland win a corner, and when the ball is knocked down Lynch and Eastwood both race to it. The Sunderland No3 gets there first, and is then completely clattered by the Oxford goalkeeper. It\u2019s not a terrible penalty shout, but I think the ball was kicked into Eastwood, which might just have saved him. We have our first goal! A lovely pass from Gray to Tielemans shreds Burton\u2019s defence, and his low centre is turned in by Iheanacho! Southampton have not had to wait long for a reminder of last Friday\u2019s miseries: BONG! The clock strikes 7.45pm, kick off has been kicked off, and we are under way! In other news, here\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve only just realised that is vaguely related to Everton v Watford: they are two of five Premier League teams whose entire name (including any Cities, Uniteds or Roverses but not the FC bit) is seven letters long or shorter. In the Championship there are two (Fulham and Reading), in League One none (since the demise of Bury) and in League Two one (Walsall). In other words - and I think this is a reasonable way of interpreting the data - the shorter a club\u2019s name the more likely they are to do well. \u201cI\u2019m not a Southampton fan,\u201d writes Peter Oh, \u201cbut I have my fingers crossed that Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl will show that this past weekend\u2019s capitulation against Leicester was a false nine.\u201d Very good. The clocks have gone back, the nights are drawing in and we\u2019re heading into snood-and-hat territory. Finally, here are the teams from Oxford where both teams make five changes: Oxford Utd: Eastwood, Long, Dickie, Moore, Ruffels, Henry, Gorrin, Baptiste, Hall, Taylor, Fosu. Subs: Stevens, Forde, Mousinho, Sykes, Mackie, Agyei, Jones. Sunderland: Jon McLaughlin, Lynch, Willis, Flanagan, Conor McLaughlin, Dobson, Leadbitter, Power, Hume, McGeady, McNulty. Subs: McGeouch, O\u2019Nien, Grigg, Mbunga-Kimpioka, Taylor, Connelly, Patterson. Referee: Stephen Martin. Colchester are the only unchanged side tonight. How many unchanged teams have been named in the entire tournament? Not many, I\u2019d wager. Crawley Town: Luyambula, Sesay, Tunnicliffe, Dallison, Doherty, Bulman, Allarakhia, Ferguson, Beryly Lubala, Grego-Cox, Enigbokan-Bloomfield. Subs: Morris, Young, Palmer, Nadesan, Nathaniel-George, Sendles-White, Camara. Colchester: Gerken, Jackson, Eastman, Prosser, Bramall, Stevenson, Comley, Senior, Adubofour-Poku, Nouble, Norris. Subs: Lapslie, Sowunmi, Jevani Brown, Harriott, Clampin, Gambin, Ross. Referee: Tony Harrington. Teams from the Pirelli Stadium, where Burton make two changes and Leicester make nine: Burton Albion: O\u2019Hara, Brayford, O\u2019Toole, Wallace, Hutchinson, Edwards, Quinn, Fraser, Sarkic, Boyce, Broadhead. Subs: Daniel, Buxton, Templeton, Sbarra, Anderson, Dyer, Garratt. Leicester: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Evans, Fuchs, Choudhury, Albrighton, Praet, Tielemans, Gray, Iheanacho. Subs: Schmeichel, Soyuncu, Vardy, Maddison, Barnes, Ricardo Pereira, Ndidi. Referee: Darren England. Here are the teams from the Etihad, where 18-year-old Tommy Doyle makes his senior debut in what will from Southampton\u2019s perspective look like a disappointingly strong Manchester City side. Still, Pep Guardiola makes nine changes; Southampton make six. Man City: Bravo, Walker, Otamendi, Garcia, Jose Angelino, Bernardo Silva, Doyle, Foden, Mahrez, Aguero, Gabriel Jesus. Subs: Stones, De Bruyne, Silva, Joao Cancelo, Carson, Bernabe, Poveda-Ocampo. Southampton: McCarthy, Valery, Stephens, Bednarek, Danso, Ward-Prowse, Romeu, Hojbjerg, Armstrong, Long, Boufal. Subs: Yoshida, Vestergaard, Ings, Adams, Redmond, Gunn, Vokins. Referee: Jonathan Moss. Team news is rolling in. Here, to get the ball rolling, is news from Goodison Park, where Everton make five changes and Watford eight. Given Watford\u2019s current dearth of strikers it is interesting to see the 19-year-old Sam Dalby, who has been prolific so far this season for the Under-23 side (and stood out when I saw him in pre-season, albeit against non-league opposition), on the bench. Hello world! So the Carabao Cup\u2019s fourth round dawns, with five fixtures being played tonight and a further three tomorrow. On a purely numerical basis, this is the week\u2019s big night of cup action, even if tomorrow\u2019s three games (Liverpool v Arsenal, Chelsea v Manchester United and Aston Villa v Wolverhampton, since you ask) all have just a little bit more stardust twinkling upon them than any of tonight\u2019s five. Still, we must all play the hands we are dealt, and these are our aces this evening (all 7.45pm BMT kick-offs): Burton Albion v Leicester City Burton\u2019s Nigel Clough thinks/hopes that this competition might not be Leicester\u2019s toppermost priority. \u201cIt is a competition that they could win, but they are challenging for the top four as well so there will be different thoughts going through his head,\u201d he said of his opposite number, Brendan Rodgers. Leicester\u2019s Danny Ward is expecting a tough old night. \u201cIt will be another tough game, they will be right at it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve played there before, it\u2019s a small, intimidating ground and they will make it difficult for us, but we know what job we\u2019ve got to go there and do and hopefully we\u2019ll produce another good performance.\u201d Crawley Town v Colchester United Crawley have not won a game since they last played Colchester on 12 October. \u201cI think we will react, I believe in the squad and in what we are doing,\u201d the manager, Gabriele Cioffi, says. \u201cSometimes a fall is healthy and I think it happened in the right moment.\u201d Meanwhile the Colchester midfieler Ben Stevenson is feeling optimistic. \u201cWe are hoping that we can put on a show,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are all really looking forward to it for the travelling fans and looking to get through.\u201d Everton v Watford Everton have to cope with the knock-on effects of the weekend defeat at Brighton, in which they sustained damage to their morale and Bernard sustained a knee ligament injury. \u201cThe next game is a different competition and if we have a goal, an ambition to go until the end, to the final, we have to win,\u201d says Marco Silva. Meanwhile Quique Sanchez Flores says success in the cup will not impact on Watford\u2019s miserable league form. \u201cWhat we want is a win,\u201d he says. \u201cTo win is always important, but what we realise is when we won in Swansea, it didn\u2019t affect what happened in the league because we didn\u2019t win the next one. It\u2019s different competitions, different line-ups, different goals. So to win tomorrow is important again but it\u2019s nothing concerned about what is happening in the league. It is a completely different scenario.\u201d Manchester City v Southampton Pep Guardiola insists that Southampton are not completely rubbish despite their 0-9 home thrashing by Leicester last Friday. \u201cThey are incredible professionals,\u201d said the Spaniard. \u201cThe manager will be sad for a moment, for one night, but after that they have to move forward. They will try to do their best.\u201d Indeed Ilkay Gundogan says tonight\u2019s game \u201cis not going to be easy, especially for their last result\u201d. Meanwhile Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg insist the Saints are determined to improve. \u201cWe never want to be in this position again or anywhere near it. We have to get back up and make sure this never happens again,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can put quotes out, apologise and say something, but the only thing that\u2019s the real deal now is actions. Actions that are nowhere near what they were against Leicester. We can never show our faces like this again.\u201d Oxford United v Sunderland Oxford must do without the full-back Chris Cadden and midfielder Cameron Brannagan, who both picked up injuries during Saturday\u2019s 3-0 League One win over Rochdale. Sunderland also lost at the weekend, 1-0 at Shrewsbury. \u201cThis is a different challenge against an in-form team, who are scoring goals,\u201d says their assistant manager, Steve Parkin. \u201cThis is a great opportunity for our lads to progress in a fantastic competition.\u201d So, that\u2019s what\u2019s on our menu. Let\u2019s do this!",

      "body": "<p>Among the defining characteristics of a champion team is supposed to be a pair of hard-bitten, seen-it-all flankers. New Zealand\u2019s old firm of Richie McCaw and Jerome Kaino were a prime example, steering the All Blacks to glory at the past two Rugby World Cups. South Africa had the teak-tough Schalk Burger and Juan Smith in 2007, while England in 2003 benefitted from the high-class duo of Richard Hill and Neil Back.</p> <p>Aside from talent, the common denominator this century has been a lot of miles on the clock. McCaw, Hill and Back did not win a World Cup until they were over 30 and, of the rest, Burger was alone in doing so before the age of 25. It is necessary to rewind right back to the amateur era and the legendary All Black Michael Jones in 1987 to find a flanker who conquered the world before his 23rd birthday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/29/billy-vunipola-tells-south-africa-bring-it-on-rugby-union-world-cup-final-showdown\">Billy Vunipola tells South Africa to \u2018bring it on\u2019 in Rugby World Cup final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Which brings us to England\u2019s Tom Curry, now just 80 minutes away from breaking Jones\u2019s long-standing record. Curry only turned 21 in June yet, alongside his 23-year-old teammate Sam Underhill, he has been among the most influential players at this World Cup. If England\u2019s increasingly impressive defence proves the difference against South Africa this weekend, the newly-minted word \u2018Undercurry\u2019 (strong, unyielding, seriously tasty) may soon be pushing for inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary.</p> <p>Even if their team falls short, Curry and Underhill will return home having had the ultimate seal of approval from their defence coach John Mitchell. The ex-All Black coach has worked with many of the best back-rowers in the modern game and is seldom prone to exaggeration but in this instance he has already made his mind up. Not only do England\u2019s youthful duo remind him of McCaw and the esteemed Wallaby David Pocock but, he says, they are already more dynamic.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of McCaw and a lot of Pocock in them but they\u2019re quicker,\u201d suggested Mitchell, after England had finished training in the Tokyo rain. \u201cHaving played in the back-row and coached a lot of fine back-rowers in the world you get a bit of a feel for who is outstanding and who isn\u2019t. These two have still got so much more growth in them ... they have the ability to be world class.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cff06f551c29d29d175eac19dae0a72f1ae7d9bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cff06f551c29d29d175eac19dae0a72f1ae7d9bd/0_46_2923_1753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England defence coach John Mitchell says that Underhill and Curry \u201chave got rocks and boulders in their shoulders\u201d.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England defence coach John Mitchell says that Sam Underhill and Tom Curry \u201chave got rocks and boulders in their shoulders\u201d.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is also Mitchell\u2019s view that, collectively, England still have more in the tank as they prepare to cope with the uber-physical challenge of South Africa. Stopping a herd of charging wildebeest would be only marginally easier than tackling some of their opponents\u2019 monster forwards in full cry but, as Curry and Underhill demonstrated last Saturday, the bigger they are the harder they fall. Their chop tackling and insatiable work-rate effectively left the All Blacks with nowhere to go.</p> <p>If it helps slightly that, to use Mitchell\u2019s phrase, the pair \u201chave got rocks and boulders in their shoulders\u201d their commitment has been staggering. England\u2019s bruise brothers have also made a deliberate point of tackling lower, among the tactics which made life so awkward for New Zealand. \u201cYes, we do work on that,\u201d confirmed Mitchell. \u201cWe address it as part of the way we practise but the players own it. Every team has different strengths so the carrier types coming towards you every weekend are slightly different. That requires some adjustments but they are bright lads. They\u2019re smart as well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the entire team queuing up to make dominant tackles on behalf of their mates alongside them, Mitchell continues to take the view that defence is, ultimately, what wins World Cups. \u201cYeah, I think defence has been a common thread that\u2019s come out of World Cups over the years and it\u2019s going to be really important again on the weekend. It\u2019s important for us to continue to get better in that particular area and be even more patient in the way we execute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60266907d5c653ba4421cf80301738a70f957e4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60266907d5c653ba4421cf80301738a70f957e4f/0_0_4673_3116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand's full back Beauden Barrett (R) is tackled by England's flanker Tom Curry\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Curry\u2019s insatiable work-rate helped England build a platform on which to beat New Zealand in the semi-final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I watched the Springboks as a kid and then played against them and coached there, they are probably a side that can create pressure like no other team in the world. It is what Springboks rugby has always been built on - that ability to create pressure. But what\u2019s great is there is now another team who can create that type of pressure - and that is us.\u201d</p> <p>Curry, Underhill, Lawes, Vunipola, Vunipola, Itoje, Sinckler, George ... find an easy route through that formidable posse and South Africa will fully deserve to lift the Webb Ellis Cup. Resolute defence, as Wales discovered on Sunday, is not enough on its own to win major Test matches but it can make a decisive difference. \u201cWe are about to witness the two most powerful rugby teams in the world,\u201d confirmed Mitchell. \u201cThe gain line is going to be huge.\u201d</p> <p>On the evidence of recent weeks, even the massive Springbok forwards should brace themselves.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Among the defining characteristics of a champion team is supposed to be a pair of hard-bitten, seen-it-all flankers. New Zealand\u2019s old firm of Richie McCaw and Jerome Kaino were a prime example, steering the All Blacks to glory at the past two Rugby World Cups. South Africa had the teak-tough Schalk Burger and Juan Smith in 2007, while England in 2003 benefitted from the high-class duo of Richard Hill and Neil Back. Aside from talent, the common denominator this century has been a lot of miles on the clock. McCaw, Hill and Back did not win a World Cup until they were over 30 and, of the rest, Burger was alone in doing so before the age of 25. It is necessary to rewind right back to the amateur era and the legendary All Black Michael Jones in 1987 to find a flanker who conquered the world before his 23rd birthday. Which brings us to England\u2019s Tom Curry, now just 80 minutes away from breaking Jones\u2019s long-standing record. Curry only turned 21 in June yet, alongside his 23-year-old teammate Sam Underhill, he has been among the most influential players at this World Cup. If England\u2019s increasingly impressive defence proves the difference against South Africa this weekend, the newly-minted word \u2018Undercurry\u2019 (strong, unyielding, seriously tasty) may soon be pushing for inclusion in the Oxford English Dictionary. Even if their team falls short, Curry and Underhill will return home having had the ultimate seal of approval from their defence coach John Mitchell. The ex-All Black coach has worked with many of the best back-rowers in the modern game and is seldom prone to exaggeration but in this instance he has already made his mind up. Not only do England\u2019s youthful duo remind him of McCaw and the esteemed Wallaby David Pocock but, he says, they are already more dynamic. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of McCaw and a lot of Pocock in them but they\u2019re quicker,\u201d suggested Mitchell, after England had finished training in the Tokyo rain. \u201cHaving played in the back-row and coached a lot of fine back-rowers in the world you get a bit of a feel for who is outstanding and who isn\u2019t. These two have still got so much more growth in them ... they have the ability to be world class.\u201d It is also Mitchell\u2019s view that, collectively, England still have more in the tank as they prepare to cope with the uber-physical challenge of South Africa. Stopping a herd of charging wildebeest would be only marginally easier than tackling some of their opponents\u2019 monster forwards in full cry but, as Curry and Underhill demonstrated last Saturday, the bigger they are the harder they fall. Their chop tackling and insatiable work-rate effectively left the All Blacks with nowhere to go. If it helps slightly that, to use Mitchell\u2019s phrase, the pair \u201chave got rocks and boulders in their shoulders\u201d their commitment has been staggering. England\u2019s bruise brothers have also made a deliberate point of tackling lower, among the tactics which made life so awkward for New Zealand. \u201cYes, we do work on that,\u201d confirmed Mitchell. \u201cWe address it as part of the way we practise but the players own it. Every team has different strengths so the carrier types coming towards you every weekend are slightly different. That requires some adjustments but they are bright lads. They\u2019re smart as well.\u201d With the entire team queuing up to make dominant tackles on behalf of their mates alongside them, Mitchell continues to take the view that defence is, ultimately, what wins World Cups. \u201cYeah, I think defence has been a common thread that\u2019s come out of World Cups over the years and it\u2019s going to be really important again on the weekend. It\u2019s important for us to continue to get better in that particular area and be even more patient in the way we execute. \u201cWhen I watched the Springboks as a kid and then played against them and coached there, they are probably a side that can create pressure like no other team in the world. It is what Springboks rugby has always been built on - that ability to create pressure. But what\u2019s great is there is now another team who can create that type of pressure - and that is us.\u201d Curry, Underhill, Lawes, Vunipola, Vunipola, Itoje, Sinckler, George ... find an easy route through that formidable posse and South Africa will fully deserve to lift the Webb Ellis Cup. Resolute defence, as Wales discovered on Sunday, is not enough on its own to win major Test matches but it can make a decisive difference. \u201cWe are about to witness the two most powerful rugby teams in the world,\u201d confirmed Mitchell. \u201cThe gain line is going to be huge.\u201d On the evidence of recent weeks, even the massive Springbok forwards should brace themselves.",

Tice said he received a frantic message from one Tory urging him not to stand a candidate in their constituency because they were facing a challenge from the Liberal Democrats. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the first; it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d he said. The texter, who sent the message on Monday as MPs returned to Westminster amid early election speculation, said that as a committed Brexiter they should be spared a challenge from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Tice, a businessman who co-founded the Leave.EU campaign group, said he had already received numerous requests from Tory MPs who are clearly anxious that the Brexit party will have more appeal for their constituents than Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. The Brexit party is offering a \u201cclean\u201d break with the EU \u2013 in effect a no-deal arrangement. It has so far vetted 600 candidates for a general election and there is a presumption it is aiming to stand in all 650 seats. The party took 29 European parliament seats at the 2019 election and has four Welsh assembly seats. Farage is still offering the government an alliance or \u201cnon-aggression pact\u201d; as both parties want to quit the EU, there is concern that unless they stand aside for each other they might split the vote of Brexit-backing constituents and usher in an opposition party candidate who backs remain or a softer Brexit. The Brexit party wants a free shot at Labour heartland seats and in return it has offered not to run where a Tory MP is enthusiastically backing its brand of Brexit or where a Tory has a reasonable chance at beating a Labour rival. Without a genuine Brexit-backing majority in parliament, the stalemate in the Commons may continue, Farage has warned previously. However, his offer has been robustly dismissed by a No 10 source who said Farage was \u201cnot fit\u201d to be allowed near government. The Brexit party is spending the next few days finalising seats for high-profile candidates such as Farage and Tice, who is an MEP for the East of England, and former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe. As it makes more concrete election plans, it appears it is attempting to align itself with the Democratic Unionist party to form a bloc that could eventually \u201chold the balance of power\u201d that the Tories would need to unlock a functioning majority. DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr spoke at one of the Brexit party\u2019s most recent rallies and they are said to have an extremely good relationship and to be working ever more closely together. The Brexit party is aiming for up to 50 seats, but even if it returns a low number of MPs, a party source said the DUP had been a case in point at how powerful a small collection of MPs could be in shaping Brexit. The source said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how influential those 10 seats are.\u201d There is an assumption that the DUP and Brexit party could unite with an offer for Johnson should he fall short of securing a majority in an election.",

But by the end they were concerned enough to bring on [Maddison, Harvey Barnes and Wilfried Ndidi], which is great credit to us.\u201d Fair comment. Not that Leicester started with a weak side. Jonny Evans and Youri Tielemans were the only two starters who had begun Friday\u2019s 9-0 Premier League demolition of Southampton but Leicester\u2019s squad are so strong their lineup still had fearsome quality \u2013 the bench was even better just in case the going got tough, which it did. So Brendan Rodgers was certainly not taking this tie lightly. And why would he when Burton proved their cup credentials by beating Bournemouth in the last round and reaching the semi-finals of this competition last season? Quite apart from the threat he knew Burton carried, Rodgers had no intention of allowing his team\u2019s momentum to stall. With a culture of ruthlessness to nurture and no European campaign to fret about, there is no good reason for a club with such an accomplished squad not to strive for a cup triumph as well as progress in the Premier League. Kelechi Iheanacho, who looked sharp here despite not appearing in this season\u2019s Premier League, fired Leicester in front after seven minutes, finishing from 10 yards after Demarai Gray and Tielemans sliced through Burton with a precise counterattack. \u201cWe want 10,\u201d piped up the travelling fans. Scott Fraser skimmed a post with a shot in the 18th minute and that seemed to irritate Leicester, who doubled their lead less than two minutes later. Gray was again integral to a flowing move, this one culminating with Dennis Praet pulling back the ball for Tielemans to slot home from close range. Burton gradually got to grips with the visitors. Just before the break, Ward had to make a couple of fine saves, turning away a diving header by Broadhead before thwarting the same player again a minute later. Praet clipped a shot wide early in the second half after being released by Iheanacho. Then Leicester got careless and Burton punished them. Iheanacho gave away possession in midfield and the Premier League side bungled several chances to clear the danger before Boyce took Ward by surprise with a ferocious shot from over 20 yards. The keeper failed to hold it. Now Leicester had a serious fight on their hands. If Ward was at fault for Burton\u2019s goal, he atoned by making a fabulous reflex save to turn away a close-range volley by Fraser in the 74th minute. After Rodgers sent on reinforcements, Maddison settled the tie by turning in a cross from Gray in the 89th minute.",

      "body": "<p>WhatsApp has launched an unprecedented lawsuit against a cyber weapons firm which it has accused of being behind secret attacks on more than 100 human rights activists, lawyers, journalists, and academics in just two weeks earlier this year.</p> <p>The social media firm is suing NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company, saying it is responsible for a series of highly sophisticated cyber-attacks which it claims violated American law in an \u201cunmistakeable pattern of abuse\u201d.</p> <p>WhatsApp said it believed the technology sold by NSO was used to target the mobile phones of more than 1,400 of its users in 20 different countries during a 14-day period from the end of April to the middle of May.</p> <p>In this brief period, WhatsApp believes those who were the subject of the cyber-attacks included leading human rights defenders and lawyers, prominent religious figures, well-known journalists and officials in humanitarian organisations.</p> <p>A number of women previously targeted by cyber-violence, and individuals who have faced assassination attempts and threats of violence, as well as their relatives, were also the victims of the attacks, the company believes.</p> <p>WhatsApp\u2019s lawsuit, filed in a California court on Tuesday, has demanded a permanent injunction blocking NSO from attempting to access WhatsApp computer systems and those of its parent company, Facebook.</p> <p>It has also asked the court to rule that NSO violated US federal law and California state law against computer fraud, breached their contracts with WhatsApp and \u201cwrongfully trespassed\u201d on Facebook\u2019s property.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time that an encrypted messaging provider is taking legal action against a private entity that has carried out this type of attack against its users,\u201d said a WhatsApp spokesman. \u201cIn our complaint, we explain how NSO carried out this attack, including acknowledgement from an NSO employee that our steps to remediate the attack were effective.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/help/ng-interactive/2017/mar/17/contact-the-guardian-securely\">Contact the Guardian securely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company is also supporting calls by the UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression, David Kaye, for a moratorium on this kind of invasive spyware.</p> <p>\u201cThere must be strong legal oversight of cyber-weapons like the one used in this attack to ensure they are not used to violate individual rights and freedoms people deserve wherever they are in the world,\u201d WhatsApp said.</p> <p>\u201cHuman rights groups have documented a disturbing trend that such tools have been used to attack journalists and human rights defenders.\u201d</p> <p>WhatsApp said it had worked with Citizen Lab, an academic research group based at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School, to identify the victims of the attacks and the technology used against them. The organisation has begun approaching members of civil society who were affected by the alleged hacks.</p> <p>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said WhatsApp\u2019s action was \u201ca major positive step forward for human rights protections online and will absolutely set a precedent\u201d.</p> <p>He accused NSO of acting with disregard to the people who were being targeted. \u201cWhile telling the public it is concerned about human rights, the commercial spyware industry has attempted to carve out an unaccountable space for itself, whereby virtue of its proximity to governments, it claims it is acting lawfully, yet prefers to disclaim any responsibility for that behaviour when it suits them.\u201d</p> <p>WhatsApp\u2019s announcement comes six months after it disclosed it had discovered a vulnerability that allowed cyber-attackers to install surveillance software on to both iPhones and Android phones by ringing targets using the application\u2019s phone function. It was unclear at that time how many of WhatsApp\u2019s 1.5bn users were affected.</p> <p>Since then, WhatsApp, working alongside Citizens Lab, has been attempting to establish how many attacks were launched in the days before the vulnerability was closed. The company is understood to have been shocked at what it found.</p> <p>In its lawsuit, it has accused NSO of \u201cunlawful access and use of WhatsApp computers, several of which are located in California\u201d.</p> <p>It also claims NSO \u201ctook a number of steps, using WhatsApp servers and the WhatsApp Service without authorisation, to send discrete malware components (\u2018malicious code\u2019) to target devices\u201d \u2013 and that this was done in a way to \u201cconceal defendants\u2019 identity and involvement\u201d.</p> <p>The WhatsApp lawsuit is not the only one directed at NSO. The company has been accused of targeting Omar Abdulaziz, who was a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi before the Washington Post journalist was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.</p> <p>NSO has said it reviews allegations of abuse by clients and that it reserves the right to strip customers of their licences.</p> <p>The company was acquired earlier this year by a London-based private equity firm called Novalpina Capital, <a href=\"https://www.novalpina.pe/novalpina-capital-llp-to-unveil-new-governance-framework-at-nso-group-within-90-days/\">which in June said </a>it would unveil new governance standards at the company.</p> <p>NSO has in the past vigorously defended the use of its technology and surveillance software, which is known as Pegasus, as a law enforcement tool that could help prevent crime and terror attacks. Novalpina has credited NSO technology for disrupting plans for a terrorist attack at a crowded stadium in Europe and, citing the Mexican government, said it assisted in the 2011 arrest of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/el-chapo-the-last-of-the-cartel-kingpins\">drug kingpin known as El Chapo</a>.</p> <p>The Israeli company released details of that new \u201chuman rights policy\u201d in November, which it said was founded on \u201cunequivocal respect for human rights\u201d. Among other initiatives, it vowed to integrate new due diligence procedures to identify, prevent, and mitigate \u201cadverse human rights impacts\u201d due to the possible abuse of its technology.</p> <p>It also said it would conduct an evaluation of the \u201cpotential for adverse human rights impacts\u201d arising through the misuse of NSO products, as well as enforcing \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d that would prevent NSO\u2019s customers from using its products for anything other than the investigation of serious crime.</p> <p>But the new policy was criticised by some human rights and cyber-surveillance experts, including the UN\u2019s Kaye.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://freedex.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2015/files/2019/10/NSO-GROUP-LETTER-OL-OTH-52.2019-1.pdf\">18 October </a><a href=\"https://freedex.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2015/files/2019/10/NSO-GROUP-LETTER-OL-OTH-52.2019-1.pdf\">letter</a> to Shalev Hulio, one of NSO\u2019s founders, Kaye raised questions about the efficacy of the new human rights guidelines and due diligence procedures, and suggested NSO seemed entirely reliant on its own customers to self-report abuse of its products.</p> <p>NSO Group said: \u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them. The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is that strongly encrypted platforms are often used by paedophile rings, drug kingpins and terrorists to shield their criminal activity. Without sophisticated technologies, the law enforcement agencies meant to keep us all safe face insurmountable hurdles. NSO\u2019s technologies provide proportionate, lawful solutions to this issue.</p> <p>\u201cWe consider any other use of our products than to prevent serious crime and terrorism a misuse, which is contractually prohibited. We take action if we detect any misuse. This technology is rooted in the protection of human rights \u2013 including the right to life, security and bodily integrity \u2013 and that\u2019s why we have sought alignment with the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, to make sure our products are respecting <em>all </em>fundamental human rights.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>If you have been affected by or have information on the alleged WhatsApp hack please contact <a href=\"mailto:Nick.Hopkins@theguardian.com\">Nick.Hopkins@theguardian.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:Stephanie.Kirchgaessner@theguardian.com\">Stephanie.Kirchgaessner@theguardian.com</a></em></p> <p>.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "WhatsApp has launched an unprecedented lawsuit against a cyber weapons firm which it has accused of being behind secret attacks on more than 100 human rights activists, lawyers, journalists, and academics in just two weeks earlier this year. The social media firm is suing NSO Group, an Israeli surveillance company, saying it is responsible for a series of highly sophisticated cyber-attacks which it claims violated American law in an \u201cunmistakeable pattern of abuse\u201d. WhatsApp said it believed the technology sold by NSO was used to target the mobile phones of more than 1,400 of its users in 20 different countries during a 14-day period from the end of April to the middle of May. In this brief period, WhatsApp believes those who were the subject of the cyber-attacks included leading human rights defenders and lawyers, prominent religious figures, well-known journalists and officials in humanitarian organisations. A number of women previously targeted by cyber-violence, and individuals who have faced assassination attempts and threats of violence, as well as their relatives, were also the victims of the attacks, the company believes. WhatsApp\u2019s lawsuit, filed in a California court on Tuesday, has demanded a permanent injunction blocking NSO from attempting to access WhatsApp computer systems and those of its parent company, Facebook. It has also asked the court to rule that NSO violated US federal law and California state law against computer fraud, breached their contracts with WhatsApp and \u201cwrongfully trespassed\u201d on Facebook\u2019s property. \u201cThis is the first time that an encrypted messaging provider is taking legal action against a private entity that has carried out this type of attack against its users,\u201d said a WhatsApp spokesman. \u201cIn our complaint, we explain how NSO carried out this attack, including acknowledgement from an NSO employee that our steps to remediate the attack were effective.\u201d The company is also supporting calls by the UN special rapporteur for freedom of expression, David Kaye, for a moratorium on this kind of invasive spyware. \u201cThere must be strong legal oversight of cyber-weapons like the one used in this attack to ensure they are not used to violate individual rights and freedoms people deserve wherever they are in the world,\u201d WhatsApp said. \u201cHuman rights groups have documented a disturbing trend that such tools have been used to attack journalists and human rights defenders.\u201d WhatsApp said it had worked with Citizen Lab, an academic research group based at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School, to identify the victims of the attacks and the technology used against them. The organisation has begun approaching members of civil society who were affected by the alleged hacks. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, said WhatsApp\u2019s action was \u201ca major positive step forward for human rights protections online and will absolutely set a precedent\u201d. He accused NSO of acting with disregard to the people who were being targeted. \u201cWhile telling the public it is concerned about human rights, the commercial spyware industry has attempted to carve out an unaccountable space for itself, whereby virtue of its proximity to governments, it claims it is acting lawfully, yet prefers to disclaim any responsibility for that behaviour when it suits them.\u201d WhatsApp\u2019s announcement comes six months after it disclosed it had discovered a vulnerability that allowed cyber-attackers to install surveillance software on to both iPhones and Android phones by ringing targets using the application\u2019s phone function. It was unclear at that time how many of WhatsApp\u2019s 1.5bn users were affected. Since then, WhatsApp, working alongside Citizens Lab, has been attempting to establish how many attacks were launched in the days before the vulnerability was closed. The company is understood to have been shocked at what it found. In its lawsuit, it has accused NSO of \u201cunlawful access and use of WhatsApp computers, several of which are located in California\u201d. It also claims NSO \u201ctook a number of steps, using WhatsApp servers and the WhatsApp Service without authorisation, to send discrete malware components (\u2018malicious code\u2019) to target devices\u201d \u2013 and that this was done in a way to \u201cconceal defendants\u2019 identity and involvement\u201d. The WhatsApp lawsuit is not the only one directed at NSO. The company has been accused of targeting Omar Abdulaziz, who was a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi before the Washington Post journalist was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. NSO has said it reviews allegations of abuse by clients and that it reserves the right to strip customers of their licences. The company was acquired earlier this year by a London-based private equity firm called Novalpina Capital, which in June said it would unveil new governance standards at the company. NSO has in the past vigorously defended the use of its technology and surveillance software, which is known as Pegasus, as a law enforcement tool that could help prevent crime and terror attacks. Novalpina has credited NSO technology for disrupting plans for a terrorist attack at a crowded stadium in Europe and, citing the Mexican government, said it assisted in the 2011 arrest of the drug kingpin known as El Chapo. The Israeli company released details of that new \u201chuman rights policy\u201d in November, which it said was founded on \u201cunequivocal respect for human rights\u201d. Among other initiatives, it vowed to integrate new due diligence procedures to identify, prevent, and mitigate \u201cadverse human rights impacts\u201d due to the possible abuse of its technology. It also said it would conduct an evaluation of the \u201cpotential for adverse human rights impacts\u201d arising through the misuse of NSO products, as well as enforcing \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d that would prevent NSO\u2019s customers from using its products for anything other than the investigation of serious crime. But the new policy was criticised by some human rights and cyber-surveillance experts, including the UN\u2019s Kaye. In an 18 October letter to Shalev Hulio, one of NSO\u2019s founders, Kaye raised questions about the efficacy of the new human rights guidelines and due diligence procedures, and suggested NSO seemed entirely reliant on its own customers to self-report abuse of its products. NSO Group said: \u201cIn the strongest possible terms, we dispute today\u2019s allegations and will vigorously fight them. The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years. \u201cThe truth is that strongly encrypted platforms are often used by paedophile rings, drug kingpins and terrorists to shield their criminal activity. Without sophisticated technologies, the law enforcement agencies meant to keep us all safe face insurmountable hurdles. NSO\u2019s technologies provide proportionate, lawful solutions to this issue. \u201cWe consider any other use of our products than to prevent serious crime and terrorism a misuse, which is contractually prohibited. We take action if we detect any misuse. This technology is rooted in the protection of human rights \u2013 including the right to life, security and bodily integrity \u2013 and that\u2019s why we have sought alignment with the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, to make sure our products are respecting all fundamental human rights.\u201d \u2022 If you have been affected by or have information on the alleged WhatsApp hack please contact Nick.Hopkins@theguardian.com or Stephanie.Kirchgaessner@theguardian.com .",

Then they told me I couldn\u2019t get a driver\u2019s license. I couldn\u2019t get a job. And there was just a cascade of no, no, no. And finally my parents said it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t want you to do these things, it\u2019s because you can\u2019t. All my hopes and dreams about growing up were literally shattered in a single moment. And it was during a time when there wasn\u2019t the undocumented youth movement, so I wasn\u2019t able to find other students.</p> <p>I grew up in a predominantly Latino neighborhood, and before I found out I was undocumented, California was becoming a ground zero for this emerging anti-immigrant movement. I remember there were policy debates with the white kids on one side, the brown kids on the other, and me feeling like I had little understanding. But everything that was being said negatively toward my Latino classmates actually applied more directly to me.</p> <p><strong>How did you overcome this and become an academic?</strong></p> <p>I barely graduated high school after learning I was undocumented, because at the time I thought, what\u2019s the point? But I got married when I was 19 and I was able to adjust my immigration status. I paid for a summer politics class, and I thought if this professor can make a living teaching, maybe I can do the same.</p> <p>It took me years to realize I bring a different perspective to the study of immigration, politics and policy, that my history is my comparative advantage. It\u2019s a perspective that helps me ask questions that others don\u2019t. It took me a while to talk about my experience of being undocumented, because my parents\u2019 immigration status was still tenuous. But they\u2019re fine now, and I\u2019m able to speak out.</p> <p><strong>What has been most shocking to you about your findings on what happens to asylum seekers?</strong></p> <p>Some findings were simultaneously shocking, but also very expected since we\u2019ve heard anecdotal reports. There were over 200 incidents of verbal abuse, dozens of instances of physical abuse and even property being taken away. I heard of someone losing their life savings.</p> <p>The findings about language access also really stuck out. Individuals are getting instructions about critically important steps in languages that they don\u2019t speak: often Central American asylum speakers who speak an indigenous language by default are given instructions in Spanish.

This is a core part of the agenda. It\u2019s not just in disregard of international and domestic law, but it\u2019s in disregard of the fact that so many of the asylum seekers who are being turned away are seeking protection from persecution. It\u2019s an agenda that is blind to the experiences of these families. The inevitable result is that people will be sent to circumstances where they will likely die.</p> <p><strong>What do you hope is the impact of your work and your findings?</strong></p> <p>I used to believe in facts swaying public opinion.

But I do quantitative work, and at the end of the day, the data speak much louder than my own personal background.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the hardest part of doing academic work that is</strong><strong> relevant to urgent policy matters?</strong></p> <p>A lot of academics are just scared about being wrong and being publicly wrong. But I believe in the importance of the work, and that means I need to be confident that I can stand by it. A few years ago I thought my bar was peer review in an academic journal. Now I understand my bar to be that as well as, \u201cCan this pass muster with a federal judge or can this withstand a deposition from attorneys for the Department of Justice?\u201d</p> <p><strong>What effect does the work have on you personally?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s often miserable. It\u2019s difficult to hear. It\u2019s difficult to interact with people, to see women and little kids who are the ages of my own children in shelters in Mexico, not knowing what\u2019s going on. It is difficult to not internalize it. But I believe in the work. If it\u2019s not me, I\u2019m afraid there won\u2019t be others who step up.

Every generation gets to decide for itself, whether it embraces diversity through our immigration system or pushes it away by closing our golden door. We are defining for this generation how we are answering the question of what it means to be a nation of immigrants. And we have done that historically. And in some periods in our history, we have closed our doors to immigrants, and in other periods we have opened them again. This is cyclical.

The chair of the committee, Lord Morris of Aberavon, wrote a letter to the Brexit department minister James Duddridge questioning whether the government had offered more to EU citizens resident in the UK than it had done to the 1.3 million UK citizens living in the EU. Morris added that some of the government\u2019s actions may be \u201cactively counter-productive\u201d in terms of ensuring the security of healthcare, welfare benefits and pension entitlements of its own citizens abroad. He urged the government to engage urgently with the EU to protect the rights of UK citizens in the EU after Brexit. The government \u201cmust do more\u201d, Morris wrote. The House of Lords EU justice subcommittee is demanding that the government agree to a list of assurances to avoid British citizens currently living in the EU suffering what it says are significant healthcare and pensions difficulties after Brexit. In the letter, Morris asks the government to commit to an indefinite right for UK citizens and their families to return to the UK in future; continued funding for healthcare until any post-Brexit agreement is reached; and uprating the pensions of UK nationals living in the EU for as long as they continue to live there. He also calls for the arrangements for student fees and finance to apply to all children born before the Brexit referendum. \u201cWe acknowledge that the UK government cannot take unilateral action to mitigate every difficulty faced by UK citizens in the EU, since this sometimes requires reciprocity by our EU partners,\u201d Morris wrote. \u201cBut we were also told that the UK government could be doing more in a number of areas. \u201cThe situation, as it stands, means that many UK citizens have now lived in a state of anxiety and uncertainty for several years,\u201d he added. \u201cMany UK nationals moved to the EU several decades ago and did so with a reasonable expectation that the rights to which they were then entitled would not be subsequently removed without due notice and consultation.\u201d Morris makes clear that the committee was frustrated by the decision of the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, to refuse their invitation to give evidence to them and asked whether the government had done basic research on how its citizens would be affected by Brexit.

      "bodyText": "\u201cAnd the fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.\u201d Congratulations to our impeccable champion, consistent in excellence, the only possible winner. David is a shoo-in for a Guardian column, which will make Mon morning at the coffee machine awkward for me. But it was overachieving, underconfident Steph who broke our hearts tonight. Truly a parable on the danger of not believing in yourself. Thanks to all of you below the line, my underfleas in arms, my baking brethren. It\u2019s been a blast. Thanks to Hannah J Davies for excellent cover, and always keeping her apron clean. See you on the time-wasty place or the time-wasty place or if you want to make my face an achey place, buy my book. Ciao! x OMG I\u2019ve just realized David\u2019s lookalike is actress Claire Forlani. Michael\u2019s dungas are all that is left that is pure in this country. IF DAVID IS THE UNDERDOG WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MAKE THE REST OF US Hips don\u2019t lie, or at least the apron covering them doesn\u2019t. Congratulations to the deserving David! David\u2019s apron is spotless and it says so much My mouth would implode with the betrayal of a sausage roll that was actually a fig roll. \u201cMy money\u2019s on Essex\u201d Just remembered Phil at the garden party and started laughing. David has surely won? Though he can\u2019t have done? He never has before, right? He\u2019s second in technical David! His showstopper basically stepped straight out of the Tate Modern. David licks his lips as the judges taste his cheese. Steph sighs heavily.\u201d I recommend turning audio-description on, by the way. Discovery of the day No Alice\u2019s carrot cake scotch egg looks exceptional. She does very well. David absolutely nails it, with an illusion array that looks like a Fortnum\u2019s hamper. Can Tin Fringe Steph beat this? She definitely rallied. YES ALICE that scotch egg looks like an absolute dream sequence, with a vividness and logic all their own OMG HELENA looks like the queen of the dead how could I forget her. I love her, I always did, I can\u2019t pretend. \u201cNo amount of fire and freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.\u201d It\u2019s really hard watching this final, because Steph and Alice are not performing nearly as well as we\u2019ve seen they can. It comes down to emotional strength as much as talent, like sport and politics and all work. I agree with you lot- Noel brings so much fun, but also knows when a simple hug and encouragement is needed. Proper emotional intelligence. They look delightful.\u201d My god, he may not be relatable, but Michaelangelo\u2019s David is definitely in charge. I have offended God and mankind because my work did not reach the quality it should have.\u201d Da Vinci\u2019s last words. Just leaving this here, Steph and Alice. Steph and Alice are falling apart even though what they\u2019re turning out is extraordinary. Wait suddenly everything everyone is making looks amazing. They\u2019ve turned bowls of catsick into illusion pork pies and whatnot. What sorcery is this. @gladarvor I have forgotten Helena, it\u2019s true! I realised long ago you have to put people in mental compartments, so they\u2019re easier to detach from as necessary. OH GOD THIS IS WHY I AM SO ALONE. What an inconvenient moment to realise Noel is earning millions of pounds on that helter skelter, remember. He\u2019s the real winner tonight. Steph is falling apart like her cake and macarons. Feel so sorry for her. The iron fringe has crumbled. YES the redundant biscuit. Spend 45 minutes on that! Is David getting calmer? He\u2019s accessed some sort of Terminator mode. \u201cI need your clothes, your boots and your baking trophy.\u201d THAT\u2019S who she looks like. We\u2019ve had ten weeks- me and all of you, I\u2019m talking about- and we\u2019ve not nailed her lookalike. But she has, inadvertently. She is so accomplished and doesn\u2019t realise. How does Steph not know what song Mowgli sings she IS Mowgli. \u201cMy parents would hate to see me upset.\u201d Alice is so tempted to just knock back the prosecco, and knock this baking on the head. Speaking of which, Noel really looks like mid-period Elvis tonight. Ooh, belated happy birthday to David\u2019s partner! I mean, very belated. This was months ago. You could make a banana look like a pork pie\u201d Is this Paul talking, or Noel riffing? Because it\u2019s 2019 and everything is a lie Of course there\u2019s always an emotional climax when Paul\u2019s private chopper hoves into view I have a funny feeling they\u2019ll be there? Like the producers will make Paul send his private chopper to pick them up and BANG- emotional climax. But I\u2019m cynical about TV. Not the time to mention it BUT I really want someone to pat Alice\u2019s dad on the shoulder as he stares dismally at the departures board and whisper \u201cWith good management you don\u2019t need good luck.\u201d This is torture. Alice\u2019s parents update drama. Their flight has been cancelled and she is in tears. Dickens bloody loved BT, didn\u2019t he. And Tolstoy was a Special K guy through and through Imagine if David wins the whole thing simply because he bakes his cake. Like, all he does is step over the hurdle and walk over the line, while the others roly-poly sideways off the track. I don\u2019t need to wait for the judges, it\u2019s obviously Steph, Alice and then David in pole position. His souffl\u00e9 fails the least. She is crying into her souffl\u00e9 puddle, but the extra salt won\u2019t save her. If only seasoning was the solution. OH NOOO. Steph/Steff\u2019s bain-marie is is cold, and her uncooked souffles fall out like chicken soup from a Ziploc bag. This is her worst nightmare. The other two are at effable and jeffable egg-underconfidence. @hathycol Yes, David definitely knows his way around souffle. Ineffable egg confidence. WHY DOES STEPH\u2019S necklace say STEFF? CAN SHE NOT SPELL HER OWN NAME. I\u2019m so confused and losing it. A souffl\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have any raising agent, so the volume comes from the egg white.\u201d David under pressure, not at all. I guess when you\u2019re a nurse, this isn\u2019t actually stressful at all. Okay great that\u2019s brilliant\u201d Steph dismissing Noel\u2019s whimsy. Alice has never made a roux? The one-sidedness of bakers always suprises me. Love that Paul makes them make a biscuit with whatever else he asks. Custard, with a biscuit. Macaron tower, with a biscuit. Biscuit, with a buttery biscuit base. Just bake it twice as long, and lie. Pranks a go-go! Love the last day of school. Paul and Prue refuse to leave when asked, until Prue cracks up. Right that chocolate cake was a slice of nothing, time for Paul to have the bakers make an Eritrean temple loaf or something. Steph\u2019s cake is overbaked! They have all...failed so far? (Thank god this show isn\u2019t on the BBC any more.) Steph serves up the 70s on a plate, much like Operation Yewtree. I\u2019m confused about whether the judges think Alice\u2019s cake is absolutely first rate, or not very good. A bit wobbly, a bit clumsy.\u201d Prue kickstarting Alice\u2019s meltdown. Inevitably, Babestation Pauly H likes \u201cthe dripping effect.\u201d David overboozes the cake, which I for one am pleased about. A slice best served with ice. Everyone\u2019s families do seem lovely and supportive though. If quite mad. Like that singing Dr Oetker cake. Alice\u2019s parents are slightly like characters in a Jordan Peele film aren\u2019t they? Makes me warm to her a lot. HE ACTUALLY CHECKED HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR GLAZE. Everyone down their Armagnac! In fairness, her cake does look awful. Lols. \u201cCan I have some ice?\u201d-David. Speak to the staff you want, not the ones you don\u2019t yet have Alice is starting her anxiety engine. \u201cWith good management you don\u2019t need good luck.\u201d Alice\u2019s dad. If he was my dad I would have been selling heroin by the age of 15 or run off to a kibbutz. David\u2019s VT is a compressed Freudian therapy session. His mother\u2019s food snobbery and sugar-eschewing ways made him the driven, health machine he is. But he\u2019s also a nurse, driven to help others, in case you weren\u2019t feeling inadequate enough. I actually like it when David admires his own cooking. So un-British! Wait I thought his partner was Hungarian. Who was that American guy? Lovely VT insight into Steph\u2019s home life and struggles with confidence. She apparently comes from a matriarchal land with no men in it whatsoever. ARE THEY IN THE CAKES? Steffy Todd. Imagine the look she\u2019d give you if you picked up a declass\u00e9 Mrs Crimbles cookie Imagine Prue pushing a trolley of cakes through your office. You wouldn\u2019t take one, would you. I thought Alice was grating a banana then. Feel like I\u2019m through the looking glass. Anyone can make a chocolate cake,\u201d says Prue as if she didn\u2019t spend the better part of a month in Jamie\u2019s company. The nerve of her. Any cake is a chocolate cake if you chase it with a Twix It\u2019s not been his year though. Does Steph have this sewn up? Four Star Bakers makes her one of the strongest competitors ever. Or Alice, who is uderrated. Her fluster hides real grit. As long as her cakes don\u2019t hide real grit, she\u2019s got a real chance. David describes himself as the underdog, whilst looking like Clark Kent just took off his glasses. It doesn\u2019t add up. Like Muhammad Ali declaring \u201cI\u2019m the second or third best in the world!\u201d I\u2019m not the only one if so. \u201cAlice has let the stress of competition get to her\u201d makes it sound like she\u2019s backstage putting jam in her ears and humming the Ski Sunday theme. Wait did everyone hear that audio-description of scones during the credits or has my telly been restored to factory settings or has the jet lag driven me mad Oh, remember Jamie!? He was a silly horse, and we loved him so. Hope he is enjoying a sugarlump somewhere, and someone has turned him in the right direction to see the TV. OMG here we go! I\u2019m awake, I swear! Ooh yes, Mumof2girls. Good melancholy game. What will we all be doing this time next week? I\u2019m going to rue the day. But\u2013 twist\u2013 for a week I have just got off a 22 hour flight and feel like Christopher Nolan is workshopping ideas inside my cranium. So good luck to the contestants, but mainly to me. I\u2019m getting word in that the winner tonight is...Margaret Atwood! People are simultaneously delighted and outraged, and their bodies are exploding under the paradox. Seriously, gotta be Steph though, right? Lot of votes for David too I see. Slightly fewer of you think Alice will do it? Hahah, hello ID856- oh come on, give me a break Yes, David will come second. But who will win? Hi there, You\u2019re probably here for the cake, but can I interest you in a horn of glory, filled with cream of tension? That sounds horrible now I\u2019ve said it. Welcome to the only Great British Bake Off blog to still be playing top level competitions in its 30s, due to the regimented abuse of steroids. It is THE FINAL WEEK in the tent, which means tonight one of the bakers will be crowned champion. Will it be Steph? Or Alice, or David? Or Steph? I\u2019ll be writing up the highlights live, but the real action is below the line: do get involved with your own puns, gossip and conspiracy theories. The show starts at 8pm so for one last time, grab a snack and meet back here!",

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this review reveals the winner of the Great British Bake Off 2019. Do not read on if you have not watched the final.</em></p> <p>It was the twice-baked Stilton souffles that started the decline. Failing to rise to the occasion, and collapsing in a soggy heap, was Steph\u2019s fate \u2013 the souffl\u00e9s did the same. Going into the final of <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-great-british-bake-off/episode-guide\" title=\"\">The Great British Bake Off</a> (Channel 4), she \u2013 the four-time star baker \u2013 was the one to beat. Watching the prize slip from her floured hands, crestfallen under her fringe, was heartbreaking to watch. Even Paul Hollywood couldn\u2019t bear it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, alright?\u201d he said, comforting her after the only thing her showstopper stopped was her Bake Off-winning dreams. Of course it doesn\u2019t matter. But it also sort of does: this is the Great British Bake Off, cultural institution, a pick-me-up for troubled times, comfort food for the nation.</p> <p>Except this hasn\u2019t been my favourite Bake Off year \u2013 a splash of vinegar has been added to the recipe. It wasn\u2019t thrillingly dramatic to watch Steph come undone, it was uncomfortable, and the natural endpoint of a show that has become overly technical and stressful. Joy has not been liberally sprinkled, at least not since the jolly goth Helena \u2013 she of the octopus custard pie \u2013 was thrown out in a mean double eviction in week five. The judges\u2019 comments have become more withering, and the skits between presenters Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig more forced (please, no more jokes about the diminutive Toksvig hiding in a sack). The showstopper this week suddenly seemed well chosen: the bakers had to create food that, deceptively, looked like something else. I fear the show may be going the same way \u2013 all the pastel-coloured, cr\u00e8me pat-making elements are there on the outside, but inside there\u2019s a hint of curdling.</p> <p>The three bakers left \u2013 David, Alice and Steph \u2013 did deserve their places. David is so trim, I suspect he never eats the cake he makes. Neither, by all appearances, does his partner Nik. Having got to know the bakers over the past nine weeks, there is something really touching about seeing snippets of their home lives. Steph\u2019s mum hints at a tough time for her. There are videos of Alice baking as a child. Her parents, Jane and Henry, say they have always taught her the value of \u201cgood management\u201d. It is advice more suited to an appraisal than child-rearing, but I am going to remember it.</p> <p>The first challenge is \u2013 thankfully, simply \u2013 a chocolate cake. David does a good mirror glaze but \u2013 has he learned nothing during his time in the tent? \u2013 his Armagnac flavour is too much. Alice\u2019s looks a mess. \u201cMaybe it will taste nice?\u201d she says uncertainly. Steph\u2019s black forest gateau is \u201ca very nice cake\u201d, even though Prue Leith says it is \u201cvery 70s\u201d, as if this is a bad thing.</p> <p>There is a surreal moment when Paul and Prue pretend to freeze and fail to leave the tent before the start of the technical challenge. It is deeply weird, but also quite funny. The bakers have to make six stilton souffles; their faces drop. Toksvig is astonished at Alice\u2019s limited life experience: \u201cYou\u2019ve never made a roux?\u201d she asks, incredulous. Steph is struggling \u2013 she doesn\u2019t know a bain-marie needs hot water and her souffles are a puddle. The tears start, and then don\u2019t really stop: \u201cI just feel a bit stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like eating a sauce,\u201d says Prue.</p> <p>Then it is showstopper day but \u2013 disaster! \u2013 Alice\u2019s parents may not make it, as their flight from Dublin has been cancelled.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this review reveals the winner of the Great British Bake Off 2019. Do not read on if you have not watched the final. It was the twice-baked Stilton souffles that started the decline. Failing to rise to the occasion, and collapsing in a soggy heap, was Steph\u2019s fate \u2013 the souffl\u00e9s did the same. Going into the final of The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4), she \u2013 the four-time star baker \u2013 was the one to beat. Watching the prize slip from her floured hands, crestfallen under her fringe, was heartbreaking to watch. Even Paul Hollywood couldn\u2019t bear it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, alright?\u201d he said, comforting her after the only thing her showstopper stopped was her Bake Off-winning dreams. Of course it doesn\u2019t matter. But it also sort of does: this is the Great British Bake Off, cultural institution, a pick-me-up for troubled times, comfort food for the nation. Except this hasn\u2019t been my favourite Bake Off year \u2013 a splash of vinegar has been added to the recipe. It wasn\u2019t thrillingly dramatic to watch Steph come undone, it was uncomfortable, and the natural endpoint of a show that has become overly technical and stressful. Joy has not been liberally sprinkled, at least not since the jolly goth Helena \u2013 she of the octopus custard pie \u2013 was thrown out in a mean double eviction in week five. The judges\u2019 comments have become more withering, and the skits between presenters Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig more forced (please, no more jokes about the diminutive Toksvig hiding in a sack). The showstopper this week suddenly seemed well chosen: the bakers had to create food that, deceptively, looked like something else. I fear the show may be going the same way \u2013 all the pastel-coloured, cr\u00e8me pat-making elements are there on the outside, but inside there\u2019s a hint of curdling. The three bakers left \u2013 David, Alice and Steph \u2013 did deserve their places. David is so trim, I suspect he never eats the cake he makes. Neither, by all appearances, does his partner Nik. Having got to know the bakers over the past nine weeks, there is something really touching about seeing snippets of their home lives. Steph\u2019s mum hints at a tough time for her. There are videos of Alice baking as a child. Her parents, Jane and Henry, say they have always taught her the value of \u201cgood management\u201d. It is advice more suited to an appraisal than child-rearing, but I am going to remember it. The first challenge is \u2013 thankfully, simply \u2013 a chocolate cake. David does a good mirror glaze but \u2013 has he learned nothing during his time in the tent? \u2013 his Armagnac flavour is too much. Alice\u2019s looks a mess. \u201cMaybe it will taste nice?\u201d she says uncertainly. Steph\u2019s black forest gateau is \u201ca very nice cake\u201d, even though Prue Leith says it is \u201cvery 70s\u201d, as if this is a bad thing. There is a surreal moment when Paul and Prue pretend to freeze and fail to leave the tent before the start of the technical challenge. It is deeply weird, but also quite funny. The bakers have to make six stilton souffles; their faces drop. Toksvig is astonished at Alice\u2019s limited life experience: \u201cYou\u2019ve never made a roux?\u201d she asks, incredulous. Steph is struggling \u2013 she doesn\u2019t know a bain-marie needs hot water and her souffles are a puddle. The tears start, and then don\u2019t really stop: \u201cI just feel a bit stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like eating a sauce,\u201d says Prue. Then it is showstopper day but \u2013 disaster! \u2013 Alice\u2019s parents may not make it, as their flight from Dublin has been cancelled. More tears: \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine it without them.\u201d (She doesn\u2019t, however, mutter anything about \u201cgood management.\u201d) They have to make a \u201cpicnic\u201d of baked treats made to look like something else, using airbrushing and paintbrushes.

The move comes as the party\u2019s national executive committee prepares for a key meeting this week. Members of the body will decide whether all sitting MPs, including the NEC member Keith Vaz and the leftwing campaigner Chris Williamson, will be able to stand in the forthcoming vote. The meeting comes after Labour\u2019s decision on Tuesday to back a general election at the fourth time of asking after Jeremy Corbyn won out against the reticence of shadow cabinet colleagues to go to the polls in December. After ordering his MPs to abstain on Monday, when the prime minister sought to trigger a December election, Corbyn was applauded by his shadow cabinet as he gave a televised statement on Tuesday saying he was ready to campaign across the country. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely looking forward to going to every part of the country with my wonderful shadow cabinet team here and all the fantastic Labour activists to give a message of hope where there isn\u2019t one with this government,\u201d he said.

At the same time, we are frank about our differences with China. We are an open democracy. China is a Communist party state.

      "bodyText": "China must be held accountable for its human rights abuses domestically because \u201ccountries that respect and promote their citizens\u2019 rights at home tend also to be better international citizens\u201d, Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has said. In an uncompromising speech in Sydney likely to garner attention in Beijing, Payne said Australia must defend an international rules-based order in its own interests, but also that the world\u2019s multilateral institutions were no longer fit for purpose and needed reform. Payne said it was in Australia\u2019s national interests to speak out where it saw human rights being abused. \u201cSpeaking our minds does not constitute interfering in another country,\u201d she said. She cited Saudi Arabia over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Myanmarese military over its persecution of that country\u2019s Rohingya minority, and accused a \u201crevanchist\u201d Russia of being \u201cintent on disruption\u201d. But she noted China, as the emerging global superpower, for particular attention. \u201cWe have also addressed the treatment of the Uighur people in Xinjiang province in China. And I will continue to advocate strongly for fair and transparent treatment for Australians overseas, for example for Dr Yang Hengjun in China, who must receive the protections afforded by international human rights law. \u201cWe will not surprise any country by advocating consistently for human rights. It will remain part of our conversations, including with China, as our relationship with our Comprehensive Strategic Partner continues to evolve. We will remain constructive and respectful.\u201d Payne said Australia welcomed China\u2019s economic rise as a \u201cgreat and historic achievement\u201d. \u201cWe acknowledge that as a major power, China will seek influence regionally and globally. At the same time, we are frank about our differences with China. We are an open democracy. China is a Communist party state. We have very different political, economic and cultural systems, and values.\u201d Payne said it was in Australia\u2019s national interest to advocate for a global rules-based order that all countries adhered to, and that included advocacy for human rights everywhere. \u201cCountries that respect and promote their citizens\u2019 rights at home tend also to be better international citizens. \u201cThose whose governments are accountable to their people are less likely to cause their people unnecessary suffering through reckless actions abroad. They are less prone to corruption and better placed to foster innovation and business confidence, and are therefore economically more productive. \u201cThey produce wealthier societies with higher standards of living. And when you generate your own wealth, you don\u2019t need to take it from others.\u201d Payne\u2019s speech to the United States Studies Centre followed an address by prime minister Scott Morrison a fortnight ago, where he declared sovereign nations need to eschew an \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d and the world needs to avoid \u201cnegative globalism\u201d, echoing Donald Trump\u2019s speech to the United Nations declaring the future belonged to patriots, not globalists. Payne said nation-states were, and would remain, the building blocks of the global order, but conceded there existed now a broader range of newly empowered actors wielding global influence. She did not go as far as Morrison in decrying the effectiveness of global multilateral institutions, but argued that many of the rules and norms established after the second world war were outmoded, reflecting a cold war reality that had long passed. \u201cThe international system does need to modernise if it is to reflect the principles that we regard as being beneficial to Australia \u2013 and also to all nations,\u201d Payne said. \u201cThat means modernising some of the institutions that make up the global order, and some of the rules, to keep pace with changes in technology, changes in trade and in the global strategic balance.\u201d Payne said in a period of political and strategic uncertainty, Australia\u2019s alliance with the US was more important than ever, while conceding \u201csome Australians will query the approaches taken at times by the current administration\u201d. \u201cLet me simply say this: the US has a record unmatched in modern times of leading an international system aimed at benefitting all people, not just its own.\u201d Payne, who travels this week to the Solomon Islands \u2013 which recently switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2013 and Vanuatu, said Australia recognised the challenges facing the Pacific, in particular climate change. \u201cOur overarching concern is the preservation of freedom and sovereignty in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>General elections must be about the issues. The 1997 election was about 18 \u201cwasted\u201d years of Tory government, with Tony Blair\u2019s manifesto saying \u201c<a href=\"http://www.labour-party.org.uk/manifestos/1997/1997-labour-manifesto.shtml\" title=\"\">Britain deserves better</a>\u201d. In 1974 Edward Heath called an election seeking an answer to the question of <a href=\"https://hatfulofhistory.wordpress.com/2017/04/18/who-governs-britain-the-last-time-the-tories-called-a-snap-election/\" title=\"\">who governs Britain</a> \u2013 the prime minister or the unions. The answer the electorate returned was the unions. More often than not, politicians overestimate their ability to frame the terms of political debate. Theresa May reasoned that Brexit would be the issue in her snap election of 2017. It <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40630242\" title=\"\">dominated</a> voters\u2019 thoughts \u2013 but that did not help her. Boris Johnson might be on the verge of making a similar <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/shelagh-fogarty/professor-john-curtice-makes-surprising-prediction/\" title=\"\">mistake</a>.</p> <p>The prime minister has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/uk-general-election-confirmed-for-12-december-after-brexit-stalemate\" title=\"\">the election</a> he long sought, though there was a surly undercurrent of resistance in parliament not giving in to Mr Johnson. It could be seen in the number of MPs who wanted to lower the voting age to 16 and give citizens of EU countries the vote, both of which are <a href=\"https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/types-elections/scottish-parliament\" title=\"\">permitted</a> in Scotland\u2019s Holyrood elections. However, Mr Johnson persevered to foreshorten his mandate. He wants to weaponise the exhaustion that voters feel with the first stage of Brexit and shift blame to a \u201cremainer\u201d parliament for the delay. He hopes to stir apathy in his opponents\u2019 base. The election is to be held in December, the first since 1923. There\u2019s a reason why the month has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/bad-weather-postal-delays-lack-of-polling-staff-pose-winter-election-risks\" title=\"\">avoided</a> for national polls. Cold, dark nights are not the ideal conditions to go canvassing, or to get people to a rally or to a polling station, however important the issues facing the nation might be.</p> <p>Reckonings like this are an insult to voters. The prime minister has tried to manipulate opinion to give the impression that this election is for the benefit of the people, rather than for the benefit of himself and his party. Mr Johnson wasted time after attaining office by not talking to the EU. He then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">unlawfully</a> prorogued parliament to evade scrutiny. Mr Johnson came out with a set of proposals that were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/02/irish-officials-dismiss-boris-johnson-brexit-offer-as-unacceptable\" title=\"\">unacceptable</a> to Brussels before being swiftly amended. There was no way MPs would permit Britain to be bundled out of the EU with no deal or on terms that threaten jobs, the economy, peace in Northern Ireland or the union with Scotland. The courts and MPs did not allow the prime minister to disregard proper procedure \u2013 to their credit, because a future government could use the precedent established for more sinister purposes. Mr Johnson does not care about such things. His calculations revolve around naked self-interest and power.</p> <p>Democracy should be about more than cynical calculation. Forcing the country to go through an exercise that there is little <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-50206341\" title=\"\">enthusiasm</a> for is a way of feeding the distaste for politics that Brexiters <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/07/18/restoring-faith-politics-begins-delivering-brexit/\" title=\"\">often</a> rail against.

      "bodyText": "General elections must be about the issues. The 1997 election was about 18 \u201cwasted\u201d years of Tory government, with Tony Blair\u2019s manifesto saying \u201cBritain deserves better\u201d. In 1974 Edward Heath called an election seeking an answer to the question of who governs Britain \u2013 the prime minister or the unions. The answer the electorate returned was the unions. More often than not, politicians overestimate their ability to frame the terms of political debate. Theresa May reasoned that Brexit would be the issue in her snap election of 2017. It dominated voters\u2019 thoughts \u2013 but that did not help her. Boris Johnson might be on the verge of making a similar mistake. The prime minister has the election he long sought, though there was a surly undercurrent of resistance in parliament not giving in to Mr Johnson. It could be seen in the number of MPs who wanted to lower the voting age to 16 and give citizens of EU countries the vote, both of which are permitted in Scotland\u2019s Holyrood elections. However, Mr Johnson persevered to foreshorten his mandate. He wants to weaponise the exhaustion that voters feel with the first stage of Brexit and shift blame to a \u201cremainer\u201d parliament for the delay. He hopes to stir apathy in his opponents\u2019 base. The election is to be held in December, the first since 1923. There\u2019s a reason why the month has been avoided for national polls. Cold, dark nights are not the ideal conditions to go canvassing, or to get people to a rally or to a polling station, however important the issues facing the nation might be. Reckonings like this are an insult to voters. The prime minister has tried to manipulate opinion to give the impression that this election is for the benefit of the people, rather than for the benefit of himself and his party. Mr Johnson wasted time after attaining office by not talking to the EU. He then unlawfully prorogued parliament to evade scrutiny. Mr Johnson came out with a set of proposals that were unacceptable to Brussels before being swiftly amended. There was no way MPs would permit Britain to be bundled out of the EU with no deal or on terms that threaten jobs, the economy, peace in Northern Ireland or the union with Scotland. The courts and MPs did not allow the prime minister to disregard proper procedure \u2013 to their credit, because a future government could use the precedent established for more sinister purposes. Mr Johnson does not care about such things. His calculations revolve around naked self-interest and power. Democracy should be about more than cynical calculation. Forcing the country to go through an exercise that there is little enthusiasm for is a way of feeding the distaste for politics that Brexiters often rail against. MPs voted for Brexit last week in the shape of the withdrawal agreement bill. Mr Johnson could have pushed ahead to get this deal through the Commons. But that would have been beyond the political skills of the Tory leader, who lacks the intellectual grace to accommodate the diversity of his opponents\u2019 views. Instead the prime minister, whose political career has been marked by untruths and evasions, hopes to fight a dirty election aided by the propaganda he can mobilise on platforms like Facebook that allow lies in political advertising. Brexit will be central to the campaign. This ought to surprise no one. Dealing with the tension between the plebiscitary demand to leave the EU and the parliamentary urge to hammer out the least damaging Brexit compromise will remain the biggest task for the next government. Yet plenty of other issues are going to be foregrounded: the economy, inequality, and austerity. On the right, it seems that leading figures such as Mr Johnson and Nigel Farage scare and repel sections of the electorate. Opposing them are politicians whom many voters tell pollsters they don\u2019t like or trust. If this does not make you giddy, then prepare for the whirl while history is being made.",

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives have restored the party whip to 10 of the 21 rebel MPs who were ejected in September after they voted to support a backbench-instigated bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit, the party has said. A Conservative spokesman said the MPs restored to the whip were Alistair Burt, Caroline Nokes, Greg Clark, Nicholas Soames, Ed Vaizey, Margot James, Richard Benyon, Stephen Hammond, Steve Brine and Richard Harrington. Of these, Burt, Benyon, Soames and Harrington have already announced they will stand down at the election, but the others will be free to seek re-election as Conservatives, subject to agreement of their local parties. The spokesman said the 10 met Boris Johnson at the prime minister\u2019s Commons office on Tuesday evening, after a process led by party whips. He gave no reason why these 10 had been picked, or what could be done by the remaining 10 also be readmitted. One, Sam Gyimah, has since defected to the Liberal Democrats. The deciding factor appeared not to have been recent loyalty, given that Harrington was among MPs who had voted against the government\u2019s compressed Commons timetable for its Brexit bill, which stalled the process. In contrast, the former justice secretary David Gauke, who supported the programme motion, remains exiled. The Conservative spokesman declined to explain this, saying the decision came after a procedure led by whips. It did not mean those still outside the party system could not be readmitted, \u201cbut there is clearly a process\u201d for them to go through, he added. Asked if the restoration of the whip was conditional on future loyalty on Brexit, the spokesman said: \u201cThe expectation of all Tory MPs and candidates who are standing for election is that when we come back we will get this deal passed.\u201d The expulsion of the 21 Tory rebels not only lost Johnson his working majority but caused significant disquiet among many other MPs, who feared it meant the Conservatives were being reshaped as a less centrist force. Speaking earlier on Tuesday, the former chancellor Philip Hammond \u2013 among those still without the whip \u2013 said he feared Johnson wanted to use an election to remove MPs such as him from the Commons. He told the BBC: \u201cI fear that the real narrative here is that the Vote Leave activists \u2013 the cohort that has seized control in Downing Street and to some extent in the headquarters of the Conservative party \u2013 want this general election to change the shape of the Conservative party in parliament.

It seems like things have come full circle for Eddie Jones because he was a World Cup winner with the Springboks 12 years ago and his England side are following the same blueprint as they look to defeat South Africa on Saturday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/29/england-fined-new-zealand-haka-world-cup\">England fined for V-shaped formation facing New Zealand\u2019s haka</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The hallmarks are so similar - comfortable with little possession, prioritise territory, rely on a strong kicking game, decent set-piece and a strong defence. A quick look at the statistics back it up. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/15/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20078\" title=\"\">South Africa beat England 36-0</a> in the pool stages in 2007, they made 52 carries compared with England\u2019s 90. They made 40 fewer passes than England and kicked from hand more often. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/21/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup200710\" title=\"\">In the final </a>England made 43 more passes, nearly twice the amount of metres, but ended up on the losing side. In that pool match it was a culmination of control and very good defence. When you look at the teams who are in the World Cup final, when you describe their DNAs, it would be defence, set piece and physicality. That was everything that South Africa were in 2007, when Jones was assistant coach, and it is everything in which England pride themselves in 2019.</p> \n<p>I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say Eddie has actively sought to model his England side on the 2007 Springboks but like so many professional sportspeople, muscle memory is an important part of his armoury and I feel like that is what has happened.

      "bodyText": "I look at this England side and I see so many similarities with the South Africa team who won the World Cup in 2007. It seems like things have come full circle for Eddie Jones because he was a World Cup winner with the Springboks 12 years ago and his England side are following the same blueprint as they look to defeat South Africa on Saturday. The hallmarks are so similar - comfortable with little possession, prioritise territory, rely on a strong kicking game, decent set-piece and a strong defence. A quick look at the statistics back it up. When South Africa beat England 36-0 in the pool stages in 2007, they made 52 carries compared with England\u2019s 90. They made 40 fewer passes than England and kicked from hand more often. In the final England made 43 more passes, nearly twice the amount of metres, but ended up on the losing side. In that pool match it was a culmination of control and very good defence. When you look at the teams who are in the World Cup final, when you describe their DNAs, it would be defence, set piece and physicality. That was everything that South Africa were in 2007, when Jones was assistant coach, and it is everything in which England pride themselves in 2019. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say Eddie has actively sought to model his England side on the 2007 Springboks but like so many professional sportspeople, muscle memory is an important part of his armoury and I feel like that is what has happened. Organically, he has gone back to what he feels has worked. Whether it be intentional, whether he predicted this was the way the game was going to be played \u2013 he often talks about trying to get ahead of the curve in that sense \u2013 but we\u2019ve discovered the new trend is actually the old trend.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 30 October.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Brian Houston, the founder of Hillsong church, refused to be interviewed by New South Wales police about his father\u2019s child abuse confessions,</strong> shortly after which an investigation was nearly abandoned due to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/30/hillsong-founder-brian-houston-refused-to-answer-questions-over-fathers-child-abuse-police-told-mps\">lack of sufficient evidence</a>, parliamentary documents reveal. NSW police confirmed last month the investigation was still open, following reporting from the Wall Street Journal that prime minister Scott Morrison had wanted Houston to attend a state dinner at the White House but the Trump administration rejected the proposal. Houston\u2019s father Frank confessed in late 1999 to his son that he had committed child abuse, after a victim, Brett Sengstock, reported the abuse which occurred in the 60s and 70s to the Australian Christian Churches. At the time Brian Houston was the national president.</p> <p><strong>Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, faced the anger of members of US Congress in Washington on Tuesday,</strong> over the failure of the aircraft maker and US regulators to identify and correct flaws in the design of the 737 Max jet that led to two crashes, killing 346. At the hearing, Connecticut Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/29/boeing-dennis-muilenburg-congress-testimony-737-max-mcas\"> sharply accused Boeing of engaging in \u201ca pattern of deliberate concealment\u201d</a>, noting that Boeing\u2019s 1,600-page pilot\u2019s manual mentions the so-called MCAS anti-stall system just once. Blumenthal accused Muilenberg and Boeing of supplying \u201cflying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding to conceal MCAS from pilots\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Four hundred million litres of fresh water is flowing out to sea from storage in drought-afflicted Queensland every day,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/30/coalition-anger-as-dam-water-flows-out-to-sea-in-drought-hit-queensland\">sparking a fresh rift</a> between Coalition MPs and the state\u2019s Labor government. As the federal government considers a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/some-councils-with-fewer-than-350-residents-given-25m-drought-funding\">fresh round of drought measures</a> to respond to the record dry spell, the Queensland government has angered federal MPs by releasing more than 100,000 megalitres of water from the Paradise dam over a 10-week period. The controversial decision was taken to reduce the dam to 42% capacity because of concerns over its structural integrity in the event of a flood. But after reaching \u201cfull supply capacity\u201d of the water storage system on Monday, the operator of the government-owned dam, Sunwater, has begun releasing 400 megalitres of freshwater out to sea each day from a barrage near Bundaberg.</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p><strong>The Morrison government has quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with new ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions</strong> and given it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/coalition-scrambles-for-carbon-cutting-solutions-as-paris-targets-move-further-out-of-reach\">less than a month</a> to come up with recommendations.</p> <p><strong>The voice to parliament co-design process will kick off today,</strong> with the new phase to be led by the prominent Indigenous leaders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/30/marcia-langton-and-tom-calma-to-lead-indigenous-voice-advisory-group\">Tom Calma and Marcia Langton</a>.</p> <p><strong>Some of Australia\u2019s richest people have successfully lobbied the Australian Taxation Office for a year\u2019s delay</strong> before businesses they own have to confess to the authority about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/30/tax-office-agrees-to-years-delay-for-some-big-companies-to-own-up-to-tax-problems\">potential tax problems</a>.</p> <p><strong>Private health insurance reforms introduced by the federal government have been undermined by industry lobbying. </strong>The reforms were meant to to make the policies easier for consumers to understand.

With the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party preparing to support a one-line bill tabled by Boris Johnson\u2019s government later on Tuesday, triggering an early poll, Corbyn said his party would also vote for it. The Labour leader told the shadow cabinet: \u201cI have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 30 October. Top stories Brian Houston, the founder of Hillsong church, refused to be interviewed by New South Wales police about his father\u2019s child abuse confessions, shortly after which an investigation was nearly abandoned due to a lack of sufficient evidence, parliamentary documents reveal. NSW police confirmed last month the investigation was still open, following reporting from the Wall Street Journal that prime minister Scott Morrison had wanted Houston to attend a state dinner at the White House but the Trump administration rejected the proposal. Houston\u2019s father Frank confessed in late 1999 to his son that he had committed child abuse, after a victim, Brett Sengstock, reported the abuse which occurred in the 60s and 70s to the Australian Christian Churches. At the time Brian Houston was the national president. Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, faced the anger of members of US Congress in Washington on Tuesday, over the failure of the aircraft maker and US regulators to identify and correct flaws in the design of the 737 Max jet that led to two crashes, killing 346. At the hearing, Connecticut Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal sharply accused Boeing of engaging in \u201ca pattern of deliberate concealment\u201d, noting that Boeing\u2019s 1,600-page pilot\u2019s manual mentions the so-called MCAS anti-stall system just once. Blumenthal accused Muilenberg and Boeing of supplying \u201cflying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding to conceal MCAS from pilots\u201d. Four hundred million litres of fresh water is flowing out to sea from storage in drought-afflicted Queensland every day, sparking a fresh rift between Coalition MPs and the state\u2019s Labor government. As the federal government considers a fresh round of drought measures to respond to the record dry spell, the Queensland government has angered federal MPs by releasing more than 100,000 megalitres of water from the Paradise dam over a 10-week period. The controversial decision was taken to reduce the dam to 42% capacity because of concerns over its structural integrity in the event of a flood. But after reaching \u201cfull supply capacity\u201d of the water storage system on Monday, the operator of the government-owned dam, Sunwater, has begun releasing 400 megalitres of freshwater out to sea each day from a barrage near Bundaberg. Australia The Morrison government has quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with new ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and given it less than a month to come up with recommendations. The voice to parliament co-design process will kick off today, with the new phase to be led by the prominent Indigenous leaders Tom Calma and Marcia Langton. Some of Australia\u2019s richest people have successfully lobbied the Australian Taxation Office for a year\u2019s delay before businesses they own have to confess to the authority about potential tax problems. Private health insurance reforms introduced by the federal government have been undermined by industry lobbying. The reforms were meant to to make the policies easier for consumers to understand. But according to health policy experts the system is as confusing as it ever was. The world Jeremy Corbyn has announced that Labour is ready to back a general election now that the EU has granted a three-month Brexit delay, making a pre-Christmas UK poll all but certain. With the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party preparing to support a one-line bill tabled by Boris Johnson\u2019s government later on Tuesday, triggering an early poll, Corbyn said his party would also vote for it. The Labour leader told the shadow cabinet: \u201cI have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table. We have now heard from the EU that the extension of article 50 to 31 January has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met.\u201d Hours later, the early election passed what may be its final major hurdle after amendments to an election bill seeking to extend the franchise to 16- and 17-year-olds and EU nationals were not selected for voting. Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Saad Hariri, has announced his resignation. Over the past fortnight Hariri has tabled reforms including the abolition of several cabinet positions and some cuts to spending, but the moves have fallen short of the structural changes demanded by protesters. Alexander Vindman, an army lieutenant colonel and the top Ukraine expert, will testify today. He is expected to tell US Congress that a July phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, caused him to raise an internal alarm. The testimony could weigh heavily in the impeachment inquiry. Read his opening statement here.

That\u2019s the sadness of it.\u201d The Rev Bouier pointed out that many people in need of food in the US are employed, but with wages so low they don\u2019t cover the bills. She said it was evil that someone who had once held public office could laugh about that fact. \u201cFor this community, any community in America to be without food and water, to constantly have to live with housing insecurity or water insecurity. It\u2019s so utterly ridiculous. It\u2019s so evil. It is evil in and of itself.\u201d She added that the former governor, despite being from a \u201cmore affluent area\u201d, would have people starving in his constituency, too: \u201cThat tells you how disconnected he is, from the people in his own community. I promise you that someone in his community will exist on the margins of society. We know that to be true all over the US.\u201d According to local reports, during Sanders\u2019 visit, he heard speeches from local students who had campaigned to get clean water in their schools, after realizing that the water they were drinking was contaminated with lead. Sanders called out corporate greed in his speech at the pantry, lamenting a system that allows tax breaks for billionaires while the poor go hungry. He said: \u201cHere in this campaign, we hear the word socialism a lot. Well, what this is a perfect example of is socialism for billionaires, massive amounts of subsidies and tax breaks \u2026 But for children, there\u2019s not enough money for a decent education and for poor people, there\u2019s not an ability to get clean drinking water.\u201d One in nine Americans lives with insecure access to food. In Wisconsin, where Walker was formerly governor, one in five children live with food insecurity.",

      "body": "<h2>Why was a public inquiry set up?</h2> <p>The morning after the fire, Theresa May announced an inquiry because families were \u201cowed an explanation\u201d. She picked the retired high court judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick and they agreed he would investigate the fire\u2019s cause and spread, how the building came to be so combustible, the fitness of building regulations and the response of the fire brigade as well as that of central and local government. However, Moore-Bick did not want it consider \u201cquestions of a social, economic and political nature\u201d and May agreed.</p> <h2>Doesn\u2019t that miss a huge part of the story?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/26/grenfell-survivors-fear-inquiry-judge-will-side-with-establishment\">Many core participants in the inquiry believe so</a>. Survivors say that before the fire they endured \u201cinstitutional indifference\u201d from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), which owns Grenfell Tower, and claim this was rooted in a class divide in the UK\u2019s richest borough. Firefighters, meanwhile, said the London fire brigade\u2019s unpreparedness resulted from decades of deregulation and decentralisation of fire safety as well as austerity. The LFB budget was cut by \u00a3100m over the decade to 2017. May and Moore-Bick argued a wider remit would make the inquiry too slow. In the end. the first phase of the inquiry took 26 months and the second phase may not conclude until 2022 - five years on.</p> <h2>Why is the inquiry split into two parts?</h2> <p>Moore-Bick originally said he wanted to determine what happened on 14 June 2017 \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d in order to suggest changes that would safeguard other high rise residents. He wrongly reckoned he could do this by April 2018; on that timetable, he is now 18 months late. Changes to fire safety have already been introduced regardless of his recommendations. Some also believe it is wrong to criticise the response to the fire before understanding why the building was so combustible. That will form the basis of the second phase, starting in early 2020.</p> <h2>Who is unhappy about that decision?</h2> <p>The firefighters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/29/grenfell-inquiry-accused-of-focusing-on-junior-firefighters\">claim they are being scapegoated</a> by coming first. The Fire Brigades Union has described the situation as unjust and rank-and-file firefighters across the UK are furious. Those at Trowbridge fire station in Wiltshire tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to comprehend how individual fire officers (who risked their lives for others at Grenfell) are the focus of criticism, however those responsible for years of deregulation and budget cuts fail to fall under the same scrutiny.\u201d Survivors are also frustrated the sequencing means there might be no rulings on the behaviour of the corporate entities they believe bear most responsibility until 2022.</p> <h2>What will the second phase determine?</h2> <p>Thousands of documents about the \u00a310m refurbishment of the tower using combustible materials have already been disclosed to the inquiry. It must find out how RBKC made decisions and examine the roles of contractors Rydon and Harley Facades, the architects Studio E, and the makers of the cladding materials including multinationals Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan. It will be high stakes, drawn out and lawyers from all sides will be in abundance, not least because detectives from Scotland Yard are watching closely. They are investigating possible manslaughter and corporate manslaughter and are delaying sending evidence to prosecutors until the second phase is complete. The inquiry will also return to the firefighting operation and \u201cquestion those who are responsible at the highest level\u201d.</p> <h2>How is Moore-Bick approaching the inquiry?</h2> <p>His exhaustive approach to evidence gathering is time-consuming. The copious paper trail about the refurbishment will find him in his comfort zone as a former commercial court judge. But his unwillingness to consider the broader issues is angering many. While kind and sympathetic, he is also seen as patrician and out-of-touch. Survivors and bereaved have often been frustrated at the inquiry\u2019s distant approach and a lack of communication. They had to fight for months to get the inquiry moved out of London\u2019s legal district and closer to their homes.</p>",

Survivors say that before the fire they endured \u201cinstitutional indifference\u201d from the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC), which owns Grenfell Tower, and claim this was rooted in a class divide in the UK\u2019s richest borough. Firefighters, meanwhile, said the London fire brigade\u2019s unpreparedness resulted from decades of deregulation and decentralisation of fire safety as well as austerity. The LFB budget was cut by \u00a3100m over the decade to 2017. May and Moore-Bick argued a wider remit would make the inquiry too slow. In the end. the first phase of the inquiry took 26 months and the second phase may not conclude until 2022 - five years on. Why is the inquiry split into two parts? Moore-Bick originally said he wanted to determine what happened on 14 June 2017 \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d in order to suggest changes that would safeguard other high rise residents. He wrongly reckoned he could do this by April 2018; on that timetable, he is now 18 months late. Changes to fire safety have already been introduced regardless of his recommendations. Some also believe it is wrong to criticise the response to the fire before understanding why the building was so combustible. That will form the basis of the second phase, starting in early 2020. Who is unhappy about that decision? The firefighters claim they are being scapegoated by coming first. The Fire Brigades Union has described the situation as unjust and rank-and-file firefighters across the UK are furious. Those at Trowbridge fire station in Wiltshire tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to comprehend how individual fire officers (who risked their lives for others at Grenfell) are the focus of criticism, however those responsible for years of deregulation and budget cuts fail to fall under the same scrutiny.\u201d Survivors are also frustrated the sequencing means there might be no rulings on the behaviour of the corporate entities they believe bear most responsibility until 2022. What will the second phase determine? Thousands of documents about the \u00a310m refurbishment of the tower using combustible materials have already been disclosed to the inquiry. It must find out how RBKC made decisions and examine the roles of contractors Rydon and Harley Facades, the architects Studio E, and the makers of the cladding materials including multinationals Arconic, Celotex and Kingspan. It will be high stakes, drawn out and lawyers from all sides will be in abundance, not least because detectives from Scotland Yard are watching closely. They are investigating possible manslaughter and corporate manslaughter and are delaying sending evidence to prosecutors until the second phase is complete. The inquiry will also return to the firefighting operation and \u201cquestion those who are responsible at the highest level\u201d. How is Moore-Bick approaching the inquiry? His exhaustive approach to evidence gathering is time-consuming. The copious paper trail about the refurbishment will find him in his comfort zone as a former commercial court judge. But his unwillingness to consider the broader issues is angering many. While kind and sympathetic, he is also seen as patrician and out-of-touch. Survivors and bereaved have often been frustrated at the inquiry\u2019s distant approach and a lack of communication. They had to fight for months to get the inquiry moved out of London\u2019s legal district and closer to their homes.",

Many of M&amp;S\u2019s rivals, including H&amp;M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shopper, including families with young children.</p> <p>M&amp;S said its customers were increasingly looking for ways to spread the cost, particularly of larger purchases. The Clearpay service enables customers to spread the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is \u00a3800 and does not require a credit application and customers can manage their payments through a phone app.</p> <p>Unlike traditional high street credit products. these fintech firms typically make money by earning commission on the sales transaction itself rather than charging shoppers interest, although some also offer interest-bearing products.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer will start offering a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service on its website next month as it tries to attract younger customers and boost trade going into the key Christmas period. The retailer has teamed up with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders of more than \u00a330 in interest-free instalments. The Australian firm and its better known rival Klarna are among a wave of fintech companies being embraced by millennials on tight budgets. Many of M&amp;S\u2019s rivals, including H&amp;M and Asos, already offer delayed payment services and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shopper, including families with young children. M&amp;S said its customers were increasingly looking for ways to spread the cost, particularly of larger purchases. The Clearpay service enables customers to spread the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is \u00a3800 and does not require a credit application and customers can manage their payments through a phone app. Unlike traditional high street credit products. these fintech firms typically make money by earning commission on the sales transaction itself rather than charging shoppers interest, although some also offer interest-bearing products. Shoppers using the plans typically spend more, more often, making it an attractive proposition for a retailer such as M&amp;S where clothing sales are in decline. More than 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports and Boohoo, work with Klarna which says it is more than 3 million British customers. Clearpay, which only launched in the UK three months ago, says it had gained more than 200,000 active customers in the first 15 weeks of trading. Not everyone is a fan, though. Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of retailer Next, suggests that this form of credit might be dangerous. \u201cThere is a difference between spreading the cost and just deferring it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very high bar for new [credit] products and we\u2019re struggling with buy now, pay later.\u201d Sue Anderson of the debt charity Stepchange said it was possible that these payment plans could encourage people to spend money they so not have. \u201cThe services are presented to consumers as a major convenience and an opportunity to \u2018try before you buy\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the knock-on consequence can be that people take on credit when they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>John Harris is absolutely right to highlight housing problems as central to debates about politics and society and to stress the need for more and better public housing as a crucial part of everyone having a decent place to live (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/28/housing-crisis-houses-brexit-vote?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">The anxieties dividing the nation begin with housing</a>, 28 October).</p> <p>But the housing shortage that forces people to remain in unsuitable or substandard housing, or drives them into homelessness, is just one side of the coin; the other is the expectation that buying property is a one-way, sure-fire bet that delivers exceptional return on investment. Clearly this only happens because the housing market is rigged by various ways of limiting supply and because of the tax incentives given to homeowners and landlords.</p> <p>Attitudes are unlikely to change until politicians of all persuasions are prepared to be open and honest with the public that they cannot have the cake of windfall gains for property owners as well as the eating of it in an adequate supply of affordable housing. Real political leadership would include helping people to understand that their individual gains from the status quo are more than offset by the consequences for their children and their communities.</p> <p>While Labour\u2019s plans for housing are ambitious and creative, they don\u2019t seem to be challenging the current mindset, although it\u2019s hard to find a better practical illustration of how and why the economy should work for the many rather than the few.<br><strong>Ian Bretman</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 John Harris says \u201cif we built the houses we needed, the sense of a population often terrified of the future would recede\u201d. In doing so, he falls for the development lobby\u2019s continuing disinformation.</p> <p>We already have the houses we need. There is a surplus of more than a million houses over households in England, according to the <a href=\"https://housingevidence.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/20190820b-CaCHE-Housing-Supply-FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">UK Collaborative Centre for Housing Evidence</a>. The problem \u2013 lack of affordability \u2013 is caused by low interest rates, snowballing inherited property wealth and the outrageous help-to-buy programme, which has pushed prices well beyond mortgageable reach of the unendowed. Building more wouldn\u2019t change that if, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/tackling-the-uk-housing-crisis/\" title=\"\">as academic studies suggest</a>, 300,000 new homes annually in England over the next 20 years would only lower prices by about 10%. More crucially, developers won\u2019t increase supply to the point where they have to drop prices; they simply lobby for more planning consents to get more bankable assets.</p> <p>The real need is for more efficient use of the existing stock, which could be brought about by a retargeting of council tax to favour the main homes of UK taxpayers, with higher rates for all others, and penal and escalating rates for property left empty. That would soften prices, but it cannot be stated often enough that the issue is homes, not investments. <br><strong>John Worrall</strong><br><em>Cromer, Norfolk</em></p> <p>\u2022 Time and time again, research by the Campaign to Protect Rural England has found that those most in need of affordable housing are overlooked by a profit-driven housing market. Our recent report <a href=\"https://www.cpre.org.uk/resources/housing-and-planning/green-belts/item/5189-space-to-breathe\" title=\"\">Space to Breathe</a> found that only 10% of homes built on greenfield land released from the green belt over the last 10 years were for \u201caffordable\u201d homes, despite this being cited as an argument to release this valuable asset.</p> <p>Last year, Oliver Letwin led a review to tackle barriers to building which called for a reformed planning system led by local communities.

      "bodyText": "John Harris is absolutely right to highlight housing problems as central to debates about politics and society and to stress the need for more and better public housing as a crucial part of everyone having a decent place to live (The anxieties dividing the nation begin with housing, 28 October). But the housing shortage that forces people to remain in unsuitable or substandard housing, or drives them into homelessness, is just one side of the coin; the other is the expectation that buying property is a one-way, sure-fire bet that delivers exceptional return on investment. Clearly this only happens because the housing market is rigged by various ways of limiting supply and because of the tax incentives given to homeowners and landlords. Attitudes are unlikely to change until politicians of all persuasions are prepared to be open and honest with the public that they cannot have the cake of windfall gains for property owners as well as the eating of it in an adequate supply of affordable housing. Real political leadership would include helping people to understand that their individual gains from the status quo are more than offset by the consequences for their children and their communities. While Labour\u2019s plans for housing are ambitious and creative, they don\u2019t seem to be challenging the current mindset, although it\u2019s hard to find a better practical illustration of how and why the economy should work for the many rather than the few. Ian Bretman London \u2022 John Harris says \u201cif we built the houses we needed, the sense of a population often terrified of the future would recede\u201d. In doing so, he falls for the development lobby\u2019s continuing disinformation. We already have the houses we need. There is a surplus of more than a million houses over households in England, according to the UK Collaborative Centre for Housing Evidence. The problem \u2013 lack of affordability \u2013 is caused by low interest rates, snowballing inherited property wealth and the outrageous help-to-buy programme, which has pushed prices well beyond mortgageable reach of the unendowed. Building more wouldn\u2019t change that if, as academic studies suggest, 300,000 new homes annually in England over the next 20 years would only lower prices by about 10%. More crucially, developers won\u2019t increase supply to the point where they have to drop prices; they simply lobby for more planning consents to get more bankable assets. The real need is for more efficient use of the existing stock, which could be brought about by a retargeting of council tax to favour the main homes of UK taxpayers, with higher rates for all others, and penal and escalating rates for property left empty. That would soften prices, but it cannot be stated often enough that the issue is homes, not investments. John Worrall Cromer, Norfolk \u2022 Time and time again, research by the Campaign to Protect Rural England has found that those most in need of affordable housing are overlooked by a profit-driven housing market. Our recent report Space to Breathe found that only 10% of homes built on greenfield land released from the green belt over the last 10 years were for \u201caffordable\u201d homes, despite this being cited as an argument to release this valuable asset. Last year, Oliver Letwin led a review to tackle barriers to building which called for a reformed planning system led by local communities. Ultimately we need homes to be commissioned by local communities, not built speculatively by developers, who will always put profit ahead of people\u2019s needs. That\u2019s why CPRE supports the National Housing Federation\u2019s call for the government to invest in building 145,000 new social homes every year, with an appropriate portion for rural areas. Tom Fyans Deputy chief executive, CPRE \u2022 John Harris makes some excellent points about the importance of housing and community, highlighting the lack of properly affordable, well-designed homes. But why is it that rising house prices are always framed as a good news story across the press?

      "body": "<p>My friend Ann Groves, who has died aged 84, gave a lifetime of service to the community in Harrow, north-west London, where she was born.</p> <p>Thwarted in her early ambitions, like many women of her generation, she used her talents as a shop steward, a magistrate, a councillor and chair of numerous organisations. She was a feminist and a fighter against oppression and discrimination.</p> <p>Ann was the daughter of Edmund Gimblett, a grocer, and his wife, Lily (nee Lawley). Educated at Pinner grammar school, Ann had a great passion for books and the theatre. She won a place at Rada at 16, but her father would not allow her to go. Refusing to be daunted, she took up amateur dramatics instead. Her first job was with WH Smith, delivering books, sometimes to famous people such as the comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/03/frankie-howerd-on-campus\" title=\"\">Frankie Howerd</a>.</p> <p>She had a daughter, Helen, during her brief marriage to James Groves. To support her child, Ann had to go out to work full-time and began in the offices of the Kodak factory in Wealdstone in 1961. She soon became a shop steward with the Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union and joined the Labour party. With the arrival of computers, she seized the opportunity to become a programmer. She worked at Kodak for 30 years. For 25 years she was also a magistrate.</p> <p>Ann had a great belief in the power of education to fulfil young people\u2019s potential and transform lives. She was a governor of Marlborough primary school in Harrow for 45 years and fought and won a fierce campaign against its closure in the early 1980s.</p> <p>She was elected to Harrow borough council in 1990 and devoted her energies to the cause of education. In 1999 she became mayor and served during the millennium year. In 2005 she received the National Merit award for excellent service to the Labour party, from Tony Blair, the then prime minister.</p> <p>After 16 years as a councillor she stood down and turned her attentions to the many local organisations with which she had developed connections. Age Concern, Harrow Alzheimer\u2019s Society, Harrow Association of Disabled People and Harrow Women\u2019s Centre were some of the bodies she chaired.</p> <p>Her skill at running meetings was formidable, but she was never just a holder of offices \u2013 she got things done.</p> <p>She is survived by Helen, and her grandchildren, Dylan and Matilda.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend Ann Groves, who has died aged 84, gave a lifetime of service to the community in Harrow, north-west London, where she was born. Thwarted in her early ambitions, like many women of her generation, she used her talents as a shop steward, a magistrate, a councillor and chair of numerous organisations. She was a feminist and a fighter against oppression and discrimination. Ann was the daughter of Edmund Gimblett, a grocer, and his wife, Lily (nee Lawley). Educated at Pinner grammar school, Ann had a great passion for books and the theatre. She won a place at Rada at 16, but her father would not allow her to go. Refusing to be daunted, she took up amateur dramatics instead. Her first job was with WH Smith, delivering books, sometimes to famous people such as the comedian Frankie Howerd. She had a daughter, Helen, during her brief marriage to James Groves. To support her child, Ann had to go out to work full-time and began in the offices of the Kodak factory in Wealdstone in 1961. She soon became a shop steward with the Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union and joined the Labour party. With the arrival of computers, she seized the opportunity to become a programmer. She worked at Kodak for 30 years. For 25 years she was also a magistrate. Ann had a great belief in the power of education to fulfil young people\u2019s potential and transform lives. She was a governor of Marlborough primary school in Harrow for 45 years and fought and won a fierce campaign against its closure in the early 1980s. She was elected to Harrow borough council in 1990 and devoted her energies to the cause of education. In 1999 she became mayor and served during the millennium year. In 2005 she received the National Merit award for excellent service to the Labour party, from Tony Blair, the then prime minister. After 16 years as a councillor she stood down and turned her attentions to the many local organisations with which she had developed connections. Age Concern, Harrow Alzheimer\u2019s Society, Harrow Association of Disabled People and Harrow Women\u2019s Centre were some of the bodies she chaired. Her skill at running meetings was formidable, but she was never just a holder of offices \u2013 she got things done. She is survived by Helen, and her grandchildren, Dylan and Matilda.",

Boeing was accused of putting profits over safety and developing a cosy relationship with regulators that permitted the company to rush the 737 Max, Boeing\u2019s most profitable model, into service. \u201cBoth of these accidents were entirely avoidable,\u201d the Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, a Republican, said. \u201cWe cannot fathom the pain experienced by the families of those 346 souls who were lost.\u201d Last week, an Indonesian report into the Lion Air crash criticized the design of the anti-stall system that left pilots fighting for control, as well as \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the flight crew\u2019s communication and manual control of the aircraft. The Ethiopian Airlines crash led to the grounding of the aircraft. That decision is estimated to have cost Boeing as much as $9bn. At the hearing, the Connecticut Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal sharply accused Boeing of engaging in \u201ca pattern of deliberate concealment\u201d, noting that Boeing\u2019s 1,600-page pilot\u2019s manual mentions the so-called MCAS anti-stall system just once. Blumenthal accused Muilenberg and Boeing of supplying \u201cflying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding to conceal MCAS from pilots\u201d. At issue are recently disclosed internal instant messages that Boeing had not previously handed to committee investigators. The messages, sent by Boeing\u2019s chief test pilot Mark Forkner in 2016, complained of \u201cegregious\u201d erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of the MCAS system, and referred to \u201cJedi mind tricks\u201d to persuade regulators to approve the plane. Muilenburg claimed he was not fully briefed on the details of the messages until a \u201ccouple of weeks ago\u201d despite the company knowing of the exchange before the Ethiopian airlines crash. The Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz called the test pilot\u2019s exchange \u201cshocking\u201d and accused Boeing of withholding knowledge of the systems faults from regulators. Cruz said: \u201cHow come your team didn\u2019t come to you with their hair on fire, saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got a real problem here\u2019? What does that say about Boeing? Why did you not act before 346 people died?\u201d Lawmakers accused Boeing of selling safety as an \u201cadd-on feature\u201d, referring to a warning light that advises pilots of any discrepancy in the aircraft\u2019s pitch, which was sold as an add-on rather than included as standard. \u201cIf you want to be the leader in aviation manufacturing you have to be the leader in safety,\u201d offered the Washington senator Maria Cantwell, the committee\u2019s top Democrat. The committee has said it plans to change the program that gave Boeing, rather than regulators, authority to sign off on aspects of the jet. \u201cWe don\u2019t \u2018sell\u2019 safety, that\u2019s not our business model,\u201d Muilenburg claimed under questioning. \u201cWe have learned that we\u2019ve made mistakes, and there are things we can improve. We take responsibility for that, we own that, we\u2019ve made fixes going forward.\u201d As the first Boeing official to testify on Capitol Hill about the crisis engulfing the company, Muilenburg said that since the 737 Max was grounded, the company has conducted extensive testing with updated software. Several other inquiries are also expected to report soon, including an international panel convened by the Federal Aviation Authority, the US regulator, to recommend changes to the way planes are certified. There is also a looming criminal investigation by the US justice department. Asked if Boeing could have done more after the first 737 Max crash, Muilenburg said: \u201cI think about that decision over and over again. If we knew then what we know now we would have made a different decision.\u201d The Democratic Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth, a former military pilot, questioned why Boeing did not disclose more details about anti-stall system\u2019s lack of safeguards. \u201cYou have told me half-truths over and over again,\u201d Duckworth said. \u201cYou have not told us the whole truth and these families are suffering because of it.\u201d Duckworth said the pilots did not know enough about the anti-stall system. \u201cYou set those pilots up for failure,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>Emily Dickinson doesn\u2019t seem like the historical figure most ripe for a feminist revision. The American poet, whose work was published almost entirely after her death, lived a pious life in a stable, publicly invested New England family, wrote mostly in private, and was a recluse for most of her adult life. Dickinson, one of four shows in the freshman class of originals for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/11/apple-tv-a-canny-way-to-compete-with-netflix\">Apple TV+</a> streaming service, launching 1 November, assumedly saw promise in the name brand of one of America\u2019s most famous 19th-century female poets. It mines her life for the strict, defining details \u2013 child of a town-figure father (Toby Huss) and cold homemaker mother (an extremely miscast Jane Krakowski) in Amherst, Massachusetts; two siblings'; comfortable home \u2013 while shoehorning in the more inconveniently introspective, cerebral, of-her-time personality of the unheralded (in her lifetime) literary trail-blazer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/28/see-review-jason-momoa-a-lethal-sensual-saga-apple-tv\">See review \u2013 Jason Momoa guts people for fun in Apple TV+'s lethal, sensual saga</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the Apple version, created by Alena Smith, a young adult Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld, also an executive producer) navigates the stifling expectations of antebellum New England with all the subtlety of a #FEMINISM workout tank, strumming air guitar to Lizzo and cross-dressing to attend a no-women-allowed college lecture because, as she says, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re so scared that if they teach us how the world works we\u2019ll figure out a way how to take over.\u201d She explicitly declares her intention to become a famous writer, bums cigarettes off of potential suitors (unclear if this was possible in the 1850s), and spends nights with her best friend/lover/brother\u2019s fiancee Sue Gilbert (Ella Hunt). She defiantly refuses to do chores, leverages a suitor\u2019s attraction into a deal to publish her poems, and prizes night-time inspiration for her work. When her sister, Lavinia (Anna Baryshnikov), interrupts her early morning poetry writing to remind her to fetch water \u2013 their brother can\u2019t do it \u201cbecause he\u2019s a boy\u201d \u2013 Emily guffaws and remarks: \u201cThis is such bullshit.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBMeB6xG4rE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iBMeB6xG4rE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In other words, there\u2019s little trace of the wondrous and luminously sad Dickinson many teens encounter in high school curriculums in this show that seems to be going for coming-of-age comedy but lands somewhere between skit and revisionist biography. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with straying far from period accuracy \u2013 the success, warmth, and absurd goofiness of Drunk History, which imparts far more emotional truth from history than its stunt premise would initially suggest, says otherwise. But Apple\u2019s take on this zaniness feels half-baked; the set-up has the feel of a high-school project with unlimited wells of money and ambition, layering thin paeans of slogan feminism (versions of \u201cwell-behaved women seldom make history\u201d, many times over) and modern diction over the broad contours of a historical figure\u2019s life.</p> <p>There\u2019s a different show, or maybe comedy sketch, where Wiz Khalifa playing the incarnation of Death imparts more than stunt casting, where the feminism is more than just acknowledging the frustrating limitations of Dickinson\u2019s position as a female poet, where the subversiveness isn\u2019t merely putting a modern teen movie on a period subject, where the lines aren\u2019t literally, as Dickinson says at one point: \u201cBoys are stupid.\u201d Dickinson may become that show after the initial three episodes available for review, not least due to the performance of Steinfeld, who still manages to shine despite the show\u2019s often clunky dialogue and tonal inconsistencies, which range from send-up to spoof to serious reconsideration of a misunderstood woman. Dickinson may still have no idea what to do with Wiz Khalifa\u2019s Death other than as a proof of concept of its winking ambition, but it\u2019s still compelling to watch Steinfeld, decked out in a red ballgown, take a carriage ride from hell or manipulate a hapless suitor (the same enjoyment cannot be said for the show\u2019s onerous voiceover and corny transcription of the real Dickinson\u2019s lines to screen).</p> <p>To its credit, Dickinson steadies itself a bit by the third episode, and it has the parts for a fun, perhaps insightful, series \u2013 namely Steinfeld and the rich potential for the absurd comedy of modern manners and personalities in period setting. But watching the three episodes available for review, it\u2019s hard not to wonder what is gained in this story, and who it\u2019s for. (As with its other shows, Apple will release the first three episodes of Dickinson together, then once a week until the season\u2019s end. Dickinson has already been renewed for a second season, suggesting there\u2019s a greater trajectory of growth beyond the first three episodes.) Certainly there\u2019s something enjoyable, particularly for a teenage audience, in watching a young woman take stock of her world\u2019s bullshit and persevere anyway. But those viewers probably don\u2019t need to be told that boys are stupid; they, like the real Dickinson, will keep looking for something deeper.</p> <ul> <li><p>Dickinson begins on Apple TV+ on 1 November<br></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Emily Dickinson doesn\u2019t seem like the historical figure most ripe for a feminist revision. The American poet, whose work was published almost entirely after her death, lived a pious life in a stable, publicly invested New England family, wrote mostly in private, and was a recluse for most of her adult life. Dickinson, one of four shows in the freshman class of originals for the Apple TV+ streaming service, launching 1 November, assumedly saw promise in the name brand of one of America\u2019s most famous 19th-century female poets. It mines her life for the strict, defining details \u2013 child of a town-figure father (Toby Huss) and cold homemaker mother (an extremely miscast Jane Krakowski) in Amherst, Massachusetts; two siblings'; comfortable home \u2013 while shoehorning in the more inconveniently introspective, cerebral, of-her-time personality of the unheralded (in her lifetime) literary trail-blazer. In the Apple version, created by Alena Smith, a young adult Dickinson (Hailee Steinfeld, also an executive producer) navigates the stifling expectations of antebellum New England with all the subtlety of a #FEMINISM workout tank, strumming air guitar to Lizzo and cross-dressing to attend a no-women-allowed college lecture because, as she says, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re so scared that if they teach us how the world works we\u2019ll figure out a way how to take over.\u201d She explicitly declares her intention to become a famous writer, bums cigarettes off of potential suitors (unclear if this was possible in the 1850s), and spends nights with her best friend/lover/brother\u2019s fiancee Sue Gilbert (Ella Hunt). She defiantly refuses to do chores, leverages a suitor\u2019s attraction into a deal to publish her poems, and prizes night-time inspiration for her work. When her sister, Lavinia (Anna Baryshnikov), interrupts her early morning poetry writing to remind her to fetch water \u2013 their brother can\u2019t do it \u201cbecause he\u2019s a boy\u201d \u2013 Emily guffaws and remarks: \u201cThis is such bullshit.\u201d In other words, there\u2019s little trace of the wondrous and luminously sad Dickinson many teens encounter in high school curriculums in this show that seems to be going for coming-of-age comedy but lands somewhere between skit and revisionist biography. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with straying far from period accuracy \u2013 the success, warmth, and absurd goofiness of Drunk History, which imparts far more emotional truth from history than its stunt premise would initially suggest, says otherwise. But Apple\u2019s take on this zaniness feels half-baked; the set-up has the feel of a high-school project with unlimited wells of money and ambition, layering thin paeans of slogan feminism (versions of \u201cwell-behaved women seldom make history\u201d, many times over) and modern diction over the broad contours of a historical figure\u2019s life. There\u2019s a different show, or maybe comedy sketch, where Wiz Khalifa playing the incarnation of Death imparts more than stunt casting, where the feminism is more than just acknowledging the frustrating limitations of Dickinson\u2019s position as a female poet, where the subversiveness isn\u2019t merely putting a modern teen movie on a period subject, where the lines aren\u2019t literally, as Dickinson says at one point: \u201cBoys are stupid.\u201d Dickinson may become that show after the initial three episodes available for review, not least due to the performance of Steinfeld, who still manages to shine despite the show\u2019s often clunky dialogue and tonal inconsistencies, which range from send-up to spoof to serious reconsideration of a misunderstood woman. Dickinson may still have no idea what to do with Wiz Khalifa\u2019s Death other than as a proof of concept of its winking ambition, but it\u2019s still compelling to watch Steinfeld, decked out in a red ballgown, take a carriage ride from hell or manipulate a hapless suitor (the same enjoyment cannot be said for the show\u2019s onerous voiceover and corny transcription of the real Dickinson\u2019s lines to screen). To its credit, Dickinson steadies itself a bit by the third episode, and it has the parts for a fun, perhaps insightful, series \u2013 namely Steinfeld and the rich potential for the absurd comedy of modern manners and personalities in period setting. But watching the three episodes available for review, it\u2019s hard not to wonder what is gained in this story, and who it\u2019s for. (As with its other shows, Apple will release the first three episodes of Dickinson together, then once a week until the season\u2019s end. Dickinson has already been renewed for a second season, suggesting there\u2019s a greater trajectory of growth beyond the first three episodes.) Certainly there\u2019s something enjoyable, particularly for a teenage audience, in watching a young woman take stock of her world\u2019s bullshit and persevere anyway. But those viewers probably don\u2019t need to be told that boys are stupid; they, like the real Dickinson, will keep looking for something deeper. Dickinson begins on Apple TV+ on 1 November",

It marked a bitter end to a turbulent season that was finishing on a high note after brilliant titles in Osaka and Beijing.</p> <p>In stepped Bertens, the 10th-ranked Dutchwoman who has been on a mission in the final months of this year. After a disappointing US Open Bertens took a break from her coach and played as many tournaments as possible with the aim of qualifying directly for the WTA Finals.</p> <p>The attempt seemed to have failed when Belinda Bencic secured the final spot by winning the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. Bertens had to settle for the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, the tournament for players ranked between ninth and 19th. As Bertens lost in the final on Sunday, Barty was preparing for her first match against Bencic in Shenzhen later that day.</p> <p>Osaka\u2019s withdrawal provided Bertens with an opportunity but she looked exhausted in the early exchanges and Barty took advantage, moving to a 6-3, 3-2 lead with a break in the second set. However, just as it seemed Barty was en route to certain victory, her game started to stutter and became caked in errors.</p> <p>Bertens adjusted her tactics and began steaming forward to the net, smothering the Australian\u2019s weaker backhand.

      "bodyText": "Ashleigh Barty experienced mixed emotions as she became the first Australian to secure the year-end No 1 ranking by the simple act of stepping on to Centre Court at the WTA Finals in Shenzhen. She left wondering what on earth had gone wrong after squandering a set-and-break lead to lose 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to the late replacement Kiki Bertens in a scrappy encounter. \u201cWhen you give a player of Kiki\u2019s calibre a chance to get back into the match not once but twice, she\u2019s going to make you pay,\u201d Barty said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the most disappointing thing. Twice in the second set I was up a break and wasn\u2019t able to consolidate.\u201d It was supposed to be a battle between two of the most prominent players of 2019 but Naomi Osaka was forced to withdraw from the tournament and her match with Barty after aggravating a right shoulder injury during her victory over Petra Kvitova on Sunday. It marked a bitter end to a turbulent season that was finishing on a high note after brilliant titles in Osaka and Beijing. In stepped Bertens, the 10th-ranked Dutchwoman who has been on a mission in the final months of this year. After a disappointing US Open Bertens took a break from her coach and played as many tournaments as possible with the aim of qualifying directly for the WTA Finals. The attempt seemed to have failed when Belinda Bencic secured the final spot by winning the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. Bertens had to settle for the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, the tournament for players ranked between ninth and 19th. As Bertens lost in the final on Sunday, Barty was preparing for her first match against Bencic in Shenzhen later that day. Osaka\u2019s withdrawal provided Bertens with an opportunity but she looked exhausted in the early exchanges and Barty took advantage, moving to a 6-3, 3-2 lead with a break in the second set. However, just as it seemed Barty was en route to certain victory, her game started to stutter and became caked in errors. Bertens adjusted her tactics and began steaming forward to the net, smothering the Australian\u2019s weaker backhand. Her improvement yielded eight games in a row to move up 3-6, 6-3, 4-0. Even as Barty stopped missing by feet, she resolutely served out the match to earn her first victory over the world No 1. \u201cIt is a great atmosphere and it\u2019s the last tournament of the year, so I\u2019m trying to give all the energy I have left in me,\u201d Bertens said. \u201cIn the beginning I wasn\u2019t playing as well and had to feel the court, and got better and better as I tried to play aggressively and it turned out pretty well.\u201d In the second singles match of the day Bencic overcame Kvitova 6-3, 1-6, 6-4, her first WTA Finals win. Such is fate that after competing for the last Shenzhen spot all autumn Bertens and Bencic will face each other on Thursday and the winner is likely to reach the semi-finals. The round-robin group format means all four players in the Red Group are still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals. Kyle Edmund beat Ricardas Berankis 6-4, 6-3 in the first round of the Paris Masters to secure his first win since August, ending an eight-match losing streak. It has been a difficult season for Edmund, who has fallen to 75th after starting the season ranked 14th. He will face the in-form Argentinian Diego Schwartzman, seeded 14th, in the second round.",

      "bodyText": "The family of a 19-year-old motorcyclist killed in a crash involving the wife of a US diplomat have announced they are planning to sue the Trump administration for lawless misconduct and a cover-up. Harry Dunn\u2019s family are also going ahead with previously announced plans to sue Anne Sacoolas for damages in a civil action. Lawyers for Sacoolas have admitted she was driving on the wrong side of the road before her car hit Dunn\u2019s motorcycle on 27 August. She then left the UK against the wishes of the Foreign Office, claiming diplomatic immunity under a relatively obscure agreement covering RAF Croughton, where her husband worked, and the British government. The Dunn family\u2019s lawyer, Radd Seiger, who left for the US on Sunday, made the announcement about the fresh legal action after instructing lawyers in the US. \u201cWe are bringing claims against both Mrs Sacoolas in the US for civil damages as well as the Trump administration for their lawless misconduct and attempt to cover that up,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNo one is above the law and the family are determined to ensure that this never happens to another family again.

The lawyers are also planning to take action against Northamptonshire police and have launched a claim for judicial review over the Foreign Office decision-making process. Trump tried to engineer an impromptu meeting between Dunn\u2019s parents and Sacoolas when the family were granted an extraordinary meeting with the US president in the White House a fortnight ago. The Dunn family had been in New York to put pressure on Sacoolas to return to the UK to answer questions from Northamptonshire police. Seiger called the White House attempt to get the family and Sacoolas in the same room a \u201cdisgusting stunt\u201d, adding: \u201cPresident Trump told Harry\u2019s mum, Charlotte, at the meeting that we would look to approach the problem from a different angle, but the family have heard no further and have no faith in his words.\u201d The Dunn family\u2019s cause has the political backing of the Labour party, which has called for a parliamentary inquiry.

Business leaders faced with unrest over the looming environmental disaster, social inequality and companies\u2019 treatment of workers are trying to head off political interference by accepting that capitalism needs to change. In August, Apple, Amazon and the Wall Street bank JP Morgan were among 200 big US companies that redefined their purpose as \u201cimproving our society\u201d and not only making money for shareholders. Some of the world\u2019s richest and most powerful businesspeople have warned that capitalism is failing. The hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio has said the gap between rich and poor is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to US capitalism because it could lead to conflict, populism and \u201crevolution of one sort or another\u201d. Starbucks\u2019 former chief executive Howard Schultz has said capitalism faces a crisis and has advocated higher taxes on the wealthy. In Britain, the Labour party has committed itself to a target for the UK of net zero emissions by 2030 in its version of a Green New Deal. Labour has also pledged to extend workers\u2019 rights, cap bosses\u2019 pay at companies that provide services to the government and increase the minimum wage to \u00a310 for all workers.",

NSW police confirmed last month the investigation was still open, following reporting from the Wall Street Journal that prime minister Scott Morrison had wanted Houston to attend a state dinner at the White House but the Trump administration rejected the proposal. Houston\u2019s father Frank confessed in late 1999 to his son that he had committed child abuse after a victim, Brett Sengstock, reported the abuse which occurred in the 60s and 70s to the Australian Christian Churches. At the time Brian Houston was the national president. Sengstock is one of seven of Frank Houston\u2019s reported victims, with the majority in New Zealand. He gave evidence to the royal commission in 2014 under the pseudonym AHA, but has since given media interviews without anonymity. The royal commission found Frank Houston was allowed to resign his position in the church and was given a retirement package up until his death in 2004. Brian Houston has defended not reporting his father\u2019s confession to police, stating he had a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d because he said Sengstock had said he did not want to go to the authorities. He also said that because Sengstock was an adult when the abuse was first reported, it was his prerogative to report it. Sengstock has denied telling Houston not to go to the police.

The Guardian has sought comment from Houston via Hillsong. Morrison appeared on stage with Brian Houston at Hillsong in July this year, and has refused to answer any questions on whether he sought to bring the Hillsong leader to the United States for his visit. Officials at Senate estimates last week took questions on notice on the matter, stating releasing the information could potentially damage international relations with the US.",

      "body": "<p>My budget beauty journey began, as many cut-price odysseys do, in the aisles of my local Aldi.</p> <p>In the midst of a last-minute pack before an overseas work trip, I discovered I\u2019d run out of my usual cleansing wipes (Mac, $25 for 30 wipes) so I popped to the store around the corner and threw a packet of <a href=\"https://www.aldi.com.au/en/groceries/skin-care/skin-care-detail/ps/p/lacura-essentials-caring-cleansing-wipes-30pk/\">Aldi\u2019s Lacura cleansing wipes</a> ($1.69 for 30 wipes) in my basket. Not only did they remove all the grit and grime while I was on assignment in Texas, the soothing sweet almond oil and aloe vera formula proved the perfect pick-me-up for my sandpaper skin (riding all day beneath the baking sun on a ranch will do that to you).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/oct/27/bare-faced-chic-funmi-fetto-good-skin-guide-10-key-trends\">Bare-faced chic: Funmi Fetto\u2019s good skin guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I returned to Sydney a Lacura convert and wondering what other cut-price beauty products could outperform my expensive skincare arsenal. As a long-time sufferer of rosacea and ridiculously sensitive skin (mysterious rashes, blotches and itchiness materialising god-knows-why but god-knows-all-the-time) I\u2019d always thought forking out the big bucks was the only way to placate and protect my visage. But what if it wasn\u2019t? Recently there has been a proliferation of affordable new skincare brands that claim to deliver real results. I decided to try them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ddbcf89fc967141a3176255c9d1c41d751d9cfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddbcf89fc967141a3176255c9d1c41d751d9cfed/157_272_2051_1475/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldi Lacura wipes, $1.69 for a pack of 30.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aldi Lacura wipes, $1.69 for a pack of 30.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I began with a trip to Sephora, which recently launched a collection of skincare products from $9-$30 running from cleansers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/07/the-best-cleansing-waters\">micellar water </a>and scrubs to eye creams, serums and mud masks. The line was created in France, adding a soup\u00e7on of marketing je ne sais quoi to cheap cleanser. Sephora claims it contains a minimum of 90% \u201cnatural ingredients\u201d, which I thought might be just as gentle as the more expensive Sisley, Aesop and Votary products I had purchased for the same reason.</p> <p>When I got home I began replacing my twice-weekly swipes of<a href=\"https://www.drnatashacook.com/products/concentrated-micropeel\"> Dr Natasha Cook Concentrated Micropeel</a> ($125 for 16 sachets) with <a href=\"https://www.sephora.com.au/products/sephora-collection-glow-peel-pads/v/20-pieces\">Sephora\u2019s Glow Peel Pads</a> ($24 for 60 pieces). Where my wipes by the Sydney dermatologist had the fine texture of a wet tissue, Sephora\u2019s were pleasingly thick with exfoliating bumps on one side.

      "bodyText": "My budget beauty journey began, as many cut-price odysseys do, in the aisles of my local Aldi. In the midst of a last-minute pack before an overseas work trip, I discovered I\u2019d run out of my usual cleansing wipes (Mac, $25 for 30 wipes) so I popped to the store around the corner and threw a packet of Aldi\u2019s Lacura cleansing wipes ($1.69 for 30 wipes) in my basket. Not only did they remove all the grit and grime while I was on assignment in Texas, the soothing sweet almond oil and aloe vera formula proved the perfect pick-me-up for my sandpaper skin (riding all day beneath the baking sun on a ranch will do that to you). I returned to Sydney a Lacura convert and wondering what other cut-price beauty products could outperform my expensive skincare arsenal. As a long-time sufferer of rosacea and ridiculously sensitive skin (mysterious rashes, blotches and itchiness materialising god-knows-why but god-knows-all-the-time) I\u2019d always thought forking out the big bucks was the only way to placate and protect my visage. But what if it wasn\u2019t? Recently there has been a proliferation of affordable new skincare brands that claim to deliver real results. I decided to try them. I began with a trip to Sephora, which recently launched a collection of skincare products from $9-$30 running from cleansers, micellar water and scrubs to eye creams, serums and mud masks. The line was created in France, adding a soup\u00e7on of marketing je ne sais quoi to cheap cleanser. Sephora claims it contains a minimum of 90% \u201cnatural ingredients\u201d, which I thought might be just as gentle as the more expensive Sisley, Aesop and Votary products I had purchased for the same reason. When I got home I began replacing my twice-weekly swipes of Dr Natasha Cook Concentrated Micropeel ($125 for 16 sachets) with Sephora\u2019s Glow Peel Pads ($24 for 60 pieces). Where my wipes by the Sydney dermatologist had the fine texture of a wet tissue, Sephora\u2019s were pleasingly thick with exfoliating bumps on one side. The sting of the cheap pads was far less powerful (if that\u2019s any indication of efficacy) but I nonetheless experienced noticeably smoother skin after use, and the small container was perfect for my frequent work travel. Sadly Sephora\u2019s Overnight Firming Cream and Ultra Glow Serum (containing a concoction of vitamin C and E) were far from rich enough for my skin, and I found myself constantly reapplying them. But with so many cut-price brands on department store shelves, how do you know which ones actually deliver results? \u201cIt is possible for budget products to deliver results similar to luxury brands but it\u2019s dependent on what the ingredients are so you need to do your research,\u201d says Michelle Wong, a Sydney chemistry PhD whose website Lab Muffin uses science to analyse which beauty products are worth buying and which aren\u2019t. Where I hit pay dirt was The Inkey List, a British brand which recently arrived in Australia. In the UK it claims to have sold one product every 60 seconds since launching in September last year. Like the Canadian brand The Ordinary, The Inkey List\u2019s USP is no-frills formulas and cutting down on expensive packaging to focus on premium single ingredients, such as retinol (which has evidence-backed wrinkle-reducing properties), niacinamide (used to treat premature ageing caused by air pollution) and alpha hydroxy acid (a chemical exfoliate that makes skin look brighter and dewier). I tried the brand\u2019s Vitamin C Serum (30ml for $18, containing 30% vitamin C compared with my usual 50ml Kiehl\u2019s Powerful-Strength Line-Reducing Concentrate for $103 with 12.5% Vitamin C), Lactic Acid Serum ($18) and Polyglutamic Acid Serum ($22), which The Inkey List claims holds four times more moisture than hyaluronic acid. After using the products in tandem my skin felt as smooth as a freshly peeled egg, and it was pleasing to customise a cocktail specific to my skin rather than having to buy more expensive products containing ingredients I didn\u2019t need or want. I also liked the minimal black and white packaging and no-BS product explanations. \u201cWe found there was a lot of confusion in skincare and a gap for helping people to understand ingredients and how to use them,\u201d says The Inkey List\u2019s co-founder, Colette Newberry, who previously worked for the UK pharmacy giant Boots. \u201cOur background in large-scale beauty companies has allowed us to go higher-up the supply chain direct to the source of quality ingredients to get the best price.\u201d Wong says: \u201cThe actual ingredients in beauty products don\u2019t cost that much. Generally they are well under $1 so it\u2019s things like packaging, logistics and celebrity endorsements that push the prices up.

Most of the time fillers are used, like water, ethyl alcohol or something oil based which helps the ingredient dilute or spread more nicely across the skin.\u201d Perhaps this is why I found the $29 Bakuchiol Booster (a retinol substitute) by British brand BYBI Beauty to produce less-than-glowy results and Mario Badescu\u2019s Hydro Moisturiser with Vitamin C ($28 for 59ml) to lack its promised \u201cradiance-boosting\u201d effect. However, K-beauty did rise to the cut-price challenge. A 16Brand kelp sheet mask (just $2!) revived my puffy face after a big night out. For the best chance of budget beauty success Wong recommends carefully reading the label to see what percentage of active ingredients a product actually contains, and scrolling through online reviews by people with a similar skin type to yours. \u201cThe ingredients list is useful but it doesn\u2019t predict how it will work on your own skin.\u201d Once you\u2019ve settled on some cut-price candidates, the best test is to try a single product at a time, rather than slapping multiple unctions on your face \u2013 so, not what I did. \u201cDon\u2019t introduce too many things to your skin at once or you risk irritation,\u201d says Wong. \u201cTry each product for one or two weeks so you can really see if they work or not.\u201d Wong\u2019s favourite budget buys include The Inkey List and Australian brands QV (for its $10.65 body wash) and Natio (for its $19.95 Daily Defence Face Moisturiser SPF 50+ ). In my own affordable beauty journey I also found several Australian brands to be effective. For instance, the Aussie Flyer Leave-on Recovery Mask ($26 for 60ml) by Lanolips plumped up my dehydrated skin better than the outrageously pricey Chanel Sublimage Mask ($305 for 50ml) I had been using. After two weeks of lathering, moisturising, scrubbing and masking, the truth is that my skin was no better or worse than before. This could be because I refused to swap out my core cleansing routine, and often found myself reaching for my hardcore moisturisers when budget buys were not nourishing enough. While there are some beauty expenses I will never give up, after my initial encounter with the Lacura wipes I\u2019ve discovered other affordable products I will definitely introduce.

Now I can die happy\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A few years ago I had a huge bonfire in my backyard and burned all my diaries up to the point where Yellow Notebook begins. I did this because when I went through the cartons of exercise books one day, looking for what I\u2019d written around the time of the dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/06/unmasking-history-the-queen-the-governor-general-and-the-whitlam-dismissal\">dismissal of the Whitlam government,</a> I found to my astonishment that I hadn\u2019t even mentioned it.</p> <p>That day, crouching over the crates in the laundry, I was soon so bored with my younger self and her droning sentimental concerns that there was nothing for it \u2013 this shit had to go. Flames from the barbecue licked the heavens. All I kept were things that my daughter had written and drawn, plus the odd tram ticket or shopping list or dried flower that I found shoved between the pages of manically precise handwriting. I\u2019m happy to report that I have never for a second regretted this conflagration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5395060a93d9cff60d14b63aedf60c61664710b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5395060a93d9cff60d14b63aedf60c61664710b/0_0_2531_3543/714.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Garner in 2017\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sometimes, as I typed, I\u2019d watch my own antics and burst out laughing \u2013 but I can\u2019t count the number of times I writhed and cursed.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Broadway</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The point of my personal history at which I stopped tearing and burning was around 1978, when my daughter and I briefly lived in Paris. I\u2019m not sure if it was a matter of a tonal shift in the writing, or the change of scene, or greater brevity, or because I\u2019d stopped going on and on about \u201clove\u201d, but reading what I\u2019d written back then gradually ceased to embarrass me. It seemed that in 1978 I had sat up and taken a proper look around. What I was seeing and hearing around me, in a foreign country whose language I had studied for half my life but still spoke imperfectly, was taking on, in my diary, as much life as were my own inner concerns; and the links between inner and outer had became looser, somehow, less grinding and neurotic. And a lot funnier.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pretty much everybody crashes through the world hurting other people and hurting themselves \u2013 cheating, lying, sneaking, betraying</p> <footer> <cite>Helen Garner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When in 2018 I sat down to see if this material might be publishable, I set myself some strict rules. I could trim, I could fillet, yes, but I was not to rewrite. On rare occasions I was allowed to reorder hastily written sentences that no reader would otherwise be able to make sense of \u2013 this was simple good manners. But I would not permit myself to correct or improve or polish.</p> <p>And of course I soon found myself, day after day, strapped into the straitjacket that is the very nature of a diary: it\u2019s got a voice, it\u2019s entirely <em>composed</em> of voice, but it has no voice<em>over</em>. It exists in an eternal present. When you\u2019re typing it up you can\u2019t add a layer of self-exculpating charm or graceful irony, as you can for example in memoir. You can\u2019t wriggle past your ugly, foolish behaviour by saying, \u201cOK, I did and said that <em>then</em>, but I would never<em> </em>do or say such a thing <em>now</em>.\u201d The evidence is there on the page, unredeemable, giving off its static: your spiteful thought, your careless cruelty, your maternal neglect, your treachery and greed and laziness. There you go again, frolicking blindly towards the cliff and prancing straight over the edge. Sometimes, as I typed, I\u2019d watch my own antics and burst out laughing, but I can\u2019t count the number of times I writhed and cursed, and had to cast myself on the mat in the corner of my office and howl with shame.</p> <p>In other words, pulling this book together has been a very challenging experience.</p> <p>At first I stripped out people\u2019s names. I simply called them \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d, or, when that was too confusing, I made up tags that I thought of as Homeric epithets: \u201cthe curly-headed one\u201d, \u201cthe married man\u201d and so on. I was a bit pleased with myself for this \u2013 I thought of it as keeping the text airborne above the mess of literalness. But of course it didn\u2019t work. No one would have the patience to keep track of all these masks and pronouns over the long haul. So that balloon went down.</p> <p>Then my editor, a woman of subtle intelligence who works with a light touch, suggested I should give each person an initial. I resisted; but she was right.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve always thought I was quite good at reading faces, but the look people give you when you tell them you\u2019re going to publish your diary is more complex and mysterious than the average expression: a half-smiling blur of alarm, tinged with suspicion and protest, which opens into a shyly guilty curiosity. A writer I like and greatly respect, when I told her about my plan, drew in a sharp breath and said, \u201cYour idea of privacy must be very different from mine.\u201d I was mortified. Did she imagine my diary as a narcissistic spilling of guts, the sort of ghastly self-glorifying mush that women like Ana\u00efs Nin used to spew out? We were sitting in a bar. I started babbling about how it was a stream of fragments, chunks of life. She still had that doubtful look. So I got out my phone and showed her photos of a couple of pages. Her face brightened. \u201cNow I get it,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are experiences that anybody might have lived.\u201d Phew! I wiped the sweat from my brow. A few years ago I had a huge bonfire in my backyard and burned all my diaries up to the point where Yellow Notebook begins. I did this because when I went through the cartons of exercise books one day, looking for what I\u2019d written around the time of the dramatic dismissal of the Whitlam government, I found to my astonishment that I hadn\u2019t even mentioned it. That day, crouching over the crates in the laundry, I was soon so bored with my younger self and her droning sentimental concerns that there was nothing for it \u2013 this shit had to go. Flames from the barbecue licked the heavens. All I kept were things that my daughter had written and drawn, plus the odd tram ticket or shopping list or dried flower that I found shoved between the pages of manically precise handwriting. I\u2019m happy to report that I have never for a second regretted this conflagration. The point of my personal history at which I stopped tearing and burning was around 1978, when my daughter and I briefly lived in Paris. I\u2019m not sure if it was a matter of a tonal shift in the writing, or the change of scene, or greater brevity, or because I\u2019d stopped going on and on about \u201clove\u201d, but reading what I\u2019d written back then gradually ceased to embarrass me. It seemed that in 1978 I had sat up and taken a proper look around. What I was seeing and hearing around me, in a foreign country whose language I had studied for half my life but still spoke imperfectly, was taking on, in my diary, as much life as were my own inner concerns; and the links between inner and outer had became looser, somehow, less grinding and neurotic. And a lot funnier. When in 2018 I sat down to see if this material might be publishable, I set myself some strict rules. I could trim, I could fillet, yes, but I was not to rewrite. On rare occasions I was allowed to reorder hastily written sentences that no reader would otherwise be able to make sense of \u2013 this was simple good manners. But I would not permit myself to correct or improve or polish. And of course I soon found myself, day after day, strapped into the straitjacket that is the very nature of a diary: it\u2019s got a voice, it\u2019s entirely composed of voice, but it has no voiceover. It exists in an eternal present. When you\u2019re typing it up you can\u2019t add a layer of self-exculpating charm or graceful irony, as you can for example in memoir. You can\u2019t wriggle past your ugly, foolish behaviour by saying, \u201cOK, I did and said that then, but I would never do or say such a thing now.\u201d The evidence is there on the page, unredeemable, giving off its static: your spiteful thought, your careless cruelty, your maternal neglect, your treachery and greed and laziness. There you go again, frolicking blindly towards the cliff and prancing straight over the edge. Sometimes, as I typed, I\u2019d watch my own antics and burst out laughing, but I can\u2019t count the number of times I writhed and cursed, and had to cast myself on the mat in the corner of my office and howl with shame. In other words, pulling this book together has been a very challenging experience. At first I stripped out people\u2019s names. I simply called them \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d, or, when that was too confusing, I made up tags that I thought of as Homeric epithets: \u201cthe curly-headed one\u201d, \u201cthe married man\u201d and so on. I was a bit pleased with myself for this \u2013 I thought of it as keeping the text airborne above the mess of literalness. But of course it didn\u2019t work. No one would have the patience to keep track of all these masks and pronouns over the long haul. So that balloon went down. Then my editor, a woman of subtle intelligence who works with a light touch, suggested I should give each person an initial. I resisted; but she was right. The way it pulled the thing into shape was a revelation. Several people go by their real names, usually public figures I didn\u2019t know, or writers and performers I admire and quote. A handful of those closer to me (\u201cthe law student\u201d, \u201cthe born-again\u201d, \u201cthe biographer\u201d) have kept their epithets because I couldn\u2019t bear to part with them. But almost everyone else who appears is identified by a single letter. Working on this text has taught me a lot. I came to understand that reading an account of a stranger\u2019s daily tasks and troubles doesn\u2019t have to lock you into their life and stifle you there.

RA drew a line in the sand when the Force asked for financial assistance, requiring the Perth-based franchise to enter into an alliance with the national union, which purchased the WA team\u2019s intellectual property. It was this move that enabled RA to axe the Force from Super Rugby in 2017 after Sanzaar decided to reduce the number of teams in the competition. Little wonder that when RA subsequently approached the Brumbies to enter into an alliance, the Canberra-based franchise refused. The axing of the Force, while supported by the other Super Rugby teams, has done little to restore trust between the provincial unions and RA. Its ambitious plans to expand to Perth (2005) and Melbourne (2011) had a detrimental effect on the three foundation franchises \u2013 the Brumbies, Reds and Waratahs \u2013 spreading the pool of player talent wafer thin at a time when there was a mass exodus of Australian players to overseas clubs in Europe and Japan. One of the reasons for expansion was to increase the revenue generated by broadcast deals, but New Zealand has managed to increase its broadcast revenue without adding to their five original Super Rugby franchises. While RA has managed to retain most of the players required for the Wallabies, the weakening of the Super Rugby teams has had an adverse effect on the national team. An Australian team has not won the title for five years, while only one has managed to reach the playoffs in each of the last four seasons, which does not help to prepare the Wallabies for Test rugby. Australia\u2019s lack of involvement in the playoffs has been reflected in the Wallabies\u2019 poor performance over the last four years, but there is a sense of powerlessness at Super Rugby level, which has led to conversations about breaking away from RA. RA is poised to sign a new Wallabies coach, reportedly New Zealander Dave Rennie, and perhaps Australia will enjoy another brief period of success. But the key to long-term, sustainable success is RA and the Super Rugby franchises developing a symbiotic relationship which is mutually beneficial to all parties. Otherwise, the game runs the risk of remaining in a state of constant crisis.",

asked if they had enough time to file their reportable tax position questionnaire, large private companies were also asked questions including whether there were \u201cdifficulties in detecting and disclosing arrangements that were set up in earlier years\u201d.</p> <p>While organisations that made submissions as part of the consultation process were warned that those submissions could be made public, the ATO said it would not release any of them.</p> <p>However, it is believed some private groups were not ready to meet the original deadline because, despite their large size, they typically have far fewer head office staff than their stock exchange-listed counterparts.</p> <p>\u201cI think they\u2019re simply not organised,\u201d one tax source told Guardian Australia.</p>",

The move was part of a Coalition strategy to have more transparency around Australia\u2019s largest taxpayers, and bring private companies into line with the requirements of public and multinational companies as part of the \u201cjustified trust\u201d strategy laid out by the ATO. Tax paid by Australia\u2019s rich is once again in the spotlight after Guardian Australia reported that a company owned by the family of Australia\u2019s richest man, Anthony Pratt, has paid very little tax since 2013 despite declaring profits of $340m over the same period. But the ATO has quietly pushed compliance for large private groups back a year, to 2021, a delay revealed in notes of an ATO consultation group meeting held last month and attended by people including representatives of the wealthy Fox, Lowy and Oatley families, as well as lawyers and tax advisers. Labor\u2019s finance spokesman, Stephen Jones, said the delay was just another \u201cin a series of inaction to crack down on tax avoidance\u201d. \u201cThe Liberals have had six years to get serious on tax avoidance and it\u2019s clear their heart isn\u2019t in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Liberals pay lip service to action on tax avoidance but the reality has been cutting thousands of jobs from the tax office and implementation delays.\u201d Assistant treasurer Michael Sukkar\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to questions about how this move matched the Coalition\u2019s promise for more transparency in the system, but said it was a \u201croutine administrative decision made by the ATO as an independent statutory agency.\u201d The principal analyst at the union-backed Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, Jason Ward, said the delay was \u201cunfortunate but not surprising\u201d. \u201cOnce again the largest private companies have used their access to government to delay greater transparency on their tax affairs,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is nothing to hide, what\u2019s the problem with a little sunlight?\u201d An ATO spokesman said the agency sought feedback about extending the reportable tax position program from the group that met last month, which is known as the private groups stewardship group, and through a consultation paper issued more broadly. \u201cConcerns were raised in feedback about implementing the [reportable tax position] schedule in the private market this financial year [2019-2020],\u201d he said. \u201cTaking on board this feedback we deferred the implementation until the 2020-21 financial year.\u201d In addition to being asked if they had enough time to file their reportable tax position questionnaire, large private companies were also asked questions including whether there were \u201cdifficulties in detecting and disclosing arrangements that were set up in earlier years\u201d. While organisations that made submissions as part of the consultation process were warned that those submissions could be made public, the ATO said it would not release any of them. However, it is believed some private groups were not ready to meet the original deadline because, despite their large size, they typically have far fewer head office staff than their stock exchange-listed counterparts. \u201cI think they\u2019re simply not organised,\u201d one tax source told Guardian Australia.",

On Wednesday, the consumer advocacy group Choice published its review of private health insurance policies and their cost following their reclassification into a tiered system. From April, many of the 70,000 existing private health insurance policies were labelled as gold, silver, bronze or basic, with \u201cplus\u201d versions of those categories also available. Gold policies represent the highest level of coverage and basic the lowest, allowing consumers to more easily identify what level of coverage they needed and avoid junk policies.

real Australian birds. The Abbott's booby is an endangered seabird that only nests on Christmas Island., 2:C - Earlier this year, a Florida man was kicked to death by the southern cassowary he kept in captivity., 3:B - In 2018, twice as many rainbow lorikeets were recorded as the next most common bird, the noisy miner., 4:D - Contrary to popular belief, the welcome swallow does not migrate. There is some movement north in winter but that is wholly within Australia., 5:C - The Australian bustard also occurs in the Trans-Fly area of New Guinea. , 6:A - Scientists suspect that the deaths of tens of thousands of seabirds in the Bering Sea are due to warming waters linked to climate change that make their prey harder to find. , 7:B - The Weebill is no longer than 9cm., 8:D - There are only around 1,500 red-tailed black-cockatoos left in south-western Victoria and south-east South Australia., 9:A - Long known to Indigenous observers, the black kite picks up burning sticks from bushfires and carries them to a new site where it drops them to start a new fire., 10:D - The pale-headed rosella has a yellowish head with a white cheek, as much vanilla slice as custard tart., 11:B - Last verified sighting of the paradise parrot was in 1927 inland from Bundaberg. , 12:A - White-winged choughs have been observed stealing the offspring from other chough families to bolster the strength of their family groups. The new recruits are thought to be brought in to help raise the new generation of chough chicks., 13:D - An estimated one million birds were slaughtered to feed the Norfolk Island population, leading to the bird\u2019s extinction on the island. Luckily another population survived on Lord Howe Island and now a few pairs of providence petrels have returned to a small island off Norfolk., 14:A - Most studies show that it is only 10% of male magpies (and it is almost always the males) that swoop, and generally only when they have chicks in the nest., 15:B - The other three belong to the megapode family which use their large feet to scrape a mound of vegetation that provides heat as it decomposes to keep the eggs warm., 16:A - The Eurasian coot is a waterbird found across Africa, Eurasia and Australia. The other three are introduced or have hitched a ride on ships., 17:A - The magnificent, Victoria\u2019s and paradise riflebirds occur in the rainforests along the east coast and, like their better-known relatives, they have elaborate courtship displays., 18:C - Glossy-blacks have one of the most limited diets of any bird., 19:B - Hidden away in dense reedbeds, male bitterns emit a far-carrying lowing across the wetlands., 20:C - The English word cockatoo comes originally from the Malay word, via Dutch. Several species of cockatoo are found on islands north of Australia with the yellow-crested cockatoo reaching Lombok and Sulawesi. </p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"4\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Uber twitcher.

The Liberal MP Craig Kelly told Guardian Australia when Wyatt put the voice on the agenda during Naidoc week that setting up separate structures, even if the representative model was legislated rather than constitutionally enshrined, risked creating \u201ca reverse form of what South Africa was a few years ago\u201d. Rightwing thinktanks like the Institute of Public Affairs are also opposed on the same rationale as conservatives like Kelly.",

As the federal government considers a fresh round of drought measures to respond to the record dry spell, the Queensland government has angered federal MPs by releasing more than 100,000 megalitres of water from the Paradise dam over a 10-week period. The controversial decision was taken to reduce the dam to 42% capacity because of concerns over its structural integrity in the event of a flood. But after reaching \u201cfull supply capacity\u201d of the water storage system on Monday, the operator of the government-owned dam, Sunwater, has begun releasing 400 megalitres of freshwater out to sea each day from a barrage near Bundaberg. The dramatic reduction in water levels has raised concerns not only for the impact on water security in the drought-affected region, but also on wildlife, including platypus, turtles and mulloway. In response, the Nationals MPs Keith Pitt and Ken O\u2019Dowd have written to the state natural resources minister, Anthony Lynham, to call for a \u201cfully transparent and public\u201d explanation for the work, and a call to delay any permanent changes to the dam\u2019s capacity. \u201cWe, the undersigned, are devastated to see 400 megalitres of precious water flowing from Paradise Dam over the Ben Anderson Barrage and out to sea each day, when we are experiencing one of the most serious droughts in decades,\u201d the letter, co-signed with state LNP MPs, says. \u201cOur communities deserve to know the full details and the full extent of the safety concerns, how the issue will be fixed, whether the dam will ever be returned to full capacity or what other options you have to ensure our region\u2019s water security.\u201d A spokesman for Sunwater said water was being released \u201cto allow for essential works to improve the dam\u2019s stability during extreme rain events\u201d. \u201cThe decision to release water during a time of drought was not taken lightly and was made to allow for better community safety,\u201d the spokesman said.

Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has said the reduction in capacity will allow work to lower the dam wall by five metres, saying it was \u201cfundamentally a safety issue and it is a paramount safety issue\u201d. But the state government has not released a report into the structural problems of the dam, which was opened in 2006 and cost $240m, saying it is commercial in confidence. The issue is likely to further heighten tensions between the federal government and the state over the drought response, with the Coalition pointing the finger at the states for not building new dams. Last month the drought minister, David Littleproud, said the states had to be dragged \u201ckicking and screaming\u201d to build dams. \u201cThe states have been responsible for urban water since federation and should be taking the lead,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cThey\u2019re just not keeping up with their growing populations.\u201d But the Queensland government has returned fire, calling the federal government\u2019s signature drought future fund a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for the state\u2019s farmers. The Coalition is also under pressure from farming groups and Labor to do more, as it fends off criticism about its national drought policy. On Tuesday the shadow agriculture minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, accused the government of \u201cdrought policy chaos\u201d after Littleproud appeared to contradict Morrison over the government\u2019s farm household allowance changes. \u201cIt\u2019s past-time we had a national drought policy and put an end to the chaotic, piecemeal and ad hoc approach we\u2019ve had from the Morrison Government,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. Littleproud had suggested no one would be cut off the farm household payment after the four-year limit was reached. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to make it quite clear, right here tonight, that this government will not be taking those off those supplementary payments,\u201d he told the ABC on Monday. A spokesman for Littleproud clarified that he was referring to lump sum payments that could be continued if needed.",

      "body": "<p>You might think the festival that is all about a plot to blow up parliament would be a surefire hit in an autumn steeped in backstabbing and skulduggery at Westminster, but Bonfire Night lost the pop cultural arms race to Halloween years ago. Halloween is huge. What was once a cobwebby half-term afterthought has reinvented itself. Olde-world graveyards and broomsticks have been ditched in favour of Instagrammable nail art and carefully curated pumpkin stalls.</p> <p>There are lots of reasons why Halloween is a really bad idea. It is the demon enabler of the evil sugar industry. It is an environmental disaster zone of disposable plastic tat \u2013 the charity Hubbub recently estimated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/18/scariest-thing-about-halloween-is-plastic-waste-say-charities\" title=\"\">throwaway costumes and accessories generate polluting oil-based plastic equivalent to 83m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/18/scariest-thing-about-halloween-is-plastic-waste-say-charities\" title=\"\"> plastic bottles</a>. And, if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, every year it completely spoils an entire week of Strictly Come Dancing with green body paint and coloured contact lenses. Yet, in the end, none of this matters, because Halloween is supposed to be nasty. The worse it gets, the better. Deal with it, because it is not going away.</p> <p>Halloween is scary, funny and probably bad for you. It is hypersexualised and narcissistic and all about how good you look. It is restless, always on the prowl for the most up-to-date joke, the newest hot take, the most zeitgeisty meme. In contrast to Christmas and Easter, which are convened around wholesome, home-cooked family feasts, Halloween catering is all about the sweets and/or alcohol, depending on your age bracket. It rewards the skills of being good at putting on makeup, overthinking pop culture and having an encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes. And it looks great in photos. It is, in other words, the most 2019 party it is possible to imagine.</p> <p>While impressing your friends with your fabulous Christmas party dress is still cute, in a retro, early-00s-Richard-Curtis-movie kind of a way, it is your Halloween look that now wins the most points. Halloween is like the Met Gala, but everyone is invited. It requires wit as well as showmanship, gore as well as glamour. And it has to be rethought every year \u2013 sustainability red flag here, as discussed, but all the more reason to aim a bit higher than whatever crudely styled, statically charged tat you can get next-day-delivered on Amazon Prime. Read on for the looks that will make the cut this Halloween.</p> <h2><strong>Brexit</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e72de43fd76a0bc6c0bce30999bee344bb8188c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e72de43fd76a0bc6c0bce30999bee344bb8188c3/0_0_7111_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump wig and a cycling helmet: easy Boris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump wig and a cycling helmet: easy Boris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design; Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images; Karl Nesh/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 31 October deadline will not come to pass, but the Halloween timing the PM repeated at every opportunity has fused the longest-running political horror show with the festival of terror and absurdity. Johnson \u2013 this year\u2019s pop culture baddie \u2013 is the obvious look; just rough up the Donald Trump wig from Halloween two years ago and add a bike helmet. But the Tim Burton vibes of Jacob Rees-Mogg also have potential. Maximum points to the person who figures out how to dress up as the Irish backstop. I have been working on a plan involving an Irish flag with a hard border, but I would be lying if I said I could explain it.</p> <h2><strong>Surrealist</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8873f0eda79bda2f53d18843654e99e82a9aea0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8873f0eda79bda2f53d18843654e99e82a9aea0d/0_0_7111_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wagatha Christie: Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wagatha Christie: Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design; Ian Gavan/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAvocado\u201d was the word of the first half of this decade and \u201csurreal\u201d has been the word of the second half, a term that came into mainstream culture as politics became more and more absurd both here and in the US. Quirkily cartoonish takes on modern life are very Halloween 2019. Upcycle the papier mache art project that Year 3 made when they read James and the Giant Peach and combine with a model of the White House for a Dali-esque impeachment costume. Or team giant Chanel earrings, bronzer and false eyelashes with a Sherlock Holmes costume for a Coleen Rooney/Wagatha Christie look.</p> <h2><strong>Peak narcissism</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7863e7741ef67643ff09240951b3a3f105d88d50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7863e7741ef67643ff09240951b3a3f105d88d50/0_0_7111_4267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Timberlake as a microphone and Jessica Biel (front centre) dressed as Timberlake at a Halloween party in LA this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Timberlake as a microphone and Jessica Biel (front centre) dressed as Timberlake at a Halloween party in LA this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian Design; Michael Kovac/Getty Images for Casamigos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No need for any of that goodwill-to-all-mankind, better-to-give-than-to-receive nonsense that you get at Christmas. Halloween is all about you. However, it is no longer socially acceptable to add \u201csexy\u201d to a noun at random. A witch in a corset, a nurse in suspenders? Babes, the 20th century called \u2013 it needs its dressing-up box back. Instead, recruit a photogenic friend or family member and have them dress up as you. The Kardashian clan are, as ever, ahead of the curve here: three days before the date itself, one-year-old Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie Jenner, was being proclaimed on social media as the \u201cwinner\u201d of Halloween thanks to a bespoke outfit recreating her mum\u2019s lilac feathered Versace Met Gala gown.

      "bodyText": "You might think the festival that is all about a plot to blow up parliament would be a surefire hit in an autumn steeped in backstabbing and skulduggery at Westminster, but Bonfire Night lost the pop cultural arms race to Halloween years ago. Halloween is huge. What was once a cobwebby half-term afterthought has reinvented itself. Olde-world graveyards and broomsticks have been ditched in favour of Instagrammable nail art and carefully curated pumpkin stalls. There are lots of reasons why Halloween is a really bad idea. It is the demon enabler of the evil sugar industry. It is an environmental disaster zone of disposable plastic tat \u2013 the charity Hubbub recently estimated that throwaway costumes and accessories generate polluting oil-based plastic equivalent to 83m plastic bottles. And, if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, every year it completely spoils an entire week of Strictly Come Dancing with green body paint and coloured contact lenses. Yet, in the end, none of this matters, because Halloween is supposed to be nasty. The worse it gets, the better. Deal with it, because it is not going away. Halloween is scary, funny and probably bad for you. It is hypersexualised and narcissistic and all about how good you look. It is restless, always on the prowl for the most up-to-date joke, the newest hot take, the most zeitgeisty meme. In contrast to Christmas and Easter, which are convened around wholesome, home-cooked family feasts, Halloween catering is all about the sweets and/or alcohol, depending on your age bracket. It rewards the skills of being good at putting on makeup, overthinking pop culture and having an encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes. And it looks great in photos. It is, in other words, the most 2019 party it is possible to imagine. While impressing your friends with your fabulous Christmas party dress is still cute, in a retro, early-00s-Richard-Curtis-movie kind of a way, it is your Halloween look that now wins the most points. Halloween is like the Met Gala, but everyone is invited. It requires wit as well as showmanship, gore as well as glamour. And it has to be rethought every year \u2013 sustainability red flag here, as discussed, but all the more reason to aim a bit higher than whatever crudely styled, statically charged tat you can get next-day-delivered on Amazon Prime. Read on for the looks that will make the cut this Halloween. Brexit The 31 October deadline will not come to pass, but the Halloween timing the PM repeated at every opportunity has fused the longest-running political horror show with the festival of terror and absurdity. Johnson \u2013 this year\u2019s pop culture baddie \u2013 is the obvious look; just rough up the Donald Trump wig from Halloween two years ago and add a bike helmet. But the Tim Burton vibes of Jacob Rees-Mogg also have potential. Maximum points to the person who figures out how to dress up as the Irish backstop. I have been working on a plan involving an Irish flag with a hard border, but I would be lying if I said I could explain it. Surrealist \u201cAvocado\u201d was the word of the first half of this decade and \u201csurreal\u201d has been the word of the second half, a term that came into mainstream culture as politics became more and more absurd both here and in the US. Quirkily cartoonish takes on modern life are very Halloween 2019. Upcycle the papier mache art project that Year 3 made when they read James and the Giant Peach and combine with a model of the White House for a Dali-esque impeachment costume. Or team giant Chanel earrings, bronzer and false eyelashes with a Sherlock Holmes costume for a Coleen Rooney/Wagatha Christie look. Peak narcissism No need for any of that goodwill-to-all-mankind, better-to-give-than-to-receive nonsense that you get at Christmas. Halloween is all about you. However, it is no longer socially acceptable to add \u201csexy\u201d to a noun at random. A witch in a corset, a nurse in suspenders? Babes, the 20th century called \u2013 it needs its dressing-up box back. Instead, recruit a photogenic friend or family member and have them dress up as you. The Kardashian clan are, as ever, ahead of the curve here: three days before the date itself, one-year-old Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie Jenner, was being proclaimed on social media as the \u201cwinner\u201d of Halloween thanks to a bespoke outfit recreating her mum\u2019s lilac feathered Versace Met Gala gown. Jessica Biel dressing as her husband Justin Timberlake (the \u2018NSync era version) also podiums here. File under: because internet. Cool-signalling It is like virtue-signalling, but without morals, and it is major. Obviously you have flawless taste, so this is your time to shine. Be the Hot Priest from Fleabag. (Also: so easy. Don\u2019t forget the can of G&amp;T.) Or pay homage to Succession: is there anything scarier than Logan in a shawl-collar cable knit? Note: you can\u2019t do Stranger Things \u2013 that was old last year. Karl and Choupette The late Karl Lagerfeld and his beloved kitten are the Gomez and Morticia of the 2019 Halloween circuit. For Karl, dust your hair with talcum powder, flip up the collar of your stiffest white shirt and pin in place with a fancy brooch. If you don\u2019t have a brooch, one of those pearl hairclips that are everywhere and a couple of safety pins will do the trick. Add black shades, fingerless gloves, a fan and a can of Diet Coke. For Choupette, white cat ears and a mohair jumper should do it. If you are keen to show off your abs, there is always J-Lo in that green dress on the Versace catwalk. Or for insider fashion lolz, raid secondhand stores for a tweed suit and a boater hat and channel the gatecrasher who stormed the Chanel runway at Paris fashion week this month.",

Yes, you read that right \u2013 the Rees-Mogg clan has a little-known arty streak. Long before Jacob was lounging in front of cameras in parliament, he was making rather different appearances in his Aunt Anne\u2019s experimental films.</p> <p>The works were shown in a former British Rail canteen in north London that had been taken over by a film-makers\u2019 cooperative in the 1970s. There, in a screening area set up at one end of the large, leaky-roofed space, Anne\u2019s filmic collages captured Jacob and his siblings mugging sweetly for the camera. He was, apparently, her favourite. </p> <p>Anne considered herself \u2013 her contemporaries told me \u2013 the black sheep of the family. A committed socialist and champion of women\u2019s and gay rights, her politics could not have been further from those of her conservative Catholic family. Though Jacob remembers her fondly \u2013 \u201cShe even took me to see the first Superman<em> </em>film \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine that could have been her scene\u201d \u2013 her friends and members of the London Filmmakers\u2019 Co-op are less sanguine about the associations of her last name.</p> <p>\u201cShe would have turned in her grave if she knew what Jacob had become,\u201d says <a href=\"http://johnsmithfilms.com/about/\">John Smith</a>, who served with her on the board<strong> </strong>of the co-op, at the time the place to be for artists interested in film-making. \u201cBut she absolutely doted on him. Even as a baby, she would regularly bring him up in conversation.

Her focus on personal memory chimes with later feminist work that took seriously everyday concerns, and her technique of collaging together memories with pop songs and her own lightly self-mocking commentary, feels contemporary. But in the 1970s in London, her films were absolutely beyond the pale.

Yes, you read that right \u2013 the Rees-Mogg clan has a little-known arty streak. Long before Jacob was lounging in front of cameras in parliament, he was making rather different appearances in his Aunt Anne\u2019s experimental films. The works were shown in a former British Rail canteen in north London that had been taken over by a film-makers\u2019 cooperative in the 1970s. There, in a screening area set up at one end of the large, leaky-roofed space, Anne\u2019s filmic collages captured Jacob and his siblings mugging sweetly for the camera. He was, apparently, her favourite. Anne considered herself \u2013 her contemporaries told me \u2013 the black sheep of the family. A committed socialist and champion of women\u2019s and gay rights, her politics could not have been further from those of her conservative Catholic family. Though Jacob remembers her fondly \u2013 \u201cShe even took me to see the first Superman film \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine that could have been her scene\u201d \u2013 her friends and members of the London Filmmakers\u2019 Co-op are less sanguine about the associations of her last name. \u201cShe would have turned in her grave if she knew what Jacob had become,\u201d says John Smith, who served with her on the board of the co-op, at the time the place to be for artists interested in film-making. \u201cBut she absolutely doted on him. Even as a baby, she would regularly bring him up in conversation. She thought he was the most marvellous person on the planet.\u201d The MP for North East Somerset scoffs at this: \u201cI doubt that\u2019s true. I think people say that because I\u2019m known. She was devoted to all her nieces and nephews.\u201d Many children from conservative families leave for art school, discover a new world of social justice, and never look back.

      "bodyText": "Anxiety over a general election has helped to pull the London stock market into the red. As the closing auction ends, the FTSE 100 has finished 25 lower at 7306 points. Oil giant BP was the top faller, down 3.8% after reporting a 40% fall in profits this morning. Utility companies also ended lower, with Centrica down 2.5% and SSE losing 2%. That reflects concerns that a Labour government could impose some sweeping nationalisations. The pound has crept higher, currently up 0.2% at $1.288. However, there\u2019s no guarantee yet that Britain WILL hold a general election in December (MPs will vote on a series of amendments to this plan tonight). That may be all for today, depending on developments.... Over in Washington, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is being grilled by senators over the two 737 Max aeroplane crashes. Muilenburg began his hearing by apologising for mistakes made by Boeing, saying: \u201cWe have made mistakes, and we got some things wrong\u201d But he also faced scrutiny over the critical flight system which has been linked to both crashes. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019s take: Some members of the Senate Commerce Committee clashed with Muilenburg, cutting him off when they believed he was failing to answer their questions about a key flight-control system implicated in both crashes. Boeing successfully lobbied regulators to keep any explanation of the system, called MCAS, from pilot manuals and training. After the crashes, the company tried to blame the pilots, said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \u201cThose pilots never had a chance,\u201d Blumenthal said. Passengers \u201cnever had a chance. They were in flying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding that it was going to conceal MCAS from the pilots.\u201d AP continues: Muilenburg denied that Boeing had ever blamed the pilots. The hearing was taking place exactly one year after a 737 Max flown by Lion Air crashed off the coast of Indonesia, and about seven months after a second crash in Ethiopia. It is the first congressional testimony by a Boeing official since the first of two Max crashes that together killed 346 people. Indonesia investigators say Boeing\u2019s design of a key flight-control system contributed to the crash of a Lion Air Max last October. Another Max crashed in Ethiopia in March, leading to a worldwide grounding of the plane. \u201cBoth of these accidents were entirely preventable,\u201d said Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss. More than a dozen relatives of passengers who died in the accidents attended the hearing. Wicker invited them to stand and hold up large photos of their relatives, which they had carried into the room. Muilenburg turned in his seat to look at them. Thanks to the minimum wage, the proportion of low-paid workers in the UK has dropped to record levels: Uh oh.... Reuters is reporting that the US and China may not succeed in signing a preliminary trade deal next month. That could worry investors; over the weekend there were encouraging noises from Beijing and Washington, fuelling talk that Xi Jinping and Donald Trump could sign this Phase One deal when they meet in November. In a blow to numismatics fans, the UK government is now melting down the commemorative coins is struck to mark Brexit. With the Article 50 deadline now extended until 31 January, there\u2019s not much call for coins marking Brexit on 31 October, alas. But don\u2019t give up hope. Instead, coin collectors can get their hands on a new 50p hailing cartoon heroes Wallace and Gromit [whose antics on the model railway may have inspired Britain\u2019s approach to looming Brexit deadlines....]. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s gender pay gap statistics: Stocks are rising on Wall Street as investors anticipate another cut in US interest rates tomorrow. The Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting today, and is expected to lower borrowing costs for the third time in 2019 on Wednesday. US interest rates are currently 1.75% and 2% -- compared to zero in the eurozone, and -0.1% in Japan. President Trump has just tweeted that the Fed should cut rates aggressively towards zero, at least! Boom! Over in New York, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 is up 7 points, or 0.25%, at 3,047.12. That beats Monday\u2019s all-time high of 3,044. Healthcare stocks, financial companies and industrial companies are the best-performing sectors Office equipment maker Xerox is the top riser, up 15% after posting a 19% jump in pre-tax profits. Pharmaceuticals firms are also pushing the S&amp;P 500 up. Merck (+2.4)% has reported that strong sales of cancer drug Keytruda helped to grow earnings by 27%. Pfizer (+3%) also beat expectations on earnings and revenue in the last quarter, and hiked its guidance. We reported this yesterday, but it bears repeating...Women are paid just \u00a3380,000 on average over their lifetimes compared with \u00a3643,000 for men, \u201cthanks\u201d to the gender pay gap. As this chart shows, US consumer confidence has cooled in recent months, after a long run upwards. That may concern the White House, with just 12 month until the presidential election. Economic news from America: US consumer confidence has fallen this month, in a sign that the economy may be weakening. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index has dipped to 125.9 for October, down from 126.3 in September. Americans interviewed for the survey said their current economic situation had improved, but their future economic expectations have deteriorated. Some expressed concerned about business conditions, and their future job prospects. Confidence levels are still high in historic terms, though: This chart, from the ONS\u2019s gender pay gap report, highlights how older women are hit hardest: Sky News have written about this issue: Older women workers face a stubbornly high gender pay gap while for those under 40 it has narrowed to almost zero, latest official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the gap among all full-time employees stood at 8.9% in 2019, slightly up on 2018 when it was 8.6%. For workers aged 40 to 49, the current gap was 11.4% - having decreased substantially since 1997 when it was 24%. But for those aged 50 and over, the disparity is more than 15% \u201cand is not declining strongly over time\u201d, the ONS said. The report said that one of the reasons for differences in the gender pay gap between age groups was that women over 40 were more likely to work in lower-paid occupations. Jane Gratton, Head of People Policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, says there are several ways to tackle the gender pay gap -- including flexible working and more affordable childcare. \u201cEmployers must identify and remove all barriers to training and career development opportunities to support women into senior level positions and enable parents and carers to thrive in skilled roles. \u201cAs part of our People Campaign, we are working with businesses to promote flexible working, but we need stronger government initiatives to break down the wider barriers. Ensuring access to quality, affordable childcare, better careers advice for young people, and funding for high quality apprenticeships and technical education would go a long way to helping women across all sectors. Sophie Walker, CEO of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, disputes the claim that the gender pay gap for under-40s is almost non-existent. She says many women are forced out of full-time employment, meaning they end up earning far less than male counterparts. Flexible working -- allowing employees to balance parental responsibilities or caring for an elderly relative -- is key to actually fixing the problem, Walker explains: Jon Boys, labour market economist at the CIPD, points out that finance and insurance has a glaring gender pay gap. \u201cOn average, women now earn 91 pence for ever one pound a man earns. However, women working in the finance and insurance sectors earn just 72 pence for every one pound earned by men. In contrast, women working in employment activities, such as recruitment, earned slightly more than their male counterparts. While we must allow for sectoral differences, the rate of change is slow and it\u2019s likely to take years, even decades, before we see real, lasting change across all parts of our economy. Shares in Britain\u2019s utility firms have fallen since Labour announced its backing for a December general election (which MPs will vote on tonight). United Utilities (-2.2%), Centrica (-2%). Seven Trent (-1.7%) and National Grid (-1.4%) are all among the top fallers on the FTSE 100 today. Investors are reacting to the possibility that Jeremy Corbyn becomes the next prime minister, and launches a sweeping renationalisation programme. Paul Dales of Capital Economics told clients that the election result could have a big impact on the markets: A hardish Brexit would probably hinder equities of homebuilders and financials, while Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans would hurt equities of utilities. Both would prevent a huge surge in the pound. But Oliver Blackbourn of Janus Henderson Investors points out that the election might not be decisive: An election could be the much-needed unblocker for the clogged political drain that is Brexit. However, the result needs to be decisive in favour of the pro-leave Conservative Party or the anti-no-deal rainbow of opposition parties. A narrow Tory victory, requiring support from elsewhere to form a workable government, could simply leave us in the same clogged political situation. However, it is also unclear how a coalition of Labour, Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party would coalesce around a target Brexit outcome, let alone wider policy objectives. The rise in the full-time gender pay gap last year could be a one-off. ONS statistician Roger Smith points out that there was an upward blip six years ago, which later reversed: \u201cWe also saw an increase in 2013 followed by a return to downward trend in subsequent years. However, the downward trend is a slow one regardless.\u201d Back in the markets, the pound has shaken off its early losses after the Labour party decided to back an early general election. Sterling had been down half a cent this morning, but has now bounced back to $1.286 - unchanged on the day. Traders may be hoping that an election will clear some of the uncertainty and deadlock away -- perhaps giving Boris Jonson a workable majority to push his deal through with. Analyst Stephen Innes, though, points out that elections aren\u2019t predictable.... ...especially with the Liberal Democrats doing well in the polls, and the Brexit Party also in the mix: There is some good news this morning: pay rose four times as fast for Britain\u2019s lowest earners compared to its high earners. The ONS\u2019s Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) shows that the pay of Britain\u2019s 10% lowest paid workers grew by 4.3% in the last year, while the 90th percentile only grew by 1%. As this chart shows, Britain\u2019s minimum wage has helping to lift the earnings of the lowest paid. Now, more than 10% of employee jobs are paid at, or within 20 pence of, the National Minimum Wage hourly rate (\u00a38.21 per hour for over 25s). However, with average real wages still lower than in 2008, there\u2019s not much else to cheer. Nye Cominetti, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, says: \u201cPay growth for the typical worker in Britain returned close to pre-crisis norms over the past year, but this follows a disastrous decade meaning pay remains below pre-crisis levels. \u201cBut there have been notable exceptions. Britain\u2019s lowest earners enjoyed the strongest pay rises last year as a result of another big increase in the National Living Wage. As a result, their earnings grew at least four times as fast as for Britain\u2019s top earners. \u201cThe strong pay performance for the lowest earners \u2013 on both an hourly and a weekly basis \u2013 fully vindicates that ambition of both main parties for a higher minimum wage. But more work will be need to get everyone else\u2019s pay packets beyond where they were before the crisis.\u201d There\u2019s almost no gender pay gap between younger workers (under 40), according to today\u2019s survey. But for older workers, the gap is still significant. The ONE says: For age groups under 40 years, the gender pay gap for full-time employees is now close to zero. Among 40- to 49-year-olds the gap (currently 11.4%) has decreased substantially over time. Among 50- to 59- year-olds and those over 60 years, the gender pay gap is over 15% and is not declining strongly over time. One of the reasons for differences in the gender pay gap between age groups is that women over 40 years are more likely to work in lower-paid occupations and, compared with younger women, are less likely to work as managers, directors or senior officials. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has warned that the gender pay gap will persist for decades, unless there is more action to help women close the gap with male workers. She says: \u201cOur economy is still stacked against working women. At this rate, it will take decades to close the gender pay gap. \u201cGovernment must pick up the pace. It\u2019s clear that publishing gender pay gaps isn\u2019t enough on its own. Companies must also be legally required to explain how they\u2019ll close them. \u201cAnd bosses who don\u2019t pay women fairly should be fined.\u201d The TUC has also flagged up another new ONS report into pay, which shows real wages (after inflation) are still lower than in 2008. Frances blames the austerity measures imposed since the financial crisis: \u201cThe Conservatives have presided over the worst wage squeeze since Napoleonic times. \u201cYears of austerity and inaction have deepened Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. It\u2019s about time politicians deliver for working families and get wages rising.\u201d The gender pay gap is particularly wide among the best-paid workers: The ONS have created a neat interactive tool that lets examine the gender pay gap across the UK economy..... The largest gender pay gap among all employees is in carpenters and joiners (44%) and energy plant operatives (41%), the Office for National Statistics reports. The lowest is in archivists and curators (negative 36%), and personal assistants and other secretaries (negative 25%). in 2019 there was a gender pay gap of greater than zero in: 79% of occupations based on all employees 81% based on full-time employees 43% based on part-time employees The pay gap between men and women working as managers, directors, or other senior roles actually widened by 2% in the last year. That sector of the jobs market has the second-highest gender pay gap, at almost 16%. The widest gap was recorded among \u2018skilled trades\u2019, where men working full-time get 22% more than women. Here\u2019s the details from today\u2019s gender pay gap report: Just in: the pay gap between men and women working full-time in the UK has widened, despite efforts to tackle the problem. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the UK\u2019s full-time gender pay gap has widened to 8.9% this year, from 8.6% in 2018, in men\u2019s favour. For part-time workers, the gap narrowed from - 4.9% to -3.1% (meaning women still earned more than men for part-time work). The gender pay gap among all employees fell from 17.8% in 2018 to 17.3%, so there has been some progress. The ONS argues that the rise in the full-time gender pay gap (from 8.6% to 8.9%) isn\u2019t statistically significant. But it does show that women in full-time work are suffering an earnings hit. As this chart shows, the full-time gender pay gap fell steadily from 1997 to 2012, but has been stubbornly steady since. The ONS attributes the gender pay gap to the impact of women leaving the labour force (often to care for young children), and then returning part time or at a lower level: The proportion of employees who held full-time jobs rather than part-time jobs increased more for women than men, but new entrants or returners to full-time jobs are likely to start from a lower pay level and may reduce average pay for full-time women employees. The three occupations that saw the largest increase in the proportion of full-time employee jobs held by women were: sales and customer service, elementary occupations and process, and plant and machine operatives; these all have a lower than average rate of hourly pay and will reduce the average full-time earnings among women. More to follow.... The Bank of England\u2019s new data also confirms that the UK mortgage market remained subdued. It says: Mortgage market indicators point to continued stability in the market. Net mortgage borrowing by households was little changed at \u00a33.8 billion in September. The stability in the monthly flows has left the annual growth rate unchanged at 3.2%. Growth rates have now remained close to this figure for the past three years. Mortgage approvals for house purchase (an indicator for future lending) were also broadly unchanged in September, at 66,000, and remained within the narrow range seen over the past three years. Mortgage approvals for remortgage strengthened slightly to 49,000. Breaking: UK consumer credit growth has hit its lowest level in five years. New data from the Bank of England shows that growth in consumer credit slowed to 6.0% in the year to September - the lowest since 2014. It\u2019s another sign that consumers are retrenching in the face of ongoing Brexit confusion. The BoE points out: This growth rate has now been falling steadily for nearly three years. Today\u2019s data also shows that net credit card borrowing weakened on the month to \u00a30.1 billion, the lowest since December 2018. Here\u2019s more details from the report: The net flow of consumer credit was \u00a30.8 billion in September, remaining below the \u00a31.1 billion average since July 2018. Net mortgage borrowing by households was little changed at \u00a33.8 billion in September, close to the average of the past three years. Net finance raised by UK businesses was relatively strong in September, rising to \u00a39.7 billion. This primarily reflected \u00a36.5 billion net issuance of bonds and \u00a32.9 billion of borrowing from banks. Shares in UK housebuilders and banks are all down this morning, hit by Brexit worries and the ongoing house price stagnation. Royal Bank of Scotland has shed 2% and Lloyds Banking Group has lost 1.6% - they\u2019re both vulnerable to fears of an economic slowdown. Housebuilders are also among the fallers on the FTSE 100, with Taylor Wimpey down 1.5%. This has pulled the blue-chip index down by 28 points, or 0.4%, to 7302. Connor Campbell says Nationwide\u2019s house price report is weighing on the City: A further slowdown in house price growth weighed on the likes of Barratt Developments, Berkeley Group and Taylor Wimpey. The index\u2019s banking sector was also in a bad mood, likely because Boris Johnson, with help from the SNP and Lib Dems, is formulating a new way to get to a December election after losing a vote on Monday. The other European stock markets have also dipped this morning, after hitting 21-month highs yesterday. Caveat emptor and all that, but there an argument that now is a good time to launch into the property market - given prices are barely rising. With Brexit uncertainty weighing down demand, buyers might get a bargain. Or they could conclude that staying on the sidelines makes more sense, in case the UK economy is dragged into recession. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, explains the two sides of the argument: \u201cAs the Brexit drama lurches into yet another encore, buyers are splitting into two camps \u2013 those who see the current slow market as a threat to be waited out, and those who view it as good time to strike. \u201cOn the \u2018hold off\u2019 side of the argument, there is the understandable reluctance to buy a home that may be cheaper tomorrow. \u201cBut the \u2018buy now\u2019 counterargument is that the combination of soft prices, lower competition for homes and fast-rising wages has opened a window of opportunity \u2013 begging the question \u2018if not now, when?\u2019 \u201cWhether we are at the edge or the eye of the storm remains to be seen, and the prospect of another general election will inject a further dose of uncertainty into proceedings. Back on UK house prices... Nationwide\u2019s report also confirms that UK property is still very pricey compared to earnings, although there has been some progress recently (as wages have picked up, and property prices have stagnated). Geopolitical uncertainty and extreme weather also hurt BP\u2019s profits, points out Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor: An average oil price of $62 for the quarter compared with $75 the previous year, driven by weak demand and the political situations in the likes of Iran and Venezuela. While this puts an immediate strain on profit, the level is comfortably above the $55 per barrel number which BP uses as a yardstick to break even. In addition, ongoing maintenance and Hurricane Barry affected Upstream operations in particular, where earnings were sharply lower. Over in the City....profits at BP have fallen sharply as global oil prices tumble amid gloomy forecasts for the global economy. My colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: The oil major reported underlying profits of $2.3bn (\u00a31.76bn) for the last three months on Tuesday morning, compared to $3.8bn in the same months last year. The decline comes just weeks after BP announced that chief executive Bob Dudley will step down after almost a decade at the helm. Dudley blamed weaker global oil prices, a string of one-off financial costs and the impact of Hurricane Barry which dealt a \u201csignificant\u201d blow to its oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in July. Shares in BP have dipped almost 1% in early trading, down 4.4p at 507p. Marc von Grundherr, director of London estate agent Benham and Reeves, predicts that house price growth will pick up, if political gloom lifts: While the black cat of Brexit uncertainty continues to cross the path of UK home sellers a chill in the rate of house price growth is to be expected. We\u2019ve seen yet more spells of uncertainty cast across the property landscape of late and this, coupled with a seasonal slowdown in the lead up to Christmas, will do little to bring a spark back to the market this side of the New Year. Howard Archer of EY Item Club predicts that house price inflation will remain muted: With the economy largely struggling and the outlook highly uncertain, we suspect that house prices will remain soft in the near term at least. House prices on the Nationwide\u2019s measure may struggle to rise more than 0.5% over 2019 \u2013 and house prices are unlikely to rise more than 1% on most other measures. Archer also predicts prices could tumble by 5% if Britain were to leave the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement (a risk that has been delayed until January 2020). Average house price growth has been falling steadily since the Brexit referendum, as this chart from Nationwide shows: Nationwide also flags up that the number of people taking out mortgages has remained below the long-term average since the financial crisis.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s housing market remains firmly in a rut, as Brexit uncertainty and the prospect of a general election deters people from buying their first home, or moving house. That\u2019s the message from the Nationwide Building Society this morning. Its monthly house price index, just released, shows that prices only rose by 0.4% in the last year. That makes October the 11th month in a row where prices have risen by less than 1% -- below wage growth and consumer price inflation. During October alone, prices did rise by 0.2%, reversing a 0.2% decline in September, but the overall picture remains very subdued. Encouraging for first-time buyers, if they have the financial resources and confidence to jump onto the housing ladder. But also a sign that economic confidence remains weak. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, cites uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. \u201cIndicators of UK economic activity have been fairly volatile in recent quarters, but the underlying pace of growth appears to have slowed as a result of weaker global growth and an intensifying of Brexit uncertainty. To date, the slowdown has centred on business investment, while household spending has been more resilient. With Brexit now postponed for another three months, there\u2019s no immediate end to this uncertainty... Gardner also points out that the UK jobs market appeared to soften over the summer, with employment down and unemployment up. If Brexit uncertainty lifts in the months ahead, hiring is likely to recover, although there may be some upward pressure on mortgage rates as investors once again contemplate the potential for UK rate increases in the years ahead. Nationwide\u2019s warning comes a day after the CBI reported that UK retailers are stockpiling at record levels to cope with Brexit, and the Christmas rush, Many also reported that sales were disappointing - another sign of consumer caution. More reaction to follow.... Also coming up today Optimism that the US and China are making progress towards a trade deal is supporting markets, after Wall Street hit a record high last night. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says investors are being tempted back into stocks and emerging market currencies, while selling bonds. Markets have started the week with equities higher, bond yields rising and risk-sensitive currencies having a blast. The Argentine Peso and Turkish Lira lead the charge this week. However, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet could dampen the mood after reporting a 23% drop in profits Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg will face Congress later today over the two Boeing 737 MAX crashes in the last year in which 346 people died. He\u2019s expected to admit that the company made mistakes, and pledge to fix the currently-grounded plane.

      "bodyText": "The standoff at People\u2019s Vote has escalated after about 40 staff called for the resignation of their chairman, Roland Rudd, who has sacked two senior executives and was planning to make a number of new appointments later on Tuesday. The bulk of staff working on the campaign for a second referendum went to confront Rudd at a meeting in a hotel, after he fired James McGrory as campaign director and Tom Baldwin as media director over the weekend. The staff had believed they were to meet Rudd, a City PR firm boss, in their Millbank offices in London on Tuesday morning, with McGrory and Baldwin having vowed to turn up to work as usual. However, Rudd changed the location to the Hilton hotel next door and staff supportive of the sacked executives initially declined to attend. They later moved en masse to the Hilton, where security guards denied entry to Baldwin and McGrory. Following the meeting with Rudd and his new acting chief executive, Patrick Heneghan, 40 staff members said they had no confidence in Rudd and called on him to quit, while three came out in favour. McGrory, who still describes himself as director of People\u2019s Vote, said: \u201cWe are asking Rudd and Heneghan to quit because no one \u2013 least of all the millions of people in the country who are desperate for us to succeed \u2013 can allow boardroom politics to overshadow the real politics taking place on Brexit. \u201cThis has been a brilliant cross-party campaign and this is a crucial week in the fight to stop Boris Johnson forcing his Brexit on the people.

One board member also disputed the idea that Rudd had been trying to improve its governance by merging it with other pro-European organisations, saying this had been the idea of the campaign\u2019s management.

      "body": "<p>A new split has emerged in the Labour party over a matter more urgent than Brexit: the sexuality of giraffes. \u201cNinety per cent of giraffes are gay,\u201d Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/10/28/dawn-butler-gay-giraffes-jeremy-corbyn-lachlan-stuart-lgbt-alliance/\" title=\"\">told a PinkNews awards event</a> earlier this month. \u201cLet\u2019s just accept people for who they are and live as our true, authentic selves.\u201d</p> <p>Butler\u2019s words were meant as praise for the school curriculum, which teaches children that it is normal for people to be gay. However, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior domestic policy adviser, Lachlan Stuart, responded angrily on Twitter over what he felt it also meant about gay people. \u201cIt is a ludicrous, offensive, homophobic claim,\u201d Stuart said, insisting instead that the same-sex physical contact observed between giraffes in the wild is \u201cnot gay behaviour\u201d at all, but a display of dominance.</p> <p>According to Stephanie Fennessy, director of the <a href=\"https://giraffeconservation.org/\" title=\"\">Giraffe Conservation Foundation</a> in Namibia, Stuart is right. \u201cWhile I totally agree with Dawn Butler\u2019s comment that we should accept people for who they are, she is incorrect in her comment that giraffes are gay,\u201d Fennessy says. \u201cSometimes they fake-hump each other, which is also dominance behaviour. Dogs do that as well. And when you see them necking, it\u2019s fighting. It\u2019s vicious. They can kill each other.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/natalie-cooper.html\" title=\"\">Dr Natalie Cooper</a>, a researcher in life sciences at the Natural History Museum, sees things slightly differently. According to her understanding of giraffe research, same-sex necking, licking, nuzzling and mounting is not always an aggressive act. Indeed, it may not be aggressive at all, and sometimes includes genital stimulation. It is common among males, but has been seen among females too. \u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t think we have enough research to know why the males do it,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThere are usually females around, so it\u2019s not just because there are no females.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, it is probably a mistake to call any giraffes \u201cgay\u201d. \u201cGiraffes don\u2019t have a sexual orientation,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThat\u2019s a human thing.\u201d In any case, whatever their same-sex predilections, all giraffes have heterosexual sex as well, or at least they try to. Nor do they form couples of any kind. Adult females live together in herds, and only mate with the transient males who manage to be dominant enough, or surreptitious enough, to visit them at the right time. Afterwards, the male leaves, and takes no role in rearing any offspring. If most giraffes have any \u201ctrue, authentic selves\u201d, in short, they would be bisexual, aromantic. And, as fathers, they set a very bad example.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new split has emerged in the Labour party over a matter more urgent than Brexit: the sexuality of giraffes. \u201cNinety per cent of giraffes are gay,\u201d Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, told a PinkNews awards event earlier this month. \u201cLet\u2019s just accept people for who they are and live as our true, authentic selves.\u201d Butler\u2019s words were meant as praise for the school curriculum, which teaches children that it is normal for people to be gay. However, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior domestic policy adviser, Lachlan Stuart, responded angrily on Twitter over what he felt it also meant about gay people. \u201cIt is a ludicrous, offensive, homophobic claim,\u201d Stuart said, insisting instead that the same-sex physical contact observed between giraffes in the wild is \u201cnot gay behaviour\u201d at all, but a display of dominance. According to Stephanie Fennessy, director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation in Namibia, Stuart is right. \u201cWhile I totally agree with Dawn Butler\u2019s comment that we should accept people for who they are, she is incorrect in her comment that giraffes are gay,\u201d Fennessy says. \u201cSometimes they fake-hump each other, which is also dominance behaviour. Dogs do that as well. And when you see them necking, it\u2019s fighting. It\u2019s vicious. They can kill each other.\u201d Dr Natalie Cooper, a researcher in life sciences at the Natural History Museum, sees things slightly differently. According to her understanding of giraffe research, same-sex necking, licking, nuzzling and mounting is not always an aggressive act. Indeed, it may not be aggressive at all, and sometimes includes genital stimulation. It is common among males, but has been seen among females too. \u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t think we have enough research to know why the males do it,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThere are usually females around, so it\u2019s not just because there are no females.\u201d Even so, it is probably a mistake to call any giraffes \u201cgay\u201d. \u201cGiraffes don\u2019t have a sexual orientation,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThat\u2019s a human thing.\u201d In any case, whatever their same-sex predilections, all giraffes have heterosexual sex as well, or at least they try to. Nor do they form couples of any kind. Adult females live together in herds, and only mate with the transient males who manage to be dominant enough, or surreptitious enough, to visit them at the right time. Afterwards, the male leaves, and takes no role in rearing any offspring. If most giraffes have any \u201ctrue, authentic selves\u201d, in short, they would be bisexual, aromantic. And, as fathers, they set a very bad example.",

Witham told the committee that the NHS was not set up to handle such a situation. \u201cHistorically the NHS has been designed, or has evolved, to deal with single problems in single organ systems, and has evolved really to deal with episodic care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is less good and less well designed at dealing with chronic care and it is particularly poorly equipped to deal with multiple problems affecting a single person.\u201d The experts said efforts to prevent multi-morbidities (the incidence of a particular disease in a specific locality) arising in the first place are important, potentially including drugs that mimic exercise or calorie restriction, boost immune response to vaccines or help clean up so-called \u201csenescent cells\u201d associated with ageing. But they stressed it was important to carry out clinical trials in older people \u2013 and in particular those with multiple health problems. Until recently, said Witham, most trials had a cutoff age of 65. \u201cFortunately explicit exclusion on the criteria of age is less common now, but unfortunately people are still excluded because of multimorbidity, which means that the overall effect is actually the same.\u201d The upshot, he said, was that the evidence gained from clinical trials is \u201cactually not fit for purpose in many cases\u201d because it does not apply to the people who are given the treatments. \u201cWe need to be working with investigators and with industry partners to say bring these people into trials, accept the fact that there is going to be some messiness, that you are probably going to need to bring more people in, accept the fact that the costs are likely to be higher,\u201d said Witham.",

Zac Goldsmith, a junior environment minister, said the government had been working on a law to ban the owners of estates from repeatedly burning heather on their moorlands to help boost the numbers of grouse for shooting.

      "bodyText": "Investigators in Cumbria are trying to establish how a man managed to climb an 88-metre (290ft) chimney with no ladder at ground level. The man, in his 50s, died on Monday afternoon after being stuck at the top of Dixon\u2019s Chimney in Carlisle for more than 14 hours. The man, who has not yet been named, was first spotted up the chimney at 2.20am on Monday. The call sparked a major rescue, which included the help of Cumbria fire and rescue, a coastguard helicopter, police, paramedics, Great North air ambulance, Penrith mountain rescue team, and rope rescue specialists from the Lancashire fire and rescue service. By dawn he was hanging upside down from one foot, bare-chested despite the morning mist and sub-zero temperatures. He was still alive at about 10.30am when the fire service flew a drone to the top of the chimney with a speaker on it, asking him to move an arm or a leg if he could hear them. They also used a thermal camera to establish whether he was still breathing. Rescuing the man proved difficult because of concerns over how securely he was attached to the ladder at the top of the chimney, Supt Matt Kennerley said on Monday. A helicopter rescue was aborted amid concerns of backdrafts, which could have knocked the man to the ground. He was dead by the time he was rescued at 4.45pm using a cherry-picker brought down from Scotland. The Cumbria fire and rescue service did not have a ladder long enough to reach him and appealed for help across the border. The chimney ladder, which is damaged, is temporary and does not start until about 4.5 metres (15ft) above ground level, according to Carlisle city council, raising the question of how the man managed to climb on to the chimney. A Carlisle city council spokesperson said the chimney had recently been repaired by specialist contractors, and was not accessible to the public. \u201cThe site is secure and is surrounded by a walled and gated compound. There is no direct access to the chimney from ground level. The ladders which are currently attached to the structure are temporary and were installed by the contractor to facilitate access to complete maintenance repairs. These start from a height of 15ft above the ground. We are working with our specialist contractor to remove the ladders,\u201d the spokesperson said. Dozens of rescue workers and police officers were involved, some drafted in from as far afield as Glasgow and Lancashire. Cumbria police said: \u201cThe thoughts of all the emergency services and partners are with the family and friends of the man.

      "bodyText": "The 50p coins minted to commemorate Brexit on 31 October are to be \u201crecycled\u201d, the Treasury has confirmed. The decision comes after ministers agreed last week to \u201cpause\u201d production of the special-edition coin by the Royal Mint because of concerns that plans to leave the EU at the end of the month were unlikely to be fulfilled. It is understood that thousands of coins with Thursday\u2019s date on them will be melted down and the metal kept aside until the next Brexit date is agreed. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cWe will still produce a coin to mark our departure from the EU.\u201d The coins were supposed to mark Britain\u2019s departure at the end of the month but the Treasury told the Royal Mint to begin stockpiling last week. Officials waited before making a final decision about the coins until the EU heads of state agreed an extension to the Brexit deadline and it was clear that parliament would prevent the UK from crashing out without a deal on 31 October. Once an extension was agreed on Monday and No 10 had made it clear its preference was to have a general election, officials were given the all clear to prepare for a future Brexit date. About 3m coins were due to be ready to go into circulation under plans put in place by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. The coins bore the inscription \u201cPeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u201d, above the leave date: 31 October 2019. The cost of designing and producing commemorative coins was met by the Mint out of its own revenues, the Treasury said, and the costs of recycling would also be met by the Mint. There was speculation that the thousands of coins minted so far could fetch a premium on the 50p cover price, possibly selling for as much as \u00a3800 each. However, Brexit coins bearing the October date \u201cwill now be recycled\u201d, the Treasury said. Javid\u2019s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for \u00a310 each in time for the first deadline on 29 March.",

      "bodyText": "Election officials are pressing for the right to delay an election count if severe weather puts the safety of their staff at risk on polling day. The Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA), which represents returning officers who employ count and polling station staff, said existing legislation gave them too little scope for delaying counts during extreme weather. They fear a snap general election in mid-December increases the risk that severe weather will make travelling far more risky for staff and count observers, and want the powers to postpone a count to the following day in the worst-affected areas. Councils in exposed or mountainous constituencies are seen as the most vulnerable to heavy snow, severe cold, flooding and gales, but flooding can affect low-lying and urban seats too. During the European Union referendum in June 2016, flash flooding impeded voting in central London. Last week, the Lib Dem MP Tim Farron warned that his constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale had been hit by three severe floods at this time of year in the last 15 years. Council officials in Shetland, part of the Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland, have warned of the logistical and safety challenges of flying all their ballot boxes to the count centre, which is normally in Kirkwall, the main town in Orkney. There are 34 inhabited islands in Orkney and Shetland, many of which are connected by ferry and plane and vulnerable to winter gales. A mid-winter election is likely to lead to increased take-up of postal votes in these places. The last December general election took place in 1923. All recent elections have taken place in April, May or June. The last polling day in winter was on 28 February 1974. The Met Office said it was close to freezing that day in large parts of Wales, northern England and Scotland. Stornoway in the Western Isles experienced storm-force winds gusting to 69mph (111km/h) and 40mm (1.6in) of rain fell across western England and Wales. The AEA said election law required returning officers to take \u201call reasonable steps\u201d to stage a count as soon as practicable after polls closed at 10pm in a UK election, but no later than four hours after polls closed. Laura Lock, the association\u2019s deputy chief executive, said that put the onus on returning officers to get counting staff and ballot boxes to a count during darkness in mid-winter rather than prioritise safety by postponing the count until the next day. If they fail to start a count within four hours of polls closing, they have to justify their decision to the Electoral Commission in writing. They face losing their election fee, and professional embarrassment, if the commission rules they should not have postponed the count. Lock said some constituencies covered huge geographical areas. \u201cDo returning officers want to say to their staff, who may need to do a 100-mile round trip to drop off ballot boxes: \u2018Do you want to stay home and keep safe and travel in the morning?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYes, we completely understand we want a quick result [in a general election].

      "body": "<p>Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Saad Hariri, has announced his resignation, in a move set to spark further uncertainty in a country paralysed by political dysfunction and nationwide protests.</p> <p>Hariri\u2019s announcement came several hours after hundreds of youths overran protest sites in downtown Beirut, ransacking tents and stalls set up by demonstrators who, for the past 13 days, have demanded an overhaul of the ruling class and an end to rampant corruption.</p> <p>The embattled leader said he intended to make a \u201cpositive shock\u201d by quitting, claiming that doing so served \u201cthe country\u2019s dignity and safety\u201d. Over the past fortnight, he has tabled reforms, including the abolition of several cabinet positions and some cuts to spending, but the moves have fallen short of the structural changes demanded by protesters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"04d768020dad2503b19f5b0edccb1c401c8141ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/04d768020dad2503b19f5b0edccb1c401c8141ae/0_33_2703_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saad Hariri\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saad Hariri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Azakir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The protests have left politicians scrambling unsuccessfully to react and have exposed the depth of feeling in Lebanon, where an imminent economic collapse threatens to cripple the country\u2019s banking system and social fabric.</p> <p>The depth of the crisis and lack of political solutions have galvanised Lebanese citizens from all political persuasions and walks of life, leading to a movement that shows little sign of slowing down, even after the main protest site was ransacked on Tuesday.</p> <p>The assault was blamed by demonstrators on two factions, Hezbollah and Amal, whose political leaders do not support a change in government. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, the most powerful figure in Lebanon despite not holding an official position, has warned of chaos if protests were allowed to continue.</p> <p>Hariri\u2019s supporters spent much of Tuesday trying to talk him out of quitting, fearing even deeper instability in Lebanon, where political uncertainty and extreme levels of government debt have caused widespread alarm and spilled over into mass demonstrations, the scale of which had not been seen for more than a decade.</p> <p>\u201cI know for sure that the main target is the top of the system,\u201d said Ali Dirani, a 33-year-old protester. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a domino effect; what I expect is that Hariri is expendable for the regime that we\u2019re trying to topple. What people should focus on now is that we need to find an alternative. We have a problem that is rooted in the system of decision-making and the relationship between citizen and state.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past fortnight, the streets of central Beirut have become a forum for debate and defiant demands for change. Emboldened by the cross-sectarian movement and sensing there is more to lose by staying home, protesters have been unusually strident in their criticism of leaders, including Hariri and Nasrallah and dynasties that have run the country since the end of the civil war.</p> <p>Much of the country\u2019s political leadership remains invested in a status quo of a weak central government and institutions being run as political fiefdoms. There are some who are not interested in the type of reform being demanded on the street, according to Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East centre.</p> <p>Albert Letayf, a senior investment banker at Levantine Partners consultants, said: \u201cThe young guys I\u2019m speaking with have a new way of looking at things. They are saying: \u2018We have all been deceived and we are not leaving until we have changed all these leaders\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Camille Abu Sleiman, who resigned as labour minister earlier this month, said: \u201cAlthough late, we welcome his resignation and hope he will go through with it, as the people of Lebanon have clearly lost confidence in this government.\u201d</p> <p>Rose, 26, was protesting in central Beirut when she heard that Hariri had gone. \u201cWe just want to say that this is the first out of many,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the others to show some dignity. But I doubt they have it.\u201d</p> <p>Letayf said confidence in the economy had disappeared, making a recovery impossible without real political reform. Lebanon is heavily dependant on foreign aid and money sent home by expatriates. Earlier this year, France pledged up to $11bn in return for structural reforms, which cut to the heart of ingrained corruption.</p> <p>However, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has so far withheld payment because the political class has been reluctant to make changes.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where Macron can\u2019t send money to Hariri or anyone else, because his deputies will rightly say half the country is on the streets saying they\u2019re corrupt,\u201d said Maha Yahya. \u201cThings cannot go back to the way they were. This is a tipping point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople feel there is nothing to lose. There is now such broad opposition to political sectarianism across the spectrum and that is a real change that many thought they would never see. The restoration of Lebanese identity is powerful.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Nadia al-Faour</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, Saad Hariri, has announced his resignation, in a move set to spark further uncertainty in a country paralysed by political dysfunction and nationwide protests. Hariri\u2019s announcement came several hours after hundreds of youths overran protest sites in downtown Beirut, ransacking tents and stalls set up by demonstrators who, for the past 13 days, have demanded an overhaul of the ruling class and an end to rampant corruption. The embattled leader said he intended to make a \u201cpositive shock\u201d by quitting, claiming that doing so served \u201cthe country\u2019s dignity and safety\u201d. Over the past fortnight, he has tabled reforms, including the abolition of several cabinet positions and some cuts to spending, but the moves have fallen short of the structural changes demanded by protesters. The protests have left politicians scrambling unsuccessfully to react and have exposed the depth of feeling in Lebanon, where an imminent economic collapse threatens to cripple the country\u2019s banking system and social fabric. The depth of the crisis and lack of political solutions have galvanised Lebanese citizens from all political persuasions and walks of life, leading to a movement that shows little sign of slowing down, even after the main protest site was ransacked on Tuesday. The assault was blamed by demonstrators on two factions, Hezbollah and Amal, whose political leaders do not support a change in government. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, the most powerful figure in Lebanon despite not holding an official position, has warned of chaos if protests were allowed to continue. Hariri\u2019s supporters spent much of Tuesday trying to talk him out of quitting, fearing even deeper instability in Lebanon, where political uncertainty and extreme levels of government debt have caused widespread alarm and spilled over into mass demonstrations, the scale of which had not been seen for more than a decade. \u201cI know for sure that the main target is the top of the system,\u201d said Ali Dirani, a 33-year-old protester. \u201cI don\u2019t expect a domino effect; what I expect is that Hariri is expendable for the regime that we\u2019re trying to topple. What people should focus on now is that we need to find an alternative. We have a problem that is rooted in the system of decision-making and the relationship between citizen and state.\u201d Over the past fortnight, the streets of central Beirut have become a forum for debate and defiant demands for change. Emboldened by the cross-sectarian movement and sensing there is more to lose by staying home, protesters have been unusually strident in their criticism of leaders, including Hariri and Nasrallah and dynasties that have run the country since the end of the civil war. Much of the country\u2019s political leadership remains invested in a status quo of a weak central government and institutions being run as political fiefdoms. There are some who are not interested in the type of reform being demanded on the street, according to Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East centre. Albert Letayf, a senior investment banker at Levantine Partners consultants, said: \u201cThe young guys I\u2019m speaking with have a new way of looking at things. They are saying: \u2018We have all been deceived and we are not leaving until we have changed all these leaders\u2019.\u201d Camille Abu Sleiman, who resigned as labour minister earlier this month, said: \u201cAlthough late, we welcome his resignation and hope he will go through with it, as the people of Lebanon have clearly lost confidence in this government.\u201d Rose, 26, was protesting in central Beirut when she heard that Hariri had gone. \u201cWe just want to say that this is the first out of many,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for the others to show some dignity. But I doubt they have it.\u201d Letayf said confidence in the economy had disappeared, making a recovery impossible without real political reform. Lebanon is heavily dependant on foreign aid and money sent home by expatriates. Earlier this year, France pledged up to $11bn in return for structural reforms, which cut to the heart of ingrained corruption. However, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has so far withheld payment because the political class has been reluctant to make changes. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where Macron can\u2019t send money to Hariri or anyone else, because his deputies will rightly say half the country is on the streets saying they\u2019re corrupt,\u201d said Maha Yahya. \u201cThings cannot go back to the way they were. This is a tipping point.\u201d \u201cPeople feel there is nothing to lose. There is now such broad opposition to political sectarianism across the spectrum and that is a real change that many thought they would never see. The restoration of Lebanese identity is powerful.\u201d Additional reporting by Nadia al-Faour",

      "body": "<p>The Democratic congresswoman Katie Hill <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/27/politics/katie-hill-announces-resignation/index.html\">has resigned</a> after being accused of violating House ethics rules by having a sexual relationship with staffers, and possibly using her position to grant improper favors. Members of her own party made it clear she did not have their support, with Nancy Pelosi <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/28/20936067/katie-hill-resigns-allegations-improper-relationships-revenge-porn\">saying</a> that Hill \u201chas acknowledged errors in judgement that made her continued service as a member untenable\u201d. Hill\u2019s case may seem straightforward: she violated the rules, she abused her office, she has to go. But there\u2019s much more to it, and we should be disturbed at the speed with which Hill was forced out of office before completing a single term.</p> <p>Hill is one of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/10/23/20928700/katie-hill-congresswoman-resigns-leaked-red-state\">first openly bisexual</a> members of Congress, and at age 32 was considered a rising star among the freshman class. This month, the conservative website RedState began revealing details about Hill\u2019s sex life. Hill was alleged to have to been in a polyamorous relationship with her husband and a female campaign staffer, as well as to have had an affair with her male legislative director. Hill acknowledged the relationship with the female staffer but denied having a relationship with the legislative director. Because the House of Representatives has a new, post-MeToo rule prohibiting sexual relations between members of Congress and staff, an investigation into Hill\u2019s potentially unethical sex life was announced.</p> <p>It\u2019s understandable to look into allegations of relationships between congresspeople and staff. After all, the rule was put in place because of the disturbing power imbalances present in such situations, and the House certainly has to look into evidence that Hill may have used her position to <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7618895/Rep-Katie-Hill-paid-5-000-campaign-bonus-male-aide-having-affair-with.html\">offer</a> financial and employment rewards to those she was in relationships with. But the way details of Hill\u2019s sex life have been exposed, and Hill\u2019s claim that her career is being ended by a vindictive husband, should give us serious pause before jumping to conclusions.</p> <p>The media did not only publish evidence that Hill violated ethics rules. It also published photographs of her naked body. The Daily Mail offered its readers \u201cshocking\u201d photos of Hill nude, saying that her \u201cwild lifestyle has been laid bare in a cache of texts and intimate photographs\u201d. (The wild lifestyle consists of being naked, kissing a woman, and possibly smoking marijuana.) The Mail did not name its source, but it appears likely to have been Hill\u2019s husband, who she claims is trying to get revenge on her. The husband said in his divorce complaint <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/10/25/katie-hill-asked-estranged-husband-to-be-stay-at-home-house-husband-report/\">that he was upset</a> Hill wanted him to be a \u201chouse husband\u201d who stayed home and did chores.</p> <p>It\u2019s outrageous that any newspaper would publish these kinds of photos.

No wonder Katie Hill <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/28/after-resigning-rep-katie-hill-vows-battle-revenge-porn-which-critics-blame-her-downfall/\">has vowed</a> to use her post-congressional career to fight \u201crevenge porn\u201d. The way Hill\u2019s sex life has been sensationalized \u2013 with headlines like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/swing-district-katie-hill-2020-rivals-seize-on-leaked-naked-photo-as-campaign-issue\">swing district</a>\u201d \u2013 certainly makes public service a less appealing career.

The prohibition on sexual relationships with staffers is new, and there is something disturbing about the fact that after untold numbers of men have had such relationships in congressional history, the first person whose career will be ended under the new rules is a young queer woman.</p> <p>Hill\u2019s situation raises a complicated question: if it is the case that Hill violated ethics rules, but it is also the case that this violation only came to light as part of a campaign of revenge by her husband, should this affect whether Hill steps down?

      "bodyText": "A Nepalese former British army soldier has climbed all 14 of the world\u2019s 8,000-metre-high mountains in a record-breaking 189 days \u2013 a feat that has taken other climbers years to achieve. Nirmal \u201cNims\u201d Purja, who came to international attention this year with the publication of his shocking photograph of a queue of climbers close to the summit of Everest, completed the last of his 14 climbs, to the summit of Shishapangma, at 8.58am local time on Tuesday, almost exactly on the schedule predicted by his support team last week. \u202a\u201cMission achieved!\u201d Purja reported from the summit with his teammates Mingma David Sherpa, Galjen Sherpa and Gesman Tamang. Climbing all of the Himalayan giants has long been one of mountaineering\u2019s most sought-after prizes, and was first achieved by Reinhold Messner in 1986, who was also was the first to climb all the 8,000ers without supplemental oxygen. In 2010, Edurne Pasaban became the first woman to complete all the 8,000ers. Purja opted to use supplementary oxygen for his ascents, justifying his choice by the huge size of the challenge he had set himself. \u201cI have to get back down, so that I can reach the next mountain. I listen to my body. You must have humility so that you can get home. You can always go again without oxygen if that is what is so important, but you can\u2019t if you\u2019re dead.\u201d Purja was born in the Dhaulagiri region of Nepal, at an altitude of 1,600 metres, and grew up in Chitwan before joining the Gurkhas in 2003 and later the Special Boat Service. His extraordinary series of ascents makes him one of the most successful climbers at the highest altitudes, joining only a handful of other mountaineers who have climbed all of the 8,000-metre peaks in the Himalayas. Notably he climbed Everest, Lhotse and Makalu (the fourth and fifth highest peaks in the world) consecutively in just 48 hours. The previous record was held by Kim Chang-ho, of South Korea, who took seven years, 11 months and 14 days. \u201cI am overwhelmed and incredibly proud to have completed this final summit and achieved my goal of climbing the world\u2019s 14 tallest mountains in record time,\u201d said Purja after his final ascent. The extraordinary achievement was quickly hailed by Alan Hinkes, the first Briton to climb all the 8,000-metre mountains, who took over 15 years to complete his round of ascents and who knows Purja. \u201cI remember celebrating at Shishapangma base camp, which was my first 8,000-metre mountain, with [the late Polish climber] Jerzy Kukuczka, who had just become the second person to climb all 14, thinking then that it was mind-blowing,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAt that stage more people had stood on the moon than had climbed all 14. It seemed like an impossible thing to do. Later I recall thinking maybe it could be done in a single year with the right support. But not less than seven months. \u201cEven getting up Everest is a big challenge and it is very well set up. Doing the others is far more challenging. You have to be able to suffer to climb an 8,000er. It\u2019s almost beyond description how difficult it is. Your head feels like it\u2019s bursting and you are gasping for air. \u201cNims is superbly fit, both physically and mentally \u2013 the right man at the right time. There is a little bit of luck. He had a good spell of weather in the [notoriously unsettled] Karakoram. But you make your own luck as well.\u201d Purja began the challenge, nicknamed Bremont Project Possible, when he reached the top of Annapurna on 23 April this year and has accomplished his feat with a rotating support team made up of exclusively Nepalese climbers. On 22 May, he reached the summit of Mount Everest along with 320 other mountaineers. It was on this climb that he took the photo seen around the world of a \u201ctraffic jam\u201d to reach the summit, bringing global attention to the mountain\u2019s dangerous overcrowding. The achievement is even more extraordinary as uncertainties in weather and conditions can reduce the window of opportunity for climbing even one mountain to a handful of days. Purja and his team were also required to obtain a special climbing permit from the China Tibet Mountaineering Association to complete his challenge when China closed Shishapangma for other climbers this season. The challenges of high-altitude mountaineering also leave the human body vulnerable to problems including the build-up of fluid on the brain and lungs as well as minor infections and other illnesses. As well as his successful ascent this year, Purja was also involved in four rescues. On 23 April, days into his world record attempt and descending Annapurna, Purja led a rescue of Dr Chin Wui Kin, who had been separated from an accompanying expedition and left without food, water or an oxygen bottle for 40 hours. On 15 May, having made it to the summit of Kanchenjunga in 21 hours, Purja and his team rescued a further two climbers from a height of 8,400 metres and sacrificed their own supplementary oxygen to the climbers in need.",

Or is the goal to get the player back on the field for the next snap and the one after that and the one after that, long-term issues be damned?</p> <p>That\u2019s one of the central tensions at the heart of a locker-room: how much does this team <em>really </em>care about me? And when a team is bad, everything is amplified. And the Jets are really bad.</p> <p>This, right here, is why bad teams stay bad. It\u2019s not just the Jets. For example, an ongoing squabble between Cordy Glenn and the Bengals over how the team dealt with a head injury resulted in the left tackle <a href=\"https://www.cincyjungle.com/2019/10/17/20919487/bengals-cordy-glenn-injury-concussion-nfl-rumors-news\">receiving a one-game suspension</a>. Every team has had its share of iffy medical situations, where a player\u2019s health hasn\u2019t seemed like the first and only priority. Only the Jets could look malicious <em>and </em>inept.</p> <p>Central to this story is Jets head coach Adam Gase. Gase made the mother of all power plays last offseason when, kicked out of the head coach\u2019s office in Miami, he arrived in New York and demanded absolute power. The Jets, stunningly, sided with a coach whose top credential remains access to Peyton Manning\u2019s phone number.</p> <p>Gase is the caricature of a football coach. Words like \u201ctoughness\u201d and \u201ctogetherness\u201d and \u201cleadership\u201d tumble from his mouth because he knows that\u2019s what is expected. But he delivers it with all the sincerity of a hard-up used car salesman. Gase is a man steeped in football-ology, a philosophy that sees players less as individuals and more as pawns of the oh-so-wise coach. Get out of the way, stay quiet, do what I say, and we will be successful.</p> <p>There\u2019s an issue, though. Gase is a loser. He has coached 56 games in his NFL career. His teams have been more likely to lose by double digits (25) than to win (24). He is the man who presided over a staff in Miami where one of its high-ranking employees \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/09/dolphins-coach-chris-foerster-snorting-powder\">an offensive-line coach</a> \u2013 felt comfortable snorting white substances at his desk before a team meeting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/snyjets/status/1187382635879895041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Adam Gase responds to a question about why he hasn&#39;t spoken to Kelechi Osemele in the past few weeks \u2013 &quot;He hasn&#39;t asked to speak to me&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/UI6MAfqos0\">pic.twitter.com/UI6MAfqos0</a></p>&mdash; Jets Videos (@snyjets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/snyjets/status/1187382635879895041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Given a chance to show leadership and accountability on the Osemele matter, Gase cowered. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d Gase said.

It\u2019s easy to ask for all the power in an organization when you want to run the draft. But the job is hard when it comes to negotiating issues with players or dealing with outside forces \u2013 agents, the media, doctors. In such disputes, there\u2019s no front-office bogeyman you can throw under the bus. You\u2019re the guy. The player, media and staff want answers.</p> <p>Gase isn\u2019t just unqualified, he is delusional. It has cost the Jets in the short-term \u2013 they are 1-6 this season \u2013 and it will continue to do so into the future. \u201cIf I\u2019m still an agent,\u201d former NFL agent and current CBS Sports analyst Joel Corry <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corryjoel/status/1188483195156566016\">wrote this week</a>, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend signing with the Jets.\u201d Gase was supposed to exorcise some of the stench of a team that has one winning season in the last eight. From his introductory press conference, to the team\u2019s record, to his handling of players, he has only served to plunge them to fresh depths.</p> <p>The Osemele situation will do lasting damage to the Jets\u2019 reputation around the league. Players will still sign there, of course: the Jets will never fail to hand out inflated contracts to has-beens, because that\u2019s the company motto. And there are only 32 teams and a finite number of jobs across the league. But if a player has a choice, the prospect of working with a team who have shown such callousness towards a respected veteran will leave them with only one option \u2013 anyone but the Jets.</p>",

But the job is hard when it comes to negotiating issues with players or dealing with outside forces \u2013 agents, the media, doctors. In such disputes, there\u2019s no front-office bogeyman you can throw under the bus. You\u2019re the guy. The player, media and staff want answers. Gase isn\u2019t just unqualified, he is delusional. It has cost the Jets in the short-term \u2013 they are 1-6 this season \u2013 and it will continue to do so into the future. \u201cIf I\u2019m still an agent,\u201d former NFL agent and current CBS Sports analyst Joel Corry wrote this week, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend signing with the Jets.\u201d Gase was supposed to exorcise some of the stench of a team that has one winning season in the last eight. From his introductory press conference, to the team\u2019s record, to his handling of players, he has only served to plunge them to fresh depths. The Osemele situation will do lasting damage to the Jets\u2019 reputation around the league. Players will still sign there, of course: the Jets will never fail to hand out inflated contracts to has-beens, because that\u2019s the company motto. And there are only 32 teams and a finite number of jobs across the league. But if a player has a choice, the prospect of working with a team who have shown such callousness towards a respected veteran will leave them with only one option \u2013 anyone but the Jets.",

We were supposed to have a huge battle between Roland Garros champion Ashleigh Barty and Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka, who have carried the top ranking between them since February, won their first matches on Sunday and played an excellent match a few weeks ago in the Beijing final, but Osaka has withdrawn from the WTA Finals this morning with a shoulder injury.</p> <p>In Osaka\u2019s stead, alternate Kiki Bertens will take to the court against Barty. This remains a significant occasion as Barty will secure the year-end number one ranking once she steps onto the court today, a big achievement that reflects her consistency.<br></p> <p>This match-up is a particularly funny one. Bertens is most at home on clay and she arrived at Roland Garros with many people considering her a title favourite. Instead, she tearfully retired in the second round with a gastrointestinal illness, while Barty shocked the world by winning her first grand slam title on her \u201cworst\u201d surface. Despite that huge disappointment, this has been a good season for Bertens, her first full year in the top 10. Bertens arrives in Shenzhen having reached the final of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai last week and her best result of the year was the Madrid Premier Mandatory title in May, in which she bulldozed the field without dropping a set. </p> <p>As for Barty, we know how good this year has been. Aside from the highs of winning Roland Garros and Miami, the reason she is in position to confirm her year-end number one ranking is because she has been the most consistent player throughout the entire season, constantly going deep in tournaments even when she isn\u2019t at her best. We\u2019ll see if she can seal the ranking with a victory today.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T10:22:10.788Z\">at 10.22am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Despite coming in as an alternate, Bertens can still qualify from this round robin Red Group. She will face Belinda Bencic on Thursday. If she wins both matches, she will qualify if two other players don\u2019t win two matches. For Barty, that was quite a big setback after leading by a set and a break. However, she should take heart from recovering fairly well towards the end and losing in three sets is crucial in this format. Her third match against Petra Kvitova could be significant. Kvitova and Bencic are next on-court in Shenzhen where the Red Group should slowly take shape. Bertens has played a lot this year and she has won a lot. She has now won more than any other female player this year. Kiki Bertens defeats Ashleigh Barty 3-6 6-3 6-4: Kiki Bertens takes her first win over Ash Barty! Bertens double faulted to open the game, but then she found two excellent first serves before a couple of brilliant volleys at the net. She finished with a big serve and forehand to win. No nerves, no fear. This seemed like an impossible result with Barty leading 6-3 *3-2, but here we are. What a great fight. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 4-5* Kiki Bertens: Barty has found some rhythm on her serve and is taking her forehand on well now. She holds to 15 after a rare volley error from Bertens, forcing the Dutchwoman to serve out the match. Let\u2019s see if she has the nerve to see it out. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 *3-5 Kiki Bertens: Bertens holds. Bertens reverted to what had put her in this situation, opening her service game with a brilliant low backhand volley on the first point and then moving in to seal the hold. Absolutely insane defence from Bertens on that final point - she was running from side to side, retrieved an overhead and then flipped the point on its head. Finally, she is one game away. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 3-4* Kiki Bertens: Barty holds to love, exactly what she was looking for. Some good serving from Barty but Bertens is now starting to over-press with her forehand, going for big winners when dragged out wide. After losing seven games in a row, Barty is now on a three game run. That one break doesn\u2019t look like much right now. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 *2-4 Kiki Bertens: Suddenly, Ash Barty looks like Ash Barty again. Bertens had four game points to move to 5-1, but as the underdog double faulted, missed first serves and made nervous errors, Barty did what she does best: She moved around to attack her forehand when she could, and killed Bertens with her slice. Her slice drew two forehand errors from Bertens in the final two points. This match is far from over. The one highlight of the previous game was back to back passing shots from the two players. Check out this movement from Bertens. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 1-4* Kiki Bertens: It took seven deuces, but Ashleigh Barty finally gets her first game after losing seven in a row. Even this one wasn\u2019t pretty - it included her badly squandering a 40-0 lead, countless unforced errors and an attempted smash that seemed closer to the back fence than the court. But Barty is still fighting. She saved three break points and finished the game moving forward into the net, trying to find a way. She is still in this against an opponent she leads 5-0. Let\u2019s see. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 *0-4 Kiki Bertens: While much of the focus has been on Barty capitulating this set, Bertens deserves so much credit for this turnaround. She looked rightfully exhausted and far from any kind of competitive level early on, but she changed her tactics and it has worked so well. She is moving forward whenever possible and she sealed her eighth consecutive game with a brilliant pick up on her first volley before slamming a smash down to move ahead 4-0. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 0-3* Kiki Bertens: Everything is terrible for Ash Barty right now but somehow things are only getting worse. After spraying more errors to fall down 0-40, she finally seems to connect with a great winning inside out forehand. Forget it. Bertens challenges and Hawk Eye says that it landed just wide. Bertens has now won seven games in a row and Barty has lost her serve 5 times in a row. None of this makes sense. This seemed completely impossible half an hour ago: \u201cWe\u2019re just scratching our heads in the commentary booth,\u201d says David Mercer on BT Sport. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 *0-2 Kiki Bertens: Bertens consolidates her break with another solid hold. She connected with an absolutely huge forehand inside out winner at 30-30 that barely kissed the outside of the line. Then Barty helped her along by dumping a forehand into the net. Six games in a row. Some call that a \u2018moral bagel\u2019. Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 0-1* Kiki Bertens: Barty just can\u2019t find any rhythm right now. A couple of unforced errors put her down 0-40, but then she found her first serve and saved all three break points with aplomb. From deuce, two more loose errors move Bertens ahead. That final forehand error was not even close. For a player who is known for her solid play, this is puzzling. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 Kiki Bertens: Well, well, well. Kiki Bertens seals her fourth consecutive game to take the number one into a third set. Suddenly, Bertens is standing further inside the court by smothering the Barty backhand and moving forward. Quite a puzzling set from Barty, who just couldn\u2019t really find the court by the end. Let\u2019s see if she can recover. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-5* Kiki Bertens: Suddenly, it\u2019s Kiki Bertens who is looking more energised and fighting tooth and nail, her fightback underlined by brilliant counter drop shot at 30-15. But this has been very poor from the number one, who sends a slice wide to lose her third consecutive game. Bertens to serve for the set seemingly out of nowhere. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 *3-4 Kiki Bertens: This could be significant. Barty seemed to bounce back immediately with a couple of big forehands to move up 0-30, but a few great forays to the net from the Dutchwoman and she edges ahead. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-3* Kiki Bertens: Another puzzling game from Barty, who quickly fell down 15-40, recovered to deuce and then lost her serve anyway. Too many regulation errors from the Aussie and Bertens finally punished her, connecting with a couple of booming forehands before slamming an overhead away to take the break. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 *3-2 Kiki Bertens: Barty gets the break back immediately, forcing an error from Bertens with a heavy crosscourt forehand. Plenty of unforced errors before that though. We have been spoilt with some quality tennis in the opening two days, but this is a very choppy tennis match. Bertens very understandably doesn\u2019t seem to have the energy while Barty hasn\u2019t been able to punish her as thoroughly as she should. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 2-2* Kiki Bertens: Well then. Barty led 40-15 and seemed to be coasting towards consolidating the break, then she just seemed to lose focus. A series of errors was punctuated by the worst of all - a missed drive volley into the open court on break point. We\u2019re back on serve. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 *2-1 Kiki Bertens: Well, that was not pretty from Kiki Bertens. After a stream of unforced errors, Bertens dumps a forehand into the net to hand Barty the break early in set two. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 1-1* Kiki Bertens: Barty is looking good at the moment. Great, aggressive service game opened with a wicked forehand winner and closed with a nice foray to the net, sealed with a volley winner. Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 *0-1 Kiki Bertens: Among many things, Bertens really needs to serve better if she wants to have a chance here. She finished the first set with 43% first serves, which is abysmal and it\u2019s killing her - she won 5/17(29%) of second serve points in that set. This was a great hold, saving a couple of break points to put her mark down on the second set. After the second break point, Bertens found three consecutive first serves and was finally able to step into the court. Good stuff. First set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 Kiki Bertens: Barty serves out the first set with aplomb. A pretty strange set in general. Barty lost her serve twice yet all three of her holds were to love. Bertens has looked quite lethargic aside from a few moments of excellence, while Barty finally cut out errors towards the end of the set and thrived. First set: Ashleigh Barty *5-3 Kiki Bertens: Bertens digs out her first hold of the day, but it wasn\u2019t easy. Bertens moved to a 40-15 lead, only for Barty to fight back including whistling backhand winner. But she holds on to force Barty to serve out the set. Decent. First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-2* Kiki Bertens: Barty finally gets a handle on this first set, sealing a love service game with an ace. First set: Ashleigh Barty *4-2 Kiki Bertens: Another service game, another break. A brilliantly constructed point from Barty to break, forcing Bertens onto the run with an angled forehand, then slipping a backhand winner to the other corner. Plenty of errors from Bertens before that though. First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-2* Kiki Bertens: So much for good serving. We\u2019re five games in with only one hold. That was a great return game from Bertens though, who connected with two incredible running forehand crosscourt winners. The first was a great passing shot as Barty approached and the second was a wicked angle that not even Barty, with her pace, could reach. We\u2019re back on serve but who will hold? First set: Ashleigh Barty *3-1 Kiki Bertens: For all the attention on Barty\u2019s slice backhand, the Aussie has been hitting more and more driven backhands this year. She pulls off a brilliant angled backhand passing shot to break again. There are some errors from both here but these are interesting, long exchanges with both women prodding the other and looking to inflict damage their heavy topspin forehands.

A brilliant crosscourt forehand passing shot from the Aussie, then a well-constructed point finished with a slick volley. She already looks extremely sharp. First set: Ashleigh Barty 1-0 Kiki Bertens: Ashleigh Barty is the year end number one and she opens her account with an easy hold to love. Three first serves in, no problem. So, who will win? Barty leads their head-to-head 5-0, so on the surface not much more needs to be said. But all but one of their meetings have been extremely tight three setters.

The biggest factor may be that Bertens\u2019 schedule has been absolutely insane this autumn as she desperately tried to qualify to Shenzhen on merit. She played in the final of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai on Sunday. At some point she has to tire. Will it be today? Hello! Welcome to our coverage on day 3 of the WTA Finals in Shenzhen, where we have awoken to some disappointing news. We were supposed to have a huge battle between Roland Garros champion Ashleigh Barty and Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka, who have carried the top ranking between them since February, won their first matches on Sunday and played an excellent match a few weeks ago in the Beijing final, but Osaka has withdrawn from the WTA Finals this morning with a shoulder injury. In Osaka\u2019s stead, alternate Kiki Bertens will take to the court against Barty. This remains a significant occasion as Barty will secure the year-end number one ranking once she steps onto the court today, a big achievement that reflects her consistency. This match-up is a particularly funny one. Bertens is most at home on clay and she arrived at Roland Garros with many people considering her a title favourite. Instead, she tearfully retired in the second round with a gastrointestinal illness, while Barty shocked the world by winning her first grand slam title on her \u201cworst\u201d surface. Despite that huge disappointment, this has been a good season for Bertens, her first full year in the top 10. Bertens arrives in Shenzhen having reached the final of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai last week and her best result of the year was the Madrid Premier Mandatory title in May, in which she bulldozed the field without dropping a set. As for Barty, we know how good this year has been. Aside from the highs of winning Roland Garros and Miami, the reason she is in position to confirm her year-end number one ranking is because she has been the most consistent player throughout the entire season, constantly going deep in tournaments even when she isn\u2019t at her best. We\u2019ll see if she can seal the ranking with a victory today.",

Any comedy show, no matter what it purports to be, is ultimately about where the comedian\u2019s at in his or her life. I definitely bring more of my personal life into it the older I get, and now it\u2019s gone another step. It is much more satisfying in the long run to be more vulnerable, not arrive with something fully formed, and flawless.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the latest step in a slowly evolving comedy journey that didn\u2019t really get going for a while. At 28, he was living in Dublin, doing two or three gigs a month on a non-existent comedy circuit, living extremely frugally but also off the girlfriend who is now his wife. (They\u2019ve been together since they were teenagers.) He moved to London to give it one proper shot; a couple of years, and if it didn\u2019t work, he\u2019d go back home.</p> <p>Of course, it did work. In the mid-90s he was cast as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4x6HuqSMdQ#t=3m19s\">Father Dougal</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/20/father-ted-legacy-20-years-on-up-with-this-sort-of-thing\">Father Ted</a> and turned in a performance of such exquisite nitwittery that the show lived way beyond its time. You can still make anyone laugh, from cold, at any age, just with a picture of Father Dougal in his pyjamas. And, if his original standup chimed with what the Father Ted writers were looking for, then his Dougal persona has definitely permeated his standup since.</p> <p>\u201cThat was my armour as a fledgling comedian, adopting this bewildered persona where I was pretending to be much more stupid than I actually am. I was kind of stiff\u201d \u2013 he does a seemingly reflexive impression of that awkward posture, arms swinging from hunched, nervous shoulders \u2013 \u201cand it worked well for a few years.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b6eb3c7843ab8833479be9b7a10da53a414c1b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b6eb3c7843ab8833479be9b7a10da53a414c1b7/1003_165_1208_1511/799.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018If I was a very stable person, I would not have to do comedy\u2019 \u2026 O\u2019Hanlon on stage in 2012.\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If I was a very stable person, I would not have to do comedy\u2019 \u2026 O\u2019Hanlon on stage in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Sheppard/Redferns/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says his success was all just a lucky strike. He didn\u2019t go into comedy as a career move; in those days, he says, no one did. \u201cIt didn\u2019t attract careerists. It was slackers, people shuffling on to the stage with very little. I loved it. Fame and money weren\u2019t possibilities even, when my generation started. That wasn\u2019t the plan at all. On a typical bill, you would have all sorts of misfits. People with ukuleles. There was a guy called <a href=\"https://comedycv.co.uk/woodybopmuddy/index.htm\">Woody Bop Muddy</a> who used to come on and smash records. So that was his job. It was fantastic. A really exciting time to be part of that generation. To feel part of something.\u201d</p> <p>But the 90s couldn\u2019t last for ever, nor could youth. O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s shtick has changed, not just with his segue from being cast as the hilarious idiot (after Father Ted, My Hero) to taking a relatively straight lead in Death in Paradise (which is one of the three most popular shows on TV). \u201cBefore, I hid behind the persona,\u201d he says, \u201cI hid behind the surreal one-liners, because that\u2019s all about craft and there\u2019s a lot of pride in that. But it\u2019s ultimately limiting. It\u2019s better to let people in a bit more.\u201d</p> <p>This means engaging with the issues of now. The day we meet, the government has put forward its latest suggestions for the Irish border issue (which seems to amount to four borders), after weeks of callow, ahistorical bilge about how easily it could be solved. O\u2019Hanlon is not impressed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[I was] dragged out of my bed at the age of seven, my mother screaming, six kids under the age of 12</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor us, this is existential,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger of economic collapse in [the UK], but for us, we could return to a state of war. You know, people are worried about that. How anybody in political leadership in this country could demonstrate such wilful ignorance of Irish history, and such blithe disregard for the people of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>. Thousands of people died. Hundreds of British soldiers lost their lives. I grew up on the border\u2026\u201d He pauses, still averse to sounding at all aerated. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to overstate the impact the Troubles had on me and my life.\u201d</p> <p>But the impact, it transpires, was pretty significant: the son of a politician, Rory O\u2019Hanlon, south of the border, they had death threats, a bomb scare. \u201cDragged out of your bed at the age of seven, my mother screaming, six kids under the age of 12. I\u2019m not equating my experience with the people who lived in Northern Ireland. But my dad was always out and about late at night, and I could not go to sleep until I knew he was in. There were assassinations, for one reason or another. And I could not relax until I heard his footsteps on the garden path.\u201d</p> <p>That gnawing anxiety didn\u2019t translate \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 into a burning political passion. \u201cI always shied away from it. I was always detached, I never supported his party [Fianna F\u00e1il]. I always liked him, I wished him well. If push came to shove, I might even vote for him. But I always stood well back.\u201d </p> <p>Yet now he\u2019s on stage, talking about politics from a comic\u2019s perspective. \u201cWe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/colonialism\">postcolonials</a>, we hold Britain up on a pedestal, as a beacon of sanity and wisdom,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what we realise now is that you\u2019re just as irrational as the rest of us. And that\u2019s sort of the arc of what I\u2019m doing. But, you know, with jokes. As a comedian, you can\u2019t tell people that they\u2019re wrong or that they\u2019re stupid. But you can say, \u2018What you did is very irrational.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/artist/1280914?awtrc=true&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3cSq-pzB5QIViKMYCh03dgpbEAAYASAAEgLKFPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Ardal O\u2019Hanlon tours the UK and Ireland until 7 March</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2019.

In the mid-90s he was cast as Father Dougal in Father Ted and turned in a performance of such exquisite nitwittery that the show lived way beyond its time. You can still make anyone laugh, from cold, at any age, just with a picture of Father Dougal in his pyjamas. And, if his original standup chimed with what the Father Ted writers were looking for, then his Dougal persona has definitely permeated his standup since. \u201cThat was my armour as a fledgling comedian, adopting this bewildered persona where I was pretending to be much more stupid than I actually am. I was kind of stiff\u201d \u2013 he does a seemingly reflexive impression of that awkward posture, arms swinging from hunched, nervous shoulders \u2013 \u201cand it worked well for a few years.\u201d He says his success was all just a lucky strike. He didn\u2019t go into comedy as a career move; in those days, he says, no one did. \u201cIt didn\u2019t attract careerists. It was slackers, people shuffling on to the stage with very little. I loved it. Fame and money weren\u2019t possibilities even, when my generation started. That wasn\u2019t the plan at all. On a typical bill, you would have all sorts of misfits. People with ukuleles. There was a guy called Woody Bop Muddy who used to come on and smash records. So that was his job. It was fantastic. A really exciting time to be part of that generation. To feel part of something.\u201d But the 90s couldn\u2019t last for ever, nor could youth. O\u2019Hanlon\u2019s shtick has changed, not just with his segue from being cast as the hilarious idiot (after Father Ted, My Hero) to taking a relatively straight lead in Death in Paradise (which is one of the three most popular shows on TV). \u201cBefore, I hid behind the persona,\u201d he says, \u201cI hid behind the surreal one-liners, because that\u2019s all about craft and there\u2019s a lot of pride in that. But it\u2019s ultimately limiting. It\u2019s better to let people in a bit more.\u201d This means engaging with the issues of now. The day we meet, the government has put forward its latest suggestions for the Irish border issue (which seems to amount to four borders), after weeks of callow, ahistorical bilge about how easily it could be solved. O\u2019Hanlon is not impressed. \u201cFor us, this is existential,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger of economic collapse in [the UK], but for us, we could return to a state of war. You know, people are worried about that. How anybody in political leadership in this country could demonstrate such wilful ignorance of Irish history, and such blithe disregard for the people of Northern Ireland. Thousands of people died. Hundreds of British soldiers lost their lives. I grew up on the border\u2026\u201d He pauses, still averse to sounding at all aerated. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to overstate the impact the Troubles had on me and my life.\u201d But the impact, it transpires, was pretty significant: the son of a politician, Rory O\u2019Hanlon, south of the border, they had death threats, a bomb scare. \u201cDragged out of your bed at the age of seven, my mother screaming, six kids under the age of 12. I\u2019m not equating my experience with the people who lived in Northern Ireland. But my dad was always out and about late at night, and I could not go to sleep until I knew he was in. There were assassinations, for one reason or another. And I could not relax until I heard his footsteps on the garden path.\u201d That gnawing anxiety didn\u2019t translate \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 into a burning political passion. \u201cI always shied away from it. I was always detached, I never supported his party [Fianna F\u00e1il]. I always liked him, I wished him well. If push came to shove, I might even vote for him. But I always stood well back.\u201d Yet now he\u2019s on stage, talking about politics from a comic\u2019s perspective. \u201cWe postcolonials, we hold Britain up on a pedestal, as a beacon of sanity and wisdom,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what we realise now is that you\u2019re just as irrational as the rest of us. And that\u2019s sort of the arc of what I\u2019m doing. But, you know, with jokes. As a comedian, you can\u2019t tell people that they\u2019re wrong or that they\u2019re stupid. But you can say, \u2018What you did is very irrational.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Ardal O\u2019Hanlon tours the UK and Ireland until 7 March. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 October 2019. An earlier version misnamed the comedian Woody Bop Muddy as \u201cWoody Bup Moddy\u201d. It was further amended on 15 April 2020 to correct a reference to \u201cthe rest of the UK\u201d, when \u201cthe UK\u201d was meant.",

Nearly 150 Cambodian officials and seven volunteers continued searching the island and surrounding areas on Tuesday, the fourth day of large-scale searches.</p> <p>Officers have been speaking to six Cambodian men. \u201cThey are being questioned,\u201d the provincial deputy police chief, Nop Panha, told AFP. \u201cWe are not drawing any conclusions yet.\u201d</p> <p>It is believed the men were being interviewed as potential witnesses rather than as suspects in any crimes.

On Monday Harry Bambridge, Amelia\u2019s brother, was accompanied by police as he searched the man\u2019s possessions in the hostel.</p> <p>Harry Bambridge has complained about a lack of support from the British government regarding the search. He said the family met police in their HQ in Sihanoukville on Tuesday morning. He wrote on social media: \u201cEveryone\u2019s [Cambodian officials] said that they\u2019re not going to stop until she\u2019s found, so I feel a little bit more positive.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday Amelia\u2019s father, Phil Bambridge, said he was losing hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/28/father-uk-woman-missing-cambodia-amelia-bambridge-says-losing-hope\">she would be found alive</a>. Sniffer dogs from Phnom Penh were expected to arrive on Koh Rong on Tuesday to help with the search. Extra boats were being dispatched from Sihanoukville for the ocean search.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/missing_backpacker_cambodia/giv-3902fdmGKdQ6Xl3L/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/10/missing_backpacker_cambodia/giv-3902fdmGKdQ6Xl3L/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>Officials and volunteers have placed added focus on checking fishing boats that may have been near Police Beach, where Bambridge went missing. Her backpack, containing items including her bank cards and phone, was found on rocks by the beach on Thursday morning.</p> <p>Ben Warner, a leader of the volunteer search team, said: \u201cWe\u2019re running out of areas where we can look on land, so we\u2019re trying to look at ways that she could have got off the island.\u201d</p> <p>Laura Link, another leader of the volunteer search team, appealed for anyone with photos of boats around Police Beach to get in contact.</p> <p>A police spokesperson said: \u201cAt this point it\u2019s still an all-area search. They\u2019re searching under the rocks in the ocean and on top of the ocean, but now they want to get in the jungle. All departments are here today: police, navy, military.\u201d</p> <p>Ryan Harris, 18, from Worcester, travelled to Koh Rong with Bambridge on 19 October after befriending her in Phnom Penh. He spent Monday with her family on the island and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/100011013618009/posts/927391487637963?sfns=mo\">appealed</a> for anyone with information to come forward.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re appealing for information from anyone who was at the party then [Wednesday night] or in the last few months, anyone who might have seen anything sketchy or suspicious,\u201d Harris said.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe family are doing well considering the circumstances. They just want to know what happened, same as everyone else.\u201d</p>",

Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Sussex, was last seen at a beach party at about 3am on Thursday. Nearly 150 Cambodian officials and seven volunteers continued searching the island and surrounding areas on Tuesday, the fourth day of large-scale searches. Officers have been speaking to six Cambodian men. \u201cThey are being questioned,\u201d the provincial deputy police chief, Nop Panha, told AFP. \u201cWe are not drawing any conclusions yet.\u201d It is believed the men were being interviewed as potential witnesses rather than as suspects in any crimes. On Monday a Koh Rong official working with police said that there had been no arrests related to the search. The Guardian understands that at least one of the men being questioned worked at a hostel on Koh Rong. On Monday Harry Bambridge, Amelia\u2019s brother, was accompanied by police as he searched the man\u2019s possessions in the hostel. Harry Bambridge has complained about a lack of support from the British government regarding the search. He said the family met police in their HQ in Sihanoukville on Tuesday morning. He wrote on social media: \u201cEveryone\u2019s [Cambodian officials] said that they\u2019re not going to stop until she\u2019s found, so I feel a little bit more positive.\u201d On Monday Amelia\u2019s father, Phil Bambridge, said he was losing hope she would be found alive. Sniffer dogs from Phnom Penh were expected to arrive on Koh Rong on Tuesday to help with the search. Extra boats were being dispatched from Sihanoukville for the ocean search. Officials and volunteers have placed added focus on checking fishing boats that may have been near Police Beach, where Bambridge went missing. Her backpack, containing items including her bank cards and phone, was found on rocks by the beach on Thursday morning. Ben Warner, a leader of the volunteer search team, said: \u201cWe\u2019re running out of areas where we can look on land, so we\u2019re trying to look at ways that she could have got off the island.\u201d Laura Link, another leader of the volunteer search team, appealed for anyone with photos of boats around Police Beach to get in contact. A police spokesperson said: \u201cAt this point it\u2019s still an all-area search. They\u2019re searching under the rocks in the ocean and on top of the ocean, but now they want to get in the jungle. All departments are here today: police, navy, military.\u201d Ryan Harris, 18, from Worcester, travelled to Koh Rong with Bambridge on 19 October after befriending her in Phnom Penh. He spent Monday with her family on the island and appealed for anyone with information to come forward. \u201cWe\u2019re appealing for information from anyone who was at the party then [Wednesday night] or in the last few months, anyone who might have seen anything sketchy or suspicious,\u201d Harris said. He added: \u201cThe family are doing well considering the circumstances. They just want to know what happened, same as everyone else.\u201d",

The region is the most dangerous place in the world to find work for migrant domestic workers such as Mbogo. The Gulf has long been notorious for labour trafficking, with the 2.5 million-strong domestic workforce particularly vulnerable to widespread physical and sexual abuse, and having their passports and salaries withheld by employers. Underpinning this abuse is the kafala system, which prevents migrant workers from changing jobs without their employer\u2019s consent. It can mean that women who face abuse at the hands of their employers are left trapped and facing arrest if they try to flee. Reports of east African workers being raped and tortured across the region and haunting videos of Kenyan women pleading for help after allegedly being abused by their employers saw the Kenyan government follow other countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines in banning its citizens from travelling to work in the Gulf in 2014. Since then the government has been grappling with how to allow women and the country\u2019s economy to benefit from the huge demand for migrant domestic workers from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, while keeping those who want to travel for work safe. This year it introduced measures to mitigate the risk of abuse. Before, Kenyan recruitment agencies had no legal obligation to bring women facing abuse home. Under the new rules, if a Kenyan woman is abused, agencies must help them leave, with the cost of their rescue coming out of a 1.5m Kenyan shilling (\u00a311,000) bond that the agent has to pay to operate.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Welcome to Cahuita town, welcome one and all,\u201d Walter Ferguson sings on the song Cahuita Is a Beautiful Place, offering an invitation to drink some rum and listen to calypso in this corner of Lim\u00f3n, Costa Rica. Its charming lyrical bounce and layered guitar sounds like the work of more than one man, although it is his work alone \u2013 and a song that might never have been heard if not for a project aimed at locating the thousands of one-of-a-kind cassettes that Ferguson recorded at home for friends and visitors wanting to take home a piece of this \u201cbeautiful place\u201d.</p> <p>In the run up to Ferguson\u2019s 100th birthday in May, his son Peck (the 10th of Ferguson\u2019s 11 children) and Swiss calypso fan Niels Werdenberg have spent two years on a labour of love: the Walter Gavitt Ferguson Tape Hunt. Their goal is to track down these lost gems, digitising songs that, in 2018, the Costa Rican government designated part of the country\u2019s cultural heritage.</p> <p>Founded by Jamaican fishermen and farmers who migrated through the Port of Lim\u00f3n in the mid-19th century, Cahuita, with its oceanside national park, has grown into a place that tourists might call a best-kept secret. Even within the country, the Lim\u00f3n region flies under the radar. \u201cIt has been pushed aside due to racial prejudice,\u201d says Costa Rican musician and researcher Manuel Monestel. Racism in the country meant that Afro-Costa Ricans were not welcome in the capital, which has resulted in the black population living primarily in Lim\u00f3n.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QREXW9PD4zY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QREXW9PD4zY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Ferguson was born in Panama, but his family moved to Cahuita when he was a toddler; with a Jamaican-Costa Rican mother and a Jamaican migrant father, he is a proud Costa Rican. Peck says that Ferguson\u2019s mother always thought her son had the talent of a calypsonian: he reportedly composed his first calypso in 1939, when he was 20, after learning clarinet and guitar while working in a store in Cahuita. He toured the country as a member of a band called Los Miserables in the 60s, but by the 70s farming and faith became his main focus. Composing and playing music became a hobby.</p> <p>I speak to Ferguson from his home via video call. The sharp centenarian can no longer play, but he speaks vividly of his process and prolific 20th-century output. \u201cAs we go around every day, we see different movements,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is what causes me to make every day. I see something new, and I make a song for it.\u201d</p> <p>Each song documents the history of his people.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Welcome to Cahuita town, welcome one and all,\u201d Walter Ferguson sings on the song Cahuita Is a Beautiful Place, offering an invitation to drink some rum and listen to calypso in this corner of Lim\u00f3n, Costa Rica. Its charming lyrical bounce and layered guitar sounds like the work of more than one man, although it is his work alone \u2013 and a song that might never have been heard if not for a project aimed at locating the thousands of one-of-a-kind cassettes that Ferguson recorded at home for friends and visitors wanting to take home a piece of this \u201cbeautiful place\u201d. In the run up to Ferguson\u2019s 100th birthday in May, his son Peck (the 10th of Ferguson\u2019s 11 children) and Swiss calypso fan Niels Werdenberg have spent two years on a labour of love: the Walter Gavitt Ferguson Tape Hunt. Their goal is to track down these lost gems, digitising songs that, in 2018, the Costa Rican government designated part of the country\u2019s cultural heritage. Founded by Jamaican fishermen and farmers who migrated through the Port of Lim\u00f3n in the mid-19th century, Cahuita, with its oceanside national park, has grown into a place that tourists might call a best-kept secret. Even within the country, the Lim\u00f3n region flies under the radar. \u201cIt has been pushed aside due to racial prejudice,\u201d says Costa Rican musician and researcher Manuel Monestel. Racism in the country meant that Afro-Costa Ricans were not welcome in the capital, which has resulted in the black population living primarily in Lim\u00f3n. Ferguson was born in Panama, but his family moved to Cahuita when he was a toddler; with a Jamaican-Costa Rican mother and a Jamaican migrant father, he is a proud Costa Rican. Peck says that Ferguson\u2019s mother always thought her son had the talent of a calypsonian: he reportedly composed his first calypso in 1939, when he was 20, after learning clarinet and guitar while working in a store in Cahuita. He toured the country as a member of a band called Los Miserables in the 60s, but by the 70s farming and faith became his main focus. Composing and playing music became a hobby. I speak to Ferguson from his home via video call. The sharp centenarian can no longer play, but he speaks vividly of his process and prolific 20th-century output. \u201cAs we go around every day, we see different movements,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is what causes me to make every day. I see something new, and I make a song for it.\u201d Each song documents the history of his people. Monilia details the infestation of a devastating fungi that attacked crops in the mid-70s, forcing locals to sell their land or switch their focus to the growing tourism industry. \u201cMonilia,\u201d he sings, \u201cyou come to stay and all you bring is hungry belly.\u201d Cahuita itself is brought to life as well. There\u2019s Bato the builder and his Cabin in di Wata; in Bombero, a domestic fight ends with a husband setting the house on fire. One Pant Man tells of racial discrimination: \u201cShe went and told the authority / Telling them I\u2019m a foreigner. / They came with gun and artillery / Compelling me to show them me cedula [identification].\u201d Monestel says Cahuita\u2019s history is embedded in Ferguson\u2019s melodies themselves. \u201cIt has roots in the calypso from Trinidad and Panama,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can track the influences of mento from Jamaica, but I believe the calypso in Lim\u00f3n has its own profile.\u201d By the end of the 70s, Ferguson had begun to capture these musical narratives using a portable cassette recorder, sharing the results with family and friends.

      "body": "<p>So you delivered your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise-unit-of-work\">NewsWise unit of work</a>, and your pupils loved talking about and critically questioning the news. Watching and talking about news is now a weekly activity in your classes, and you even started a new school newspaper! But how can you support your pupils to keep consuming news and discussing what they see, read and hear, beyond the classroom?</p> <p>Team NewsWise recently found ourselves attempting to answer that question in the company of 35 local parents, children and teachers at the iconic Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough, alongside two brilliant local journalists - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianmcneal?lang=en\">Ian McNeal</a>, Digital editor at Teesside Live and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04fhjmw\">Gary Philipson</a>, BBC Tees presenter - and the (rather more hairy) Roary the Lion, mascot for Middlesbrough Football Club.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2018/jun/12/register-your-interest-in-newswise\">Register your interest in NewsWise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why? Because recent <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/family-news-literacy-report/\">research commissioned by NewsWise</a> from the National Literacy Trust shows that while children prefer talking about fake news with their family rather than friends or teachers, many are missing out on the opportunity to do so. We know that the increasing use of mobile phones and tablets as a source of news content has led to <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0027/157914/uk-news-consumption-2019-report.pdf\">news consumption becoming a more solitary activity</a>. Indeed, according to the National Literacy Trust\u2019s research, two in five parents (39%) said they never watch, listen to or read news with their child at home and one in five (21%) never talk to their child about news. This challenge is even more acute for children from disadvantaged communities, whose parents are more likely to never watch, listen to or read news with them (45% vs 37%) and to believe they don\u2019t have the skills to spot fake news (52% vs 39%) than parents from more advantaged backgrounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1475e3bdddc5807ad29f5973e832307278893ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1475e3bdddc5807ad29f5973e832307278893ca/269_299_4915_2949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children and families at the NewsWise family workshop at Middlesbrough Football Club\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children and families at the NewsWise family workshop at Middlesbrough Football Club</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Banks/NewsWise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The research revealed that half of UK parents are worried about the impact of fake news and misinformation on their children\u2019s lives (50%) and don\u2019t think their children have the skills to spot it (52%). What\u2019s more, two in five parents (40%) admitted to falling for fake news themselves.</p> <p>In response to this challenge \u2013 and to parents\u2019 calls for greater support to help their children understand news \u2013 NewsWise has started a UK tour of family news festivals over the coming year to give children and parents new and exciting opportunities to explore news together. Which brings us back to Middlesbrough Football Club and Roary the Lion.

      "bodyText": "So you delivered your NewsWise unit of work, and your pupils loved talking about and critically questioning the news. Watching and talking about news is now a weekly activity in your classes, and you even started a new school newspaper! But how can you support your pupils to keep consuming news and discussing what they see, read and hear, beyond the classroom? Team NewsWise recently found ourselves attempting to answer that question in the company of 35 local parents, children and teachers at the iconic Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough, alongside two brilliant local journalists - Ian McNeal, Digital editor at Teesside Live and Gary Philipson, BBC Tees presenter - and the (rather more hairy) Roary the Lion, mascot for Middlesbrough Football Club. Why? Because recent research commissioned by NewsWise from the National Literacy Trust shows that while children prefer talking about fake news with their family rather than friends or teachers, many are missing out on the opportunity to do so. We know that the increasing use of mobile phones and tablets as a source of news content has led to news consumption becoming a more solitary activity. Indeed, according to the National Literacy Trust\u2019s research, two in five parents (39%) said they never watch, listen to or read news with their child at home and one in five (21%) never talk to their child about news. This challenge is even more acute for children from disadvantaged communities, whose parents are more likely to never watch, listen to or read news with them (45% vs 37%) and to believe they don\u2019t have the skills to spot fake news (52% vs 39%) than parents from more advantaged backgrounds. The research revealed that half of UK parents are worried about the impact of fake news and misinformation on their children\u2019s lives (50%) and don\u2019t think their children have the skills to spot it (52%). What\u2019s more, two in five parents (40%) admitted to falling for fake news themselves. In response to this challenge \u2013 and to parents\u2019 calls for greater support to help their children understand news \u2013 NewsWise has started a UK tour of family news festivals over the coming year to give children and parents new and exciting opportunities to explore news together. Which brings us back to Middlesbrough Football Club and Roary the Lion. Our new workshops give families an opportunity to work together to navigate the news and explore topics such as bias, rumour, clickbait, manipulated images, truth and trustworthiness and become \u2018Fake News Detectives\u2019. Thanks to the MFC Foundation, participants from Abingdon Primary School also took part in a mock press conference in Riverside Stadium\u2019s media suite, got a journalist\u2019s-eye-view of the pitch from the press box and interviewed local journalists about their jobs. Both children and adults told us they learned something new, but more than this, we hope we inspired and supported parents to explore conversations and questions about the news so children can learn at home as well as in the classroom. We\u2019ll be running family workshops across the UK from November onwards. To find out more follow us @GetNewsWise.",

      "bodyText": "Express your interest in this course A fascinating and fantastic class, with speakers at the top of their field. Thank you!\u201d \u2013 Catherine Absolutely fascinating\u201d \u2013 Anon Join us for a rare opportunity to hear from five leading palaeontologists from the Natural History Museum as they reveal some of the great scientific discoveries and mysteries of the last few decades. This thought-provoking masterclass offers the opportunity examine how life has both shaped and been shaped by the Earth\u2019s environments, with some of the leading experts in the field. They will talk you through new research that has changed the way many people now think about evolution, from how dinosaurs became extinct to the most important environmental issues facing the human population today. You will also learn more about the scientific methods used to study fossils and how the experts plan and execute their research within the Natural History Museum. Content Paul Barrett will reveal new discoveries that are challenging our understanding of how dinosaurs dominated the land for tens of millions of years and how to explain their extinction. Tim Ewin will take you through how the evolution of invertebrates from fossils can be used to address societally relevant problems with a biased towards echinoderms. Chris Stringer will explore how unexpected advances in scientific methods are helping to rewrite the story of human evolution. Zerina Johanson will take you through the evolution of sharks and other fish, from their origins of over 420m years ago, when they had strange forms that lacked jaws and teeth, to the highly adapted sharks and bony fish of today. Anjali Goswami will discuss what makes us mammals, how we as mammals acquired our distinctive characteristics through the transition from our mammal-like reptile ancestors, and how mass extinctions have shaped our evolution. Tutor profiles Paul Barrett is the Natural History Museum\u2019s senior dinosaur expert. He has travelled widely in pursuit of their fossils and is a specialist on dinosaurs from the UK, China and southern Africa. He has worked on all major dinosaur groups and has published &gt;150 papers on dinosaur biology and evolution. His popular books include Dinosaurs: How They Lived and Evolved and Dippy: The Story of a Dinosaur Icon. Chris Stringer is a British anthropologist and researcher at the Natural History Museum. He is a leading expert on human evolution as well as a fellow of the Royal Society. His research has focused on the past 500,000 years of human evolution, especially the origins of Neanderthals and modern humans. His books include The Origin of Our Species and Homo Britannicus: The Incredible Story of Human Life in Britain. Tim Ewin is a senior curator for invertebrate palaeontology, invertebrate and plant palaeobiology division in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum. He has over 15 years of experience working within internationally regarded museums. He has contributed to four Palaeontological Association UK Field Guides to Fossils, was editor for the eighth edition of the popular British Mesozoic Fossils guidebook, and also had a smartphone app published that aided identification of UK fossils. Through this work, he has undertaken fieldwork in places such as the deserts of Wyoming, the USA and Morocco, as well as delivering scientific findings at international conferences in places such as Moscow, Russia and Nagoya, Japan. Zerina Johanson is merit researcher and head of division in the Earth Sciences department at the Natural History Museum. Her research focuses on the evolution and development of the early vertebrae skeleton, focusing on dentitions and the postaxial skeleton. Some of her current projects include evolution and development of the pufferfish dentition, and devolution and development of the axial skeleton of jawed vertebrates. Anjali Goswami is a research leader in life sciences at the Natural History Museum, and an honorary professor of palaeobiology at University College London. Her expertise is in vertebrate evolution and development, particularly using high-resolution image analysis to quantify and reconstruct the evolution of biodiversity and understand how development, ecology and large-scale environmental effects have shaped organisms through deep time. She has worked on groups from insects to dinosaurs, but her main interest is in the evolution of mammals. She has searches for fossils all over the world, from Svalbard to Madagascar, and currently leads expeditions in Argentina and India.

      "bodyText": "Facebook and other major social media platforms have been accused by the European commission of giving a misleading picture of their efforts to remove fake accounts spreading politically motivated disinformation. The security commissioner, Julian King, told the Guardian on the publication of the sites\u2019 self-assessment reports to the EU\u2019s executive that there remained a \u201cdisconnect\u201d between the claims of progress from social media companies and \u201cthe lived experience\u201d. Facebook, whose founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, recently gave evidence to a US Senate committee looking at disinformation, has said it disabled 2.2bn fake accounts in the first three months of 2019 and removed about 7,600 accounts, pages and groups engaged in \u201cinauthentic behaviour\u201d. But King said there had remained \u201ctoo much disinformation\u201d around the European elections in May, and that the debate about regulation of social media was developing at pace on both sides of the Atlantic. He pointed to a study from George Washington university that found that in the run-up to and during the European elections, the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) party in Germany, which took 11% of the vote overall, received 86% of total shares and 75% of all comments on party political content in Germany posted on Facebook. That was four times the comments and six times the shares of all the other parties combined. \u201cThe vast majority of likes and shares came from a cluster of 80,000 accounts which were busily retweeting this stuff and they have many of the features of fake accounts,\u201d King said. \u201cIn particular the most active \u2013 around 20,000 accounts \u2013 had random two letter first and last names. For example MX, CH, EW, which as it happens would not be legal names if you tried to register on a birth certificate in Germany.\u201d He added: \u201cIf a platform like Facebook with their resources and their knowledge can\u2019t figure out that thousands of coordinated accounts with random two-letter names are suspicious and are engaging in this kind of activity in the context of the election, when we have put all that focus on it, then we still have some way to go.\u201d King was speaking as the commission published reports compiled by Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Mozilla, all signatories to a voluntary EU code of practice. The commission said in an accompanying summary that while there had been some progress there were \u201cserious further steps\u201d to be made. The efforts to advise consumers on what they were reading and who was behind it were said to be \u201cpatchy\u201d although the commission praised Facebook\u2019s clear policy to label ads with \u201cpaid for by\u201d disclaimers. Independent researchers tasked with finding disinformation on sites were not, however, being given the access they needed to allow them to do their jobs. The commission said it was also concerned that various companies were continuing to sell \u201cfake account activity\u201d for a few hundred euros. \u201cThere is a kind of stock and flow problem,\u201d King said of Facebook, which admits to hosting some 120m fake accounts. \u201cThey are definitely affecting the flow, they are stopping some of this stuff being set up.

A further report in January will reveal EU member states\u2019 reactions to the platforms\u2019 efforts over the past 12 months. King said there were \u201cnegative examples\u201d where \u201cwhat platforms say and lived experience does not entirely align\u201d. \u201cIf we are really going to make progress on this then we are going to have to have a step-change in the amount of outside scrutiny that the platforms are going to tolerate,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you need, because of the questions it raises about the integrity of government, to think about some form of regulation? We are not there yet but we have to have that debate. More than 250 employees have signed a letter to Zuckerberg decrying Facebook\u2019s decision to allow politicians to post ads on the platform that include false claims, it was reported on Monday.

LA\u2019s Getty blaze puts \u2018fireproof\u2019 museum to the test The extreme winds whipping up northern California\u2019s wildfires abated briefly on Monday, offering firefighters in wine country a window to bring the sprawling Kincade fire under some kind of control. The blaze, which doubled in size over the weekend, has burned almost 30,000 hectares (75,000 acres) and forced 185,000 people to evacuate. In LA, a fire broke out close to the Getty Center art museum, which is designed to be impervious to flames and smoke. Global heating. The tinderbox conditions in California are a traditional feature of the state\u2019s natural cycle, but experts agree the climate crisis is worsening and extending its wildfire season. Pelosi plans House vote to formalise impeachment inquiry Nancy Pelosi will call a House vote to formalise the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, before it ramps up from closed-door depositions to public hearings. In a letter to colleagues, the House speaker noted that the constitution does not demand such a vote, but said it would quash White House claims that the inquiry was invalid and \u201celiminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstruction of the House\u201d. \u2018Internal alarm\u2019. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the national security council, intends to testify on Tuesday that the July phone call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, led him to raise an internal alarm that US foreign policy was being subverted. Syrian Kurds claim key role in hunt for Baghdadi The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they played a key role in tracking down the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, including placing a spy in his inner circle who stole a pair of Baghdadi\u2019s underpants to prove his identity via DNA testing. Trump, who has so far played down the SDF\u2019s role in the manhunt, on Monday tweeted a photo of the \u201cwonderful\u201d Belgian Malinois dog injured during the US raid in which Baghdadi was killed on Saturday. Syria reinforcements. Weeks after a controversial withdrawal from northern Syria, US troops are moving back into positions around oil fields in the east of the country, saying the new deployments are part of a continuing counter-terrorism mission following Baghdadi\u2019s death. Fighting terrorism. Baghdadi\u2019s death is an important milestone, argues Michael H Fuchs, but the circumstances of the raid and Trump\u2019s announcement also expose the flaws in US approach to counter-terrorism. Facebook employees \u2018strongly object\u2019 to political ads policy More than 250 Facebook employees have signed a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in which they \u201cstrongly object\u201d to the company\u2019s current policy on political advertisements, which allows politicians to include false claims in their ads on the platform, in the latest in a string of examples of tech employees protesting against company policies they consider unethical.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who last week grilled Zuckerberg on the policy at a congressional hearing, tweeted in support of the letter, calling those who had signed it \u201ccourageous\u201d.

The risks of using cannabis to treat mental health disorders such as depression or psychosis are greater than the potential benefits, according to a major study that reviewed evidence from almost 40 years of clinical trials. A 56-year-old woman was killed by shrapnel from a homemade device that was intended to discharge coloured powder as part of a \u2018gender reveal\u2019 party in Iowa, but which instead exploded like a pipe bomb because its top had been sealed with tape.

Prosecutors claimed at least 4,000 people were tortured by his subordinates during interrogation there between April 2011 and 2012, with guards using bars, cables and whips to beat prisoners during interviews.</p> <p>Some prisoners were subjected to electric shocks, while others were \u201chung from the ceiling by their wrists, with only their toes touching the ground\u201d, according to a statement by the German prosecutor.</p> <p>Many died as a result, and Raslan has been has been charged with 59 counts of murder, as well as rape and aggravated sexual assault.</p> <p>\u201cAs head of the investigation unit, the accused Anwar R determined and oversaw the prison\u2019s operational procedures, including the systematic and brutal use of torture,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement. \u201cHe was aware of the fact that prisoners were dying as a result of the massive application of violent force.\u201d</p> <p>Gharib allegedly reported to Raslan, arresting protesters and delivering them to the Branch 251 jail.

Perpetrators should take note that an unprecedented volume of information is being gathered to help ensure they face justice, no matter how much time passes.\u201d</p> <p>The Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which helps victims of abuse in Syria and elsewhere, said seven Syrians would be co-plaintiffs in the case, as allowed under German law.</p> <p>\u201cThese charges send an important message to survivors of Assad\u2019s system of torture,\u201d said Wolfgang Kaleck of the ECCHR. \u201cWe will continue working to ensure that the main perpetrators of state torture under Assad are brought to justice \u2013 in Germany or elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>The trial, set to start in 2020, will be the first prosecution for state-sponsored torture in Syria. The group described it as \u201can important step in the fight against impunity\u201d, and quoted an unnamed survivor of the Branch 251 saying the judicial process was a cause for hope.</p> <p>\u201cThis process in Germany gives hope, even if everything takes a long time and nothing happens tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow. The fact that it continues at all gives us, as survivors, hope for justice. I am ready to testify,\u201d the survivor said.</p> <p>German authorities have approached the cases under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes in one country even if they happened elsewhere.</p>",

Prosecutors claimed at least 4,000 people were tortured by his subordinates during interrogation there between April 2011 and 2012, with guards using bars, cables and whips to beat prisoners during interviews. Some prisoners were subjected to electric shocks, while others were \u201chung from the ceiling by their wrists, with only their toes touching the ground\u201d, according to a statement by the German prosecutor. Many died as a result, and Raslan has been has been charged with 59 counts of murder, as well as rape and aggravated sexual assault. \u201cAs head of the investigation unit, the accused Anwar R determined and oversaw the prison\u2019s operational procedures, including the systematic and brutal use of torture,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement. \u201cHe was aware of the fact that prisoners were dying as a result of the massive application of violent force.\u201d Gharib allegedly reported to Raslan, arresting protesters and delivering them to the Branch 251 jail. He is charged with a role in the abduction and torture of at least 30 people in the autumn of 2011. Raslan and Gharib left Syria in 2013 and entered Germany as asylum seekers in July 2014 and August 2018 respectively. Anwar Raslan came on to the radar of German investigators after a number of his alleged victims spotted him in Berlin and reported the sighting to authorities. After years of civilian deaths and suffering at the hands of multiple parties during the Syrian conflict, the first slow efforts to bring perpetrators to justice and dispel a sense of impunity are moving through national courts in several countries. Many have been driven by Syrian survivors, relatives, activists and lawyers, who have been collecting evidence and submitting criminal complaints across countries including Germany, Austria and Sweden. Documented crimes include the use of chemical weapons and torture, mass execution, Islamic State\u2019s abduction and sexual enslavement of Yazidi women, and the targeted bombing of hospitals and other civilian installations. There has been no concerted international effort because Syria is not a party to the treaty that established the international criminal court, and Russia and China have vetoed efforts to mandate the ICC to set up a special tribunal for Syria. The German prosecutions were welcomed by human rights groups. \u201cWe are starting to see the fruits of a determined push by victims and others to achieve justice,\u201d said Balkees Jarrah, senior counsel at Human Rights Watch. \u201cCriminal cases in Germany and elsewhere in Europe are an important first step in puncturing the climate of impunity that has plagued Syria for far too long. Perpetrators should take note that an unprecedented volume of information is being gathered to help ensure they face justice, no matter how much time passes.\u201d The Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which helps victims of abuse in Syria and elsewhere, said seven Syrians would be co-plaintiffs in the case, as allowed under German law. \u201cThese charges send an important message to survivors of Assad\u2019s system of torture,\u201d said Wolfgang Kaleck of the ECCHR. \u201cWe will continue working to ensure that the main perpetrators of state torture under Assad are brought to justice \u2013 in Germany or elsewhere.\u201d The trial, set to start in 2020, will be the first prosecution for state-sponsored torture in Syria. The group described it as \u201can important step in the fight against impunity\u201d, and quoted an unnamed survivor of the Branch 251 saying the judicial process was a cause for hope. \u201cThis process in Germany gives hope, even if everything takes a long time and nothing happens tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow. The fact that it continues at all gives us, as survivors, hope for justice. I am ready to testify,\u201d the survivor said. German authorities have approached the cases under the legal principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes in one country even if they happened elsewhere.",

Sparked by the dismissal of a popular general who distinguished himself in the war against Islamic State, the demonstrations have been motivated by a deeper undercurrent of anger towards a corrupt religious oligarchy, a rotten bureaucratic regime and the failure of the Iraqi prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, to fulfil any of his campaign pledges after a year in power.</p> \n<p>For a young generation that has grown up in the 16 years that have followed the toppling of Saddam Hussein, elections and representative democracy have become synonymous with corruption and MPs abusing their privileges. Religious parties, many backed by Iran, dominate the political sphere and though oil-rich Iraq has an income of hundreds of billions of dollars, the reality for many citizens is parallel with life in some of the poorest Arab nations: unemployment, a collapsing healthcare system and lack of services.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"2bd45caafefad6f14b269048b79a96d0875716f8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bd45caafefad6f14b269048b79a96d0875716f8/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three young anti-government protesters in Baghdad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Three young anti-government protesters in Baghdad.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the protests gathered pace on 5 October, Baghdad was on the edge.Under a flyover less than a mile from Tahrir Square a teenager wearing a yellow T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops walked slowly while a police officer brandishing his Kalashnikov rifle chased him away. Thin black columns of smoke twisted into the sky and a crowd \u2013 of fellow teenagers and young men \u2013 started marching towards the square.</p> \n<p>Police standing guard shot in the air but the crowd moved on, waving Iraqi flags and Shia banners.</p> \n<p>Tyres were set on fire as the crackle of gunfire became continuous and the sound of teargas canisters being fired became more frequent, white gas mixing with the black fumes from the burning rubber. Back and forth the young men surged, only to be pushed back by the heavy machine-gun fire and teargas.</p> \n<p>Amid the carnage, dozens of small three-wheeled tuk-tuk motorcycle rickshaws zoomed between the crowd, ferrying the injured away from the scene. A yellow one carried a man slumped in the back, unable to breathe.</p> \n<p>Urging the men to move forward was a short thin young man with a well trimmed ginger beard. \u201cWhy are you standing behind?\u201d He called on the men cowering behind the bridge railing. \u201cThose who don\u2019t want to advance go back home.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b7dd8c22-bad0-4bd1-9a1b-9837dafd5ec9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qHfV9NWNF34?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The man, who gave his name as Jawdat, said he was a former fighter with the Hashd al-Shaabi paramilitary group, which was established in 2014 from disparate armed groups and volunteers to fight against Isis.

      "bodyText": "In Al Umma Park in central Baghdad \u2013 the \u201cpark of the nation\u201d \u2013 a small group of men and two women debated under ageing eucalyptus trees how best to articulate the demands of the protesters who have taken to the streets of Iraqi cities in their thousands this month. \u201cBurning army trucks won\u2019t help us, it will only help the government accuse us of being hooligans,\u201d said a young man. \u201cIf I give you 17 RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] launchers and you burn that building, how will that benefit our demands?\u201d Another man called for the government to be toppled. As the group gathered around him listening, someone shouted: \u201cWho made you a speaker?\u201d This spurred the rest of the crowd to break into chants of \u201cno one represents us\u201d and \u201cIran out, out\u201d, denouncing Iraq\u2019s ruling Islamic parties and their Iranian backers. The nature of the debate, just like the demonstrations taking place outside the park, was chaotic, boisterous and leaderless. Most of the group were in their 20s, but among them stood two old communists in Che Guevara berets. Eventually, the crowd agreed on a list of demands, which were read out from the steps of the city\u2019s Freedom monument by a young bearded and bespectacled man: \u201cThe resignation of the government, new elections, a change in the elections law and most importantly putting all the government officials on trial.\u201d The crowd cheered, mobile phones were raised and the call was raised to demonstrate in Tahrir Square. \u2018Those who don\u2019t want to advance go back home\u2019 Iraq\u2019s latest spasm of protest erupted on 1 October after a call for demonstrations on Facebook. Sparked by the dismissal of a popular general who distinguished himself in the war against Islamic State, the demonstrations have been motivated by a deeper undercurrent of anger towards a corrupt religious oligarchy, a rotten bureaucratic regime and the failure of the Iraqi prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, to fulfil any of his campaign pledges after a year in power. For a young generation that has grown up in the 16 years that have followed the toppling of Saddam Hussein, elections and representative democracy have become synonymous with corruption and MPs abusing their privileges. Religious parties, many backed by Iran, dominate the political sphere and though oil-rich Iraq has an income of hundreds of billions of dollars, the reality for many citizens is parallel with life in some of the poorest Arab nations: unemployment, a collapsing healthcare system and lack of services. As the protests gathered pace on 5 October, Baghdad was on the edge.Under a flyover less than a mile from Tahrir Square a teenager wearing a yellow T-shirt, shorts and flip-flops walked slowly while a police officer brandishing his Kalashnikov rifle chased him away. Thin black columns of smoke twisted into the sky and a crowd \u2013 of fellow teenagers and young men \u2013 started marching towards the square. Police standing guard shot in the air but the crowd moved on, waving Iraqi flags and Shia banners. Tyres were set on fire as the crackle of gunfire became continuous and the sound of teargas canisters being fired became more frequent, white gas mixing with the black fumes from the burning rubber. Back and forth the young men surged, only to be pushed back by the heavy machine-gun fire and teargas. Amid the carnage, dozens of small three-wheeled tuk-tuk motorcycle rickshaws zoomed between the crowd, ferrying the injured away from the scene. A yellow one carried a man slumped in the back, unable to breathe. Urging the men to move forward was a short thin young man with a well trimmed ginger beard. \u201cWhy are you standing behind?\u201d He called on the men cowering behind the bridge railing. \u201cThose who don\u2019t want to advance go back home.\u201d The man, who gave his name as Jawdat, said he was a former fighter with the Hashd al-Shaabi paramilitary group, which was established in 2014 from disparate armed groups and volunteers to fight against Isis. Hashd al-Shaabi has received training and other support from Iran. Jawdat said his brother was an officer who was killed in the war against Isis. \u201cI fought with the Hashd, I even went to fight in Syria, but what did I get from this government? Nothing, while those politicians in the Green Zone [in Baghdad] are blocking any attempt to reform the state.\u201d Ambulances darted back and forth ferrying the injured and the dead \u2013 20 people were killed at that demonstration alone on 5 October. During six days of demonstrations, Abdul-Mahdi appeared on TV every night, promising in a soft voice to create jobs, provide cheap housing and eradicate corruption. Yet young unarmed men were killed as they sought refuge behind concrete barriers or stood in the streets waving flags. In at least one instance snipers positioned on buildings participated in the killings. Activists and journalists were intimidated, and dozens of them fled Baghdad after receiving threatening phone calls. Media outlets and TV networks were closed. Plainclothes officers roamed hospital wards, detaining injured demonstrators. \u201cThe doctors just patched my injury and told me to leave quickly, after officers entered the hospital looking for demonstrators,\u201d said a young man as he lay in his bed, his injury still bleeding three days after he was shot in a street close to Tahrir Square. By 7 October more than 106 people had been killed, and more than 6,000 injured. \u2018Iran doesn\u2019t want anything that threatens its position here\u2019 The size of the demonstrations at the start of the month was not abnormal, but what came as a shock was the ferocity of the response. Many Iraqi observers attributed the violence to the extent to which the regime has been shaken. Others suggested that it was indicative of concern among the country\u2019s pro-Iran militias that the protest were really intended to undermine Tehran. \u201cIran doesn\u2019t want anything that threatens its position here and that\u2019s why the reaction was so harsh,\u201d said an intelligence officer at the interior ministry. Many of Iraq\u2019s political parties have ties to Iran and militias that originated there \u2013 a legacy of the aftermath of the 2003 war, when Tehran bolstered Iraq\u2019s newly powerful Shia majority, previously repressed under Saddam\u2019s Sunni Arab Ba\u2019athists. Fatah, the political arm of Hashd al-Shaabi, is Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s remaining major sponsor, after a bloc tied to the firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said it was dropping its support over the weekend. Militiamen have been integrated into the security services and have played a central role in the crackdown on the demonstrations. The militias have become a focus of the demonstrators\u2019 anger, a flashpoint for Iran\u2019s perceived control over the Iraqi state. During one night of protests, a clean-shaven, tall unarmed army officer stood in front of crowd of young men, pleading with them to disperse. \u201cI can let you go down and march towards Tahrir Square,\u201d he said pointing at the rising columns of smoke. \u201cBut I swear by Allah that the militiamen and the snipers will kill you.\u201d The crowds responded with angry anti-Iranian chants. \u2018Our soul, our blood, we sacrifice for you Iraq\u2019 Last Friday, a second wave of demonstrations began. The crowds waved Iraqi flags and chanted \u201cour soul, our blood we sacrifice for you Iraq\u201d. At least 74 people were killed over two days, with hundreds more wounded. The overall toll since the start of the month now stands at more than 250. On Sunday, Iraq\u2019s elite counter-terrorism service said it had been deployed in Baghdad to protect important state buildings \u201cfrom undisciplined elements\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Taking out one of the leaders of the Islamic State is a symbolic and tangible achievement in blunting Isis\u2019s influence. The work of the US military, intelligence agencies and partners on the ground made this possible. And as much as Trump wants to claim personal credit, the success of the raid only highlighted the dangers of his haphazard withdrawal of US troops from Syria: the New York Times reports that the success of the raid occurred \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/us/politics/baghdadi-isis-leader-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">in spite of</a>\u201d Trump\u2019s recent Syria moves, as the Kurds were the key partners providing intelligence and the US military was concerned they wouldn\u2019t get another shot at Baghdadi because intelligence would be significantly reduced after the US withdrawal.</p> <p>But the circumstances surrounding the raid and its announcement raise broader concerns about the nature of America\u2019s counterterrorism policies.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s announcement itself was disturbing \u2013 even setting aside the completely inappropriate description of the death, the unnecessary divulsion of details about the raid and Trump\u2019s self-congratulatory comments making the event about himself. The very fact that we treat the killing of a single terrorist like a national event reveals how our national security priorities are sometimes out of order. Obama\u2019s announcement of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden seemed appropriate, as it felt in part like closure after 3,000 Americans were killed on 9/11 (and Obama\u2019s solemn remarks marked it with the right tone). But presidents hardly ever address the nation when a climate deal is reached or a peacekeeping mission helps deter violence. This may be because presidents feel the need to garner public support for the use of the military abroad, but it\u2019s just as easily chalked up to the overly militaristic approach the US has adopted to counter-terrorism, and how deeply leaders feel the need to look tough in the face of terrorism.</p> <p>The announcement also reinforced how the fear factor of terrorism can dominate US national security policy and how irresponsible politicians like Trump use that fear to pursue dangerous policies. The rise of Isis \u2013 the gruesome videos of murder, attacks abroad, and the fact that Isis controlled territory \u2013 was deadly serious. While pursuing a military campaign along with allies, Obama was criticized for trying to keep the threat in perspective for Americans. During the 2016 campaign and since Trump on the other hand has played on the public\u2019s fear, linking Isis to immigration to scare people. And the public\u2019s fear of terrorism, despite the chances of being hurt by terrorism are virtually none, keeps counter-terrorism efforts at a much more prominent place in national discourse and policy making than they should be.</p> <p>The raid was possible because of a US military presence in the area, but the global war on terror has driven the US to have a significantly expanded global military presence for counter-terrorism purposes \u2013 a trend that should concern Americans. While the US has improved its intelligence and other capabilities to detect and prevent terrorism since 9/11, it has often used the military as a tool of first resort, from Afghanistan to Iraq and beyond. The US military is sometimes the only option for going after terrorists, but we are not nearly cautious enough about its use. Not only does this approach militarize US relationships with countries, but it also means that the military tools end up with outsized influence in determining US policies. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way: A new Cap <a href=\"https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2019/10/24135725/NSIP-pollsheet-terrorism.pdf\">study</a> shows that Americans want leaders to focus on terrorism, but don\u2019t want to treat it like a military problem.</p> <p>Moreover, almost every time we announce a military operation today it is a stark reminder that Congress likely has not voted to use force in those countries. Congress has never explicitly voted to authorize military operations in Yemen or against Isis in Iraq or Syria. While Congress has appropriated funds to fight certain conflicts \u2013 and thereby could be construed as approving them \u2013 the 2001 AUMF is being stretched to justify CT efforts almost 20 years later. No wonder the US military\u2019s global footprint looks the way it does \u2013 with Congress unwilling to vote on military conflicts, there\u2019s little standing in the way of a president who wants to expand that presence.</p> <p>The news about Baghdadi came in the midst of an increasingly rare bipartisan moment, with members of both parties criticizing Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria in a disastrous fashion. The criticism is justified; the way in which Trump withdrew the troops has been catastrophic, resulting in freed Isis terrorists, abandoning the Kurds to a grim fate, helping Russia, Iran and Syria. But the very fact that America\u2019s political parties \u2013 at loggerheads on just about everything \u2013 can agree that removing troops from a foreign conflict (no matter how badly it was done) is worthy of condemnation is a deeply worrying sign about the politics of national security. One can see a similar dynamic on Afghanistan where far too many leaders of all parties seem content with having thousands of US troops there in perpetuity fighting a war that few seem to focus on. Yes, decisions about military force \u2013 using it and ending its use \u2013 are difficult. And yes, there was a much better way to strategically draw down the US troop presence, and even a good case for keeping troops there longer. But since 9/11 we too often shy away from reducing our military presence for fear of the unknown as opposed to leaning towards bringing home the troops as soon as possible.</p> <p>And so one less ruthless terrorist in the world is good news. But we should stop measuring our counter-terrorism efforts by how many terrorists we kill or our security by how many US troops are deployed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Taking out one of the leaders of the Islamic State is a symbolic and tangible achievement in blunting Isis\u2019s influence. The work of the US military, intelligence agencies and partners on the ground made this possible. And as much as Trump wants to claim personal credit, the success of the raid only highlighted the dangers of his haphazard withdrawal of US troops from Syria: the New York Times reports that the success of the raid occurred \u201cin spite of\u201d Trump\u2019s recent Syria moves, as the Kurds were the key partners providing intelligence and the US military was concerned they wouldn\u2019t get another shot at Baghdadi because intelligence would be significantly reduced after the US withdrawal. But the circumstances surrounding the raid and its announcement raise broader concerns about the nature of America\u2019s counterterrorism policies. Trump\u2019s announcement itself was disturbing \u2013 even setting aside the completely inappropriate description of the death, the unnecessary divulsion of details about the raid and Trump\u2019s self-congratulatory comments making the event about himself. The very fact that we treat the killing of a single terrorist like a national event reveals how our national security priorities are sometimes out of order. Obama\u2019s announcement of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden seemed appropriate, as it felt in part like closure after 3,000 Americans were killed on 9/11 (and Obama\u2019s solemn remarks marked it with the right tone). But presidents hardly ever address the nation when a climate deal is reached or a peacekeeping mission helps deter violence. This may be because presidents feel the need to garner public support for the use of the military abroad, but it\u2019s just as easily chalked up to the overly militaristic approach the US has adopted to counter-terrorism, and how deeply leaders feel the need to look tough in the face of terrorism. The announcement also reinforced how the fear factor of terrorism can dominate US national security policy and how irresponsible politicians like Trump use that fear to pursue dangerous policies. The rise of Isis \u2013 the gruesome videos of murder, attacks abroad, and the fact that Isis controlled territory \u2013 was deadly serious. While pursuing a military campaign along with allies, Obama was criticized for trying to keep the threat in perspective for Americans. During the 2016 campaign and since Trump on the other hand has played on the public\u2019s fear, linking Isis to immigration to scare people. And the public\u2019s fear of terrorism, despite the chances of being hurt by terrorism are virtually none, keeps counter-terrorism efforts at a much more prominent place in national discourse and policy making than they should be. The raid was possible because of a US military presence in the area, but the global war on terror has driven the US to have a significantly expanded global military presence for counter-terrorism purposes \u2013 a trend that should concern Americans. While the US has improved its intelligence and other capabilities to detect and prevent terrorism since 9/11, it has often used the military as a tool of first resort, from Afghanistan to Iraq and beyond. The US military is sometimes the only option for going after terrorists, but we are not nearly cautious enough about its use. Not only does this approach militarize US relationships with countries, but it also means that the military tools end up with outsized influence in determining US policies. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way: A new Cap study shows that Americans want leaders to focus on terrorism, but don\u2019t want to treat it like a military problem. Moreover, almost every time we announce a military operation today it is a stark reminder that Congress likely has not voted to use force in those countries. Congress has never explicitly voted to authorize military operations in Yemen or against Isis in Iraq or Syria. While Congress has appropriated funds to fight certain conflicts \u2013 and thereby could be construed as approving them \u2013 the 2001 AUMF is being stretched to justify CT efforts almost 20 years later. No wonder the US military\u2019s global footprint looks the way it does \u2013 with Congress unwilling to vote on military conflicts, there\u2019s little standing in the way of a president who wants to expand that presence. The news about Baghdadi came in the midst of an increasingly rare bipartisan moment, with members of both parties criticizing Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria in a disastrous fashion. The criticism is justified; the way in which Trump withdrew the troops has been catastrophic, resulting in freed Isis terrorists, abandoning the Kurds to a grim fate, helping Russia, Iran and Syria. But the very fact that America\u2019s political parties \u2013 at loggerheads on just about everything \u2013 can agree that removing troops from a foreign conflict (no matter how badly it was done) is worthy of condemnation is a deeply worrying sign about the politics of national security. One can see a similar dynamic on Afghanistan where far too many leaders of all parties seem content with having thousands of US troops there in perpetuity fighting a war that few seem to focus on. Yes, decisions about military force \u2013 using it and ending its use \u2013 are difficult. And yes, there was a much better way to strategically draw down the US troop presence, and even a good case for keeping troops there longer. But since 9/11 we too often shy away from reducing our military presence for fear of the unknown as opposed to leaning towards bringing home the troops as soon as possible. And so one less ruthless terrorist in the world is good news. But we should stop measuring our counter-terrorism efforts by how many terrorists we kill or our security by how many US troops are deployed.",

      "bodyText": "Khadijah Mellah, the hijab-wearing newcomer who caused a sensation by riding the Magnolia Cup winner at Goodwood, was officially ruled out of the contest just weeks beforehand. The moment she failed her first riding test at the British Racing School is at the heart of a thrilling documentary about her foray into racing, Riding A Dream, to be shown on ITV at 12.15pm on Saturday, right after the Rugby World Cup final. \u201cThat was the lowest low ever,\u201d we are told by Mellah, who was by then months into a crash course in jockeyship, which she had juggled with preparing for her A levels and fasting for Ramadan. Her setback can\u2019t have been much fun, either, for Oli Bell, who set Khadijah this challenge and arranged to film it as a means of promoting Brixton\u2019s Ebony Horse Club, where he is the patron and she began to ride. Bell got word that his documentary might be headed for the rocks when she called him in tears at around 1am in Royal Ascot week, hours before he was due to present ITV\u2019s Opening Show. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really bad film here,\u201d he recalls telling his fellow producers at the time, but the opposite has turned out to be true. Mellah worked hard before a second test, a fortnight before Glorious Goodwood, and sailed through on her way to beating her celebrity rivals in the charity race aboard a 25-1 shot. The whole story was caught on camera, including the race itself from Mellah\u2019s point of view, the footage differing from the familiar jockey-cam material in that there is substantially more excited squealing than one would expect from, say, Ryan Moore. Mellah is engagingly down-to-earth. When the Duchess of Cornwall attended the first screening of Riding A Dream at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton last night, she chirpily addressed her from the stage as \u201cCamilla\u201d. In the documentary, she is never more likeable than when describing her bond with Haverland, her low-rated mount. \u201cHe only won one race and it was ages ago,\u201d she says, but she gets on with him, which could not be said of a more talented stablemate who \u201cthrew me off twice\u201d. At Goodwood, she is frustrated that she can\u2019t spend the build-up to the race in the stables with her equine friend. \u201cWhere the boy at?\u201d she asks. Riding A Dream is a highly enjoyable outsider story with a serious point at its core about racing\u2019s need to make itself approachable for entire communities that know it not. \u201cNo one here ever goes racing,\u201d Mellah says over shots of her family and friends celebrating Eid Al Fitr. On Saturday, the telling of her story will also give racing a prime TV slot that could gain it new, young fans. Watching it last night, I loved the way Riding A Dream introduces the sport with moments of drama rapidly intercut like something from Oliver Stone\u2019s high-powered NFL drama Any Given Sunday. Mellah and Bell have really achieved something and I recommend making time to admire their work. You can watch a trailer here.

These shows always feature a shot of the aforementioned Shibuya Crossing, items on AI and sumo wrestling, and a concerned interview with an undersexed young man (sometimes called <em>otaku</em>) and/or an overexcited young woman (something to do with <em>kawaii</em>). Only rarely do they offer fresh insight.</p> <p>At least the upcoming Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! on Netflix and BBC Two\u2019s drama Giri/Haji have obeyed the most basic rule of making British TV about Japan: don\u2019t name it after that slightly racist 1980s hit about masturbation. That\u2019s where Channel 5\u2019s Justin Lee Collins: Turning Japanese went wrong. Or rather, it was the first of many wrong turns in which the since-disgraced comic\u2019s 2011 travelogue erred.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou0A_JI-Q_c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ou0A_JI-Q_c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>TV\u2019s other orientalist missteps are less daft, but more common. The premise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/19/queer-eye-season-four-review-netflix\">Queer Eye</a> \u2013 five sophisticates makeover a sad-sack \u2013 puts Karamo Brown in danger of doing an accidental \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d when he arrives in Tokyo. That is, updating the colonial yarn of the westerner who is eventually accepted by an alien community and then asserts his inherent superiority by embodying the culture better than the locals. Happily, Queer Eye has addressed that risk by including Kiko Mizuhara, a Japanese-American model and Tokyo resident as its guide.</p> <p>The illuminating presence of Mizuhara is, however, unusual. \u201cBritish television programmes have a tendency to represent Japanese people as stereotypically odd or kooky, without explaining the cultural context,\u201d says Professor Perry R Hinton, an expert in intercultural communication.</p> <p>This kind of othering reveals a narrow-mindedness.

      "bodyText": "It just feels so alien! So other! So extraordinarily strange!\u201d So said Sue Perkins as she walked across Tokyo\u2019s most crowded zebra crossing in the opening sequence of her travelogue. But shouldn\u2019t this all be more familiar by now? After all, BBC One\u2019s Japan With Sue Perkins, which aired last month, was only the latest in a long run of British TV programmes inviting us to boggle at the east Asian country. These shows always feature a shot of the aforementioned Shibuya Crossing, items on AI and sumo wrestling, and a concerned interview with an undersexed young man (sometimes called otaku) and/or an overexcited young woman (something to do with kawaii). Only rarely do they offer fresh insight. At least the upcoming Queer Eye: We\u2019re in Japan! on Netflix and BBC Two\u2019s drama Giri/Haji have obeyed the most basic rule of making British TV about Japan: don\u2019t name it after that slightly racist 1980s hit about masturbation. That\u2019s where Channel 5\u2019s Justin Lee Collins: Turning Japanese went wrong. Or rather, it was the first of many wrong turns in which the since-disgraced comic\u2019s 2011 travelogue erred. TV\u2019s other orientalist missteps are less daft, but more common. The premise of Queer Eye \u2013 five sophisticates makeover a sad-sack \u2013 puts Karamo Brown in danger of doing an accidental \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d when he arrives in Tokyo. That is, updating the colonial yarn of the westerner who is eventually accepted by an alien community and then asserts his inherent superiority by embodying the culture better than the locals. Happily, Queer Eye has addressed that risk by including Kiko Mizuhara, a Japanese-American model and Tokyo resident as its guide. The illuminating presence of Mizuhara is, however, unusual. \u201cBritish television programmes have a tendency to represent Japanese people as stereotypically odd or kooky, without explaining the cultural context,\u201d says Professor Perry R Hinton, an expert in intercultural communication. This kind of othering reveals a narrow-mindedness. As Shinichi Adachi, the Japanese-British film-maker behind YouTube culinary series The Wagyu Show explains, Japanese culture isn\u2019t particularly strange, just more accepting of humanity\u2019s strangeness. \u201cThey respect people, even if they don\u2019t understand them.

The grounding of the 737 Max has forced US airlines to cancel flights up to January and February and has also affected European carriers such as Ryanair, which cut 30,000 flights and will fly 5 million fewer passengers than planned next year. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not expected to approve the 737 Max\u2019s use until December at the earliest. Muilenberg will tell the Senate he has flown on two demonstration flights testing the improvements made to the 737 Max. \u201cWhen the 737 Max returns to service, it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly,\u201d he said in his written testimony. He conceded getting the plane back in the air \u201chas taken longer than we originally expected, but we\u2019re committed to getting it right, and return-to-service timing is completely dependent on answering each and every question from the FAA\u201d. He added \u201cregulators should approve the return of the Max to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane\u2019s safety. The flying public deserves nothing less.\u201d Muilenberg also expressed \u201cdeepest sympathies to the families and loved ones\u201d of those killed. He visited the Indonesian embassy in Washington on Monday to meet the country\u2019s ambassador, offer condolences and pay respects to those lost on the flight. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, told Reuters last week the 737 Max \u201cwon\u2019t fly unless 99.9% of the American public and American policymakers are convinced that it\u2019s absolutely safe\u201d. Indonesian investigators reported last week that problems with Boeing\u2019s design, the airline\u2019s maintenance of the jet and pilot errors contributed to the Lion Air crash. Muilenburg noted both crashes involved the repeated activation of a flight control software function known as MCAS after it received faulty sensor input. Boeing\u2019s development of that software has come under criticism from lawmakers and the company is adding safeguards to the system. Muilenburg said the changes would \u201celiminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accident\u201d. Boeing has admitted few mistakes since the two fatal crashes. Earlier this month, the FAA questioned why Boeing withheld instant messages from a former pilot for months that raised questions about MCAS. Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House panel, has one main question for Boeing at Wednesday\u2019s hearing: \u201cHow the hell did this happen?\u201d",

What is immediately striking, in sharp contrast to today, is the moral purpose that drove LBJ and his success in getting, with the help of Republicans in the Senate, both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act on to the statute book. </p> <p>But, as shown by Christopher Hampton\u2019s 2013 play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/22/christopher-hampton-america-play-appomattox\">Appomattox</a> \u2013 which has sadly never been seen in Britain \u2013 LBJ was one of the great tragic heroes of modern times.

I caught an intriguing work by Adam Rapp, <a href=\"https://www.lct.org/shows/sound-inside/\">The Sound Inside</a>, about the odd relationship between Bella, a 53-year-old professor of creative writing at Yale, and a young student, Christopher, who has a passion for Dostoyevsky. Rapp keeps you on tenterhooks as to the real reason for the couple\u2019s extra-curricular friendship and, in a highly literary play, makes a number of shrewd points. One is that fiction is, more often than not, camouflaged autobiography. Another is that, in today\u2019s world, readers (and theatre audiences) crave elliptical conclusions. </p> <p>Mary-Louise Parker is brilliant as the self-contained, solitary Bella and Will Hochman suggests a dark undertow to her inquisitive student. I only hope that if David Cromer\u2019s production makes it to London, as it surely will, it finds a more intimate space than Broadway\u2019s Studio 54. But this is a fine play that, even if not directly about public affairs, proves that uncertainty is the defining condition of modern life.</p>",

But the virtue of the show is that it pins down the current American crisis with jaunty irony. \u201cThe ballot box has thrown your country into chaos,\u201d claims the communist Xue. While Clinton agrees, she plangently sings that you have to stick with democracy. She even finally endorses a Chinese proverb that proclaims: \u201cGood fortune will follow if we somehow survive.\u201d While Hwang\u2019s musical and Arbery\u2019s play deal with the current crisis, Robert Schenkkan\u2019s The Great Society at the Vivian Beaumont looks back to the historic past: specifically to the last years of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency from 1965 to 1968. What is immediately striking, in sharp contrast to today, is the moral purpose that drove LBJ and his success in getting, with the help of Republicans in the Senate, both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act on to the statute book. But, as shown by Christopher Hampton\u2019s 2013 play Appomattox \u2013 which has sadly never been seen in Britain \u2013 LBJ was one of the great tragic heroes of modern times. A progressive politician and genuine idealist, who got 104 bills through Congress, will always be defined by his disastrous escalation of the war in Vietnam. Brian Cox, who plays Johnson in Bill Rauch\u2019s energetic production, doesn\u2019t look much like the man himself but it is still a titanic performance that captures LBJ\u2019s political guile and ingenuity as well as his descent from a great height. Not all New York plays are overtly political. I caught an intriguing work by Adam Rapp, The Sound Inside, about the odd relationship between Bella, a 53-year-old professor of creative writing at Yale, and a young student, Christopher, who has a passion for Dostoyevsky. Rapp keeps you on tenterhooks as to the real reason for the couple\u2019s extra-curricular friendship and, in a highly literary play, makes a number of shrewd points. One is that fiction is, more often than not, camouflaged autobiography. Another is that, in today\u2019s world, readers (and theatre audiences) crave elliptical conclusions. Mary-Louise Parker is brilliant as the self-contained, solitary Bella and Will Hochman suggests a dark undertow to her inquisitive student. I only hope that if David Cromer\u2019s production makes it to London, as it surely will, it finds a more intimate space than Broadway\u2019s Studio 54. But this is a fine play that, even if not directly about public affairs, proves that uncertainty is the defining condition of modern life.",

This is the way to get Brexit done so the country can move on.\u201d On Monday night the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told MPs that all stages of legislation to trigger an early general election would go through the Commons on Tuesday, adding: \u201cI can assure this House that we will not bring back the withdrawal agreement bill.\u201d Earlier Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said she was not happy with Johnson\u2019s proposed date of 12 December, which is after many universities have broken up for Christmas and students have returned to their home towns. She said: \u201cBoris Johnson claims he wants a general election, but he also claimed he wouldn\u2019t prorogue parliament or put a border down the Irish sea. \u201cIf Boris Johnson wants a general election, then he could have supported our bill for a general election on 9 December. Instead, he has chosen to stick to his original plan for 12 December which we have already rejected.\u201d Swinson left the door open for a possible compromise, but there are fears among opposition parties about whether the prime minister really would abandon all efforts to pass the EU withdrawal agreement before the dissolution of parliament next Wednesday. Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader, said his party would need a \u201ccast-iron guarantee\u201d that the prime minister would not try to bring back his Brexit deal to parliament. He told MPs: \u201cIt is clear that there is a desire on the opposition benches to bring forward a bill that can give us an election. But we don\u2019t trust this prime minister and we don\u2019t trust this prime minister for good reason. \u201cSo the prime minister, if he is going to bring forward a bill, must give an absolute cast-iron assurance that up until the passage of that bill and the rising of parliament, that there will be no attempt to bring forward the withdrawal agreement bill.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, also suggested his party could be persuaded to back the idea, with the shadow cabinet convening on Tuesday to discuss its position. \u201cWe will consider carefully any legislation on an early election,\u201d he said. But Corbyn added that a date needed to be locked down in law to prevent Johnson trying to move it for his own advantage and also suggested he would want it to be earlier than 12 December,saying any plan would need to \u201cprotect the voting rights of all of our citizens\u201d. For a 9 December election, parliament would need to pass its legislation by Thursday this week, but for a 12 December election it could wait until the middle of next week. The government\u2019s argument is that it needs a 12 December date in order to pass Northern Ireland budget legislation before parliament is dissolved for an election. No 10 has been split over whether to proceed with the Brexit deal before an election or just push straight for the polls. But Johnson made a firm decision on Monday that ditching the withdrawal bill this parliament was a price worth paying for an election. However, polling experts are divided over whether an election before Brexit will benefit Johnson at all, with the Brexit party expected to exploit his failure to leave on 31 October. The prime minister\u2019s move for an election came on the day he accepted the EU\u2019s offer of a three-month extension to article 50, bringing a formal end to his pledge for the UK to complete Brexit by 31 October,\u201cdo or die\u201d. The government finally recognised that this prospect was over by pausing its \u00a3100m advertising campaign, which had stated the UK would leave the EU on that date. It also shelved Operation Yellowhammer, Whitehall\u2019s efforts to plan for a no-deal Brexit. Labour is also split about the wisdom of a poll when Brexit remains unresolved, with some senior shadow cabinet ministers arguing for an election and others for a second referendum first. The Liberal Democrats are keen for an election as they are doing well in the polls on the back of their pro-EU position, while the SNP are also expected to gain MPs in Scotland on current predictions. Although the Conservatives are ahead, many Tory MPs believe it is a very risky move at a volatile time and have reminded the prime minister how Theresa May lost a strong poll lead over Corbyn in 2017 to finish with a hung parliament. Former Tories who had the whip withdrawn over their opposition to a hard Brexit and some pro-deal Labour MPs said they were unhappy with Johnson\u2019s decision to abandon the withdrawal bill. Philip Hammond, the former chancellor who had the whip removed, said: \u201cParliament showed last week it wanted to get on with the bill \u2013 it\u2019s the government that hasn\u2019t allowed us to do so. So stop the self-indulgent focus on elections on both sides and concentrate on passing the bill. If we\u2019d done that last week, we could have finished it by now.\u201d Sarah Champion, a Labour MP who voted for Johnson\u2019s deal at second reading, added: \u201cI\u2019ve always said Boris doesn\u2019t care about Brexit, just increasing his majority and staying as PM. He had a majority to get a Brexit deal and he\u2019s thrown it away in his quest for a general election.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Google\u2019s latest Pixel 4 XL smartphone is its bravest yet, throwing out the conventions of old, integrating cutting-edge technology and attempting to round it all out with a special mix of software direct from the Android-maker.</p> <p>By now you probably know the drill. The Pixel 4 XL is a metal and glass sandwich like practically every other phone. Unlike most though the aluminium sides have a black textured coating, which aids grip, while the back feels almost like super-smooth skin or silk rather than glass. It also has bold, contrasting colours, if you choose the white or orange variant, that make it stand out well against the competition.</p> <p>The 6.3in QHD+ OLED screen is big but not massive by today\u2019s 6.5in-plus standards. It has a 90Hz refresh rate, but just in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929090/google-pixel-4-screen-smooth-display-refresh-rate-lighting-conditions-software-update\">certain lighting conditions</a> for now, which Google says it\u2019s working on a fix to increase. Generally it makes the experience of using it smoother and more fluid. It\u2019s crisp, colourful and has good viewing angles but can\u2019t reach the same super-bright heights as rivals \u2013 the 90Hz display on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/22/oneplus-7t-pro-review-the-best-kind-of-deja-vu\">OnePlus 7T Pro</a> has far more wow factor. A chunky top bezel hides a new Face Unlock system and Google\u2019s new party trick: the Soli radar system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42337a37baeb40b85bfed2c9a220cf443ad27ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42337a37baeb40b85bfed2c9a220cf443ad27ecb/855_714_3414_2049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 4 XL review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The frosted glass back feels very different to those fitted to rivals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pixel 4 XL is a large phone that doesn\u2019t feel too big in the hand. The textured sides and frosted glass back help with grip. I never felt I would drop it. At 8.2mm thick and 75.1mm wide it compares favourably to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/iphone-11-pro-max-review-battery-camera-screen\">Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> and the OnePlus 7T Pro, while undercutting both by as much as 29g.</p> <p>It feels like a phone you\u2019re meant to use without a case, rather than something that needs protecting \u2013 although dropping it runs the risk of it smashing, like any other phone, so whether people will use it without a case is another matter.</p> <p>The bottom has a USB-C port, the back supports wireless charging, there\u2019s an accent colour<strong> </strong>on the power button and you can still squeeze the sides on the bottom half of the phone to activate Google Assistant.</p> <h2>Specifications</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> 6.3in QHD+ OLED (90Hz, 537ppi)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Processor:</strong> octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855</p></li> <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> 6GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> 64 or 128GB</p></li> <li><p><strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 10</p></li> <li><p><strong>Camera:</strong> Dual rear cameras (12.2+16MP) with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera</p></li> <li><p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> LTE, wifi 5, NFC, eSIM, Bluetooth 5, GPS, 3D face recognition</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 75.1 x 160.4 x 8.2mm</p></li> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 193g</p></li> </ul> <h2>Speed, but not for long</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cf76785308b66815ed46f5cc41c45542f4df5c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cf76785308b66815ed46f5cc41c45542f4df5c7/739_378_3370_2022/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 4 XL review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The battery life isn\u2019t great, so you might be reaching for the charger more than you\u2019d expect.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pixel 4 XL has 6GB of RAM, at least 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm\u2019s top processors, the Snapdragon 855, which was only recently replaced by the slightly faster 855+ as used in the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro.</p> <p>In day-to-day tasks the Pixel 4 XL felt fast and fluid \u2013 significantly faster than a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/06/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-the-sweet-spot\">Samsung Galaxy S10</a>, but not quite as super-slick as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/16/oneplus-7t-review-the-new-cut-price-flagship-king\">OnePlus 7T</a>. Most will be very happy and the Pixel 4 XL is likely to continue feeling fast and responsive a couple of years down the line if the previous generation Pixels are anything to go by.</p> <p>What\u2019s not so great is battery life. The Pixel 4 XL only lasts just over 26 hours between charges with medium usage, which means 7am on day one until 9am on day two in the working week. That\u2019s not really long enough to guarantee the Pixel 4 XL will be alive and kicking at the end of a night out to see you home.</p> <p>That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 50 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and taking about 15 photos.</p> <p>For comparison, the OnePlus 7T lasts 34 hours or the similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts just shy of 48 hours under similar conditions. Turning off the ambient display feature added about two hours to the battery life.</p> <p>The Pixel 4 XL fast-charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, one of which is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W. A full charge via cable took just under two hours, hitting 70% in 50 minutes.</p> <h2>Android 10</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bb124b57a10c09536fbda07756066753a80f814\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bb124b57a10c09536fbda07756066753a80f814/241_260_4624_2775/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 4 XL review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new Google Recorder app is a brilliant example of using on-device AI technology for useful new functions, rather than whizz-bang gimmicks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Pixel 4 XL is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/04/android-10-released-everything-you-need-to-know-about-google-update\">Android 10</a>, here with a level of polish only OnePlus rivals, and a bunch of Pixel-exclusive features, some of which will make it to third-party smartphones at some point<strong>.</strong></p> <p>Android 10 introduced a system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation, which makes using large-screen smartphones a lot easier. You\u2019re going to get at least three years of software updates from the release of the phone, and major Android version updates before anyone else<strong>.</strong></p> <p>The big new Pixel 4 XL software advance is on-device natural language processing. Normally when you speak to your phone for Assistant, search or similar, it sends what you say across the internet to be understood on Google\u2019s server farm.</p> <p>Now Google has managed to make that technology run on the phone itself, with some very impressive results. It\u2019s considerably faster, recognising what you say instantly, doesn\u2019t require an internet connection, and is better for privacy because your voice doesn\u2019t leave the device.</p> <p>A new version of Assistant uses it to great effect. You can rattle off commands at breakneck speeds and it will understand the lot. If you want to open the camera, shoot a photo and share it to a friend you can now do it faster with your voice than you probably can with taps.</p> <p>The Google Recorder app is equally impressive, transcribing voice recordings on-device in real time and tying text and audio together so you can search through them. Lastly Google\u2019s new Live Captions can put subtitles on any video, even if it\u2019s muted \u2013 perfect for those who can\u2019t turn the sound up but want to know what\u2019s happening in a video.</p> <p>These thoroughly impressive software features are what Google does best.</p> <p>Unfortunately the new Assistant only works in US English for now. Worse, you can\u2019t use it if you have a G Suite account<strong> </strong>(Google\u2019s commercial services including email) logged into your phone. Google says it\u2019s working on a fix.</p> <h2>Motion Sense</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4253969162c04c5ee988c2204c21fd3d765ba2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4253969162c04c5ee988c2204c21fd3d765ba2e/0_306_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 4 XL review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motion Sense uses the Soli radar technology to detect and track objects and gestures happening above and around the phone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the products of Google\u2019s advanced projects research division is Soli, which is a miniaturised radar system enabling the new Motion Sense feature. It detects when you\u2019re within 60cm and shows the ambient display. Reaching for the phone lights up the screen fully and gets it ready to recognise your face, but it can also snooze alarms and silence calls.</p> <p>A swipe through the air above the phone can skip tracks in music apps or from the lockscreen, and more gestures are promised. It worked well when on a desk, but was harder to trigger when handheld.</p> <p>The technology is certainly novel and works surprisingly well, but these sorts of gestures aren\u2019t a new thing and I\u2019m not sure Google has hit on the killer feature for Soli yet.</p> <h2>Face Unlock</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681c15c71db773bdaef86ca37d4071eeb7de179e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681c15c71db773bdaef86ca37d4071eeb7de179e/448_411_4112_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 4 XL review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face Unlock shows promise, but needs the support of third-party apps to come into its own.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new 3D face recognition technology. Face Unlock works essentially the same way as Apple\u2019s Face ID, except faster. A little too fast in some instances, unlocking the phone when I didn\u2019t actually intend to. A simple glance at the phone is all that\u2019s required, although you don\u2019t actually need to have your eyes open for it to recognise you \u2013 which might be a problem for those with prying partners. Google says it\u2019s working on a fix (can you spot the trend here?).</p> <p>It works through polarised sunglasses and not once did it fail to recognise me. By default it skips the lockscreen and opens the phone straight up to whatever you were doing, which I wish Apple\u2019s Face ID did.</p> <p>But most third-party apps don\u2019t support Face Unlock now. That\u2019s because to do so they have to implement <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/better-biometrics-in-android-p.html\">a new unified biometric system</a> which allows the phone to decide whether to use a fingerprint, a face or something else. Most don\u2019t, which means they don\u2019t even see the Face Unlock system.</p> <p>Used to just using my fingerprint for everything, I\u2019d forgotten what a pain entering strong pins or 55-digit passwords into apps can be.

The new on-device natural language understanding is a marvel. The next-generation Google Assistant feels like we\u2019re finally putting the kind of AI we\u2019re used to seeing in films in our phones, not on some server somewhere providing the illusion of being in our devices. This is the smartest phone I\u2019ve ever used and I genuinely enjoyed Google\u2019s moments of magic.</p> <p>But for every feature that\u2019s good, there\u2019s a problem that needs fixing. The screen\u2019s great, but not always at 90Hz and not always bright enough, and the battery life just isn\u2019t long enough for a top-end phone in 2019.</p> <p>The fact that the new Assistant doesn\u2019t work when you have a G Suite account on your phone \u2013 a product made and sold to companies by Google \u2013 is frankly embarrassing. As is the oversight that some may want to make sure they\u2019re actually looking at their phone with their eyes before it unlocks \u2013 Apple knew this and has had it in Face ID for three years.</p> <p>The biggest issue for me, however, is that the Android app ecosystem just isn\u2019t ready for a phone that has dumped the fingerprint sensor. Face Unlock is genuinely great. A transformational leap just as Face ID was three years ago on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/10/iphone-x-review-apple-face-id-all-screen-design-home-button\">iPhone X</a>, but only when it works.

Only one app I routinely use a fingerprint with supports Face Unlock.</p> <p>That situation will change once all the apps have been updated, but I\u2019m not holding my breath for the very slow-moving banks to support Face Unlock any time soon, and that\u2019s a real problem.</p> <p>The Pixel 4 XL is therefore a very hard phone to grade. Once Google fixes the problems and apps have been updated, the only thing really holding the phone back is below-average battery life. If that\u2019s something you can live with, and you trust Google to fix things, then by all means buy the Pixel 4 XL.</p> <p>But at \u00a3829, or really \u00a3929 if you want a reasonable 128GB of storage space, there are better, problem-free experiences to be had out there from the likes of OnePlus, and for less money too.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> amazing on-device natural language processing, next-generation Google Assistant, brilliant camera, Face Unlock, Google Recorder app, Android 10 + fast updates, 90Hz screen.</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> poor third-party app support for Face Unlock, Face Unlock needs eyes-open fix, Google Assistant needs G Suite fix, below-average battery life, no fingerprint scanner option.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f20b818c741392b62e6f0232fa0feb2681ac0c30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f20b818c741392b62e6f0232fa0feb2681ac0c30/701_778_3603_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel 4 XL review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The status bar at the top glows when Motion Sense is available in your current app, and flashes across the screen in the direction of your mid-air swipes to show it has detected something happening.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/06/best-smartphone-iphone-samsung-google-huawei-ios-android-buyers-guide-compared-ranked\">Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/22/oneplus-7t-pro-review-the-best-kind-of-deja-vu\">OnePlus 7T Pro review: the best kind of deja vu</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/16/oneplus-7t-review-the-new-cut-price-flagship-king\">OnePlus 7T review: the new cut-price flagship king</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/11/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review-smartphone-ultrasonic-triple-camera\">Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: a simply stunning screen</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review-bigger-and-now-with-a-magic-wand\">Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ review: bigger and now with a magic wand</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/09/iphone-11-pro-max-review-battery-camera-screen\">Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max review: salvaged by epic battery life</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/24/huawei-p30-pro-review-leica-quad-camera-zoom\">Huawei P30 Pro review: game-changing camera, stellar battery life</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/18/fairphone-3-review-ethical-phone\">Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Google\u2019s latest Pixel 4 XL smartphone is its bravest yet, throwing out the conventions of old, integrating cutting-edge technology and attempting to round it all out with a special mix of software direct from the Android-maker. By now you probably know the drill. The Pixel 4 XL is a metal and glass sandwich like practically every other phone. Unlike most though the aluminium sides have a black textured coating, which aids grip, while the back feels almost like super-smooth skin or silk rather than glass. It also has bold, contrasting colours, if you choose the white or orange variant, that make it stand out well against the competition. The 6.3in QHD+ OLED screen is big but not massive by today\u2019s 6.5in-plus standards. It has a 90Hz refresh rate, but just in certain lighting conditions for now, which Google says it\u2019s working on a fix to increase. Generally it makes the experience of using it smoother and more fluid. It\u2019s crisp, colourful and has good viewing angles but can\u2019t reach the same super-bright heights as rivals \u2013 the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7T Pro has far more wow factor. A chunky top bezel hides a new Face Unlock system and Google\u2019s new party trick: the Soli radar system. The Pixel 4 XL is a large phone that doesn\u2019t feel too big in the hand. The textured sides and frosted glass back help with grip. I never felt I would drop it. At 8.2mm thick and 75.1mm wide it compares favourably to Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro Max and the OnePlus 7T Pro, while undercutting both by as much as 29g. It feels like a phone you\u2019re meant to use without a case, rather than something that needs protecting \u2013 although dropping it runs the risk of it smashing, like any other phone, so whether people will use it without a case is another matter. The bottom has a USB-C port, the back supports wireless charging, there\u2019s an accent colour on the power button and you can still squeeze the sides on the bottom half of the phone to activate Google Assistant. Specifications Screen: 6.3in QHD+ OLED (90Hz, 537ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 6GB Storage: 64 or 128GB Operating system: Android 10 Camera: Dual rear cameras (12.2+16MP) with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 5, NFC, eSIM, Bluetooth 5, GPS, 3D face recognition Dimensions: 75.1 x 160.4 x 8.2mm Weight: 193g Speed, but not for long The Pixel 4 XL has 6GB of RAM, at least 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm\u2019s top processors, the Snapdragon 855, which was only recently replaced by the slightly faster 855+ as used in the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro. In day-to-day tasks the Pixel 4 XL felt fast and fluid \u2013 significantly faster than a Samsung Galaxy S10, but not quite as super-slick as the OnePlus 7T. Most will be very happy and the Pixel 4 XL is likely to continue feeling fast and responsive a couple of years down the line if the previous generation Pixels are anything to go by. What\u2019s not so great is battery life. The Pixel 4 XL only lasts just over 26 hours between charges with medium usage, which means 7am on day one until 9am on day two in the working week. That\u2019s not really long enough to guarantee the Pixel 4 XL will be alive and kicking at the end of a night out to see you home. That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 50 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and taking about 15 photos. For comparison, the OnePlus 7T lasts 34 hours or the similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts just shy of 48 hours under similar conditions. Turning off the ambient display feature added about two hours to the battery life. The Pixel 4 XL fast-charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, one of which is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W. A full charge via cable took just under two hours, hitting 70% in 50 minutes. Android 10 The Pixel 4 XL is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, here with a level of polish only OnePlus rivals, and a bunch of Pixel-exclusive features, some of which will make it to third-party smartphones at some point. Android 10 introduced a system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation, which makes using large-screen smartphones a lot easier. You\u2019re going to get at least three years of software updates from the release of the phone, and major Android version updates before anyone else. The big new Pixel 4 XL software advance is on-device natural language processing. Normally when you speak to your phone for Assistant, search or similar, it sends what you say across the internet to be understood on Google\u2019s server farm. Now Google has managed to make that technology run on the phone itself, with some very impressive results. It\u2019s considerably faster, recognising what you say instantly, doesn\u2019t require an internet connection, and is better for privacy because your voice doesn\u2019t leave the device. A new version of Assistant uses it to great effect. You can rattle off commands at breakneck speeds and it will understand the lot. If you want to open the camera, shoot a photo and share it to a friend you can now do it faster with your voice than you probably can with taps. The Google Recorder app is equally impressive, transcribing voice recordings on-device in real time and tying text and audio together so you can search through them. Lastly Google\u2019s new Live Captions can put subtitles on any video, even if it\u2019s muted \u2013 perfect for those who can\u2019t turn the sound up but want to know what\u2019s happening in a video. These thoroughly impressive software features are what Google does best. Unfortunately the new Assistant only works in US English for now. Worse, you can\u2019t use it if you have a G Suite account (Google\u2019s commercial services including email) logged into your phone. Google says it\u2019s working on a fix. Motion Sense One of the products of Google\u2019s advanced projects research division is Soli, which is a miniaturised radar system enabling the new Motion Sense feature. It detects when you\u2019re within 60cm and shows the ambient display. Reaching for the phone lights up the screen fully and gets it ready to recognise your face, but it can also snooze alarms and silence calls. A swipe through the air above the phone can skip tracks in music apps or from the lockscreen, and more gestures are promised. It worked well when on a desk, but was harder to trigger when handheld. The technology is certainly novel and works surprisingly well, but these sorts of gestures aren\u2019t a new thing and I\u2019m not sure Google has hit on the killer feature for Soli yet. Face Unlock Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new 3D face recognition technology. Face Unlock works essentially the same way as Apple\u2019s Face ID, except faster. A little too fast in some instances, unlocking the phone when I didn\u2019t actually intend to. A simple glance at the phone is all that\u2019s required, although you don\u2019t actually need to have your eyes open for it to recognise you \u2013 which might be a problem for those with prying partners. Google says it\u2019s working on a fix (can you spot the trend here?). It works through polarised sunglasses and not once did it fail to recognise me. By default it skips the lockscreen and opens the phone straight up to whatever you were doing, which I wish Apple\u2019s Face ID did. But most third-party apps don\u2019t support Face Unlock now. That\u2019s because to do so they have to implement a new unified biometric system which allows the phone to decide whether to use a fingerprint, a face or something else. Most don\u2019t, which means they don\u2019t even see the Face Unlock system. Used to just using my fingerprint for everything, I\u2019d forgotten what a pain entering strong pins or 55-digit passwords into apps can be. Once apps are updated, using Face Unlock with apps such as LastPass is a fantastic, seamless experience; the kind of experience you\u2019ve had on a top iPhone for the last three years. Fewer than 10 apps currently do so, though. And even leaders in fintech such as Monzo are saying it will take a while to implement, so you can forget your traditional banking apps. At least this one isn\u2019t up to Google to fix. Camera Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the Pixel 4 XL is no different, now with a dual-camera system on the back. It is arguably the best point-and-shoot camera available. Still photos are full of drama and with an amazing amount of detail, even in very difficult lighting conditions. New for the Pixel 4 XL is the ability to manually alter the foreground and background brightness independently. Portrait mode for people, pets or objects is also improved particularly around things such as wisps of hair. A 2x telephoto camera has significantly improved the zoom, using the firm\u2019s Super Res Zoom technology to reach to 8x while still preserving a lot of fine detail. It compares favourably with the iPhone 11 Pro, but can\u2019t hold a candle to the 5x optical and up to 50x digital zoom of the Huawei P30 Pro. Google\u2019s Night Sight mode continues to lead the market in capability and flexibility, and can now shoot three-minute exposures of stars with astrological mode \u2013 not that I could test that given the British weather over the last two weeks. The single selfie camera is also good, with a wider angle than most front-facing cameras. Video capture is generally solid, but caps out at 4K at 30fps and is by no means market-leading. If video is your medium of choice there are better cameras than the Pixel 4 XL. The lack of the fun ultrawide-angle camera popular with other manufacturers is also disappointing, as is Google dumping free full-resolution Photos backup, which has been a Pixel value-add for years. Observations If you have your phone by your bed at night the ambient screen never shuts off because you\u2019re typically within the Motion Sense bubble all the time \u2013 there really needs to be a scheduler or for the display to turn off when you activate do-not-disturb mode. There\u2019s a new Pokemon live wallpaper where you can wave at or pet Pikachu and others using Motion Sense. Price The Google Pixel 4 XL costs \u00a3829 ($899) with 64GB or \u00a3929 ($999) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the smaller Google Pixel 4 costs \u00a3669 ($799), the OnePlus 7T costs \u00a3549, the OnePlus 7T Pro costs \u00a3699, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs \u00a3899, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs \u00a3999, the iPhone 11 costs \u00a3729 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs \u00a31,149. Verdict There will be a time when the Google Pixel 4 XL might be a great phone, but that time isn\u2019t now. I love the design, the feel, the 90Hz screen and incredible camera. The new on-device natural language understanding is a marvel.

They have often ended up having what she refers to as \u201cdeficit sex ...

It\u2019s horrifying when you think about it, but just saying this to couples can really change things for them.\u201d</p> <p>The first step, therefore, is to sit down and talk, but even the seasoned relationship and family therapist Armele Philpotts concedes that sex is the hardest thing to talk about. \u201cIt\u2019s really personal and we feel so vulnerable,\u201d she says, adding that talking under the guidance of a therapist, \u201cmakes it a little bit easier\u201d.</p> <p>For discussions with your partner, remaining fully clothed works best \u2013 with debriefs during or immediately after sex avoided. \u201cIn no other category in life,\u201d says Major, who is head of service quality and clinical practice at the relationship support charity Relate, \u201cis it possible to humiliate somebody as easily.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/15/my-mid-life-adventures-online-dating\">My mid-life adventures in online dating</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asking caring questions is a good start, says Philpotts. \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to try that we\u2019ve never done? Is there anything that since childbirth, for example, is uncomfortable? How has your body changed from when we first started making love?\u201d</p> <p>If you have a gripe, own it, says Major. \u201cMake it about you rather than being critical of a partner. It\u2019s about saying: \u2018I\u2019ve noticed maybe I need a bit more of this or less of that.\u2019\u201d Also key, she says, \u201cis not putting yourself under pressure because you think you should be getting out a gimp mask\u201d.</p> <p>What if one partner requests a kink the other finds horrifying? \u201cIf your partner suggests anal sex, for example,\u201d says Major, \u201ca lot of people, if they\u2019ve not experienced that, might think it\u2019s disgusting and it will hurt. But I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with any suggestion providing you ask the right way and you\u2019re prepared to be turned down or try a compromise.\u201d Equally, nobody should feel guilty if they don\u2019t want to \u201cdo certain types of sex, and nobody should be made to do it; that would fall under domestic abuse\u201d.</p> <p>There are many ways to approach the situation, she says. \u201cTalk about it, or try it a little bit, go half way. People have different sexual needs in terms of quantity, too, so it\u2019s always a compromise; making sure each partner gets most of their needs met, some of the time, or some of their needs met most of the time. Be kind; be realistic \u2013 we\u2019re all getting older.\u201d</p> <p>Laying the groundwork requires maintaining connection. \u201cIntimacy is bigger than sex,\u201d says Major. \u201cI would say intimacy can start in the morning and I don\u2019t mean with a shag. Even if you\u2019re very busy, a text to say: \u2018Thinking about you\u2019 or: \u2018Looking forward to seeing you tonight\u2019. It can be tiny things \u2013 a touch of the hand, asking how their day was.\u201d It boils down to being nice to each other. \u201cIf you feel someone\u2019s kind and loving towards you, it makes it much easier to have those conversations when things might not be going too well in the sex department.\u201d</p> <p>A common complaint she hears is that a client comes home exhausted only \u201cto find your partner shoving their hand between your legs. Some people need a bit of a buildup.\u201d In her 25 years of providing sex therapy, she says, the main requirement hasn\u2019t changed much \u2013 most people want to \u201cfeel connected with somebody and not just be confronted with: \u2018I want to have sex with you, even though I might have been distant or horrible to you all day.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really important to have a tactile routine,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAlways say goodnight properly, kiss and have a cuddle. And do the same in the morning.\u201d Going to bed at the same time is optimal. \u201cWith so many couples, one goes up the stairs and the other stays down watching porn when they could be in bed together.\u201d</p> <p>She advises exercises to help break out of restrictive routines, such as: \u201cWithout trying to arouse your partner, move their hands wherever you want them to go. If you want more of something or something different, just move your partner\u2019s hands. You might end up doing very different things \u2013 it\u2019s a very different lovemaking session because you end up far away from the usual moves.\u201d</p> <p>Ten years into a relationship, says Campbell, desire is no longer automatic. \u201cIf you think about the early stages, you\u2019re up for it all the time. But beyond 10 years, you\u2019d rather have a cup of tea. However, if you choose to engage in sexual behaviour, you might often become aroused and go for it.\u201d This is one reason why sex therapists recommend scheduling sex. It may not be spontaneous, but neither, in fact, were the hot, panting sessions of your dating years. \u201cYou knew you were going to have sex \u2013 you prepared for it, shaved your legs and all of that,\u201d says Campbell.</p> <p>Scheduled sex doesn\u2019t have to come with pressure or promises. Book an hour together, says Campbell, \u201clay or sit together naked, or have a bath together (the taller partner lies against the back of the bath with the other one between their legs lying back against them). Just chat and if you want to get sexual then you can.\u201d But just as importantly, she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve connected\u201d.</p> <p>You could start by sharing memories of the best times you have had sex, says Philpotts. \u201cWhat was it that you particularly liked? If we only talk about what\u2019s not going right, that can feel demoralising.\u201d</p> <p>Another game Campbell favours is to say: \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know about you. Whether that\u2019s a sexual something or not.\u201d Or there\u2019s the classic sex therapy exercise of exploring each other\u2019s bodies. \u201cWhen was the last time you just lay naked together? Have you ever looked behind their ears, knees, nape of their neck? Or just look at one another\u2019s hands in great detail \u2013 this has led to sex for a lot of people. It\u2019s so intimate just looking at someone\u2019s hands, turning them over and touching them, smelling them. Just get to know them again. It\u2019s kind of symbolic of the whole relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Philpotts says that in sex-therapy circles, there\u2019s a whole discourse about challenging the idea that once you\u2019re settled into a marriage, \u201cyou might as well get your slippers out\u201d. Whereas sex when you are younger and less experienced can be more mechanical, she says, as you get older \u201cyou know each other better, there\u2019s more trust, you\u2019re more comfortable with your body\u201d. That bond and intimate knowledge of each other, she says, can pave the way to sex getting \u201cbetter and better right through to your 80s\u201d.</p>",

It can be tiny things \u2013 a touch of the hand, asking how their day was.\u201d It boils down to being nice to each other. \u201cIf you feel someone\u2019s kind and loving towards you, it makes it much easier to have those conversations when things might not be going too well in the sex department.\u201d A common complaint she hears is that a client comes home exhausted only \u201cto find your partner shoving their hand between your legs. Some people need a bit of a buildup.\u201d In her 25 years of providing sex therapy, she says, the main requirement hasn\u2019t changed much \u2013 most people want to \u201cfeel connected with somebody and not just be confronted with: \u2018I want to have sex with you, even though I might have been distant or horrible to you all day.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really important to have a tactile routine,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAlways say goodnight properly, kiss and have a cuddle. And do the same in the morning.\u201d Going to bed at the same time is optimal. \u201cWith so many couples, one goes up the stairs and the other stays down watching porn when they could be in bed together.\u201d She advises exercises to help break out of restrictive routines, such as: \u201cWithout trying to arouse your partner, move their hands wherever you want them to go. If you want more of something or something different, just move your partner\u2019s hands. You might end up doing very different things \u2013 it\u2019s a very different lovemaking session because you end up far away from the usual moves.\u201d Ten years into a relationship, says Campbell, desire is no longer automatic. \u201cIf you think about the early stages, you\u2019re up for it all the time. But beyond 10 years, you\u2019d rather have a cup of tea. However, if you choose to engage in sexual behaviour, you might often become aroused and go for it.\u201d This is one reason why sex therapists recommend scheduling sex. It may not be spontaneous, but neither, in fact, were the hot, panting sessions of your dating years. \u201cYou knew you were going to have sex \u2013 you prepared for it, shaved your legs and all of that,\u201d says Campbell. Scheduled sex doesn\u2019t have to come with pressure or promises. Book an hour together, says Campbell, \u201clay or sit together naked, or have a bath together (the taller partner lies against the back of the bath with the other one between their legs lying back against them). Just chat and if you want to get sexual then you can.\u201d But just as importantly, she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve connected\u201d. You could start by sharing memories of the best times you have had sex, says Philpotts. \u201cWhat was it that you particularly liked? If we only talk about what\u2019s not going right, that can feel demoralising.\u201d Another game Campbell favours is to say: \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know about you. Whether that\u2019s a sexual something or not.\u201d Or there\u2019s the classic sex therapy exercise of exploring each other\u2019s bodies. \u201cWhen was the last time you just lay naked together? Have you ever looked behind their ears, knees, nape of their neck? Or just look at one another\u2019s hands in great detail \u2013 this has led to sex for a lot of people. It\u2019s so intimate just looking at someone\u2019s hands, turning them over and touching them, smelling them. Just get to know them again. It\u2019s kind of symbolic of the whole relationship.\u201d Philpotts says that in sex-therapy circles, there\u2019s a whole discourse about challenging the idea that once you\u2019re settled into a marriage, \u201cyou might as well get your slippers out\u201d. Whereas sex when you are younger and less experienced can be more mechanical, she says, as you get older \u201cyou know each other better, there\u2019s more trust, you\u2019re more comfortable with your body\u201d. That bond and intimate knowledge of each other, she says, can pave the way to sex getting \u201cbetter and better right through to your 80s\u201d.",

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/21/boris-johnson-in-final-push-to-ram-through-brexit-deal\">seeking to win two crucial Brexit votes</a>, on the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) and on his plan to ram it through the Commons in three days (the programme motion) \u2013 which might have allowed him to lead the UK out of the EU as promised on 31 October.</p> <p>In the event he won the former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/hammond-at-helm-as-former-tories-torpedo-pms-breakneck-brexit\">and lost the latter</a>, the former chancellor Philip Hammond leading nine Tory independents in torpedoing Johnson\u2019s plans in a sign that they were unconvinced by his promise to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/soft-brexit-tories-might-back-deal-if-wto-loophole-closed\">give parliament a vote on stopping a potential </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/soft-brexit-tories-might-back-deal-if-wto-loophole-closed\">crash-out</a> in 2020.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/22/donald-tusk-indicates-eu-would-grant-brexit-extension\">EU initially signalling it was likely to agree</a> to Johnson\u2019s enforced request under the Benn act for an extension until 31 January, the PM put the Brexit legislation on pause \u2013 but was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/johnson-and-corbyn-fail-to-agree-timetable-for-paused-brexit-bill\">unable to agree with Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn on a new timetable</a>, prompting No 10 to start pushing the possibility of early elections.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/johnsons-cabinet-split-over-gambling-on-pre-christmas-election\">cabinet doubts over an early poll</a>, Johnson\u2019s decision to abandon his pledge to leave the EU by 31 October and instead <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/boris-johnson-to-ask-mps-to-back-pre-christmas-election\">plead with MPs to give him a 12 December election</a>, and Corbyn\u2019s apparent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/labour-poised-to-block-offer-of-12-december-general-election\">readiness to block that request</a>, however, the EU27 started to get cold feet, saying they preferred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/eu-could-rethink-brexit-extension-after-latest-johnson-manoeuvre\">delay granting a new extension until there was more clarity from London</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/michel-barnier-eu-brexit-extension-boris-johnson-election\">France in particular argued strongly</a> that now was not the right time to agree a three-month delay and that the EU should decide on what length of extension it would offer only after MPs had voted on granting Johnson his early election wish on Monday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/rebel-mps-look-to-thwart-boris-johnsons-brexit-agenda\">As rebel MPs began exploring ways</a> to seize control of the agenda by allowing debate and votes on amended Brexit legislation and a possible second referendum, the Northern Irish unionists of the DUP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/dup-arlene-foster-johnson-brexit-northern-ireland\">reiterated their fury at Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal </a>and said they would keep opposing it until it was changed.</p> <p>With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/labour-agree-election-boris-johnson-never-pursue-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-corbyn\">Labour opposition meaning Johnson would be unlikely</a> to get the two-thirds majority for an election needed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/boris-johnson-no-brexit-until-january-block-christmas-general-election\">Lib Dems and the SNP offered him a route to a pre-Christmas poll</a> by proposing to amend the FTPA to say the next election would be on 9 December \u2013 a plan that would require only a simple majority to pass.</p> <p>No 10 indicated that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/no-10-says-it-could-back-lib-dem-plan-for-9-december-election\">it could well back this plan</a>, after France \u2013 with a UK general election now looking increasingly likely \u2013 withdrew its opposition to a long delay and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/eu-agrees-brexit-extension-to-31-january-flextension\">EU27 formally granted a three-month extension</a>, which <a

reluctantly accepted</a>.</p> <p>On Monday night, as expected, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/oct/28/boris-johnsons-election-vote-looms-as-eu-decides-on-brexit-delay-politics-live?page=with:block-5db73a558f08c428d89323c5#block-5db73a558f08c428d89323c5\">failed to get anywhere near the numbers needed</a> for a 12 December general election. The PM immediately said he would legislate for an early election with a bill not subject to a super-majority.</p> <h2>What next</h2> <p>Not for the first time: it all depends. With Johnson having lost his third attempt at an election under the terms of the FTPA, the government will table a one-line bill for a pre-Christmas poll that would have the support of the Lib Dems and the SNP.</p> <p>This would be more likely to pass because, as a traditional bill, it requires only a simple majority. However, it would be amendable, and while the Lib Dems and the SNP may be unlikely to table amendments, Labour might.</p> <p>The Conservatives believe Johnson can win an election, and seem happy for him to campaign on the grounds that he has secured a Brexit deal and just needs a clear majority to get it ratified. The Lib Dems, as the revoke Brexit party, want an early election because they know their chances of a good result will diminish drastically once Brexit has happened.</p> <p>But Labour? Trailing in the polls, the party is still divided, with some arguing it is more than ready for an election and pointing out that it did far better than polls predicted in 2017 \u2013 and others seriously doubting Labour has any hope of success as long as Corbyn remains leader.</p> <p>With the other two main opposition parties looking ready to back an early poll, however, it may be impossible for Labour not to this time round, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/jeremy-corbyn-keeps-door-open-to-backing-december-election\">Corbyn appeared to suggest on Monday</a> that the party could back a 9 December poll if the date was set in law.</p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/peoples-vote-senior-figures-forced-out\">People\u2019s Vote staff walk out</a> over sacking of senior figures</p></li> <li><p>Government\u2019s empty-chair policy in EU branded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/government-accused-of-another-silly-gesture\">\u2018another silly gesture\u2019</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/27/kill-gina-miller-crowdfunding-page-investigated-by-police\">Police investigating</a> \u201cKill Gina Miller\u201d crowdfunding page</p></li> <li><p>Tories deny plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/tories-deny-compromise-workers-rights-after-brexit\">compromise workers\u2019 rights</a> after Brexit</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/27/jd-wetherspoon-may-have-breached-law-over-19m-brexit-beer-mats\">JD Wetherspoon may have breached law</a> over 1.9m Brexit beer mats</p></li> <li><p>Migrant deaths: Britain faces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/britain-faces-axe-europe-elite-policing-unit\">exclusion from elite EU policing unit</a></p></li> <li><p>Number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/number-britons-going-to-europe-at-10-year-high\">Britons leaving for Europe</a> hits a 10-year high</p></li> <li><p>UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/25/move-to-scrap-uk-budget-fuels-calls-to-publish-economic-forecasts\">under pressure to publish forecasts</a> after budget scrapped</p></li> <li><p>Specialist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/26/specialist-christmas-meats-at-risk-from-lack-of-seasonal-workers\">Christmas meats at risk</a> from lack of seasonal workers</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/25/production-of-brexit-50p-coin-paused-amid-departure-uncertainty\">Production of Brexit 50p coin paused</a> amid exit uncertainty</p></li> <li><p>Brexit uncertainty drives up job losses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/25/brexit-uncertainty-drives-up-job-losses-and-holds-back-economy\">holds back economy</a></p></li> <li><p>\u201cDisgraceful\u201d: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/northern-ireland-unionist-mps-attack-brexit-betrayal\">Unionists slam minister</a> over Irish Sea checks</p></li> </ul> <h2>Top comment</h2> <p>In the Observer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/27/brexit-politics-britain-england-union\">Neil </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/27/brexit-politics-britain-england-union\">Ascherson argues</a> that long Brexit ordeal will end up finishing off the break-up of Great Britain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The deepest change since 2016 is the weakening of the UK\u2019s inner bonds. Theresa May went around preaching about \u201cour precious, precious union\u201d. This puzzled me, given massive English indifference. Then I understood: it wasn\u2019t Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland that was \u201cprecious\u201d to her, but \u201cthe union\u201d in the abstract \u2013 a sort of legitimising halo hovering over Westminster\u2019s anointed \u2026 Yet in the union of four nations, one \u2013 England \u2013 has 85% of the population. What the past three years have shown is that the big partner is no longer concerned to put its own interests behind those of the others. A poll this year showed that Tory voters would be ready to \u201close Scotland\u201d (revealing words) if that ensured Brexit. In turn, devolution only made sense when all four nations were inside the EU. If England in 2019 can no longer remember why the union with Scotland and Northern Ireland once made sense, Brexit has delivered the UK to the hospice of history.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Top tweet</h2> <p>Brexit\u2019s current absurdities neatly put by the Atlantic\u2019s Tom McTague:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TomMcTague/status/1188775314467500033\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In summary, then: We have a govt which has broken its central promise; an opposition which does not want an election to make them pay for it; two anti Brexit parties offering to break the deadlock in a way that could enable Brexit; &amp; an EU which cannot do anything about any of it</p>&mdash; Tom McTague (@TomMcTague) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomMcTague/status/1188775314467500033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s weekly Brexit briefing. If you\u2019d like to receive this as a weekly email, sign up here. You can also catch our latest Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here, and for daily updates, head to Andrew Sparrow\u2019s politics live blog. Top stories Another roller-coaster week began with Boris Johnson seeking to win two crucial Brexit votes, on the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) and on his plan to ram it through the Commons in three days (the programme motion) \u2013 which might have allowed him to lead the UK out of the EU as promised on 31 October. In the event he won the former and lost the latter, the former chancellor Philip Hammond leading nine Tory independents in torpedoing Johnson\u2019s plans in a sign that they were unconvinced by his promise to give parliament a vote on stopping a potential crash-out in 2020. With the EU initially signalling it was likely to agree to Johnson\u2019s enforced request under the Benn act for an extension until 31 January, the PM put the Brexit legislation on pause \u2013 but was unable to agree with Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn on a new timetable, prompting No 10 to start pushing the possibility of early elections. Perhaps unsurprisingly given cabinet doubts over an early poll, Johnson\u2019s decision to abandon his pledge to leave the EU by 31 October and instead plead with MPs to give him a 12 December election, and Corbyn\u2019s apparent readiness to block that request, however, the EU27 started to get cold feet, saying they preferred to delay granting a new extension until there was more clarity from London. France in particular argued strongly that now was not the right time to agree a three-month delay and that the EU should decide on what length of extension it would offer only after MPs had voted on granting Johnson his early election wish on Monday. As rebel MPs began exploring ways to seize control of the agenda by allowing debate and votes on amended Brexit legislation and a possible second referendum, the Northern Irish unionists of the DUP reiterated their fury at Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal and said they would keep opposing it until it was changed. With Labour opposition meaning Johnson would be unlikely to get the two-thirds majority for an election needed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the Lib Dems and the SNP offered him a route to a pre-Christmas poll by proposing to amend the FTPA to say the next election would be on 9 December \u2013 a plan that would require only a simple majority to pass. No 10 indicated that it could well back this plan, after France \u2013 with a UK general election now looking increasingly likely \u2013 withdrew its opposition to a long delay and the EU27 formally granted a three-month extension, which Johnson reluctantly accepted. On Monday night, as expected, the government failed to get anywhere near the numbers needed for a 12 December general election. The PM immediately said he would legislate for an early election with a bill not subject to a super-majority. What next Not for the first time: it all depends. With Johnson having lost his third attempt at an election under the terms of the FTPA, the government will table a one-line bill for a pre-Christmas poll that would have the support of the Lib Dems and the SNP. This would be more likely to pass because, as a traditional bill, it requires only a simple majority. However, it would be amendable, and while the Lib Dems and the SNP may be unlikely to table amendments, Labour might. The Conservatives believe Johnson can win an election, and seem happy for him to campaign on the grounds that he has secured a Brexit deal and just needs a clear majority to get it ratified. The Lib Dems, as the revoke Brexit party, want an early election because they know their chances of a good result will diminish drastically once Brexit has happened. But Labour? Trailing in the polls, the party is still divided, with some arguing it is more than ready for an election and pointing out that it did far better than polls predicted in 2017 \u2013 and others seriously doubting Labour has any hope of success as long as Corbyn remains leader. With the other two main opposition parties looking ready to back an early poll, however, it may be impossible for Labour not to this time round, and Corbyn appeared to suggest on Monday that the party could back a 9 December poll if the date was set in law.

Theresa May went around preaching about \u201cour precious, precious union\u201d. This puzzled me, given massive English indifference. Then I understood: it wasn\u2019t Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland that was \u201cprecious\u201d to her, but \u201cthe union\u201d in the abstract \u2013 a sort of legitimising halo hovering over Westminster\u2019s anointed \u2026 Yet in the union of four nations, one \u2013 England \u2013 has 85% of the population. What the past three years have shown is that the big partner is no longer concerned to put its own interests behind those of the others. A poll this year showed that Tory voters would be ready to \u201close Scotland\u201d (revealing words) if that ensured Brexit. In turn, devolution only made sense when all four nations were inside the EU. If England in 2019 can no longer remember why the union with Scotland and Northern Ireland once made sense, Brexit has delivered the UK to the hospice of history.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018We will not bring back withdrawal bill\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello \u2013 Warren Murray helping you embark upon another Tuesday.</p> \n<p>After another failure yesterday, Boris Johnson will abandon attempts to push his Brexit bill through this parliament \u2013 aiming instead to get the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/boris-johnson-abandons-brexit-bill-in-new-push-for-december-election\">agree to an election before Christmas</a>. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told MPs that all stages of legislation to trigger an early general election would go through the Commons on Tuesday, adding: \u201cI can assure this House that we will not bring back the withdrawal agreement bill.\u201d Operation Yellowhammer, the plan to keep Britain running in the event of a no-deal Brexit, has been shelved.</p> \n<p>The parties are still in dispute over the potential date \u2013 the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, is not happy with Johnson\u2019s preference, 12 December, which is after many universities have broken up for Christmas and students have returned to their home towns.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile<strong> </strong>Johnson\u2019s government is predicted to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/29/uk-treasury-on-course-to-exceed-this-years-deficit-target-by-16bn\">overshoot its deficit target by \u00a316bn this year</a> after \u00a343bn was ripped from the Treasury by a series of spending pledges, an economic slowdown and the spiralling cost of student loans. The independent Resolution Foundation warns that the \u00a327bn allocated by then-chancellor Philip Hammond to cope with the costs of Brexit has evaporated and the Treasury looks set to break its rule capping the annual spending shortfall at 2% of GDP.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Shark bites off Briton\u2019s foot \u2013</strong> A British tourist lost his foot as he and another Briton were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/29/airlie-beach-shark-attack-two-men-injured-off-queensland-coast\">mauled by a shark</a> in the Whitsunday region of north Queensland. The two men, both in their 30s, were airlifted to hospital in the city of Mackay with serious lower leg injuries after being attacked on a day excursion to Hook Passage, about 30km from the resort of Airlie Beach. The attack took place about 10.20am Tuesday, local time.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Major failings allowed Grenfell disaster \u2013 </strong>The London fire brigade\u2019s readiness for the Grenfell Tower fire was gravely inadequate and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/28/grenfell-inquiry-finds-fire-brigade-gravely-ill-prepared-for-blaze\">fewer people would have died if it had been better prepared</a>, the report into the disaster that killed 72 people has concluded. Contrary to evidence of the cladding manufacturer Arconic, the main reason the flames spread so rapidly up the building was its aluminium-polyethylene composite panels, wrote Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the retired judge heading the inquiry. Despite knowing about the dangers of cladding panels, the LFB had not prepared adequately. More lives could have been saved if firefighters had realised earlier the fire was out of control and ordered a full evacuation. Moore-Bick praised the \u201cextraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty\u201d of rank-and-file firefighters, both on the ground and in the control room. The second phase of the inquiry, which begins next year, will examine the refurbishment project that preceded the fire.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump-Ukraine vote planned \u2013 </strong>The US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will call a vote to formalise the impeachment inquiry under way against Donald Trump. Republicans have argued the inquiry is invalid because the House didn\u2019t vote on it. \u201cThis argument has no merit,\u201d Pelosi said \u2013 no vote is required by the US constitution. But given White House obstruction of the inquiry, she would hold a vote to make clear the Trump administration must co-operate: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/28/pelosi-house-vote-formalize-impeachment-inquiry\">\u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d</a> Today the top Ukraine expert on the US national security council is expected to tell the inquiry that he \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen\u201d. According to a leaked statement, Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel and Purple Heart recipient, will say: \u201cI realised that if Ukraine pursued an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/28/white-house-ukraine-testimony-impeachment-vindman\">investigation into the Bidens and Burisma</a> it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Cannabis no panacea \u2013 </strong>The use of cannabis medicines in the treatment of mental health issues carries more risks than benefits, a review of 40 years\u2019 worth of trials has found. Professor Louisa Degenhardt, lead author of the study, said of all research carried out there was only \u201clow-quality evidence\u201d of THC being helpful with conditions such as anxiety and depression, as opposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/28/risks-of-cannabis-use-for-mental-health-treatment-outweigh-benefits\">\u201ca large body of research\u201d of its potential harms</a>. \u201cThis research suggests that cannabis use can increase the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptom,\u201d says the paper. A well-constructed study found that smoked cannabis increased the risk of acute psychotic symptoms. Young adults, the age group more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression and psychosis, were more likely to become dependent if using cannabis daily over a long period of time.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Small details caught Baghdadi \u2013 </strong>The Kurdish army in Syria says one of its spies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/28/syrian-kurds-baghdadi-underpants-dna-test\">stole the underpants of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> to get the DNA that was used to identify him. \u201cOur own source, who had been able to reach al-Baghdadi, brought al-Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure 100% that the person in question was al-Baghdadi himself,\u201d said Polat Can, a senior official in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Baghdadi blew himself up to avoid capture when US special forces swooped. Can said a decision to eliminate Baghdadi was made \u201cmore than a month ago\u201d but this was delayed when Donald Trump allowed Turkey to invade Kurdish-held territory in Syria. And the special forces dog that chased down Baghdadi has been celebrated as a hero. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/29/zero-bark-thirty-dog-that-took-part-in-al-baghdadi-raid-sets-tongues-wagging\">A photo has been released</a> \u2013&nbsp;but the canine\u2019s name remains classified. </p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Weinstein was just the beginning</h2> \n<p>When Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2019/oct/29/the-women-who-broke-the-harvey-weinstein-story-podcast\">global reckoning on sexual harassment</a> resulting in #MeToo.

After another failure yesterday, Boris Johnson will abandon attempts to push his Brexit bill through this parliament \u2013 aiming instead to get the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to agree to an election before Christmas. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told MPs that all stages of legislation to trigger an early general election would go through the Commons on Tuesday, adding: \u201cI can assure this House that we will not bring back the withdrawal agreement bill.\u201d Operation Yellowhammer, the plan to keep Britain running in the event of a no-deal Brexit, has been shelved.

Meanwhile Johnson\u2019s government is predicted to overshoot its deficit target by \u00a316bn this year after \u00a343bn was ripped from the Treasury by a series of spending pledges, an economic slowdown and the spiralling cost of student loans. The independent Resolution Foundation warns that the \u00a327bn allocated by then-chancellor Philip Hammond to cope with the costs of Brexit has evaporated and the Treasury looks set to break its rule capping the annual spending shortfall at 2% of GDP. * * * Shark bites off Briton\u2019s foot \u2013 A British tourist lost his foot as he and another Briton were mauled by a shark in the Whitsunday region of north Queensland. The two men, both in their 30s, were airlifted to hospital in the city of Mackay with serious lower leg injuries after being attacked on a day excursion to Hook Passage, about 30km from the resort of Airlie Beach. The attack took place about 10.20am Tuesday, local time. * * * Major failings allowed Grenfell disaster \u2013 The London fire brigade\u2019s readiness for the Grenfell Tower fire was gravely inadequate and fewer people would have died if it had been better prepared, the report into the disaster that killed 72 people has concluded. Contrary to evidence of the cladding manufacturer Arconic, the main reason the flames spread so rapidly up the building was its aluminium-polyethylene composite panels, wrote Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the retired judge heading the inquiry. Despite knowing about the dangers of cladding panels, the LFB had not prepared adequately. More lives could have been saved if firefighters had realised earlier the fire was out of control and ordered a full evacuation. Moore-Bick praised the \u201cextraordinary courage and selfless devotion to duty\u201d of rank-and-file firefighters, both on the ground and in the control room. The second phase of the inquiry, which begins next year, will examine the refurbishment project that preceded the fire. * * * Trump-Ukraine vote planned \u2013 The US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will call a vote to formalise the impeachment inquiry under way against Donald Trump. Republicans have argued the inquiry is invalid because the House didn\u2019t vote on it. \u201cThis argument has no merit,\u201d Pelosi said \u2013 no vote is required by the US constitution. But given White House obstruction of the inquiry, she would hold a vote to make clear the Trump administration must co-operate: \u201cNobody is above the law.\u201d Today the top Ukraine expert on the US national security council is expected to tell the inquiry that he \u201cdid not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen\u201d. According to a leaked statement, Alexander Vindman, a lieutenant colonel and Purple Heart recipient, will say: \u201cI realised that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d * * * Cannabis no panacea \u2013 The use of cannabis medicines in the treatment of mental health issues carries more risks than benefits, a review of 40 years\u2019 worth of trials has found. Professor Louisa Degenhardt, lead author of the study, said of all research carried out there was only \u201clow-quality evidence\u201d of THC being helpful with conditions such as anxiety and depression, as opposed to \u201ca large body of research\u201d of its potential harms. \u201cThis research suggests that cannabis use can increase the occurrence of depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptom,\u201d says the paper. A well-constructed study found that smoked cannabis increased the risk of acute psychotic symptoms. Young adults, the age group more likely to suffer from anxiety, depression and psychosis, were more likely to become dependent if using cannabis daily over a long period of time. * * * Small details caught Baghdadi \u2013 The Kurdish army in Syria says one of its spies stole the underpants of the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to get the DNA that was used to identify him. \u201cOur own source, who had been able to reach al-Baghdadi, brought al-Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure 100% that the person in question was al-Baghdadi himself,\u201d said Polat Can, a senior official in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Baghdadi blew himself up to avoid capture when US special forces swooped. Can said a decision to eliminate Baghdadi was made \u201cmore than a month ago\u201d but this was delayed when Donald Trump allowed Turkey to invade Kurdish-held territory in Syria. And the special forces dog that chased down Baghdadi has been celebrated as a hero. A photo has been released \u2013 but the canine\u2019s name remains classified.

And: Rafael Behr on the likelihood of a winter election. Lunchtime read: Forgotten corners of the Berlin Wall Every five years there is an anniversary to mark the fall of the Berlin Wall, and this year is a particular milestone, as on next week\u2019s 30th anniversary (9 November) the wall will have been down longer than the 28 years it stood. From 4-11 November the city will host more than 200 events to \u201ccelebrate and remember\u201d, including films and documentaries, photo exhibitions and concerts (including an appearance from Patti Smith), art installations and talks \u2013 taking place at Wall-related spots, such as the Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz, and the East Side Gallery. Paul Sullivan writes that the anniversary marks a great chance to see some fascinating and less well known reminders of a divided city. Sport England\u2019s head coach, Eddie Jones, will not over-exert his players this week and admits aggressive South Africa will be \u201ca difficult side to beat\u201d in Saturday\u2019s Rugby World Cup final. Wayne Pivac will take over from Warren Gatland as Wales head coach after the tournament in Japan but, like his predecessor, he will find that he has to spot then develop his own Test players. Supporters\u2019 groups are to meet the Premier League today to demand action on VAR after another weekend of chaos beset video refereeing technology. The Liverpool midfielder James Milner is no fan of the technology and says it is ruining the atmosphere at matches. Aidan O\u2019Brien must travel to this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup without the animal he recently described as \u201cthe ultimate racehorse\u201d, Magical having been found to have a temperature shortly before she was due to fly. Simona Halep, the Wimbledon champion, valiantly saved a match point and recovered from a set down to defeat Bianca Andreescu, the US Open champion, in a dramatic battle at the WTA Finals. And Granit Xhaka\u2019s shocking fallout with Arsenal fans is born of frustration at the slow decline at the club caused by mismanagement on and off the pitch, writes Nick Ames. Business Shares have been mixed in Asia with Chinese benchmarks falling after the S&amp;P 500 index closed at an all-time high, ahead of a busy week of corporate earnings and economic reports, and expectation of another another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index has gained along with Taiwan, Bangkok and Singapore. There have been falls in Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea and Jakarta. The pound is worth $1.285 and \u20ac1.158 at time of writing. The FTSE is down a few points. The papers Almost every paper focuses on Boris Johnson\u2019s plan today to secure a pre-Christmas election \u2013 on 12 December to be exact. The Mail asks: \u201cCan Boris win his Christmas gamble?\u201d and reports that the prime minister is on the brink of sealing an election deal. The Guardian says Johnson has abandoned his Brexit bill in the hope that the move will curry enough favour with the Lib Dems and SNP to win a fresh push for an election. Other stories include heightened fears of Isis revenge attacks and the BBC equal pay row. The Times carries the same line on Brexit in a single-column story, with a bravely deep picture of Johnson\u2019s furrowed brow eyeing No 10 but it splashes on findings suggesting aspirin can tackle depression symptoms. The Sun returns to the Jeremy Corbyn chicken theme with a \u201c12 Fright\u201d headline, accusing the Labour leader of running scared from an election. The Express says: \u201cPM: Bring it on for Dec 12!\u201d and reports that a defiant PM will today make attempt No 4 to go to the polls. Holly Willougby at the Pride of Britain awards gets the picture slot. The i injects more doubt into the issue, focusing on senior Tories\u2019 fears that voters will punish the party if Johnson succeeds in calling an election. The FT adds a note of drama with the headline: \u201cJohnson raises stakes in fresh election gambit\u201d. The Mirror splashes on the Keith Vaz ban over the sex workers scandal, with the headline: \u201cNot fit to be an MP\u201d.

That\u2019s not what we do here.\u201d </p> <p>She is talking about the Citizens\u2019 Curriculum, a local project that has been highly successful in redressing the deficit in adult education, an acknowledged national problem.</p> <p>Rochdale, one of the poorest towns in England, has been rocked in recent years by a horrific series of grooming and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/rochdale-child-sex-abuse-ring\" title=\"\">sexual abuse cases</a>, some still going through the courts. But it is also a place of tremendous resilience and community spirit.</p> <p>The Citizens\u2019 Curriculum has helped local people to get jobs and overcome serious challenges, such as bereavement and homelessness. It also does specialist work, including with those affected by sexual abuse. One young woman disclosed a long and horrendous history of abuse in her first life-writing session, which enabled her to get support to report it.</p> <p>This year alone, no fewer than five commissions have sat to consider the issues of lifelong learning and the related skills deficit. According to a survey by the <a href=\"https://www.learningandwork.org.uk/our-work/promoting-learning-and-skills/participation-survey/rates-of-adult-participation-in-learning/\" title=\"\">Learning and Work Institute</a>, the number of adults learning in 2017 was the lowest in two decades. Labour, whose <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lifelong-Learning-Commission-Interim-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">Lifelong Learning Commission</a> is due to report this autumn, has made adult education a key part of its proposed National Education Service.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018We\u2019re all still living with what happened. I worked bloody hard not to be a vulnerable woman; don\u2019t treat me like one\u2019</p> <footer> <cite>Ann, abuse survivor who now gives talks to police</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem can be traced, in part, to the mid-2000s, when a shift in government emphasis from education to skills, coupled with a squeeze on local authority funding, changed the quality and quantity of courses on offer. Employers were expected to take on more of the burden, which benefited those in work, while adults were asked to contribute to the costs of their own non-work-related learning, which excluded poorer citizens.</p> <p>Helen Chicot, who has worked in Rochdale for 26 years, explains how these national trends affected the town. \u201cThe culture changed. Education became all about skills and employment, a target-driven, qualification-led service that wasn\u2019t serving people\u2019s needs. People were saying they were sick of being put on courses, as they didn\u2019t really address the context that they were in.\u201d</p> <p>Rochdale decided to do things differently. There remained, Chicot says, \u201chundreds of motivated and skilled adults in the system, helping each other and supporting others in their neighbourhoods\u201d. Their willingness, and informal work, gave shape to the Citizens\u2019 Curriculum.</p> <p>In 2014 Rochdale council launched a pilot scheme in Kirkholt, a large social housing estate where residents regularly called on the emergency, health and social services. The scheme, an attempt to bring services together in one place to make things work from the bottom up, was part of the post-devolution Greater Manchester development plan, allowing councils room to innovate in the harsh climate of austerity.</p> <p>\u201cWe brought a multi-agency team together and gave them the freedom to engage with people without treating them as if they were a problem,\u201d says Chicot. \u201cThe idea was to give them the opportunity both to learn how to do things for themselves, setting their own priorities, and to be amongst those who are learning just like them.\u201d</p> <p>Team workers include police officers, housing officers, health workers, social workers, teachers and former teachers. Chicot is keen to emphasise that \u201cmost of the workforce see themselves as both educators and learners\u201d.</p> <p>Visiting the Friday drop-in centre, it is hard to distinguish between professionals and clients. Thomas, in his 50s, was made homeless after his wife of 30 years became ill with cancer and died. The Rochdale team helped to get him into a night shelter and then into social housing.</p> <p>From there, his confidence grew. He beams as he tells me about leading local residents on walks to nearby beauty spots. He was recently elected to an official position in the tenants\u2019 association and has spoken about his experiences to an area-wide forum. \u201cI was shaking so badly. But I spoke for 15 minutes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/15/century-adult-education-tossed-aside\">A century of adult education has been tossed aside \u2013 is it too late to rescue it? | Laura McInerney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Citizens\u2019 Curriculum works through different groups. One, Heritage Hackers, was set up to share digital skills. One member, Peter, is on the autistic spectrum and has been through the special school system but, says Chicot, \u201che got headhunted by <a href=\"https://madlab.org.uk/\" title=\"\">MadLab</a>, the funkiest organisation in Manchester.

      "bodyText": "Luci, a place team worker, is sitting with a group of women round the big kitchen table at a Friday afternoon drop-in centre in the Lower Falinge estate in Rochdale. \u201cWhat is adult education exactly?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou picture people in classrooms, in rows. That\u2019s not what we do here.\u201d She is talking about the Citizens\u2019 Curriculum, a local project that has been highly successful in redressing the deficit in adult education, an acknowledged national problem. Rochdale, one of the poorest towns in England, has been rocked in recent years by a horrific series of grooming and sexual abuse cases, some still going through the courts. But it is also a place of tremendous resilience and community spirit. The Citizens\u2019 Curriculum has helped local people to get jobs and overcome serious challenges, such as bereavement and homelessness. It also does specialist work, including with those affected by sexual abuse. One young woman disclosed a long and horrendous history of abuse in her first life-writing session, which enabled her to get support to report it. This year alone, no fewer than five commissions have sat to consider the issues of lifelong learning and the related skills deficit. According to a survey by the Learning and Work Institute, the number of adults learning in 2017 was the lowest in two decades. Labour, whose Lifelong Learning Commission is due to report this autumn, has made adult education a key part of its proposed National Education Service. The problem can be traced, in part, to the mid-2000s, when a shift in government emphasis from education to skills, coupled with a squeeze on local authority funding, changed the quality and quantity of courses on offer. Employers were expected to take on more of the burden, which benefited those in work, while adults were asked to contribute to the costs of their own non-work-related learning, which excluded poorer citizens. Helen Chicot, who has worked in Rochdale for 26 years, explains how these national trends affected the town. \u201cThe culture changed. Education became all about skills and employment, a target-driven, qualification-led service that wasn\u2019t serving people\u2019s needs. People were saying they were sick of being put on courses, as they didn\u2019t really address the context that they were in.\u201d Rochdale decided to do things differently. There remained, Chicot says, \u201chundreds of motivated and skilled adults in the system, helping each other and supporting others in their neighbourhoods\u201d. Their willingness, and informal work, gave shape to the Citizens\u2019 Curriculum. In 2014 Rochdale council launched a pilot scheme in Kirkholt, a large social housing estate where residents regularly called on the emergency, health and social services. The scheme, an attempt to bring services together in one place to make things work from the bottom up, was part of the post-devolution Greater Manchester development plan, allowing councils room to innovate in the harsh climate of austerity. \u201cWe brought a multi-agency team together and gave them the freedom to engage with people without treating them as if they were a problem,\u201d says Chicot. \u201cThe idea was to give them the opportunity both to learn how to do things for themselves, setting their own priorities, and to be amongst those who are learning just like them.\u201d Team workers include police officers, housing officers, health workers, social workers, teachers and former teachers. Chicot is keen to emphasise that \u201cmost of the workforce see themselves as both educators and learners\u201d. Visiting the Friday drop-in centre, it is hard to distinguish between professionals and clients. Thomas, in his 50s, was made homeless after his wife of 30 years became ill with cancer and died. The Rochdale team helped to get him into a night shelter and then into social housing. From there, his confidence grew. He beams as he tells me about leading local residents on walks to nearby beauty spots. He was recently elected to an official position in the tenants\u2019 association and has spoken about his experiences to an area-wide forum. \u201cI was shaking so badly. But I spoke for 15 minutes.\u201d The Citizens\u2019 Curriculum works through different groups. One, Heritage Hackers, was set up to share digital skills. One member, Peter, is on the autistic spectrum and has been through the special school system but, says Chicot, \u201che got headhunted by MadLab, the funkiest organisation in Manchester. From there, he got to teach posh kids from Didsbury how to code.\u201d Getting people into work is not the only way the project measures its success. For every \u00a31 spent, \u00a34.50 is saved in terms of reduced police callouts, preventing children going into care, and reduced calls on the ambulance and doctors\u2019 services. About 1,000 people take part in the Citizens\u2019 Curriculum in Rochdale, and it has transformed the lives of some, such as Tina, a heroin addict and sex worker who has had a child put up for adoption and has another living with relatives. The team help her keep safe, (\u201cwe throw condoms at her\u201d), to manage her medication, to live independently and to keep in regular touch with her daughter. Luci says, \u201cWho are we to judge? She could be my sister, my daughter. And if she were, what would I want for her? That\u2019s how we work.\u201d The key to the project is that the starting point is the complex social and psychological situation in which people find themselves, rather than pre-set courses and targets. It may not be conventional adult education, but by choosing the path of human solidarity and kindness it can yield remarkably similar results. Sarah, a quiet, self-possessed woman, grew up in care but was encouraged by the place team to study to become a social worker. Now just 21, she is about to do her first shift as an adult care worker. Life looks equally promising for Ann, aged 26, who had spells in care as a child and was groomed as a teenager, later giving evidence against her abuser. At 18, she found herself at home but unable to function. \u201cMy mum felt so guilty about what had happened to me, she was running after me but that wasn\u2019t helping.\u201d Luci showed Ann how to \u201cdo things like pay bills, cook a meal, how to look after myself basically\u201d. Ann has now learned to drive, travelled abroad alone and gives talks to police offers around the country on how to deal with victims of sexual exploitation. \u201cI tell them not to use the term \u2018historical\u2019 sexual abuse because we\u2019re all still living with what happened. Plus I worked bloody hard not to be a vulnerable woman, so don\u2019t treat me like one.\u201d Ann plans to go to university one day.

      "body": "<p>Hindsight is the only exact science, as these two books confirm. Chris Wylie and Brittany Kaiser are two youngish, idealistic, clever people who got involved in some very dark stuff orchestrated by unscrupulous operators. Eventually, both realised they had become accomplices to activities that were at best unethical and at worst illegal, realisations that prompted them to break loose and blow the whistle. And both their memoirs, though very different in style and tone, are attempts to atone for the societal damage their respective collaborations with the devil have done.</p> <p>But there the similarities end. Wylie is an unorthodox, gay Canadian who is passionately interested in fashion; Kaiser is a straight, liberal American interested in human rights and other humanitarian causes. And yet both were ensnared in the same net: a sinister dirty-tricks, election-manipulating \u201cconsultancy\u201d outfit called SCL run by a sociopathic old Etonian, Alexander Nix, which eventually spawned another company called Cambridge Analytica (CA), which was the vehicle that did most of the democratic damage.</p> <p>CA succeeded by finding a way of leveraging people\u2019s personal data \u2013 as revealed by its activities on Facebook in conjunction with data purchased from credit agencies, data brokers and other sources \u2013 to offer psychological profiles in ways that would reveal the kinds of political messages to which they might be receptive. \u201cFacebook,\u201d as Wylie puts it early in his account, \u201cis no longer just a company. It\u2019s a doorway into the minds of the American people and Mark Zuckerberg left that door open for Cambridge Analytica, the Russians and who knows how many others.\u201d</p> <p>The idea that Facebook \u201clikes\u201d could provide a window into people\u2019s souls did not originate with CA, but in research conducted at Cambridge University (much to t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/24/cambridge-analytica-academics-work-upset-university-colleagues\" title=\"\">hat institution\u2019s subsequent chagrin</a>). As a talented geek who is fascinated by human behaviour, however, Wylie immediately understood the significance of the research and had the programming skills to build scalable tools for deducing from the data psychological traits of voters that could then be exploited for political purposes.</p> <p>As a result, his book is \u2013 inadvertently \u2013 an invaluable primer on psychological warfare and behaviour modification. It\u2019s clear that Wylie played a key role in developing the technology that enabled political operators to effectively target messages to individual voters. And although nobody knows what \u2013 ultimately \u2013 makes an individual cast a vote one way or another, what now seems incontrovertible is that social media can <em>suppress</em> voter turnout by finding people who are doubtful or reluctant about voting and persuading them to stay home.</p> <p>Ever since Brexit and the election of Trump there has been consistent scepticism about whether social media played a significant role in the political upheavals of 2016. That scepticism began to be dented when Carole Cadwalladr and the <em>Observer</em> revealed what Cambridge Analytica had been up to with Facebook data. But paradoxically, it was also boosted by Channel 4\u2019s undercover filming that accompanied Cadwalladr\u2019s scoop. The film showed the SCL boss, Nix, in his pomp, where he came over as a nattily suited trust-funder constantly exaggerating the capacity of his firm to achieve its clients\u2019 objectives. How could such an obvious chancer bring about political earthquakes?</p> <p>The answer is that he couldn\u2019t, but the tech-heads who worked for the firm could \u2013 and did. Given that Wylie was at the heart of this work, and that he displayed real sociological understanding of what the data was revealing, his account provides a useful, crystal-clear exposition of the power of psychographic profiling when it\u2019s done right. And it suggests that electoral campaigning has now moved on to a different level.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"65ecf7ac2604fea189a955f229105c57ccbf843f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65ecf7ac2604fea189a955f229105c57ccbf843f/0_0_6198_4132/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brittany Kaiser.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brittany Kaiser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hardy Wilson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oddly enough, Wylie first intuited this when, before joining SCL, he did a study for \u2013 of all people \u2013 the Lib Dems. Having spent a few weeks studying how the party went about electioneering, in late 2011, he explained to Nick Clegg and his team that \u201cthe data showed that Lib Dem voters were ideological, they were stubborn and they hated compromise. But the party has become the antithesis of these attributes when it joined a coalition government with the Tories. The party was composed of uncompromising supporters and yet it was operating in a government birthed out of compromising its principles. This type of compromise was a betrayal of Lib Dem voters\u2019 ideals and it was bound to drive people out of the party.\u201d He was never invited back.</p> <p>Brittany Kaiser was a different kind of naif \u2013 a well-educated, middle-class, well-meaning admirer of Obama who was interested in politics, and who desperately needed a job because her parents back in the US had lost their savings and were, basically, almost dependent on her. So, by a series of accidents she was introduced to Nix, who, to her surprise, hired her and taught her how to make PowerPoint presentations to pitch for clients.</p> <p>She turned out to be good at it and her book is a whirlwind account of three frenetic years during which SCL (and CA) appeared to thrive. She found herself seduced by the glamour (tea with Rebekah Mercer, meetings with prime ministers and billionaires, spats with Kellyanne Conway), enjoying being able to funnel money to her parents, alternately bullied and indulged by Nix, perpetually exhausted, hooked on the adrenaline but also needing the money.</p> <p>In the end, though, it got to her. At 2:30am on the night of Trump\u2019s inauguration ball, dead drunk, dancing with Mercer she suddenly has an epiphany. \u201cBob and Bekah Mercer,\u201d she thought, \u201cnow represented a new kind of force in American politics: wealthy donors with the money and the wherewithal to use their dollars in measurable, provable ways to make sure their expenditures produces some kind of return on investment.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201creturn\u201d was Brexit and Trump. And she was part of it. So her book is some kind of penance for that.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Mindf*ck: Inside Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Plot to Break the World</em> by Christopher Wylie is published by Profile (\u00a320).

It\u2019s a doorway into the minds of the American people and Mark Zuckerberg left that door open for Cambridge Analytica, the Russians and who knows how many others.\u201d The idea that Facebook \u201clikes\u201d could provide a window into people\u2019s souls did not originate with CA, but in research conducted at Cambridge University (much to that institution\u2019s subsequent chagrin). As a talented geek who is fascinated by human behaviour, however, Wylie immediately understood the significance of the research and had the programming skills to build scalable tools for deducing from the data psychological traits of voters that could then be exploited for political purposes. As a result, his book is \u2013 inadvertently \u2013 an invaluable primer on psychological warfare and behaviour modification. It\u2019s clear that Wylie played a key role in developing the technology that enabled political operators to effectively target messages to individual voters. And although nobody knows what \u2013 ultimately \u2013 makes an individual cast a vote one way or another, what now seems incontrovertible is that social media can suppress voter turnout by finding people who are doubtful or reluctant about voting and persuading them to stay home. Ever since Brexit and the election of Trump there has been consistent scepticism about whether social media played a significant role in the political upheavals of 2016. That scepticism began to be dented when Carole Cadwalladr and the Observer revealed what Cambridge Analytica had been up to with Facebook data. But paradoxically, it was also boosted by Channel 4\u2019s undercover filming that accompanied Cadwalladr\u2019s scoop. The film showed the SCL boss, Nix, in his pomp, where he came over as a nattily suited trust-funder constantly exaggerating the capacity of his firm to achieve its clients\u2019 objectives. How could such an obvious chancer bring about political earthquakes? The answer is that he couldn\u2019t, but the tech-heads who worked for the firm could \u2013 and did. Given that Wylie was at the heart of this work, and that he displayed real sociological understanding of what the data was revealing, his account provides a useful, crystal-clear exposition of the power of psychographic profiling when it\u2019s done right. And it suggests that electoral campaigning has now moved on to a different level. Oddly enough, Wylie first intuited this when, before joining SCL, he did a study for \u2013 of all people \u2013 the Lib Dems. Having spent a few weeks studying how the party went about electioneering, in late 2011, he explained to Nick Clegg and his team that \u201cthe data showed that Lib Dem voters were ideological, they were stubborn and they hated compromise. But the party has become the antithesis of these attributes when it joined a coalition government with the Tories. The party was composed of uncompromising supporters and yet it was operating in a government birthed out of compromising its principles. This type of compromise was a betrayal of Lib Dem voters\u2019 ideals and it was bound to drive people out of the party.\u201d He was never invited back. Brittany Kaiser was a different kind of naif \u2013 a well-educated, middle-class, well-meaning admirer of Obama who was interested in politics, and who desperately needed a job because her parents back in the US had lost their savings and were, basically, almost dependent on her. So, by a series of accidents she was introduced to Nix, who, to her surprise, hired her and taught her how to make PowerPoint presentations to pitch for clients. She turned out to be good at it and her book is a whirlwind account of three frenetic years during which SCL (and CA) appeared to thrive. She found herself seduced by the glamour (tea with Rebekah Mercer, meetings with prime ministers and billionaires, spats with Kellyanne Conway), enjoying being able to funnel money to her parents, alternately bullied and indulged by Nix, perpetually exhausted, hooked on the adrenaline but also needing the money. In the end, though, it got to her. At 2:30am on the night of Trump\u2019s inauguration ball, dead drunk, dancing with Mercer she suddenly has an epiphany. \u201cBob and Bekah Mercer,\u201d she thought, \u201cnow represented a new kind of force in American politics: wealthy donors with the money and the wherewithal to use their dollars in measurable, provable ways to make sure their expenditures produces some kind of return on investment.\u201d The \u201creturn\u201d was Brexit and Trump. And she was part of it. So her book is some kind of penance for that. \u2022 Mindf*ck: Inside Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Plot to Break the World by Christopher Wylie is published by Profile (\u00a320).

The NFU says the government has ignored its pleas to put tariffs on eggs to protect against cheaper rivals from countries such as the US where caging hens is allowed. \u201cWe will be importing eggs produced in those very same cages we banned in 2012,\u201d said the NFU president, Minette Batters. Tariffs on farm and other produce will come in at the end of the transition period after Brexit whether a deal with the EU is done or not, and will affect all imports from third countries. But the NFU is baffled by the decision by the government to put tariffs on lamb to protect vulnerable sheep farmers, but not to impose them on eggs or wheat. The NFU wrote to the Treasury immediately after it announced its draft tariff schedule in March pointing out the risks its plan was creating for three agriculture products: eggs, horticulture and grains. In its final tariff schedule published three weeks ago the three categories were rated at zero, meaning US producers, who can raise laying hens more cheaply because of the intensity of battery farming, will be able to undercut British eggs. Batters said the NFU had begged the new environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, to think again about the final tariff schedule, but that all the minister was interested in was \u201cleaving the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal\u201d. \u201cThere is no engagement on the issues,\u201d she said.

She told John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live the government was \u201cnot going to alter domestic standards for the sake of trade deals\u201d. But the NFU argues that the trading environment for egg and wheat farmers will change even if there is no trade deal with the US. \u201cIf you have 0% tariffs on eggs, how are you going to stop eggs, particularly liquid and dried egg, coming into the UK that has been produced in systems that are illegal in the UK?\u201d said Batters. \u201cWe do not want to see deregulation on animal welfare.

Please help me, I need help.\u2019\u201d She had never asked for help before.</p> \n<p>Kenny had battled alcohol and drug dependency since her teens. Eventually, it had led to her sleeping rough on the streets of Belfast. Over the next few days, Hughes tried desperately to get her sister into rehab, but she did not succeed. Five days after her seizure, Kenny died alone in the doorway of a derelict shop just metres from Belfast\u2019s magisterial City Hall. She was 32.</p> \n<p>Kenny was the fifth person to die on Belfast\u2019s streets that year, amid a mounting homelessness crisis in the city. Even more shockingly, newspapers reported that <a href=\"https://www.irishnews.com/news/2016/03/22/news/catherine-kenny-homeless-woman-s-family-tell-of-her-battle-with-drugs-458656/\" title=\"\">her boyfriend had died a few weeks earlier in the same doorway</a>. An inquest found that Kenny died after a fatal reaction to the synthetic cannabinoid known as MDMB-CHMICA \u2013 nicknamed Sky High in Belfast.

Through her tears, she says something about seeing someone who raped her in town, but we are ushered upstairs before we can learn more. Later, Hughes tells us that her sister would soon have calmed the woman down. \u201cShe\u2019d have took that wee girl under her wing and settled her, pacified her, done everything for her. That\u2019s just the type of person she was. She was amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Inside the Welcome, we are joined by its chief executive, Sandra Moore, a friend of Hughes\u2019s who worked closely with Kenny. Moore is a passionate woman in her 60s who weeps one minute as she reminisces and purples with indignation the next when railing against the lack of funding for Belfast\u2019s homeless people. Because public spending has been slashed, Moore says, charities have become increasingly dog-eat-dog as they compete for the tiny pot that remains. \u201cAt ground level, we can see people starting to jostle for what funding there is out there, as opposed to working collectively to address the issues.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f19c6dbd-a8c5-44ad-a2f7-cde781d9ee47\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures.

She admits that this love could be a bit rough and tumble, though. \u201cWe had a running joke in the house. We said: \u2018Catherine\u2019s problems came from us.\u2019\u201d She recalls the times when she and her brothers would wrap Kenny in a blanket and tell her they were going to swing her on to the sofa: \u201cSo imagine she\u2019s in this cocoon. We used to swing her, but bang her against the wall.\u201d How did she respond? \u201cShe\u2019d say: \u2018Do it again, do it again!\u2019\u201d Hughes giggles. \u201cAnd you know turkish delight?

They were members of the same youth club and played mischievous games together like knock-a-door-run. Catherine, the youngest of four children, was Daddy\u2019s blue-eyed girl. Their father, Michael, worked as a steel fixer, installing the components in construction projects. One day, when Catherine was an infant, he fell 13 metres (42ft) from scaffolding: he fractured his skull, lost an ear and injured his spine. Their mother, also Catherine, was the homemaker before the accident, but afterwards their roles were reversed \u2013 Catherine senior worked as a kitchen porter while Michael became the main carer. The younger Catherine became even closer to him.</p> \n<p>Hughes says the family always worried for Catherine \u2013 there was a \u201cwant\u201d in her sister, something missing that she could never put her finger on. This want became more pronounced in her teens after a close friend killed herself. \u201cShe suddenly became this rebellious wee kid in the house,\u201d Hughes says. At the same time, she had low self-esteem \u2013 she obsessed about her weight, the fact that her left clavicle was smaller than the right, and a small scar across her knuckles (the result of burning herself on a radiator when she was a baby). This tiny blemish stopped Kenny from completing a beauticians\u2019 course. \u201cShe would go to massive lengths to look extra-beautiful, because she felt so deep in herself that she was ugly,\u201d Hughes says.</p> \n<p>Was she good at school work? Hughes laughs. \u201cNo, she was never going to be an academic. She was too crazy for that. She smoked in the school grounds and just caused havoc.\u201d Kenny loved football (Manchester United) and music (Eminem, 50 Cent, Tupac). Her nickname was Moonbeam, \u201cbecause she was off the planet\u201d, Hughes says. \u201cWe used to call her the crazy one.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57e75333a64e8526097b2c556905b2d31099d574\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e75333a64e8526097b2c556905b2d31099d574/0_0_4241_4552/932.jpg\" alt=\"Family photos of Catherine Kenny as a child.\" width=\"932\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family photos of Catherine Kenny as a child.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: (Paul McErlane/The Guardian)</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Family photos of Catherine Kenny as a child.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The family home was in Downpatrick, a small town in County Down about 20 miles south of Belfast. Although they lived on a predominantly Catholic estate, the children were largely unaffected by the Troubles. \u201cWe were sheltered from that, living out of Belfast.\u201d All except Catherine, that is. From a young age, she ran around with the more defiant, politicised kids on the estate and became a staunch nationalist.</p> \n<p>\u201cComplex\u201d is the word Hughes returns to repeatedly to describe her sister \u2013 gobby, funny, loving, combative, anarchic, oversensitive, self-loathing Catherine Kenny. The family noticed there was a serious problem when she was 16. Her mental health issues became pronounced and she started to drink and take drugs. Despite this, she received no support from local services and deteriorated gradually as she entered adulthood.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/sep/17/were-telling-the-stories-of-those-who-died-homeless-heres-why\">We're telling the stories of those who died homeless \u2013 here's why</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Does Hughes think the family could have done more to help? She shakes her head. \u201cNot at all. Back then, there was no talk of mental health issues, and we certainly didn\u2019t know about that. Even in her later years, after she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, we were never trained to deal with that. We could never have helped her with that. We weren\u2019t professionals.\u201d Hughes believes Kenny\u2019s life could have turned out very differently if she had received wraparound support from a young age.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It was this lack of intervention early in Kenny\u2019s life that led to Hughes butting heads with Joe McCrisken, the coroner at the inquest into her sister\u2019s death. In fact, Hughes says, she was initially opposed to the inquest full stop. \u201cShe was dead. I wanted to let it go, let her be at peace,\u201d Hughes says. McCrisken insisted the inquest went ahead. That was when they really clashed. While he acknowledged there were insufficient rehab services, he concluded that Kenny \u201cdid receive good care from the health authorities\u201d at various times.</p> \n<p>Hughes\u2019s point was that her sister needed the help in her teens, when she first struggled. \u201cI said to him: \u2018Joe, with all due respect, I\u2019m not talking about Catherine at the age of 30, I\u2019m talking about Catherine at the age of 14 to 15. That\u2019s when she should have had mental health intervention, that\u2019s when they should have looked after her; not when she was 30.\u2019 Was anyone gonna fix that child by the age of 30?\u201d Right until her death, she referred to Kenny as a child.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"648925cc44fbf4456f570c7a6302376b4326504d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/648925cc44fbf4456f570c7a6302376b4326504d/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When Catherine died, I was so lost.\u2019 Catherine\u2019s sister, Lee-Maria Hughes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When Catherine died, I was so lost.\u2019 Catherine\u2019s sister, Lee-Maria Hughes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>\u2018When Catherine died, I was so lost.\u2019 Catherine\u2019s sister, Lee-Maria Hughes. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Two years on, Hughes is glad McCrisken insisted on the inquest. Unlike many coroners tasked with investigating the death of a homeless person, he treated Kenny with respect and was adamant that lessons would be learned. \u201cTo everybody else, she was just a homeless tramp on the street,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cTo Joe, she was a human being who should never have died the way she died. He spoke about her with such compassion. He summonsed all the people to court so we could hear for the first time from the first responders at the scene where Catherine died. It was only afterwards that I realised he allowed us to relive her final moments, and we wouldn\u2019t have got that otherwise. He didn\u2019t let her just become a statistic lying dead in a doorway.\u201d</p> \n<p>The postmortem examination revealed that Kenny had a blood alcohol level four times the legal limit for driving and had taken the \u201clegal high\u201d MDMB-CHMICA. It was subsequently banned \u2013 just a month before the inquest. McCrisken stressed the danger of synthetic cannabinoids, referring to a recent inquest into the death of a 12-year-old who had purchased a \u201clegal high\u201d online, and said that psychoactive substances \u201cpose a very real danger\u201d. It was one of the earliest, and most prophetic, cautions about synthetic cannabinoids. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasise this warning enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be holding another inquest into a death from a legal high, but I fear I will be.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It\u2019s not as if people like Catherine are jumping out of the sky and finding themselves on the streets.

We don\u2019t even have a government to hold us to account. Your responsibility as a politician is actually doing something to prevent anybody else from getting into that situation and families suffering that kind of grief again. It\u2019s not good enough to be saying: \u2018This is tragic.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>In her early 20s, Kenny had a son and worked in a bar. \u201cShe was a cracking barmaid,\u201d Hughes says, smiling. \u201cShe did it for a few years. Everybody loved her.\u201d By 2006, she was still living with her parents, after Hughes and her other siblings had married and moved out. Kenny was drinking heavily \u2013 and ferociously. \u201cCatherine was a violent drunk,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cShe would start murder down the street. If she was in the pub, she fought like mad; she was a nightmare.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d095691bbd9806afa319c837e038827b01c38747\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d095691bbd9806afa319c837e038827b01c38747/0_0_640_1028/623.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine and her father.\" width=\"623\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine and her father, Michael.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Kenny Family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How do we square the cracking barmaid with the violent drunk? Simple, Hughes says: she was a binge drinker and never drank while working. \u201cThe thing you have to understand about Catherine is she could go months on end without a drink, then she\u2019d go off for a week drinking. And you wouldn\u2019t know where she was. Without drink, she was one of the most amazing people you\u2019d have ever met.\u201d</p> \n<p>In January 2007, Kenny\u2019s father was diagnosed with lung cancer. He was told the best he could hope for was five more years. Hughes says that Kenny dedicated herself to him for the rest of his life. \u201cMy daddy was very, very sick towards the end, and she was so good to him. Oh my God, that child ... what she did for my daddy.\u201d Throughout her life, Kenny showed a desire and ability to look after others while wholly neglecting herself. \u201cCatherine brought in all the strays of the day,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI swear she brought everything into the house, whether it be dogs, cats, hedgehogs, birds; you name it, she brought it home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Their father died aged 62, seven months after his diagnosis. Kenny discovered him in bed after he suffered a rupture in his lungs. \u201cBasically, the tumour dislodged,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cSo you can imagine the sight that Catherine found.\u201d Hughes believes that discovering her father like that almost destroyed Kenny. Throughout the three-day wake the family held for him, she was nowhere to be seen. Hughes says Kenny tried to block out her grief with any drugs she could get her hands on.</p> \n<p>Despite her worsening condition, Kenny continued to care for her mother, who by now also had a lung disease. She died 17 months later, aged 63, in January 2009. Kenny could not cope in the family home by herself. Hughes and her husband, Darren, secured her a flat close to them on the outskirts of Downpatrick. Despite their best intentions, things went horribly wrong. \u201cJesus Christ, the heartache that child caused. Between parties, drinking, taking drugs, at this point crystal meth came into the scene. When this hateful drug came on the scene ... That smell \u2013 when I think of that word, I can smell that smell.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMetallic,\u201d Moore says.</p> \n<p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s exactly it,\u201d says Hughes, wincing.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>We break off for lunch \u2013 a platter of ham and cheese sandwiches, mugs of tea and shortcake. Hughes opens up a giant memorial scrapbook that is lying on the desk. Flowers frame a photograph of Kenny on the front cover. The inside has been lovingly curated with childhood photos, more recent snaps, letters and other memories from her life. The scrapbook has become a prized possession for Hughes.</p> \n<p>There are photos of young, playful Catherine with her siblings; glamorous Catherine in her 20s, wearing a sheer, white silk top; adoring Catherine with her young son. Hughes passes over the latter quickly, saying she cannot talk about her nephew. We ask when Kenny was at her happiest. Hughes looks upset. She gestures silently to the photos of her sister with her son before moving on.</p> \n<p>The scrapbook contains a letter sent to Hughes after Kenny died, from a woman who was a stranger to the rest of the family. Kenny had known the letter-writer\u2019s son, who had killed himself; she had paid her a visit after his death. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten Katy\u2019s [Catherine\u2019s] visit,\u201d she wrote. \u201cKaty brought sunshine that day to a grieving mother who could only see darkness. Her act of kindness speaks volumes about the person she was. I feel very privileged and grateful to have known her.\u201d Another instance of the woman who was so hopeless at looking after herself taking care of others.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"738db86db0821bcd95d1c356c778b1b8b2464bd6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/738db86db0821bcd95d1c356c778b1b8b2464bd6/0_0_2448_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine was assaulted at least three times while living on the streets, says her sister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine was assaulted at least three times while living on the streets, says her sister.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Kenny Family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Catherine was assaulted at least three times while living on the streets, says her sister.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>We come across a poignant card in the scrapbook that Kenny sent to Hughes and her husband in 2012, four years before she died. Revealingly, she refers to her as \u201cmummy\u201d, as well as her sister. \u201cTo my sister, best friend in the world and mummy for your amazing strength and patience above all, for standing by me and never giving up on me. I will make you proud of me, I love you with all my heart and soul and for letting me be a part of my wee man Jack\u2019s [Hughes\u2019s son\u2019s] life. And to my big bro [Darren], I\u2019m sorry for being so much hard work and for all the bad I\u2019ve done on you, but I know you will be there to watch me grow and change and be a proper sister to you and your amazing wife and to be a good example of an aunty to Jack.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she never did manage to change. At 28, she was finally diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder. She self-harmed frequently and attempted suicide several times. Hughes recalls one frustrating meeting with a community crisis team in 2014: \u201cThis guy came into my sister\u2019s house and she\u2019s sliced all over, arms bleeding everywhere, and I remember him sitting down \u2013 condescending bastard if I ever met one \u2013 and he said to my sister: \u2018Tell me this, Catherine, do you drink because you\u2019re depressed or are you depressed because you drink?\u2019 And she says: \u2018I\u2019m depressed because I drink.\u2019 Had she answered that the other way, he would have helped her, but he didn\u2019t. He got up and he said: \u2018Stop drinking!\u2019 and walked out and left me with that child bleeding from every place on her arms.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"074aed423ec81d001602f6badff0eb96505103fb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/074aed423ec81d001602f6badff0eb96505103fb/0_0_485_485/485.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine with her mother, also Catherine.\" width=\"485\" height=\"485\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine with her mother, also Catherine.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Kenny Family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Catherine, aged 10, with her mother, also called Catherine</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Kenny became homeless a year after that meeting and spent the final year of her life on the streets. Hughes says it was a terrible period for her sister. For the first time, Kenny started to drink constantly. Hughes knows of at least three times that she was viciously attacked while living on the streets. She shows us a distressing photograph of Kenny lying asleep in a hospital bed, her face a grisly patchwork of cuts, bruises, scars and stitches.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>It was on the streets that Kenny came into contact with Sandra Moore at the Welcome Organisation. Moore started working for the Welcome 12 years ago. Back then, the organisation was a tiny outfit operating from an old laundry, equipped only with a domestic-sized kitchen to feed 40 to 50 homeless people a day. This was before the UK\u2019s Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion\" title=\"\">its austerity programme</a>, and the challenges were very different: \u201cWe had six females who we would have deemed entrenched rough sleepers,\u201d Moore says. Today, women are a much bigger part of the homeless picture in Northern Ireland. Out of the 205 homeless people who died in Northern Ireland in the 18 months before March 2019, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iG6X7OE7JVcN8xltOm50KgX3xmN5ynvx0cqxAJLOpmE/edit#gid=814172065\" title=\"\">80 \u2013 almost </a><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iG6X7OE7JVcN8xltOm50KgX3xmN5ynvx0cqxAJLOpmE/edit#gid=814172065\" title=\"\">four in 10 \u2013 were women</a>, including a 101-year-old woman and 17 women aged 80 or older. In England and Wales, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that 88% of the estimated 726 homeless people who died in 2018 were men.</p> \n<p>Clare Bailey, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Green party, last year <a href=\"https://thedetail.tv/articles/homeless\" title=\"\">described the statistics </a><a href=\"https://thedetail.tv/articles/homeless\" title=\"\">as \u201cbrutally shocking\u201d</a>. But, on the streets, the homelessness crisis seems no worse than in the rest of the UK \u2013 and less conspicuous than in English cities such as London, Birmingham and Manchester. There is a simple reason that the figures for homeless deaths in Northern Ireland appear so alarming \u2013 the way they are counted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Catherine\u2019s biggest issue was the fact she didn\u2019t believe she deserved love and help and gratitude</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sandra Moore, the Welcome Organisation</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The Northern Ireland Housing Executive count is based on homelessness applications and includes sofa surfers and people sleeping in temporary accommodation or hostels; the ONS defines people who have died homeless in England and Wales as those whose death certificates state explicitly that they were of no fixed abode, homeless or using homeless hostels and emergency shelters. In other words, the figures produced by the ONS for England and Wales are a measure of the most extreme form of homelessness \u2013 street homelessness. This helps to explain why in Northern Ireland women account for a larger proportion of homeless deaths than in England and Wales.</p> \n<p>The number of people sleeping rough changes by the day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/22/at-least-320000-homeless-people-in-britain-says-shelter\" title=\"\">but it is a tiny proportion of the 320,000 people that the charity Shelter estimated were homeless in Britain in 2018</a>. For example, in autumn 2017, it was estimated that 4,751 people slept rough in England. While Northern Ireland\u2019s figure for homeless deaths is significantly higher proportionally than in England and Wales, its figures for rough sleeping are in fact lower than in many regions of England and Wales.</p> \n<p>Moore does not sentimentalise the street homeless people of Belfast. Many are difficult to work with, and Kenny was no exception. \u201cOn one occasion, I had picked up Catherine from the streets to take her back to the Welcome. I was bringing her out of the van and she didn\u2019t want to come out ... I was kind of frog-marching her and she was calling me delightful names. \u2018Fucking let me lie there. I was comfortable, you fucking bastard.\u2019\u201d Moore smiles at the memory. Even when Kenny gave her \u201cdog\u2019s abuse\u201d, Moore could not help but like her.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77d52be09aef84d56bbb2830de0520c3b42daaac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77d52be09aef84d56bbb2830de0520c3b42daaac/35_0_1067_640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sisters on Lee-Maria\u2019s wedding day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sisters on Lee-Maria\u2019s wedding day</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Kenny Family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The sisters on Lee-Maria\u2019s wedding day</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Moore and Hughes believe that the abuse stemmed from Kenny\u2019s feelings of worthlessness. \u201cCatherine\u2019s biggest issue was the fact she didn\u2019t believe she deserved love and help and gratitude and all those compassionate things that people offer,\u201d Hughes says. Moore notes that it is common for the people she helps to resist support: \u201cThey challenge, challenge, challenge, because they can\u2019t get their head around the fact that somebody actually cares.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kenny was a scrapper, and she enjoyed pitting her slight frame \u2013 she was 1.4 metres (4ft 8in) tall and weighed 41kg (6st 7lb) \u2013 against an opponent in a different weight division. Often, it affected the family. In 2002, the first year Hughes and Darren were together, he spent Christmas Eve with Kenny at hospital after she got hurt in a drunken brawl in the city centre.</p> \n<p>Kenny, a devout Catholic as well as a nationalist, adored Darren, but that did not exempt him from her taunting. \u201cEverybody knew who Catherine was, and you either liked it or lumped it,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cThat was her attitude. My husband is a Protestant, and she tortured him.\u201d What did she call him? \u201cBlack bastard.\u201d She looks embarrassed. \u201cBlack bastard\u201d is a pejorative directed at the unionist community in Northern Ireland, particularly those in the police. Kenny would never shy away from a fight \u2013 particularly with the police. In 2011, she was imprisoned for assaulting a police officer.</p> \n<p>Four months before she died, she was imprisoned for a second time. Hughes believes a warrant for her arrest, for disorderly behaviour, had been out for months and she was picked up off the street. Kenny served three months in Hydebank Wood College prison. After almost a year of rough sleeping, she was weak and vulnerable, having been the victim of multiple assaults on the streets. How does Hughes feel about the fact that her sister was jailed when she was in such a state? \u201cI was pleased. I know that\u2019s selfish of me, but I knew she was safe and was getting dry and getting all her square meals and getting her medical attention.\u201d Yes, of course, Hughes says she would have preferred her to be in rehab, but prison was the next best option.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=320%2C000&amp;title=people%20are%20estimated%20to%20have%20been%20homeless%20in%20Britain%20in%202018\" data-alt=\"320,000 people are estimated to have been homeless in Britain in 2018\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=320%2C000&amp;title=people%20are%20estimated%20to%20have%20been%20homeless%20in%20Britain%20in%202018\">320,000 people are estimated to have been homeless in Britain in 2018</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Kenny was popular among the homeless community in Belfast and had become especially close to<a href=\"https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2016/02/10/news/funeral-for-homeless-man-who-died-in-belfast-413716/\"> Jimmy Coulter</a>, with whom she often slept rough. While it was reported in the local press that Coulter and Kenny were in a relationship, Moore says it is more accurate to describe the pair as a \u201ccouple of bestie mates\u201d. Two days before Kenny was due to be released from prison, Coulter died on the streets of Belfast. Hughes is convinced that the prison\u2019s failure to tell her sister that Coulter had died was a key factor in her eventual death.</p> \n<p>\u201cI rang the prison and I said: \u2018It\u2019s really important that Catherine is told this news,\u2019\u201d Hughes says. \u201cIf she comes out to this news, this is going to send her over the edge. But, in their professional opinion, they thought that would be the biggest mistake ever.\u201d According to Hughes, the prison did not want to risk informing Kenny of her friend\u2019s death, lest it destabilise her. Hydebank Wood College prison declined to comment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I battled every day with Catherine and her addictions for 16 years of her life.

They spent most of the day with her, but after she discovered what had happened to Coulter she was angry and wanted to be alone \u2013 on the street.<strong> </strong>\u201cShe went off the Richter scale,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cShe had been 12 weeks sober and clean and, after receiving the news, she pumped every fucking narcotic that she could get into her body. Oh my God, it was horrendous.\u201d</p> \n<p>Did Hughes consider bringing Kenny home with her? No, she says: however much she loved her sister, she could not have done that. \u201cIf I had made the decision to bring Catherine here, in the eyes of social services, I would have put my child at risk. Not in my eyes, because I knew Catherine would never, ever have been a threat to my son. He is, ultimately, my main priority. As much as I\u2019d done for Catherine, Jack always came first.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe second reason I didn\u2019t have her here is that I would never have wanted Jack to witness Catherine like that, and he never did, because in his wee head he had his idea who his aunty Catherine was before it all went terribly wrong for her, and I would never want to taint that memory.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hughes describes the final 11 months of Kenny\u2019s life, when she was living on the streets, as \u201ca whole new level of horror\u201d. She says there is a final reason she didn\u2019t invite her into her home. \u201cCatherine had a dual addiction to alcohol and drugs. There was no way I was ever going to keep her in my house unless I\u2019d locked her in a bedroom. She would never have stayed. She simply would never have stayed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4aa0cf8cb5c79e1a175938eed3b8bd587750b7bf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aa0cf8cb5c79e1a175938eed3b8bd587750b7bf/0_2_4346_2607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Family photos of Catherine Kenny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family photos of Catherine Kenny.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Courtesy of the Kenny family</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kenny had a number of seizures over the following four weeks. On Monday 14 March, she suffered a huge seizure and was hospitalised. The next day, Hughes spent many hours trying to get her into rehab units across Northern Ireland. \u201cI finally get speaking to a girl up in Derry, and I remember it as clear as day. I said: \u2018I need you to take my sister, please help me get my sister better,\u2019 and she said to me: \u2018The soonest I can see your sister is three weeks. If I deem her fit to come in and use our services, then that is what will happen.\u2019 I said: \u2018Well, what would you like me to do with my sister for three weeks?\u2019 She said: \u2018I have no idea, but she can\u2019t come here.\u2019 And my sister died four days later in a stinking, dirty doorway in our capital city. Jesus Christ, where is the humanity in that?\u201d</p> \n<p>On the Wednesday, Kenny discharged herself from hospital. Three days later, Hughes received a visit from the police in an unmarked squad car. She says she knew in her heart why they were there. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it until the day I take my last breath. Darren said: \u2018This is the knock \u2013 it\u2019s going to change your life.\u2019\u201d She opened the door and was greeted by a tall policeman. \u201cHe says: \u2018There\u2019s no easy way to say this: Catherine was found dead an hour ago.\u2019 And my world came crashing down around me.\u201d It was five weeks since Coulter had been found dead in the same doorway.</p> \n<p>Hughes says so many people rang her to offer condolences, but she did not answer. She refused to accept her sister had died until her body had been identified. Darren and her brother David went to the morgue. Kenny still had a cannula in her left hand, which obscured the scar she got from burning her hand as a baby. \u201cDavid knew it was her, but he wanted to see the scar. He tried to take the bandage off and the policeman had to restrain him. He was like: \u2018I need to see the scar, you need to show me the scar.\u2019\u201d Sure enough, he got to see the scar.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>Hundreds of people attended Kenny\u2019s funeral. The service card contains a poem. It is a tender, raw and unblinking account of Kenny\u2019s curtailed life, written in the first person. It was Darren who wrote the poem, on the day he and Hughes discovered she had died. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever written a poem in his life,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI read it at the service and, honestly, you could have heard a pin drop.\u201d The poem contains the lines:</p> \n<p><em>I\u2019ll always be that feather on your ground,</em><br><em>I\u2019ll be everywhere you go.</em></p> \n<p>Hughes now has a feather tattooed on her back, along with the words: \u201cI\u2019ll be everywhere you go.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"92fbd1f376ef6e26f05a975fa407b9d744787232\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92fbd1f376ef6e26f05a975fa407b9d744787232/644_236_4445_3327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The poem written by Lee-Maria\u2019s husband Darren on the day Catherine died.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"748\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The poem written by Lee-Maria\u2019s husband Darren on the day Catherine died.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Before her sister\u2019s death, Hughes\u2019s own life was in chaos, but it was a chaos on which she thrived. \u201cWhen Catherine died, I was so lost,\u201d she says.

After Kenny died, she gave up her job. \u201cI couldn\u2019t function without Catherine. I became an introvert.

She has got a new job \u2013 as a buyer, rather than a salesperson.

      "bodyText": "The day after Catherine Kenny suffered a seizure in Belfast city centre in March 2016, she woke up in hospital. The first person she saw at her bedside was her sister Lee-Maria Hughes, who had been there for her all her life. \u201cI said to her: \u2018My God, sweetheart, what am I gonna do with you?\u2019\u201d Hughes says. \u201cShe just opened her eyes and said: \u2018Will you help me? Please help me, I need help.\u2019\u201d She had never asked for help before. Kenny had battled alcohol and drug dependency since her teens. Eventually, it had led to her sleeping rough on the streets of Belfast. Over the next few days, Hughes tried desperately to get her sister into rehab, but she did not succeed. Five days after her seizure, Kenny died alone in the doorway of a derelict shop just metres from Belfast\u2019s magisterial City Hall. She was 32. Kenny was the fifth person to die on Belfast\u2019s streets that year, amid a mounting homelessness crisis in the city. Even more shockingly, newspapers reported that her boyfriend had died a few weeks earlier in the same doorway. An inquest found that Kenny died after a fatal reaction to the synthetic cannabinoid known as MDMB-CHMICA \u2013 nicknamed Sky High in Belfast. The inquest, held in January 2017, heard that 13 people had died from taking the drug in Europe between December 2014 and May 2016, and that Kenny was the first known victim in Northern Ireland. The death of Kenny and the four other rough sleepers in Belfast led to a task force being set up to address the issue. However, in January 2017, the Northern Ireland assembly collapsed, and there has been no devolved government since. In the 18 months before March 2019, 205 homeless people lost their lives in Northern Ireland \u2013 more than 25% of the 800 homeless deaths in the UK catalogued by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism during the same period, despite the fact that Northern Ireland\u2019s population of 1.9 million accounts for only 2.8% of the UK\u2019s population. Northern Ireland counts homelessness and homeless deaths differently from the rest of UK, which explains much of the disparity, but the figures are still horrifying. Hughes, a 39-year-old businesswoman, says that, if we had approached her last year, she would not have been ready to talk about her sister. She meets us at George Best airport in Belfast and ferries us in her BMW to the Welcome Organisation, a local charity that is the fulcrum of homeless aid in the city. Along the way, she points out the local landmarks \u2013 here is the liner-shaped Titanic museum and the Harland and Wolff shipyard, its giant yellow cranes, Samson and Goliath, dominating the skyline; there is the famous memorial mural to the hunger striker Bobby Sands. Hughes reels off the history of her home city in a series of well-turned anecdotes. She is small, fierce and warm. When we enter the Welcome centre, we are confronted by a distressed young woman who has been stopped from entering the building because she has drugs on her. Through her tears, she says something about seeing someone who raped her in town, but we are ushered upstairs before we can learn more. Later, Hughes tells us that her sister would soon have calmed the woman down. \u201cShe\u2019d have took that wee girl under her wing and settled her, pacified her, done everything for her. That\u2019s just the type of person she was. She was amazing.\u201d Inside the Welcome, we are joined by its chief executive, Sandra Moore, a friend of Hughes\u2019s who worked closely with Kenny. Moore is a passionate woman in her 60s who weeps one minute as she reminisces and purples with indignation the next when railing against the lack of funding for Belfast\u2019s homeless people. Because public spending has been slashed, Moore says, charities have become increasingly dog-eat-dog as they compete for the tiny pot that remains. \u201cAt ground level, we can see people starting to jostle for what funding there is out there, as opposed to working collectively to address the issues.\u201d If you look into the background of homeless people, often you find chaos, broken homes, abuse and neglect, but Kenny had a loving family who \u201cnever wanted for anything\u201d, Hughes says. She admits that this love could be a bit rough and tumble, though. \u201cWe had a running joke in the house. We said: \u2018Catherine\u2019s problems came from us.\u2019\u201d She recalls the times when she and her brothers would wrap Kenny in a blanket and tell her they were going to swing her on to the sofa: \u201cSo imagine she\u2019s in this cocoon. We used to swing her, but bang her against the wall.\u201d How did she respond? \u201cShe\u2019d say: \u2018Do it again, do it again!\u2019\u201d Hughes giggles. \u201cAnd you know turkish delight? Well, she hated turkish delight. So we used to steal all her chocolate out of her selection boxes at Christmas and put all the fucking delights in!\u201d Now she is giggling hard. Despite Hughes being four years older than her sister, they were close \u2013 and always remained so. They were members of the same youth club and played mischievous games together like knock-a-door-run. Catherine, the youngest of four children, was Daddy\u2019s blue-eyed girl. Their father, Michael, worked as a steel fixer, installing the components in construction projects. One day, when Catherine was an infant, he fell 13 metres (42ft) from scaffolding: he fractured his skull, lost an ear and injured his spine. Their mother, also Catherine, was the homemaker before the accident, but afterwards their roles were reversed \u2013 Catherine senior worked as a kitchen porter while Michael became the main carer. The younger Catherine became even closer to him. Hughes says the family always worried for Catherine \u2013 there was a \u201cwant\u201d in her sister, something missing that she could never put her finger on. This want became more pronounced in her teens after a close friend killed herself. \u201cShe suddenly became this rebellious wee kid in the house,\u201d Hughes says. At the same time, she had low self-esteem \u2013 she obsessed about her weight, the fact that her left clavicle was smaller than the right, and a small scar across her knuckles (the result of burning herself on a radiator when she was a baby). This tiny blemish stopped Kenny from completing a beauticians\u2019 course. \u201cShe would go to massive lengths to look extra-beautiful, because she felt so deep in herself that she was ugly,\u201d Hughes says. Was she good at school work? Hughes laughs. \u201cNo, she was never going to be an academic. She was too crazy for that. She smoked in the school grounds and just caused havoc.\u201d Kenny loved football (Manchester United) and music (Eminem, 50 Cent, Tupac). Her nickname was Moonbeam, \u201cbecause she was off the planet\u201d, Hughes says. \u201cWe used to call her the crazy one.\u201d Family photos of Catherine Kenny as a child. The family home was in Downpatrick, a small town in County Down about 20 miles south of Belfast. Although they lived on a predominantly Catholic estate, the children were largely unaffected by the Troubles. \u201cWe were sheltered from that, living out of Belfast.\u201d All except Catherine, that is. From a young age, she ran around with the more defiant, politicised kids on the estate and became a staunch nationalist. \u201cComplex\u201d is the word Hughes returns to repeatedly to describe her sister \u2013 gobby, funny, loving, combative, anarchic, oversensitive, self-loathing Catherine Kenny. The family noticed there was a serious problem when she was 16. Her mental health issues became pronounced and she started to drink and take drugs. Despite this, she received no support from local services and deteriorated gradually as she entered adulthood. Does Hughes think the family could have done more to help? She shakes her head. \u201cNot at all. Back then, there was no talk of mental health issues, and we certainly didn\u2019t know about that. Even in her later years, after she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, we were never trained to deal with that. We could never have helped her with that. We weren\u2019t professionals.\u201d Hughes believes Kenny\u2019s life could have turned out very differently if she had received wraparound support from a young age. * * * It was this lack of intervention early in Kenny\u2019s life that led to Hughes butting heads with Joe McCrisken, the coroner at the inquest into her sister\u2019s death. In fact, Hughes says, she was initially opposed to the inquest full stop. \u201cShe was dead. I wanted to let it go, let her be at peace,\u201d Hughes says. McCrisken insisted the inquest went ahead. That was when they really clashed. While he acknowledged there were insufficient rehab services, he concluded that Kenny \u201cdid receive good care from the health authorities\u201d at various times. Hughes\u2019s point was that her sister needed the help in her teens, when she first struggled. \u201cI said to him: \u2018Joe, with all due respect, I\u2019m not talking about Catherine at the age of 30, I\u2019m talking about Catherine at the age of 14 to 15. That\u2019s when she should have had mental health intervention, that\u2019s when they should have looked after her; not when she was 30.\u2019 Was anyone gonna fix that child by the age of 30?\u201d Right until her death, she referred to Kenny as a child. \u2018When Catherine died, I was so lost.\u2019 Catherine\u2019s sister, Lee-Maria Hughes. Photograph: Paul McErlane/The Guardian Two years on, Hughes is glad McCrisken insisted on the inquest. Unlike many coroners tasked with investigating the death of a homeless person, he treated Kenny with respect and was adamant that lessons would be learned. \u201cTo everybody else, she was just a homeless tramp on the street,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cTo Joe, she was a human being who should never have died the way she died. He spoke about her with such compassion. He summonsed all the people to court so we could hear for the first time from the first responders at the scene where Catherine died. It was only afterwards that I realised he allowed us to relive her final moments, and we wouldn\u2019t have got that otherwise. He didn\u2019t let her just become a statistic lying dead in a doorway.\u201d The postmortem examination revealed that Kenny had a blood alcohol level four times the legal limit for driving and had taken the \u201clegal high\u201d MDMB-CHMICA. It was subsequently banned \u2013 just a month before the inquest. McCrisken stressed the danger of synthetic cannabinoids, referring to a recent inquest into the death of a 12-year-old who had purchased a \u201clegal high\u201d online, and said that psychoactive substances \u201cpose a very real danger\u201d. It was one of the earliest, and most prophetic, cautions about synthetic cannabinoids. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasise this warning enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be holding another inquest into a death from a legal high, but I fear I will be.\u201d Nichola Mallon, the deputy leader of the centre-left, nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and a former lord mayor of Belfast, is sympathetic to Hughes\u2019s view that there should have been an early intervention in Kenny\u2019s case. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if people like Catherine are jumping out of the sky and finding themselves homeless on the streets,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a journey, and we should be getting them help early on, rather than leaving them to die in doorways.\u201d Mallon believes that, since the suspension of Stormont in January 2017, the homelessness problem has grown more acute in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe\u2019re failing homeless people and we\u2019re failing them spectacularly,\u201d she says. \u201cPoliticians put out statements and we say: \u2018This is a tragic loss of life; we must do something about this.\u2019 And then what do we do? We don\u2019t even have a government to hold us to account. Your responsibility as a politician is actually doing something to prevent anybody else from getting into that situation and families suffering that kind of grief again. It\u2019s not good enough to be saying: \u2018This is tragic.\u2019\u201d * * * In her early 20s, Kenny had a son and worked in a bar. \u201cShe was a cracking barmaid,\u201d Hughes says, smiling. \u201cShe did it for a few years. Everybody loved her.\u201d By 2006, she was still living with her parents, after Hughes and her other siblings had married and moved out. Kenny was drinking heavily \u2013 and ferociously. \u201cCatherine was a violent drunk,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cShe would start murder down the street. If she was in the pub, she fought like mad; she was a nightmare.\u201d How do we square the cracking barmaid with the violent drunk? Simple, Hughes says: she was a binge drinker and never drank while working. \u201cThe thing you have to understand about Catherine is she could go months on end without a drink, then she\u2019d go off for a week drinking. And you wouldn\u2019t know where she was. Without drink, she was one of the most amazing people you\u2019d have ever met.\u201d In January 2007, Kenny\u2019s father was diagnosed with lung cancer. He was told the best he could hope for was five more years. Hughes says that Kenny dedicated herself to him for the rest of his life. \u201cMy daddy was very, very sick towards the end, and she was so good to him. Oh my God, that child ... what she did for my daddy.\u201d Throughout her life, Kenny showed a desire and ability to look after others while wholly neglecting herself. \u201cCatherine brought in all the strays of the day,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI swear she brought everything into the house, whether it be dogs, cats, hedgehogs, birds; you name it, she brought it home.\u201d Their father died aged 62, seven months after his diagnosis. Kenny discovered him in bed after he suffered a rupture in his lungs. \u201cBasically, the tumour dislodged,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cSo you can imagine the sight that Catherine found.\u201d Hughes believes that discovering her father like that almost destroyed Kenny. Throughout the three-day wake the family held for him, she was nowhere to be seen. Hughes says Kenny tried to block out her grief with any drugs she could get her hands on. Despite her worsening condition, Kenny continued to care for her mother, who by now also had a lung disease. She died 17 months later, aged 63, in January 2009. Kenny could not cope in the family home by herself. Hughes and her husband, Darren, secured her a flat close to them on the outskirts of Downpatrick. Despite their best intentions, things went horribly wrong. \u201cJesus Christ, the heartache that child caused. Between parties, drinking, taking drugs, at this point crystal meth came into the scene. When this hateful drug came on the scene ... That smell \u2013 when I think of that word, I can smell that smell.\u201d \u201cMetallic,\u201d Moore says. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s exactly it,\u201d says Hughes, wincing. * * * We break off for lunch \u2013 a platter of ham and cheese sandwiches, mugs of tea and shortcake. Hughes opens up a giant memorial scrapbook that is lying on the desk. Flowers frame a photograph of Kenny on the front cover. The inside has been lovingly curated with childhood photos, more recent snaps, letters and other memories from her life. The scrapbook has become a prized possession for Hughes. There are photos of young, playful Catherine with her siblings; glamorous Catherine in her 20s, wearing a sheer, white silk top; adoring Catherine with her young son. Hughes passes over the latter quickly, saying she cannot talk about her nephew. We ask when Kenny was at her happiest. Hughes looks upset. She gestures silently to the photos of her sister with her son before moving on. The scrapbook contains a letter sent to Hughes after Kenny died, from a woman who was a stranger to the rest of the family. Kenny had known the letter-writer\u2019s son, who had killed himself; she had paid her a visit after his death. \u201cI\u2019ve never forgotten Katy\u2019s [Catherine\u2019s] visit,\u201d she wrote. \u201cKaty brought sunshine that day to a grieving mother who could only see darkness. Her act of kindness speaks volumes about the person she was. I feel very privileged and grateful to have known her.\u201d Another instance of the woman who was so hopeless at looking after herself taking care of others. Catherine was assaulted at least three times while living on the streets, says her sister. We come across a poignant card in the scrapbook that Kenny sent to Hughes and her husband in 2012, four years before she died. Revealingly, she refers to her as \u201cmummy\u201d, as well as her sister. \u201cTo my sister, best friend in the world and mummy for your amazing strength and patience above all, for standing by me and never giving up on me. I will make you proud of me, I love you with all my heart and soul and for letting me be a part of my wee man Jack\u2019s [Hughes\u2019s son\u2019s] life. And to my big bro [Darren], I\u2019m sorry for being so much hard work and for all the bad I\u2019ve done on you, but I know you will be there to watch me grow and change and be a proper sister to you and your amazing wife and to be a good example of an aunty to Jack.\u201d But she never did manage to change. At 28, she was finally diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder. She self-harmed frequently and attempted suicide several times. Hughes recalls one frustrating meeting with a community crisis team in 2014: \u201cThis guy came into my sister\u2019s house and she\u2019s sliced all over, arms bleeding everywhere, and I remember him sitting down \u2013 condescending bastard if I ever met one \u2013 and he said to my sister: \u2018Tell me this, Catherine, do you drink because you\u2019re depressed or are you depressed because you drink?\u2019 And she says: \u2018I\u2019m depressed because I drink.\u2019 Had she answered that the other way, he would have helped her, but he didn\u2019t. He got up and he said: \u2018Stop drinking!\u2019 and walked out and left me with that child bleeding from every place on her arms.\u201d Catherine, aged 10, with her mother, also called Catherine Kenny became homeless a year after that meeting and spent the final year of her life on the streets. Hughes says it was a terrible period for her sister. For the first time, Kenny started to drink constantly. Hughes knows of at least three times that she was viciously attacked while living on the streets. She shows us a distressing photograph of Kenny lying asleep in a hospital bed, her face a grisly patchwork of cuts, bruises, scars and stitches. * * * It was on the streets that Kenny came into contact with Sandra Moore at the Welcome Organisation. Moore started working for the Welcome 12 years ago. Back then, the organisation was a tiny outfit operating from an old laundry, equipped only with a domestic-sized kitchen to feed 40 to 50 homeless people a day. This was before the UK\u2019s Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government began its austerity programme, and the challenges were very different: \u201cWe had six females who we would have deemed entrenched rough sleepers,\u201d Moore says. Today, women are a much bigger part of the homeless picture in Northern Ireland. Out of the 205 homeless people who died in Northern Ireland in the 18 months before March 2019, 80 \u2013 almost four in 10 \u2013 were women, including a 101-year-old woman and 17 women aged 80 or older. In England and Wales, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows that 88% of the estimated 726 homeless people who died in 2018 were men. Clare Bailey, the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Green party, last year described the statistics as \u201cbrutally shocking\u201d. But, on the streets, the homelessness crisis seems no worse than in the rest of the UK \u2013 and less conspicuous than in English cities such as London, Birmingham and Manchester. There is a simple reason that the figures for homeless deaths in Northern Ireland appear so alarming \u2013 the way they are counted. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive count is based on homelessness applications and includes sofa surfers and people sleeping in temporary accommodation or hostels; the ONS defines people who have died homeless in England and Wales as those whose death certificates state explicitly that they were of no fixed abode, homeless or using homeless hostels and emergency shelters. In other words, the figures produced by the ONS for England and Wales are a measure of the most extreme form of homelessness \u2013 street homelessness. This helps to explain why in Northern Ireland women account for a larger proportion of homeless deaths than in England and Wales. The number of people sleeping rough changes by the day, but it is a tiny proportion of the 320,000 people that the charity Shelter estimated were homeless in Britain in 2018. For example, in autumn 2017, it was estimated that 4,751 people slept rough in England. While Northern Ireland\u2019s figure for homeless deaths is significantly higher proportionally than in England and Wales, its figures for rough sleeping are in fact lower than in many regions of England and Wales. Moore does not sentimentalise the street homeless people of Belfast. Many are difficult to work with, and Kenny was no exception. \u201cOn one occasion, I had picked up Catherine from the streets to take her back to the Welcome. I was bringing her out of the van and she didn\u2019t want to come out ... I was kind of frog-marching her and she was calling me delightful names. \u2018Fucking let me lie there. I was comfortable, you fucking bastard.\u2019\u201d Moore smiles at the memory. Even when Kenny gave her \u201cdog\u2019s abuse\u201d, Moore could not help but like her. The sisters on Lee-Maria\u2019s wedding day Moore and Hughes believe that the abuse stemmed from Kenny\u2019s feelings of worthlessness. \u201cCatherine\u2019s biggest issue was the fact she didn\u2019t believe she deserved love and help and gratitude and all those compassionate things that people offer,\u201d Hughes says. Moore notes that it is common for the people she helps to resist support: \u201cThey challenge, challenge, challenge, because they can\u2019t get their head around the fact that somebody actually cares.\u201d Kenny was a scrapper, and she enjoyed pitting her slight frame \u2013 she was 1.4 metres (4ft 8in) tall and weighed 41kg (6st 7lb) \u2013 against an opponent in a different weight division. Often, it affected the family. In 2002, the first year Hughes and Darren were together, he spent Christmas Eve with Kenny at hospital after she got hurt in a drunken brawl in the city centre. Kenny, a devout Catholic as well as a nationalist, adored Darren, but that did not exempt him from her taunting. \u201cEverybody knew who Catherine was, and you either liked it or lumped it,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cThat was her attitude. My husband is a Protestant, and she tortured him.\u201d What did she call him? \u201cBlack bastard.\u201d She looks embarrassed. \u201cBlack bastard\u201d is a pejorative directed at the unionist community in Northern Ireland, particularly those in the police. Kenny would never shy away from a fight \u2013 particularly with the police. In 2011, she was imprisoned for assaulting a police officer. Four months before she died, she was imprisoned for a second time. Hughes believes a warrant for her arrest, for disorderly behaviour, had been out for months and she was picked up off the street. Kenny served three months in Hydebank Wood College prison. After almost a year of rough sleeping, she was weak and vulnerable, having been the victim of multiple assaults on the streets. How does Hughes feel about the fact that her sister was jailed when she was in such a state? \u201cI was pleased. I know that\u2019s selfish of me, but I knew she was safe and was getting dry and getting all her square meals and getting her medical attention.\u201d Yes, of course, Hughes says she would have preferred her to be in rehab, but prison was the next best option. Kenny was popular among the homeless community in Belfast and had become especially close to Jimmy Coulter, with whom she often slept rough. While it was reported in the local press that Coulter and Kenny were in a relationship, Moore says it is more accurate to describe the pair as a \u201ccouple of bestie mates\u201d. Two days before Kenny was due to be released from prison, Coulter died on the streets of Belfast. Hughes is convinced that the prison\u2019s failure to tell her sister that Coulter had died was a key factor in her eventual death. \u201cI rang the prison and I said: \u2018It\u2019s really important that Catherine is told this news,\u2019\u201d Hughes says. \u201cIf she comes out to this news, this is going to send her over the edge. But, in their professional opinion, they thought that would be the biggest mistake ever.\u201d According to Hughes, the prison did not want to risk informing Kenny of her friend\u2019s death, lest it destabilise her. Hydebank Wood College prison declined to comment. On Kenny\u2019s release, Hughes ensured that she was met at the prison gate by Donna and Jim Connor from Hope Outreach, which works with the Welcome Organisation. They spent most of the day with her, but after she discovered what had happened to Coulter she was angry and wanted to be alone \u2013 on the street. \u201cShe went off the Richter scale,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cShe had been 12 weeks sober and clean and, after receiving the news, she pumped every fucking narcotic that she could get into her body. Oh my God, it was horrendous.\u201d Did Hughes consider bringing Kenny home with her? No, she says: however much she loved her sister, she could not have done that. \u201cIf I had made the decision to bring Catherine here, in the eyes of social services, I would have put my child at risk. Not in my eyes, because I knew Catherine would never, ever have been a threat to my son. He is, ultimately, my main priority. As much as I\u2019d done for Catherine, Jack always came first. \u201cThe second reason I didn\u2019t have her here is that I would never have wanted Jack to witness Catherine like that, and he never did, because in his wee head he had his idea who his aunty Catherine was before it all went terribly wrong for her, and I would never want to taint that memory.\u201d Hughes describes the final 11 months of Kenny\u2019s life, when she was living on the streets, as \u201ca whole new level of horror\u201d. She says there is a final reason she didn\u2019t invite her into her home. \u201cCatherine had a dual addiction to alcohol and drugs. There was no way I was ever going to keep her in my house unless I\u2019d locked her in a bedroom. She would never have stayed. She simply would never have stayed.\u201d Kenny had a number of seizures over the following four weeks. On Monday 14 March, she suffered a huge seizure and was hospitalised. The next day, Hughes spent many hours trying to get her into rehab units across Northern Ireland. \u201cI finally get speaking to a girl up in Derry, and I remember it as clear as day. I said: \u2018I need you to take my sister, please help me get my sister better,\u2019 and she said to me: \u2018The soonest I can see your sister is three weeks. If I deem her fit to come in and use our services, then that is what will happen.\u2019 I said: \u2018Well, what would you like me to do with my sister for three weeks?\u2019 She said: \u2018I have no idea, but she can\u2019t come here.\u2019 And my sister died four days later in a stinking, dirty doorway in our capital city. Jesus Christ, where is the humanity in that?\u201d On the Wednesday, Kenny discharged herself from hospital. Three days later, Hughes received a visit from the police in an unmarked squad car. She says she knew in her heart why they were there. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it until the day I take my last breath. Darren said: \u2018This is the knock \u2013 it\u2019s going to change your life.\u2019\u201d She opened the door and was greeted by a tall policeman. \u201cHe says: \u2018There\u2019s no easy way to say this: Catherine was found dead an hour ago.\u2019 And my world came crashing down around me.\u201d It was five weeks since Coulter had been found dead in the same doorway. Hughes says so many people rang her to offer condolences, but she did not answer. She refused to accept her sister had died until her body had been identified. Darren and her brother David went to the morgue. Kenny still had a cannula in her left hand, which obscured the scar she got from burning her hand as a baby. \u201cDavid knew it was her, but he wanted to see the scar. He tried to take the bandage off and the policeman had to restrain him. He was like: \u2018I need to see the scar, you need to show me the scar.\u2019\u201d Sure enough, he got to see the scar. * * * Hundreds of people attended Kenny\u2019s funeral. The service card contains a poem. It is a tender, raw and unblinking account of Kenny\u2019s curtailed life, written in the first person. It was Darren who wrote the poem, on the day he and Hughes discovered she had died. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever written a poem in his life,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI read it at the service and, honestly, you could have heard a pin drop.\u201d The poem contains the lines: I\u2019ll always be that feather on your ground, I\u2019ll be everywhere you go. Hughes now has a feather tattooed on her back, along with the words: \u201cI\u2019ll be everywhere you go.\u201d Before her sister\u2019s death, Hughes\u2019s own life was in chaos, but it was a chaos on which she thrived. \u201cWhen Catherine died, I was so lost,\u201d she says. Hughes had been \u201cat the top of my game\u201d, working as a sales rep in the plumbing and heating industry. After Kenny died, she gave up her job. \u201cI couldn\u2019t function without Catherine. I became an introvert. I didn\u2019t want to deal with anybody outside of my own four walls, and I mean nobody. People wanted to talk about it, people wanted to express their sympathies. But nobody got a piece of me.\u201d Hughes felt she had lost her sense of purpose. \u201cI battled every day with Catherine and her addictions for 16 years of her life, from when she was 16 till she was 32 and took her last breath. My life was consumed by her. But that was my choice to remain involved, to try to champion her, encourage her, to tell her she was worth more than she believed she was worth.\u201d Hughes is aware there were people who asked why she bothered. But she knows exactly why \u2013 because she was her sister, because she had promised their mother on her deathbed that she would look after her, because she loved Catherine. Three years on, she has started remaking her world. She has got a new job \u2013 as a buyer, rather than a salesperson. She has raised thousands of pounds for the Welcome and made it her mission to highlight the homelessness crisis in Northern Ireland \u2013 to make sure that her sister did not die for nothing. Finally, she says, she is beginning to come to terms with her death. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever experienced the loss of someone, when you get that pain in your heart and that lump in your throat and you can\u2019t take a deep breath. I suffered that for two years \u2013 two years solid \u2013 before I could actually take a breath.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m 22 years old, and this is my last letter,\u201d the young man begins. Most of his face is masked with black fabric; only his eyes, tired and steely, are visible below a messy fringe. \u201cI\u2019m worried that I will die and won\u2019t see you any more,\u201d he continues, his hands trembling. \u201cBut I can\u2019t not take to the streets.\u201d The nameless demonstrator \u2013 one of many in Hong Kong who have been writing to their loved ones before heading out to confront rising police violence in the city \u2013 was filmed by the New York Times last week in an anonymous stairwell. But he could be almost anywhere, and not only because the walls behind him are white and characterless, left blank to protect his identity. From east Asia to Latin America, northern Europe to the Middle East, there are young people gathering in stairwells, back alleys and basements whose faces display a similar blend of exhilaration and exhaustion. \u201cThe disaster of \u2018chaos in Hong Kong\u2019 has already hit the western world,\u201d the former Chinese diplomat Wang Zhen declared in an official Communist party paper, following reports that protesters in Catalonia were being inspired by their counterparts in Hong Kong. \u201cWe can expect that other countries and cities may be struck by this deluge.\u201d Wang is right about the deluge. In the same week that those seeking independence from Spain occupied Barcelona airport and brought motorways to a standstill, Extinction Rebellion activists seized major bridges and squares across London, prompting nearly 2,000 arrests. Both mobilisations adopted tactics from Hong Kong, including fluid targets \u2013 inspired by Bruce Lee\u2019s famous \u201cbe water\u201c mantra \u2013 and a repertoire of hand signals to outwit security forces. Meanwhile Lebanon has been convulsed by its largest demonstrations in two decades, dozens have been killed during anti-government marches in Iraq, and in Egypt a blanket ban on dissent by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi\u2019s brutal dictatorship failed to prevent sporadic anti-regime protests breaking out across the country late last month. In the Americas, where Wang once served as a Chinese government envoy, Ecuador, Chile and Haiti are all experiencing citizen uprisings that are virtually unprecedented in recent history, ushering vast numbers of people into the streets \u2013 as well as soldiers tasked with containing them. Each of these upheavals has its own spark \u2013 a hike in transport fares in Santiago, or a proposed tax on users of messaging apps like WhatsApp in Beirut \u2013 and each involves different patterns of governance and resistance. The class composition of the indigenous demonstrators in Ecuador can\u2019t be compared with most of those marching against the imprisonment of separatist leaders in Catalonia; nor is the state\u2019s prohibition of protest in London on a par with the repression in Hong Kong, where officers shot live ammunition into a teenager\u2019s chest. And yet it\u2019s clear that we are witnessing the biggest surge in global protest activity since the early 2010s, when a \u201cmovement of the squares\u201d saw mass rallies in capital cities across the Arab world, followed by Occupy demonstrations in the global north. Historically speaking, the past decade has seen more protests than at any time since the 1960s. Despite their disparate grievances, some common threads do bind today\u2019s rebellions together.

One direct impact of the crash has been a rapid diminishment of opportunity for millions of young people in rich countries \u2013 who now regard precarious work and rising inequality as the norm.

      "body": "<p>The trouble with getting into a rat race, the American comedian Jackie Gleason once said, is that even if you win you\u2019re still a rat.</p> <p>Influential people in the UK are cheerleading for a \u201cSingapore on the Thames\u201d economic model after Brexit: a strategy to win the great global race to attract financial capital by lowering taxes, loosening regulations and turning a blind eye to the world\u2019s dirty money. Britain is already, on some measures, the biggest player in the global tax haven game. A spider\u2019s web of satellite havens, from the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to Jersey, captures wealth from around the world, polishes it and feeds it to the City of London. The world\u2019s best known independent rankings of tax havens by importance \u2013 the Tax Justice Network\u2019s financial secrecy index and its sister publication, the corporate tax haven index \u2013 both show that the UK, considered together with its satellites, is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/28/uk-and-territories-are-greatest-enabler-of-tax-avoidance-study-says\" title=\"\">biggest player in the offshore world</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need a revolutionary overhaul \u2013 first we must overthrow an ideology, one that is sometimes called 'competitiveness'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.transparency.org.uk/uk-businesses-helping-worlds-corrupt-embed-themselves-british-establishment/\" title=\"\">report from Transparency International</a>, provides the latest evidence of the devastation Britain\u2019s offshore spider\u2019s web causes globally. It tots up \u00a3325bn of funds \u201cdiverted by rigged procurement, bribery, embezzlement and the unlawful acquisition of state assets\u201d, from more than 100 countries \u2013 mostly in Africa, the former Soviet Union, Latin America and Asia. The financial criminals include a kingpin of a multibillion-pound scam to loot Malaysia, and a jailed former Moldovan prime minister. \u201cPeppered throughout most major cases of bribery, embezzlement and rigged procurement,\u201d says Transparency International, \u201cyou will find a UK nexus.\u201d</p> <p>But here\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t disagree with the report\u2019s recommendations: open up crime-infested corporate registries in the UK and its offshore territories (some limited progress is evident here, after sustained campaigning); get businesses to apply \u201cethical principles\u201d, improve oversight and enforcement, and create credible deterrents for bosses of all those crime-dealing City firms.</p> <p>Fine. But this report reminds us just how little progress we\u2019ve made, and how widely and deeply the rot has spread. The world\u2019s crooks find accomplices in our purveyors of private jets and yachts, our estate agents, the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, globe-striding banks, schools, universities, football clubs, thinktanks and newspapers \u2013 and, of course, across our political establishment.</p> <p>We need a complete, revolutionary overhaul. Yet if we want to take on this giant network of vested interests, we must first overthrow an ideology: something that sometimes gets called \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d.</p> <p>On the one hand, most British voters hate it when poor countries get looted, and hate being tainted by dirty money. On the other hand, though, we like the dirty money that flows in. Crackdowns may help others abroad, people fret, but they may make us less competitive, ultimately hurting us. And, they also worry, if we stop doing these bad things, someone else will. This ideology is a recipe for inaction. But there is now a way to change this record. A new tune is being played by two unlikely saviours: the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers\u2019 bank. Since 2012, they have spearheaded a growing body of academic research known as <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/Too-Much-Finance-26011\" title=\"\">Too Much Finance?</a> \u2013 a foundation of what I call the \u201cfinance curse\u201d.</p> <p>Study after study now finds a nonlinear relationship between the size of a country\u2019s financial sector and its long-term economic growth. Every nation needs banking and finance, but only up to the point where it provides all the useful services the country needs: taking deposits, lending, handling business payments and so on.

      "bodyText": "The trouble with getting into a rat race, the American comedian Jackie Gleason once said, is that even if you win you\u2019re still a rat. Influential people in the UK are cheerleading for a \u201cSingapore on the Thames\u201d economic model after Brexit: a strategy to win the great global race to attract financial capital by lowering taxes, loosening regulations and turning a blind eye to the world\u2019s dirty money. Britain is already, on some measures, the biggest player in the global tax haven game. A spider\u2019s web of satellite havens, from the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands to Jersey, captures wealth from around the world, polishes it and feeds it to the City of London. The world\u2019s best known independent rankings of tax havens by importance \u2013 the Tax Justice Network\u2019s financial secrecy index and its sister publication, the corporate tax haven index \u2013 both show that the UK, considered together with its satellites, is the biggest player in the offshore world. A new report from Transparency International, provides the latest evidence of the devastation Britain\u2019s offshore spider\u2019s web causes globally. It tots up \u00a3325bn of funds \u201cdiverted by rigged procurement, bribery, embezzlement and the unlawful acquisition of state assets\u201d, from more than 100 countries \u2013 mostly in Africa, the former Soviet Union, Latin America and Asia. The financial criminals include a kingpin of a multibillion-pound scam to loot Malaysia, and a jailed former Moldovan prime minister. \u201cPeppered throughout most major cases of bribery, embezzlement and rigged procurement,\u201d says Transparency International, \u201cyou will find a UK nexus.\u201d But here\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t disagree with the report\u2019s recommendations: open up crime-infested corporate registries in the UK and its offshore territories (some limited progress is evident here, after sustained campaigning); get businesses to apply \u201cethical principles\u201d, improve oversight and enforcement, and create credible deterrents for bosses of all those crime-dealing City firms. Fine. But this report reminds us just how little progress we\u2019ve made, and how widely and deeply the rot has spread. The world\u2019s crooks find accomplices in our purveyors of private jets and yachts, our estate agents, the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, globe-striding banks, schools, universities, football clubs, thinktanks and newspapers \u2013 and, of course, across our political establishment. We need a complete, revolutionary overhaul. Yet if we want to take on this giant network of vested interests, we must first overthrow an ideology: something that sometimes gets called \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d. On the one hand, most British voters hate it when poor countries get looted, and hate being tainted by dirty money. On the other hand, though, we like the dirty money that flows in. Crackdowns may help others abroad, people fret, but they may make us less competitive, ultimately hurting us. And, they also worry, if we stop doing these bad things, someone else will. This ideology is a recipe for inaction. But there is now a way to change this record. A new tune is being played by two unlikely saviours: the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers\u2019 bank. Since 2012, they have spearheaded a growing body of academic research known as Too Much Finance? \u2013 a foundation of what I call the \u201cfinance curse\u201d. Study after study now finds a nonlinear relationship between the size of a country\u2019s financial sector and its long-term economic growth. Every nation needs banking and finance, but only up to the point where it provides all the useful services the country needs: taking deposits, lending, handling business payments and so on. But once finance expands beyond this ideal size and the aforementioned roles \u2013 the City of London passed this point long ago \u2013 it turns nasty. It reduces economic growth, boosts inequality, distorts the economy and curbs entrepreneurialism and productivity (the UK\u2019s is about 10% below France\u2019s or Germany\u2019s, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). A study by Sheffield University last year estimated that the UK had lost a cumulative \u00a34.5tn in income between 1995 and 2015 due to the City\u2019s bloated size. The reasons for this \u201ccurse\u201d are many but include a drain of talented people into highly paid City jobs from other parts of the economy and from government. People who might have devised cures for Alzheimer\u2019s or led a dynamic, forward-looking political party into power instead get rich as wealth managers to Kazakh oligarchs. As finance grows, its collective attention turns away from useful activities that help support the creation of wealth towards often more profitable activities extracting it \u2013 from other parts of the economy, from the environment and from foreigners. Oversized finance also delivers crippling financial crises. Foreign dirty money flowing into British real estate helps the one-percenters prosper but hurts the UK overall: not just for the reasons above, but by inflating property prices, pushing millions down or off the property ladder, or deeper into mortgage debt. In short, too much finance makes us poorer. The implications of understanding the finance curse are hopeful \u2013 and immense. Growing the City of London by making it more competitive is exactly the wrong goal for us to be pursuing. To prosper, we must shrink it, down to its economy-supporting core. How? One way is to deliberately deter harmful financial inflows through \u201csmart capital controls\u201d. I don\u2019t mean blocking financial flows at the border: I mean by doing the right thing. Tax billionaires and multinationals effectively, crack down properly on all those who take crooked money from overseas, and implement radical, widespread transparency. In short, the opposite of a tax-haven strategy. Not only will this curb corruption in poorer countries, but the finance curse analysis shows it will make the UK better off overall.

It requires federal agencies to \u201censure that water users\u2019 private property rights are not encumbered when they attempt to secure permits to operate on public lands.\u201d</p> <p>Former Forest Service special uses leader Gary Earney administered Nestl\u00e9\u2019s water permit between 1984 and 2007 and is now one of its most vocal critics.</p> <p>During that time, he witnessed \u201cdevastating\u201d Forest Service budget cuts that made it impossible to monitor Nestle\u2019s activities or properly manage the forest, but Nestl\u00e9 was there to help \u2013 it set up a nonprofit to solicit money for projects. Former San Bernardino national forest supervisor Gene Zimmerman, who left the agency in 2006 to work as a contractor for Nestl\u00e9, admits the company funded government projects in a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XzQd8oFM9Q\">video promoting Nestl\u00e9</a>.</p> <p>Earney said he was once questioned by the FBI over possible corruption after it received a complaint about Nestl\u00e9 pulling water for only a $500 permit fee. Nestl\u00e9 capitalized on a financially weakened Forest Service, Earney said, but he doesn\u2019t believe it rose to the level of corruption: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Nestl\u00e9 had an informal quid pro quo arrangement with the Forest Service \u2013 by that I mean most likely unspoken.\u201d</p> <p>Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Alix Dunn defended the activities. She said it\u2019s important for elected officials \u201cto hear all perspectives when considering complex public policy issues\u201d and added that the company\u2019s generosity was being misrepresented: \u201cOur employees have been empowered to be, and will continue to be, active contributors in the improvement of their local communities.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c0c79bb006c698ca60390a77df4d1ea673e91276\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0c79bb006c698ca60390a77df4d1ea673e91276/0_0_5321_3684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Huff, chairperson of the zoning and planning commission for Osceola Township, stands before Chippewa Creek, shown flowing through a culvert.

A seven-mile system of 4in pipes carries water from it to tanker trucks at the mountain\u2019s base.</p> <p>Lawrence notes the meadow is a green, lush area that bears use as a water source, and the sound of the flowing stream is drowned out by buzzing from mosquitoes \u2013 a sign of a healthy ecosystem.</p> <p>But further up the mountain, the brush is more brown. There are few mosquitoes, insects, amphibians or other wildlife. Earney sees an ecosystem that \u201cshould be much more lush\u201d. Where Nestl\u00e9 sees a healthy environment, conservationists see one struggling.</p> <p>In Fryeburg, the company\u2019s activities dried out wells and depleted the aquifer. It\u2019s proposing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/26/nestle-suwannee-river-ginnie-springs-plan-permit\">pulling 1.1m gallons daily</a> from injured springs feeding the central Florida\u2019s Santa Fe River \u2013 four times what previous bottling companies took. The aquifer is draining because municipalities, agri-business, and bottled water companies are pulling from it, said Robert Knight, director of the Florida Springs Institute.</p> <p>\u201cWhen those springs are dying a death from a thousand cuts, one more cut isn\u2019t going to kill them, but it\u2019s not advisable to take more when they\u2019re showing all sorts of signs of stress,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A Michigan court <a href=\"https://www.mlive.com/news/2016/12/nestle_water_michigan_backstor.html\">ruled in 2003</a> that Nestl\u00e9 was solely responsible for draining the Dead River watershed from which it pulled 400 gallons per minute, or 210m gallons annually. The nine-year legal battle ended in 2009 when Nestl\u00e9 agreed to drastically reduce the amount of water it takes and monitor levels in real time.</p> <p>In Strawberry Creek, the Forest Service is requiring a three-year study of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s impact on the watershed as part of the terms of the five-year permit it issued. \u201cAccusations are simple. Science is tough. We\u2019re doing the science,\u201d Lawrence said.</p> <p>However, Nestl\u00e9 is conducting the study, which won\u2019t be made public. That worries conservationists, partly because it has a history of skewing results in its favor. An independent scientist Nestl\u00e9 hired was caught fabricating data during the 2003 Michigan trial, prompting the judge to issue a scathing opinion labeling him a \u201ccompany man\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b2df1fbbcdaca5490f2c00a08afc92d3062e279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2df1fbbcdaca5490f2c00a08afc92d3062e279/0_0_5402_3581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maryann Borden, 73, speaks emotionally about the effects of Nestl\u00e9 Water\u2019s pumping over the last 15 years in Evart, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maryann Borden, 73, speaks emotionally about the effects of Nestl\u00e9 Water\u2019s pumping over the last 15 years in Evart, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven M Herppich/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018Backstop to protect public waters\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The Dead River case represented a major victory for conservationists. Jim Olson, an attorney who fought it for Evart residents, underscored the water laws\u2019 importance, which he characterized as \u201cthe lynchpin on whether or not there\u2019s privatization of public water\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to be conscious of the legal framework and a subtle shifting toward privatization of water without you knowing it,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The best and last line of defense is the public trust doctrine, Olson said, which he called the \u201cbackstop to protect public waters\u201d. It states that water is a public resource that the government is obligated to protect. In short, water <a href=\"https://legal-planet.org/2014/07/21/groundwater-and-the-public-trust-doctrine-california-style/\">can\u2019t be privatized</a>, as Nestl\u00e9 is moving to do.</p> <p>States\u2019 water laws are all similar gradations of the same principle. In Maine, absolute dominion is a type of law that allows landowners to draw unlimited water from the aquifer below a parcel. \u201cWhoever has the biggest straw can suck out as much water as possible. Even if your neighbors\u2019 well goes dry, you\u2019re not accountable,\u201d Swinton said.</p> <p>Most eastern states allow landowners to bottle water as long as there isn\u2019t \u201cmeasurable diminishment\u201d of water levels and flow, Olson said. He won the 2003 Dead River case by proving Nestl\u00e9 violated that rule. However, the Michigan court of appeals slightly shifted its interpretation of the law to favor Nestl\u00e9. Now, Michigan is closer to California and other western states, which allows landowners to lower water levels as long as downstream neighbors aren\u2019t seriously harmed.</p> <p>It\u2019s likely the Strawberry Creek fight will be settled on that law, though Earney noted that an administration change in 2020 could push the Forest Service in a different direction. Regardless, he said, \u201cit will be a political decision or a technically correct decision\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c[The state] may fold because of political pressure from Nestl\u00e9, or they\u2019ll recognize that Nestl\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have a right to water that they\u2019re taking and do the right thing,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The network of clear streams comprising California\u2019s Strawberry Creek run down the side of a steep, rocky mountain in a national forest two hours east of Los Angeles. Last year Nestl\u00e9 siphoned 45m gallons of pristine spring water from the creek and bottled it under the Arrowhead Water label. Though it\u2019s on federal land, the Swiss bottled water giant paid the US Forest Service and state practically nothing, and it profited handsomely: Nestl\u00e9 Waters\u2019 2018 worldwide sales exceeded $7.8bn. Conservationists say some creek beds in the area are now bone dry and once-gushing springs have been reduced to mere trickles. The Forest Service recently determined Nestl\u00e9\u2019s activities left Strawberry Creek \u201cimpaired\u201d while \u201cthe current water extraction is drying up surface water resources\u201d. Meanwhile, the state is investigating whether Nestl\u00e9 is illegally drawing from Strawberry Creek and in 2017 advised it to \u201cimmediately cease any unauthorized diversions\u201d. Still, a year later, the Forest Service approved a new five-year permit that allows Nestl\u00e9 to continue using federal land to extract water, a decision critics say defies common sense. Strawberry Creek is emblematic of the intense, complex water fights playing out around the nation between Nestl\u00e9, grassroots opposition, and government officials. At stake is control of the nation\u2019s freshwater supply and billions in profits as Nestl\u00e9 bottles America\u2019s water then sells it back in plastic bottles. Those in opposition, such as Amanda Frye, an author and nutritionist, increasingly view Nestl\u00e9 as a corporate villain motivated by \u201cgreed\u201d. \u201cThese are people who just want to make money, but they\u2019ve already dried up the upper Strawberry Creek and they\u2019ve done a lot of damage,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re a foreign corporation taking our natural resources, which makes it even worse.\u201d Critics characterize Nestl\u00e9 as a \u201cpredatory\u201d water company that targets struggling communities with sometimes exaggerated job promises while employing a variety of cheap strategies, like donating to local boy scouts, to win over small town officials who hold the keys to valuable springs. Its spending on lobbying and campaign contributions at the federal and state levels totals in the millions annually, the revolving door between the company and government perpetually turns, and it maintains cozy relationships with federal officials from the Forest Service to Trump administration. Such tactics are partly what\u2019s behind the Forest Service\u2019s Strawberry Creek decision to allow Nestl\u00e9 to pull water from federal land, said Michael O\u2019Heaney, director of the Berkeley-based environmental group Story of Stuff Project, which has sued to stop Nestl\u00e9. \u201cYou have Nestl\u00e9 spouting this idea of shared benefits and \u2018We\u2019re in it for the communities\u2019, but when you see the way they operate on the ground \u2013 they\u2019re very skilled at cozying up with legislators, state officials \u2026 and getting their way,\u201d he said. Nestl\u00e9 Waters, which owns 51 brands including Ice Mountain, Poland Spring, and Zephyrhills, sees a much different reality. It presents itself as a responsible steward of America\u2019s water and an eco-friendly \u201chealthy hydration\u201d company aiming to save the world\u2019s freshwater supply. It calls itself a job creator that invests heavily in local municipalities and says it bottles a minuscule amount of the nation\u2019s water. Nestl\u00e9 resource manager Larry Lawrence insists the company obtained the right to Strawberry Creek\u2019s when it purchased Arrowhead, and says its science backs claims that it draws water \u201csustainably\u201d. \u201cThe argument that there should be some flowing stream bed [in upper Strawberry Creek] \u2013 we don\u2019t necessarily believe that and that\u2019s what we\u2019re testing for,\u201d Lawrence said. Ultimately, the debate\u2019s particulars lead back to a question at the heart of issue: should water be commodified and sold by private industry, or is it a basic human right? Former Nestl\u00e9 chief executive and chairman Peter Brabeck labeled the latter viewpoint \u201cextreme\u201d and called water a \u201cgrocery product\u201d that should \u201chave a market value\u201d. He later amended that, arguing 25 liters of water daily is a \u201chuman right\u201d, but water used to fill a pool or wash a car shouldn\u2019t be free. At its current pace, the world will run out of freshwater before oil, Brabeck said, and he suggests privatization is the answer. While conservationists agree that pool water could be subjected to fees, Nisha Swinton, senior organizer at the Food and Water Watch environmental group, says the public \u2013 not a company that \u201chas to appease their stockholders and make money on privatizing water\u201d \u2013 should be responsible for that. \u201cThis is not an issue for a multinational corporation to have control over \u2013 this is an issue for the public to hang on to and protect as their own,\u201d she said. \u2018Quid pro quo arrangement\u2019 The source of America\u2019s corporate water crisis can be traced back to 1976 when Perrier, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, opened an office in New York. By 2016, bottled water sales had surpassed soda as the largest US beverage category, with Americans consuming 12.8bn gallons that year. Last year, Nestl\u00e9 Waters\u2019 North American sales were worth $4.5bn. As sales have grown, so has opposition. From California to Maine, residents and environmentalists are increasingly worried about Nestl\u00e9\u2019s impact. In Fryeburg, Maine, resident Nickie Sekera says the small former timber town\u2019s fire department once offered a spigot from which residents could draw free water if a well ran dry or another problem necessitated it. The fire department, however, replaced the spigot with free bottles of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Poland Spring water. Though it\u2019s a relatively minor change, Sekera said the symbolism is strong: \u201cIt speaks \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d Some Fryeburg residents have been attempting to dislodge Nestl\u00e9 since the early 2000s. Several rounds of fights have played out at the ballot box and state court system \u2013 Nestl\u00e9 won most. In a recent legal challenge that went to the Maine supreme court, justices upheld a deal allowing Nestl\u00e9 to pull between 75m and 220m gallons annually from a Fryeburg well for 45 years. As part of its comprehensive Fryeburg public relations campaign, Nestl\u00e9 presents itself as longtime Maine label Poland Springs, which it acquired in 1992, instead of a Swiss multinational, Sekera said. It donated to the local boy scouts, bought the high school ski team new ski equipment, and sponsored a fair, among other small acts. In April, before a Maine legislature committee vote on new protections for state water, Nestl\u00e9 launched an approximately $1m Facebook ad blitz targeting the region. Meanwhile, Maine\u2019s regulatory apparatus is stacked with former Nestl\u00e9 employees or contractors. The Maine Public Utilities Commission was set to rule on the Fryeburg water deal in 2013 when it was revealed the three commissioners considering the case included a former Nestl\u00e9 lobbyist, attorney, and consultant. Former governor Paul LePage last year appointed a Nestl\u00e9 manager to the state\u2019s environmental protection board, while former Nestl\u00e9 lobbyist Patricia Aho previously ran the state\u2019s department of environmental protection. According to Food and Water Watch, Nestl\u00e9 or its lobbyists donated $634,000 to Maine politicians between 2001 and 2012. \u201cThey\u2019re in bed together,\u201d Swinton said. Such strategies are part of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s playbook. In Michigan, where the company is pumping 1,100 gallons per minute across several wells, it paid for new ambulances and fireworks for economically struggling communities. Evart public schools\u2019 superintendent Howard Hyde said in 2005 that he was \u201ctickled\u201d by Nestl\u00e9 funding new baseball diamonds for the district\u2019s baseball team. \u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas. Our current fields are pretty nice, but these are going to be better,\u201d he added. Anger boiled over in 2017 as residents in nearby Flint paid much higher rates for tainted water than Nestl\u00e9 did for clean water, and Detroit carried out mass water shut offs as its poorest residents got behind on bills. In response, Nestl\u00e9 donated bottled water to Flint. In Oregon and Pennsylvania, local officials resigned following revelations they and Nestl\u00e9 worked in secret to attempt to push through unpopular water deals. Nestl\u00e9 scrapped its Pennsylvania plans while residents in Hood River, Oregon, voted out the company. It funneled $105,000 into a local political action committee ahead of the election. At the national level, former agriculture secretary Ann Veneman serves on Nestl\u00e9\u2019s board, and documents Story of Stuff obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show the Forest Service chief is closely monitoring Strawberry Creek. Meanwhile, the FDA in 2017 determined Nestl\u00e9 was partly bottling groundwater \u2013 not spring water \u2013 in Strawberry Creek. The FDA abruptly reversed its position several months later after a former FDA regulator representing Nestl\u00e9 went to the company. Nestl\u00e9 is now fighting a lawsuit that alleges it is selling what is technically groundwater, which is different than spring water, and generally less desirable. The Forest Service\u2019s Strawberry Creek permit decision references a 2017 Trump executive order that seems to speak to the controversy. It requires federal agencies to \u201censure that water users\u2019 private property rights are not encumbered when they attempt to secure permits to operate on public lands.\u201d Former Forest Service special uses leader Gary Earney administered Nestl\u00e9\u2019s water permit between 1984 and 2007 and is now one of its most vocal critics. During that time, he witnessed \u201cdevastating\u201d Forest Service budget cuts that made it impossible to monitor Nestle\u2019s activities or properly manage the forest, but Nestl\u00e9 was there to help \u2013 it set up a nonprofit to solicit money for projects. Former San Bernardino national forest supervisor Gene Zimmerman, who left the agency in 2006 to work as a contractor for Nestl\u00e9, admits the company funded government projects in a 2015 video promoting Nestl\u00e9. Earney said he was once questioned by the FBI over possible corruption after it received a complaint about Nestl\u00e9 pulling water for only a $500 permit fee. Nestl\u00e9 capitalized on a financially weakened Forest Service, Earney said, but he doesn\u2019t believe it rose to the level of corruption: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Nestl\u00e9 had an informal quid pro quo arrangement with the Forest Service \u2013 by that I mean most likely unspoken.\u201d Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson Alix Dunn defended the activities. She said it\u2019s important for elected officials \u201cto hear all perspectives when considering complex public policy issues\u201d and added that the company\u2019s generosity was being misrepresented: \u201cOur employees have been empowered to be, and will continue to be, active contributors in the improvement of their local communities.\u201d Draining aquifers Partway up a brush-covered Strawberry Creek mountain is an area Lawrence calls \u201cthe meadow\u201d that holds Nestl\u00e9 wells. A seven-mile system of 4in pipes carries water from it to tanker trucks at the mountain\u2019s base. Lawrence notes the meadow is a green, lush area that bears use as a water source, and the sound of the flowing stream is drowned out by buzzing from mosquitoes \u2013 a sign of a healthy ecosystem. But further up the mountain, the brush is more brown. There are few mosquitoes, insects, amphibians or other wildlife. Earney sees an ecosystem that \u201cshould be much more lush\u201d. Where Nestl\u00e9 sees a healthy environment, conservationists see one struggling. In Fryeburg, the company\u2019s activities dried out wells and depleted the aquifer. It\u2019s proposing pulling 1.1m gallons daily from injured springs feeding the central Florida\u2019s Santa Fe River \u2013 four times what previous bottling companies took. The aquifer is draining because municipalities, agri-business, and bottled water companies are pulling from it, said Robert Knight, director of the Florida Springs Institute. \u201cWhen those springs are dying a death from a thousand cuts, one more cut isn\u2019t going to kill them, but it\u2019s not advisable to take more when they\u2019re showing all sorts of signs of stress,\u201d he said. A Michigan court ruled in 2003 that Nestl\u00e9 was solely responsible for draining the Dead River watershed from which it pulled 400 gallons per minute, or 210m gallons annually. The nine-year legal battle ended in 2009 when Nestl\u00e9 agreed to drastically reduce the amount of water it takes and monitor levels in real time. In Strawberry Creek, the Forest Service is requiring a three-year study of Nestl\u00e9\u2019s impact on the watershed as part of the terms of the five-year permit it issued. \u201cAccusations are simple. Science is tough. We\u2019re doing the science,\u201d Lawrence said. However, Nestl\u00e9 is conducting the study, which won\u2019t be made public. That worries conservationists, partly because it has a history of skewing results in its favor. An independent scientist Nestl\u00e9 hired was caught fabricating data during the 2003 Michigan trial, prompting the judge to issue a scathing opinion labeling him a \u201ccompany man\u201d. \u2018Backstop to protect public waters\u2019 The Dead River case represented a major victory for conservationists. Jim Olson, an attorney who fought it for Evart residents, underscored the water laws\u2019 importance, which he characterized as \u201cthe lynchpin on whether or not there\u2019s privatization of public water\u201d. \u201cYou have to be conscious of the legal framework and a subtle shifting toward privatization of water without you knowing it,\u201d he added. The best and last line of defense is the public trust doctrine, Olson said, which he called the \u201cbackstop to protect public waters\u201d. It states that water is a public resource that the government is obligated to protect. In short, water can\u2019t be privatized, as Nestl\u00e9 is moving to do. States\u2019 water laws are all similar gradations of the same principle. In Maine, absolute dominion is a type of law that allows landowners to draw unlimited water from the aquifer below a parcel. \u201cWhoever has the biggest straw can suck out as much water as possible. Even if your neighbors\u2019 well goes dry, you\u2019re not accountable,\u201d Swinton said. Most eastern states allow landowners to bottle water as long as there isn\u2019t \u201cmeasurable diminishment\u201d of water levels and flow, Olson said. He won the 2003 Dead River case by proving Nestl\u00e9 violated that rule. However, the Michigan court of appeals slightly shifted its interpretation of the law to favor Nestl\u00e9. Now, Michigan is closer to California and other western states, which allows landowners to lower water levels as long as downstream neighbors aren\u2019t seriously harmed. It\u2019s likely the Strawberry Creek fight will be settled on that law, though Earney noted that an administration change in 2020 could push the Forest Service in a different direction. Regardless, he said, \u201cit will be a political decision or a technically correct decision\u201d. \u201c[The state] may fold because of political pressure from Nestl\u00e9, or they\u2019ll recognize that Nestl\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have a right to water that they\u2019re taking and do the right thing,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "When Thomas Swann completed his PhD in 2015, he spent three months applying for 40 different jobs in academia. He was lucky to secure a dream position at Leicester University\u2019s School of Business, but the year-long contract meant it wouldn\u2019t be the end of his job hunt. After three further short-term contracts he is now employed more securely at Loughborough. Swann says his experience of short-term contracts \u201cmakes life frantic because as well as trying to do the best job you can, you\u2019re constantly having to apply for other opportunities,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge amount of time I could be spending on developing teaching or research.\u201d After publication of this article, a university spokesperson described the contract under which Swann has been employed since 2017 as \u201ca permanent \u2018open-ended\u2019 contract\u201d. Swann\u2019s experience is not unusual. The typical academic career involves a sequence of often low-paid, temporary contracts, and according to the University and College Union, many academics now feel at breaking point. Tomorrow a ballot of UCU members will close, possibly leading to strikes in the new year. Its general secretary, Jo Grady, has warned that feelings are running high. According to 2016 research from the union, more than half of all academics are on temporary contracts. This has combined with an erosion of pay in real terms (which the union estimates has fallen by 17% since 2009), rising workloads (staff work an average of more than two unpaid days each week) and a gender pay gap of 15.9%. \u201cPeople are exhausted by it and really want things to change,\u201d says Swann. \u201cStudents are always massively shocked, they assume that during their summer holidays we\u2019re all off on ours but actually, until last week I hadn\u2019t had a day off for two months.\u201d This chimes with the experience of Hannah Boast, a research fellow at Warwick University. She says her first job \u2013 at another university \u2013 after finishing her PhD in English literature was paid at 0.7 of a full-time wage, despite her working more than full time \u2013 a common setup for early-career lecturers. According to UCU, the median hourly rate for a lecturer on a 10-hour week contract is \u00a318.70, but if they are working 20 hours a week (the median from its survey), pay falls to a real hourly rate of \u00a39.35. This is despite lecturers having trained for at least seven years. \u201cBeing early in my career and knowing lots of people in part-time, fixed-term jobs you see lots of people working extremely hard, getting exhausted and burned out \u2013 then leaving the sector,\u201d says Boast. This month\u2019s ballot has the support of the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, who has called for universities to work with staff to address the fact that \u201ca combination of falling pay, rising workloads and increasingly insecure employment is making a career in higher education less sustainable\u201d. Last February, to protest about their pensions, thousands of lecturers and other staff staged a mass walkout in the driving snow, the biggest industrial action ever seen at UK universities. They were largely supported by students, despite stopping teaching and marking for a fortnight. The union succeeded in forcing employers to drop plans to change pensions at universities established before 1992, from defined benefit schemes to the less favourable defined contribution schemes. It is now looking to challenge the size of staff contributions, which it thinks should be capped at 8% of a lecturer\u2019s salary, rather than the 9.6% currently being paid. Grady, who has been touring campuses, says the two issues staff have raised most often are casualisation \u2013 how financial insecurity stops them enjoying their lives and work \u2013 and unsustainable workloads. \u201cPeople are burning out,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d Last year, the union balloted members on strike action over pay but although the majority voted in favour, it didn\u2019t obtain the required 50% voter turnout to move forward.

iron ore fuelled the industrial economies of the 20th century, it is these minerals that will fuel the clean energy economies of the 21st,\u201d Albanese said, pointing to the growing demand for lithium for electric vehicles, batteries and energy storage.</p> <p>But the Labor leader also assured \u201ctraditional industries\u201d that they would benefit from the shift to renewables, saying the demand for metallurgical coal would continue, fuelled by growth in wind energy.</p> <p>Labor has been at pains to reconnect with coal communities since its election defeat, amid concern that blue-collar workers abandoned the party in its traditional stronghold seats.</p> <p>The former leader Bill Shorten has said since the election that he had misread \u201csome of the mood\u201d, particularly in the resources states of Queensland and Western Australia, saying voters saw some of the party\u2019s policies as \u201cbeing green-left, not for the worker, not for working people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt pains me to realise at the last election our presentation meant that some people felt we weren\u2019t putting jobs first and foremost in everything we did,\u201d Shorten said.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said there was a perception that Labor was \u201csending mixed messages on the coal industry\u201d during the campaign, while Fitzgibbon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/04/qa-labor-made-huge-error-in-being-silent-over-coal-joel-fitzgibbon-says\">has said it was a \u201chuge error\u201d for Labor not to talk about coal because of a fear that it would cost city seats</a>.</p> <p>Albanese said that with more than 200 tonnes of metallurgical coal required to produce one wind turbine, growth in global wind generation over the next decade could see Australia exporting 15.5 million tonnes of coking coal to build turbines.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the equivalent of three years output from the Moranbah North coking coal mine in Queensland,\u201d Albanese said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

      "bodyText": "Labor leader Anthony Albanese has pledged to tackle skills shortages and industrial relations reform if he wins government, as he seeks to reposition the party\u2019s proposed action on climate change as a new jobs \u201crevolution\u201d. In the first of a series of vision statements aimed at resetting Labor\u2019s policy agenda following the May election, the opposition leader has outlined the party\u2019s jobs and skills agenda in a speech in Perth on Tuesday. Saying the party is \u201cproudly and resolutely pro-growth\u201d, Albanese has flagged the potential of clean energy jobs for a new manufacturing boom, while also emphasising the need to do more on skills reform. Labor in government would establish a new national organisation called Jobs and Skills Australia, Albanese said, which would be tasked with driving improved outcomes in the vocational education and training sector and strengthening workplace planning. The agency would be legislated and based on the model of Infrastructure Australia, with its functions including workforce and skills analysis and reviewing the adequacy of the training and vocational education system. \u201cIt will work with business and unions to harness insights from industry to ensure that training is meeting not just today\u2019s needs but to anticipate how work is changing,\u201d Albanese said. He says Australians worried about the future of work, need to be reassured that technological change will unlock new opportunities while still providing economic security. \u201cThe unprecedented pace of change and spread of new technologies are leaving many workers unsettled, and others left out of the labour market altogether.\u201d Albanese said that to restore confidence in the labour market, workers needed to be helped to engage with technology and innovation in \u201can assured manner\u201d, which would require \u201cthe single-minded pursuit of skills\u201d. This would help address a mismatch between what workers have to offer and what employers need, with Albanese highlighting a recent Australian Industry Group survey that three quarters of businesses cannot find the skilled workers they need. \u201cIn short we have a labour market characterised by the mismatch between what workers have to offer, and what employers need,\u201d Albanese said. He criticised the government for issuing half a million visas to foreign workers over the past six years. \u201cInstead, what we should be doing \u2013 wherever possible \u2013 is training Australians for current and future jobs.\u201d On the issue of job security and industrial relations reform, Albanese said the current industrial relations system was being \u201cstrained\u201d by the emergence of new forms of employment arrangements, pointing to the rise of the gig economy as an example. \u201cThese Australians deserve a greater sense of security,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cIt is time to have a conversation about new forms of worker protections, which can be made as flexible as the gig economy jobs they could cover, as well as benefit more traditional industries \u2013 ideas like portable entitlements.\u201d The new skills pledge comes alongside a push by Albanese to recast Labor\u2019s climate policy as part of a new industrial \u201crevolution\u201d, saying the shift to clean energy will underpin an Australian manufacturing boom that unlocks new jobs and export opportunities. \u201cThe world is decarbonising. With the right planning and vision, Australia can not only continue to be an energy exporting superpower, we can also enjoy a new manufacturing boom. This means jobs,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWorking towards a low-carbon future provides the opportunity to revitalise the Australian manufacturing sector \u2013 opportunities that are all about jobs.\u201d The speech comes as Labor MPs jostle over how the party should reposition itself on climate policy after the shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, called for the opposition to abandon its emissions reduction target in favour of the coalition\u2019s less ambitious plan to reduce emissions by 28% on 2005 levels by 2030. Labor had proposed an emissions reduction target of 45% in the same period. In a sign that Albanese wants to maintain the party\u2019s action on climate change as a key point of difference with the coalition, he used Tuesday\u2019s speech to emphasise the benefits of an ambitious emissions reduction policy for jobs in the renewable energy sector. Labelling climate change \u201cone of the greatest challenges that we face today\u201d, Albanese also says that countries which act to harness cheap renewable energy would also be able to transform into \u201cmanufacturing powerhouses\u201d. \u201cWe have the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent, we also have some of the best wind and wave resources and we have some of the best engineers and scientists, breaking the barriers of what is possible with renewable energy,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cAustralia can be the land of cheap and endless energy \u2013 energy that could power generations of metal manufacturing and other energy intensive manufacturing industries.\u201d He points to the potential export opportunities of lithium, rare earths, iron and titanium as the \u201ckey ingredients\u201d of the renewables revolution, saying the minerals would be in high demand in a low-carbon future. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cJust as coal and iron ore fuelled the industrial economies of the 20th century, it is these minerals that will fuel the clean energy economies of the 21st,\u201d Albanese said, pointing to the growing demand for lithium for electric vehicles, batteries and energy storage. But the Labor leader also assured \u201ctraditional industries\u201d that they would benefit from the shift to renewables, saying the demand for metallurgical coal would continue, fuelled by growth in wind energy. Labor has been at pains to reconnect with coal communities since its election defeat, amid concern that blue-collar workers abandoned the party in its traditional stronghold seats. The former leader Bill Shorten has said since the election that he had misread \u201csome of the mood\u201d, particularly in the resources states of Queensland and Western Australia, saying voters saw some of the party\u2019s policies as \u201cbeing green-left, not for the worker, not for working people.\u201d \u201cIt pains me to realise at the last election our presentation meant that some people felt we weren\u2019t putting jobs first and foremost in everything we did,\u201d Shorten said. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said there was a perception that Labor was \u201csending mixed messages on the coal industry\u201d during the campaign, while Fitzgibbon has said it was a \u201chuge error\u201d for Labor not to talk about coal because of a fear that it would cost city seats. Albanese said that with more than 200 tonnes of metallurgical coal required to produce one wind turbine, growth in global wind generation over the next decade could see Australia exporting 15.5 million tonnes of coking coal to build turbines. \u201cThis is the equivalent of three years output from the Moranbah North coking coal mine in Queensland,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cSimply put, the road to a low-carbon future can be paved with hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs, as well as supporting traditional jobs, including coalmining. Labor wants to lead that clean energy revolution.\u201d The first of Albanese\u2019s headland speeches comes as the party braces for the release of a review of the election that is being spearheaded by Jay Weatherill and Craig Emerson to establish what went wrong in its campaign, with climate policy and the party\u2019s position on the Adani coalmine expected to be scrutinised. Albanese has said the review will be a \u201cline in the sand\u201d for the party as it seeks to reassess all of its policies ahead of the next election, due in 2022. Along with the focus on green jobs, Albanese also called for the government to introduce an upgraded investment guarantee, saying it should form part of a \u201cmeasured\u201d economic stimulus package. \u201cA bring-forward of infrastructure investment combined with increased business investment would create jobs in the short term as well as lift productivity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has quietly appointed an expert panel to come up with new ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and given it less than a month to come up with recommendations. In what is being seen by observers as an acknowledgment that its main climate change policy, the $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, is failing to cut national pollution, the government has appointed a panel of four business leaders and policy experts to suggest options to expand it. The panel is headed by Grant King, the outgoing president of the Business Council of Australia and a former chief executive of Origin Energy. It was appointed by the minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, in mid-October but has not been made public. Business sources say the Morrison government, via officials, has been privately sounding out various groups about an overhaul of the fund for months. But stakeholders were taken aback when the King panel approached them to provide detailed comments on options in less than two weeks. A letter from King to interest groups, seen by Guardian Australia, apologises implicitly for the compressed timeframe, acknowledging \u201cit may not be possible to fully consult across your membership before providing your response\u201d. But he argues there will be time for follow-up discussions as a final report is prepared. The letter was sent with a discussion paper headed \u201cExpert panel examining opportunities for further abatement\u201d that critiques and sets out options \u201cto enhance\u201d the fund. The panel has been established despite Morrison and Taylor maintaining they have set out \u201cto the last tonne\u201d of carbon dioxide how Australia will meet the 2030 emissions target announced before the Paris climate conference. In reality, national emissions have risen each year since 2015 and most analyses suggest the government will not reach the goal, a 26%-28% cut below 2005 levels, under current policies. The discussion paper, first reported by Footprint, says the emissions reduction fund has been successful in generating carbon offsets from native vegetation and landfill projects, largely because they cost relatively little and do not require businesses to make substantial operational changes. But it says the scheme has done little to cut emissions through energy efficiency projects and from industry, agriculture and transport, in part due to high upfront and transaction costs. The emissions reduction fund works as a reverse auction, rewarding landowners and businesses that make cheap, viable bids for taxpayers\u2019 support to cut pollution. The most recent auction bought emissions cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia\u2019s annual greenhouse gas pollution after officials found just three projects worth backing. The paper says the government is looking at ways to attract more participants from industry and agricultural businesses. It is also considering new incentives to complement the fund, including partnerships with other tiers of government and the private sector and reconsidering how to best spend \u201cexisting financing resources\u201d. Those resources include an additional $2bn committed to the fund before the election (when the government rebranded it as part of what it calls a climate solutions fund) and money allocated to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Possible emissions reduction options listed include: Changing the scheme known as the safeguard mechanism, which was supposed to limit emissions from big industry but in practice has allowed pollution to increase, so companies that emit less than their limit are awarded carbon credits they could sell to the government or business. Companies now have limits based on emissions intensity (how much they emit for every dollar earned) rather than outright pollution. Offering companies cash to help pay for technology-focused emissions reduction projects that would otherwise struggle to be financially viable. Boosting energy efficiency by giving smaller operators better access to expert advice and providing incentives to reduce energy use in commercial buildings and low-income housing. There is a view among some stakeholders that the Morrison government is trying to pull together a policy reboot before a meeting of energy ministers at the Council of Australian Governments energy council in November. The meeting has been delayed for months because of wrangling among the participants. Guardian Australia revealed in August that the New South Wales government had asked Canberra to provide an alternative to the dumped national energy guarantee. It would see the Morrison government underwrite both new generation to replace the Liddell power station, probably firmed renewables, and new investments in transmission. Energy stakeholders are speculating that some states may also pursue money from the fund to drive abatement . In response to questions about the panel, Taylor said the environment department and expert panel were working together to ensure the $2bn climate solutions fund would deliver the most emissions abatement possible. He said the commonwealth conservatively estimated the fund would deliver at least 103m tonnes of cuts by 2030. \u201cThis is a minimum target, not a cap,\u201d he said. Interest groups were asked to give quick feedback last week before the panel submits advice to Taylor next month. The other panel members are Susie Smith, chief executive of the Australian Industry Greenhouse Network, Prof Andrew Macintosh, head of the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, and David Parker, the Clean Energy Regulator chairman. The fund has faced consistent criticism since it replaced the Gillard-era carbon pricing scheme. A Guardian Australia investigation found while the type of vegetation projects it supports were worthwhile it was often difficult to know what taxpayers were getting for their money. There have been problems with how emissions cuts from some projects have been calculated and some methodologies have paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have supported fossil fuel projects. The government has also been criticised for planning to reduce the difficulty of meeting its 2030 target by using what are known as \u201ccarryover credits\u201d, which it has claimed for Australia surpassing the targets it set under the Kyoto protocol (an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2012, and a 5% reduction between 2000 and 2020). The environment department has conceded it is not aware of any other country planning to use carryover credits to meet a target under the Paris agreement.",

      "bodyText": "Tanzania\u2019s president John Magufuli is presiding over an escalating campaign of repression that has targeted journalists, human rights defenders and political opponents ahead of his plans to run for re-election next year, two reports claim. Magufuli \u2013 nicknamed \u201cthe Bulldozer\u201d \u2013 is accused in two independent reports, by the human rights organisations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, of presiding over rising levels of abuses against activists and opponents since his election in 2015. The two reports paint a chilling picture of Tanzanian rights under assault, beginning with Magufuli\u2019s announcement in July 2016 of a blanket ban on political activities until 2020, which critics say has been used to target opposition parties and justify politically motivated trials. Amnesty cites amendments made to the country\u2019s Political Parties Act at the beginning of this year that introduced wide-ranging restrictions on the rights to freedom of association and peaceful assembly. These moves have been accompanied by violence. In 2017, unidentified assailants shot an opposition member of parliament, Tundu Lissu, and in 2018, unidentified assailants killed two officials, Daniel John and Godfrey Luena, of the main opposition party, Chadema. Although police said they are investigating these killings, no arrests have yet been made. In tandem with moves restricting political activity, Tanzania\u2019s media has seen increasing censorship and scrutiny under a new Media Services Act with at least six media outlets suspended for publishing stories about corruption and human rights violations. Beyond suspension and threats, journalists in Tanzania have also faced arbitrary arrests and prosecutions. In one extreme case, journalist Azory Gwanda disappeared under mysterious circumstances in November 2017. In one of the most high-profile cases earlier this year, police arrested investigative reporter Erick Kabendera. Public statements suggested he had been questioned about the validity of his Tanzanian nationality and later interrogated for alleged sedition and publication of false information in an Economist article he wrote. \u201cAs President Magufuli marks four years in office next month, he must carefully reflect on his government\u2019s record of ruthlessly disemboweling the country\u2019s human rights framework,\u201d said Roland Ebole, Amnesty International\u2019s Tanzania researcher. \u201cHis government must repeal all oppressive laws being used to clamp down on dissent, and urgently end human rights violations and abuses.\u201d Oryem Nyeko, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, added: \u201cTanzania should show true commitment to protecting and fulfilling the rights to freedom of expression and association. The authorities need to put a stop to harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrests of activists, journalists and opposition members.\u201d Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch found that Tanzanian authorities had undermined the rights to freedom of expression and media freedom by enforcing repressive new and existing laws and regulations governing the media, NGOs and political parties. The reports were researched and documented separately, but their findings were similar. Just days after taking office in late 2015, Magufuli cancelled the symbolic independence day fete and used funds for the event to widen a part of a highway notorious for gridlocks in Dar es Salaam. He also fired a number of senior government figures in an anti-corruption crusade. The moves were initially well received. Fast forward to 2019 and opinion about him and his regime is more divided. Magufuli, who is leader of the ruling Party of the Revolution (Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or CCM) earned his nickname while public works minister, when he removed thousands of ghost workers from the payroll and purged incompetent civil servants. Since becoming president he has acquired a reputation for authoritarian and peremptory announcements which have caused friction with international organisations. This includes the World Health Organization, which was refused data over a suspected case of the deadly ebola virus earlier this year. Earlier this month he publicly backed an official who sparked outrage and violated the country\u2019s rules by beating more than a dozen students with a stick. Magufuli urged parents and school teachers to do the same in order to build a disciplined nation.",

      "bodyText": "South Korea is intensifying its campaign to ban the Japanese \u201crising sun\u201d flag from being displayed at next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, in the latest diplomatic row linked to the countries\u2019 bitter wartime history. In September, South Korea\u2019s sports ministry asked the International Olympic Committee [IOC] to ban the flag \u2013 regarded by many Koreans as a symbol of Japanese militarism and colonial rule. But having failed to secure a commitment from the IOC, South Korean MPs recently adopted a resolution calling for a ban on the use of the flag at the Olympics, describing it as akin to the Nazi swastika. In September, South Korean media quoted An Min-suk, an MP in the ruling Democratic party, as saying: \u201cA flag symbolising war is not suitable for peaceful Olympic Games. \u201cThe rising run flag is akin to a symbol of the devil to Asians and Koreans, just like how the swastika is a symbol of Nazis which reminds Europeans of invasion and horror,\u201d he reportedly said. Tokyo Olympic organisers said they had no plans to restrict public use of the flag during the Games, noting that it was widely used in Japan and claiming it did not have any political connotations. The kyokujitsuki flag, used by Japanese imperial navy in campaigns around Asia and the Pacific before and during the second world war, features a red disc and 16 rays extending outwards, and was adopted by the maritime self-defence forces in 1954. Japan\u2019s foreign ministry said this week it would update its explanation of the flag in response to South Korea\u2019s campaign. The ministry\u2019s website currently describes it as an integral part of Japanese culture, adding that it is \u201cwidely accepted in the international community\u201d. The row comes amid a dramatic deterioration in ties between the north-east Asian neighbours. The dispute began after a South Korean supreme court ruling last year ordering Japanese companies to compensate Koreans forced to work in Japanese mines and factories when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony. Japan insists that all compensation claims were settled by a postwar peace treaty. The court ruling triggered a trade spat that has since spread to tourism and, now, the Tokyo Olympics. Japanese athletes have long been identified by their national flag the Hinomaru \u2013 a red disc on a white background \u2013 but South Koreans have voiced concern that spectators will display the rising sun at event venues next summer. This is not the first time that conflicting narratives of the flag\u2019s historical significance have affected bilateral relations. Last year, Japan pulled out of an international fleet review hosted by South Korea after Seoul insisted that the ensign be removed from its vessels. Japan withdrew an invitation to South Korea to take part in a similar naval event this month, with Tokyo acknowledging that the countries had yet to \u201ccreate an environment that is sufficient\u201d to invite South Korean ships. Originally flown by feudal warlords, the rising sun symbol was adopted by the Japanese imperial army in 1870 and became the navy ensign in 1889. While it is commonly used by Japanese far-right activists, it is also used on commercial products and is the corporate logo of the liberal Asahi newspaper.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has promised a review of national environmental laws will \u201ctackle green tape\u201d and reduce delays in project approvals that it said costs the economy about $300m a year. Hundreds of scientists have asked the government to use a legally required review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) to strengthen the legislation so it could be used to stem a worsening extinction crisis. Announcing the review on Tuesday, Sussan Ley, the federal environment minister, emphasised the government\u2019s goal was to deliver greater certainty to business groups, farmers and environment organisations. The review, a once-a-decade examination required under the 1999 act and expected to take a year, is headed by Graeme Samuel, a businessman, Monash University professorial fellow and former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Ley said the review was not about ideology, and all sides in environment debates agreed complexities in the act were leading to unnecessary delays in reaching decisions about development proposals. \u201cThe act has been a world benchmark in environmental protection but needs to be adapted to changes in the environment and economy,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve asked Professor Samuel to look at how we can improve efficiency and make clear and simple decisions that deliver strong, clear and focused environmental protection.\u201d Samuel said he came to the review as \u201ca clean skin\u201d and the review would aim to consult \u201cevery person in Australia who has an interest in the environment and in the issues of regulation\u201d. \u201cI come with a clean sheet of paper, I have no preconceived views,\u201d he said. The expert panel working alongside Samuel is: Wendy Craik, the chair of the Climate Change Authority and a former National Farmers\u2019 Federation chief; Erica Smyth, a geologist with decades of experience in the minerals and petroleum industry; Bruce Martin, a Wik Ngathan man and community leader from Cape York peninsula; Andrew Macintosh, an environmental law and policy expert at the Australian National University. Environment groups noted the panel did not include anyone with a history of working to save endangered species. Craik previously headed a review of how conservation laws could better serve the agriculture industry that was completed earlier this year. The future of the act was a point of difference at this year\u2019s federal election, which saw a concerted campaign by environment groups for stronger environmental laws that was backed by Labor but rejected by the Coalition. Green groups, academics and lawyers want tougher laws overseen by an independent environment protection authority, but business, minerals industry and farming representatives want the development approval process to be streamlined and fast-tracked. This week more than 240 Australian conservation scientists signed an open letter to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that said Australia\u2019s environment laws were failing because they were too weak, had inadequate review and approval processes and were not overseen by an effective compliance regime. They urged him to lift spending on conservation and back laws to address an extinction crisis under which three native species became extinct in the past decade and could lead to another 17 being lost in the next 20 years. More than 1,800 Australian plants and animals are listed as threatened with extinction. Basha Stasak, a nature campaign manager at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the group looked forward to working with Samuel and the panel to ensure the review left \u201can environmental legacy Australians can take pride in\u201d. She said the review must be seen through the lens of the extinction crisis: \u201cIn that light, we are disappointed the review panel does not include a conservation scientist.\u201d Suzanne Milthorpe, from the Wilderness Society, agreed. \u201cWe are concerned that the government has overlooked the vast level of scientific and practical conservation experience available by not appointing ecologists or conservation practitioners to the expert panel,\u201d she said. Andrew McConville, chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said the oil and gas industry believed there did not need to be a trade-off between environmental outcomes and economic growth. \u201c[The association] supports the consideration of reducing regulatory burden while delivering equivalent or enhanced levels of environmental protection,\u201d he said. Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, urged the government must use the review to restore community and industry confidence in environmental processes, and linked delays in approval decisions to environment department budget cuts. Greens environment spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said Ley was in denial about the extinction crisis and accused her of planning to use the review to water down the laws to favour of miners and developers. A Guardian investigation last year found most campaigners and political veterans believed environmental protection was harder to win in Australia than at any time since before the wave of landmark 1980s decisions to save Tasmania\u2019s Franklin river, recognise the Daintree rainforest and Kakadu national park and block mining in Antarctica. Some described the EPBC Act as legislation designed to manage developments, not protect the environment. Less than 40% of nationally listed threatened species had recovery plans in place to secure their long-term survival. The federal environment department admitted earlier this year it did not know whether the recovery plans that were in place were being implemented. Conservation groups found spending on environment department programs has been cut by nearly 40% since the Coalition was elected in 2013. A United Nations global assessment released in May found biodiversity across the planet was declining at an unprecedented rate, with 1m species across the globe at risk of extinction and human populations in jeopardy if the trajectory was not reversed. Ley said Samuel would release a discussion paper in November before meeting interest groups. The government has set up a dedicated website for the review here.",

The anticipated testimony before congressional investigators by Alexander Vindman, an army lieutenant colonel who was decorated with a Purple Heart after being wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq, could weigh heavily in the impeachment inquiry against Trump. Vindman\u2019s planned opening testimony, describing what he felt was a shocking swerve of US policy toward Ukraine, was published late Monday by CNN and excerpted by the New York Times. The excerpts indicate that Vindman, who planned to testify in defiance of a White House gag order, was prepared to corroborate previous, damning testimony that the Trump administration mounted a campaign to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation of Joe Biden, in exchange for military aid and a possible White House visit. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the US government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d said Vindman\u2019s statement as quoted in the Times. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d Burisma is a gas company on whose board Hunter Biden, the former vice-president\u2019s son, served for five years. The White House has denied any such effort to establish a quid pro quo with Ukraine, but against mounting evidence to the contrary Trump\u2019s defenders have argued that the president\u2019s conduct does not rise to the level of impeachment. Vindman, a Ukrainian-American immigrant and the current European affairs director at the national security council, planned to indicate in his testimony that he raised an internal alarm about the shadow US policy toward Ukraine. His opening statement suggested that he might have been one of the White House sources for a whistleblower report that kicked off the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThis would all undermine US national security,\u201d Vindman planned to say of Trumps\u2019s 25 July call with Zelenskiy. The Times report quoted Vindman\u2019s statement further: \u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics. \u201cI did convey certain concerns internally to national security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command.\u201d In keeping with the previous testimony of current and former officials, including the diplomat William Taylor and the Russia expert Fiona Hill, Vindman planned to testify that he was concerned about the role the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was also on the payroll of opaque interests in Ukraine, was playing in crafting US policy towards Ukraine.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission began proceedings against Google in the federal court in New South Wales on Tuesday, alleging it breached the law through a series of on-screen representations made as users set up Google accounts on their Android mobile phones and tablets. The ACCC says when people set up their Google accounts on phones and tablets between January 2017 and late 2018, they would have incorrectly believed that \u201cLocation History\u201d was the only setting that affected whether the company was collecting a user\u2019s location data. In fact, the setting \u201cWeb &amp; App Activity\u201d also had to be switched off if users did not want their location data collected. By default, new Google accounts have location history turned off, while web and app activity is turned on. If the latter remained switched on, however, the company continued to collect personal information including the user\u2019s location through the app. \u201cWe allege that as a result of these on-screen representations, Google has collected, kept and used highly sensitive and valuable personal information about consumers\u2019 location without them making an informed choice,\u201d the ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said in a statement on Tuesday. The ACCC has argued users were not able to make an informed choice about how to stop Google obtaining and retaining their personal data and location information. A spokesperson for Google said the company was reviewing the allegations and engaging with the ACCC. It is the first major court case launched by the ACCC against one of the tech giants since the release of the report into digital platforms earlier this year. While the government has yet to respond to the recommendations, Sims told the Guardian at the time the regulator had five active investigations under way and would pursue companies such as Facebook and Google using existing consumer and competition laws.",

They are 15 points ahead on this measure and have been that way for many years of good and bad fortune.</p> <p>The risk for the government is that if it clings to the slogan it will prompt the downturn that will cost jobs. That\u2019s the lived experience that will let the opposition back in the game.</p> <p>Perversely, breaking a central election promise could be the government\u2019s only viable political option.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential.

      "bodyText": "In a world where slogans carry surplus meaning, the Morrison government\u2019s promised budget surplus is totemic. If there was a single moment that sparked the dramatic turnaround in Coalition fortunes that culminated in its upset victory it was this confected/projected 2019 federal budget that would get the nation \u201cback in the black\u201d. With the backing of pilfered ACDC riffs, blanket tabloid bouquets, and turbocharged by a multimillion-dollar taxpayer-funded advertising campaign, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, managed to hit reset on a dead government walking. While the surplus was never more than a slogan, it framed the government\u2019s economic credentials and set the scene for a sustained scare campaign on Labor tax \u201cincreases\u201d that became more successful the sillier it got. By election day six weeks later, the status quo was the safe bet, Shorten was the Bill Australia couldn\u2019t afford, and every well-thought through and nuanced social policy that he unveiled became just further proof that Labor couldn\u2019t be trusted with our money. And it all started on budget night when the government solemnly pledged it would deliver a surplus in 2020 \u2013 albeit propped up by an NDIS underspend \u2013 come hell or high water. Of course the government never expected to have to deliver on this promise \u2013 it was salting the fields for the incoming Labor government, creating an unreachable target to condemn their opponents\u2019 economic management when the electorate had done its job. Now six months on they are still in charge and the economy is starting to soften, with the International Monetary Fund downgrading growth projections to just 1.7% and urging the government to provide some economic leadership by using its budget to stimulate the economy. For a government that has built its mandate on slogans and economic snake oil, this is a tough call. The treasurer\u2019s solemn pledge cuts off one of the few levers at his disposal. With close to zero interest rates and flatlining wages, the government doesn\u2019t have many other cards to play.

Collateral damage for stimulus will also be exposing their long-running criticism of Labor\u2019s assured handling of the last global financial crisis. Awkward, yes? But prohibitive, I\u2019m not sure. A second set of questions shows that the public is not ready to blame the government for the current state of affairs. They recognise that with a Trump White House cooking up trade wars with China, there is going to be collateral damage outside any local government\u2019s control. Indeed, fewer than one third of voters give primary responsibility to the government\u2019s economic management. For now. TABLE 2 As I\u2019ve argued before, political reward for economic management isn\u2019t a merit game. We know it takes an incredibly poor conservative government to fall from preferred economic manager. It\u2019s only when the economic story shifts from the macro \u2013 debt and deficits \u2013 to how the economy is operating for individuals through specific life experience \u2013 wages and jobs \u2013 that left-of-centre political parties have a show. What this means is that there is actually very little political reward for Coalition governments delivering a surplus because people expect them to be the better economic manager anyway. They are 15 points ahead on this measure and have been that way for many years of good and bad fortune. The risk for the government is that if it clings to the slogan it will prompt the downturn that will cost jobs. That\u2019s the lived experience that will let the opposition back in the game. Perversely, breaking a central election promise could be the government\u2019s only viable political option. \u2022 Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential.

An unprepared call center resulted in long wait times for customers. </p> \n  <p>PG&amp;E defended the decision to cut power but vowed to improve the process in the future.</p> \n  <p>And yet, despite the massive scale of the preventive blackouts, it appears likely that the utility\u2019s equipment was responsible for sparking three recent fires. <br></p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/PG-E-to-state-2-Lafayette-fires-linked-to-14568505.php#\">San Francisco Chronicle reports</a> that two fires that started Sunday in Lafayette, a community just north-east of Oakland, happened at same location and at roughly the same time as two PG&amp;E electrical malfunctions, according to the reports sent to the California Public Utilities Commission. </p> \n  <p>The news comes less than a week after PG&amp;E acknowledged that its equipment could have played a role in sparking the Kincade fire, currently the state\u2019s largest and a blaze firefighters are still working to contain. In that case, too, a malfunction coincided with the place a fire started.</p> \n  <p>The utility cut off power because live, wind-toppled wires could easily ignite dry vegetation. But in all three recent fires, however, PG&amp;E left the juice running, assuming that the area was at a low risk of fire.</p> \n  <p>The utility is believed to have been responsible for wildfires in 2017 and 2018 and in January filed for bankruptcy protection.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-29T00:41:20.073Z\">at 12.41am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db759a48f08d669cdaae90e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T21:47:56.073Z\">9.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Southern California could see strongest winds this week</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Huge sections of California remain under a red-flag warning as extreme seasonal winds continue to ebb and flow, fanning flames from northern California\u2019s wine country to the state\u2019s border with Mexico. </p> \n  <p>Violent winds over the weekend, which in places topped 100mph, helped double the size of the Kincade fire that continued burning a path through the state\u2019s wine country. </p> \n  <p>The winds wound down Monday morning, but forecasters predict the respite will be brief. </p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://weather.com/forecast/regional/news/2019-10-28-california-wildfire-danger-forecast\">Weather Channel reports</a> that the state will see a third round of fire danger on Tuesday and southern California could see its highest winds, yet:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Another strong high pressure system and southward plunge of the jet stream will dive into the West from Canada. When that happens, strong offshore flow exists in California, contributing to gusty winds and low humidity.</p> \n   <p>Southern California could experience its strongest Santa Ana winds so far this fall beginning Tuesday night and lasting into Thursday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Wind gusts of 50 to 70mph are possible in the mountains and foothills and relative humidity could drop into the single digits. </p> \n   <p>\u201cIf fire ignition occurs, conditions will be favorable for extreme fire behavior, long range spotting and very rapid fire spread which would threaten life and property,\u201d the <a href=\"https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=lox&amp;wwa=red%20flag%20warning\">NWS said</a>.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> The high winds expected in southern California could help spread the Getty fire if firefighters in Los Angeles are not able to contain it by the time the winds pick up. And conditions could complicate efforts to extinguish the still-burning Kincade fire, which as of Monday morning was only contained at 5%. </p> \n  <p>California generally faces its greatest risk of wildfires in the fall. Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist and adjunct professor in the Department of Meteorology and Climate Science at San Jose State University, explained to the Weather Channel why that\u2019s the case. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIn September and October, we begin seeing high pressure developing over the Great Basin, and this creates dry, warm offshore winds,\u201d said Null. \u201cThe air is compressed as it descends to sea level, warming and drying it. When this flow is forced over mountains and through canyons, it accelerates.\u201d</p> \n   <p>If the jet stream is also located to the east of the state over the Great Basin, a downward push of strong winds can occur, intensifying the offshore wind event. These intense offshore winds can occur from fall through spring.</p> \n   <p>What makes them particularly dangerous in the fall: they occur when soil moisture is at its lowest.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T21:55:35.058Z\">at 9.55pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5db744ae8f08cb84c60a0503\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-10-28T20:26:17.602Z\">8.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Air quality in Oakland : unhealthy for sensitive groups</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Commuters headed to work or school on Monday morning may have noticed a new trend in the Bay Area: A growing number of area residents are donning air masks that can help filter particles floating in the smoky air coming from the wildfires burning nearby and throughout the state. </p> \n  <p>As my colleague Vivian Ho <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/12/california-wildfires-bay-area-smoke-haze-air-quality-pollution\">described last year</a> \u2013 as the Camp fire claimed its place as the most destructive fire in the state\u2019s history \u2013 smoke that sweeps into the Bay Area from fires can create an inversion layer over the area that essentially acts as a lid that keeps all of the air down near ground level and results in poor quality air, often expressed as an Air Quality Index, or AQI. </p> \n  <p>An AQI under 50 is considered healthy, 50 to 100 is considered moderate, 100 to 150 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups and anything above 150 is considered unhealthy. </p> \n  <p>Currently, air quality in Oakland stands at 121 \u2013 roughly three times worse than it was yesterday, according to the <a href=\"https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;cityid=317\">Environmental Protection Agency</a> \u2013 but it\u2019s forecasted to rise to 151, which means it\u2019s probably a good thing for anyone sensitive to breathing issues to opt for masks and avoid heavy exertion. (San Francisco air quality is a bit healthier: It currently stands at 54).</p> \n  <p>In fact, when air quality reaches and unhealthy level, experts recommend that residents limit their time outdoors.

At one point firefighters had the blaze 10% contained, but it has since grown, and is now only 5% contained.</li> \n   <li>Jonathan Cox, Cal Fire division chief, said at the press conference that over the weekend the agency had received assurance from the Department of Homeland Security that there would be no enforcement of immigration law while the wildfires burned. Cox said it was important at this time for everyone to know they could seek help, regardless of immigration status. </li> \n   <li>All evacuation orders that have been issued in Sonoma county remain in effect. As of Monday morning, 185,000 people had been ordered to leave their homes. </li> \n   <li>Cal Fire and the Sonoma county sheriff will meet today to discuss if and when they could begin repopulating certain parts of the county. </li> \n   <li>Cox said that an area woman had been arrested for arson over the weekend, but that they think the fire she is suspected of setting was an isolated incident \u2013 reportedly retaliation for a domestic situation \u2013 and is unrelated to the larger fires. </li> \n   <li>Anyone who crosses into an evacuated area without authorization will get attention from law enforcement. If the person lives in the neighborhood, they\u2019ll likely be \u201cre-escorted\u201d out of the area, Cox said. If, however, they\u2019re not local and appear to be \u201cup to no good\u201d, they\u2019ll face arrest.

      "bodyText": "That does it for me here in Oakland as I leave my fire-watch post for the day. But before I close out the blog, let\u2019s take a look back at the day in California wildfire news. The Getty fire broke in west Los Angeles in the wee hours of the morning, sending some of LA\u2019s wealthiest residents, including NBA superstar LeBron James, scrambling for safety. As of this afternoon, firefighters had only 5% of the fire contained. This morning progressive Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted an urgent reminder that we are fast-approaching the deadline to cut carbon emissions drastically or face irreversible climate breakdown. \u201cThis is what climate change looks like,\u201d she wrote of a dramatic photo of the fire in Vallejo. \u201cThe GOP like to mock scientific warnings about climate change as exaggeration. But just look around: it\u2019s already starting. Air quality across the San Francisco Bay Area took a turn for the worse as smoke from the wildfires began drifting into the area. Roughly 741,000 homes or businesses in Calfornia were still without power on Monday afternoon, according to Pacific Gas and Electric\u2019s numbers. In a new, 230-page report made public today, PG&amp;E acknowledged \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d in its planned power outage, admitting that its communication with customers and agencies was inadequate, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. In anticipation of violent and damaging winds, today the National Weather Service issued a red-flag warning for Los Angeles and neighboring Ventura county through the day and an extreme red-flag warning for Tuesday through Thursday. The NSW predicts the Socal area could see the highest winds of the season, with its peak expected on Wednesday and gusts of up to 80 mph in the mountains. High winds, low-humidity and dry vegetation can be a deadly combination for wildfires. As of this afternooon, the Getty fire that broke out early this morning in west Los Angeles, threatening some of the most affluent parts of the city, remained only 5% contained, the LAist reported. As entire communities evacuate and firefighters work through nights to beat back blazes, there have been no words of support or condolences from Donald Trump. The radio silence is more remarkable when you consider that last year Trump was very vocal on the eve of a visit to Paradise, a community that was virtually incinerated by the most destructive fire in state history. Prior to the trip, Trump asserted his opinion that wildfires in Calfornia were the result of poor forest management. In a tweet around the same time, he threatened to withhold federal payments to California and claimed its forest management is \u201cso poor\u201d. Some firefighters saw Trump\u2019s visit as a show of support for responders; others were less welcoming, viewing his comments as ill-informed and insensitive. Brian K Rice, the president of the California Professional Firefighters, said at the time: \u201cThe president\u2019s message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the frontlines.\u201d This year, Trump has been exceptionally hostile in his comments toward California, saying that Los Angeles and San Francisco were \u201cdestroying themselves\u201d by their inability to deal with homelessness. By contrast, Trump appeared very sympathetic toward Russia earlier this year when he reached out to Vladimir Putin to offer to help the country put out wildfires in Siberia. Roughly 741,000 homes or businesses in Calfornia were still without power on Monday afternoon, according to Pacific Gas and Electric\u2019s numbers \u2013 a result of the utility\u2019s planned power outages that PG&amp;E hoped would reduce the risk of sparking fires. With the latest round of blackouts beginning 26 October, nearly 2 million people could go without power for five days \u2013 an unprecedented impact for a planned power outage in California, the Los Angeles Times points out: Cutting power for five days to a million customers far exceeds national averages, according to federal data. The average electrical outage even with \u201cmajor events,\u201d such as ice or wind storms, runs four hours, according to the US Energy Information Administration. South Carolina ranks the worst with an average duration of 20 hours. New York and Nevada rank the best. The utility has been roundly criticised for its handling of the blackouts, the first of which came 9 October. And in a new, 230-page report made public today, PG&amp;E acknowledged \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d in the planned power outage, admitting that its communication with customers and agencies was inadequate, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The report found that PG&amp;E was slow to give customers, including government agencies and individuals with serious medical conditions, adequate advanced notice. When its website was inundated with an unexpected number of requests from people seeking information, it crashed several times. An unprepared call center resulted in long wait times for customers. PG&amp;E defended the decision to cut power but vowed to improve the process in the future. And yet, despite the massive scale of the preventive blackouts, it appears likely that the utility\u2019s equipment was responsible for sparking three recent fires. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that two fires that started Sunday in Lafayette, a community just north-east of Oakland, happened at same location and at roughly the same time as two PG&amp;E electrical malfunctions, according to the reports sent to the California Public Utilities Commission. The news comes less than a week after PG&amp;E acknowledged that its equipment could have played a role in sparking the Kincade fire, currently the state\u2019s largest and a blaze firefighters are still working to contain. In that case, too, a malfunction coincided with the place a fire started. The utility cut off power because live, wind-toppled wires could easily ignite dry vegetation. But in all three recent fires, however, PG&amp;E left the juice running, assuming that the area was at a low risk of fire. The utility is believed to have been responsible for wildfires in 2017 and 2018 and in January filed for bankruptcy protection. Huge sections of California remain under a red-flag warning as extreme seasonal winds continue to ebb and flow, fanning flames from northern California\u2019s wine country to the state\u2019s border with Mexico. Violent winds over the weekend, which in places topped 100mph, helped double the size of the Kincade fire that continued burning a path through the state\u2019s wine country. The winds wound down Monday morning, but forecasters predict the respite will be brief. The Weather Channel reports that the state will see a third round of fire danger on Tuesday and southern California could see its highest winds, yet: Another strong high pressure system and southward plunge of the jet stream will dive into the West from Canada. When that happens, strong offshore flow exists in California, contributing to gusty winds and low humidity. Southern California could experience its strongest Santa Ana winds so far this fall beginning Tuesday night and lasting into Thursday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Wind gusts of 50 to 70mph are possible in the mountains and foothills and relative humidity could drop into the single digits. \u201cIf fire ignition occurs, conditions will be favorable for extreme fire behavior, long range spotting and very rapid fire spread which would threaten life and property,\u201d the NWS said. The high winds expected in southern California could help spread the Getty fire if firefighters in Los Angeles are not able to contain it by the time the winds pick up. And conditions could complicate efforts to extinguish the still-burning Kincade fire, which as of Monday morning was only contained at 5%. California generally faces its greatest risk of wildfires in the fall. Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist and adjunct professor in the Department of Meteorology and Climate Science at San Jose State University, explained to the Weather Channel why that\u2019s the case. \u201cIn September and October, we begin seeing high pressure developing over the Great Basin, and this creates dry, warm offshore winds,\u201d said Null. \u201cThe air is compressed as it descends to sea level, warming and drying it. When this flow is forced over mountains and through canyons, it accelerates.\u201d If the jet stream is also located to the east of the state over the Great Basin, a downward push of strong winds can occur, intensifying the offshore wind event. These intense offshore winds can occur from fall through spring. What makes them particularly dangerous in the fall: they occur when soil moisture is at its lowest. Commuters headed to work or school on Monday morning may have noticed a new trend in the Bay Area: A growing number of area residents are donning air masks that can help filter particles floating in the smoky air coming from the wildfires burning nearby and throughout the state. As my colleague Vivian Ho described last year \u2013 as the Camp fire claimed its place as the most destructive fire in the state\u2019s history \u2013 smoke that sweeps into the Bay Area from fires can create an inversion layer over the area that essentially acts as a lid that keeps all of the air down near ground level and results in poor quality air, often expressed as an Air Quality Index, or AQI. An AQI under 50 is considered healthy, 50 to 100 is considered moderate, 100 to 150 is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups and anything above 150 is considered unhealthy. Currently, air quality in Oakland stands at 121 \u2013 roughly three times worse than it was yesterday, according to the Environmental Protection Agency \u2013 but it\u2019s forecasted to rise to 151, which means it\u2019s probably a good thing for anyone sensitive to breathing issues to opt for masks and avoid heavy exertion. (San Francisco air quality is a bit healthier: It currently stands at 54). In fact, when air quality reaches and unhealthy level, experts recommend that residents limit their time outdoors. Because residents who are homeless don\u2019t have that option, one local organization, Mask Oakland, organizes volunteers to hand out free air masks. Mask Oakland is currently mobilizing and getting ready to hit the streets. Firefighters in Los Angeles are battling a fire that broke out in the early morning hours on Monday and rapidly burned more than 500 acres and sent people fleeing from their homes in the dark. The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, said in no uncertain terms that residents aren\u2019t to waste time if they\u2019re told to evacuate. \u201cGet out when we say get out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing you cannot replace is you and your family.\u201d The Los Angeles Times, which has had a platoon of reporters and photographers on the scene, points out that the fire has threatened some of LA\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods. The LA Times quoted a man who wrestled with the decision of whether to evacuate because he had two cars and couldn\u2019t drive them both. \u201cI have to figure out what I\u2019m going to do with my Ferrari,\u201d the 47-year-old man said. The fire forced a number of celebrities to flee their homes, including California\u2019s former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lakers basketball star LeBron James. It was almost 4am when James tweeted: \u201cHad to emergency evacuate my house and I\u2019ve been driving around with my family trying to get rooms. No luck so far!\u201d Of course, if one of the biggest superstars in the history of sports has trouble finding a room in an emergency, the situation is likely pretty concerning for the poor and less privileged. That obviously includes those who are paid to clean and care for the homes of the rich and famous. As smoke billowed and choppers circled, one of the LA Times reporters on scene, Brittny Mejia, met a number of housekeepers whose bosses had apparently forgotten to call them to tell them not to come in to work. (Here\u2019s Mejia\u2019s story on the housekeepers and gardeners who went to work despite the fires. It\u2019s a stark reminder that while fire may not discriminate in whose property it claims, the wealthy are in a much better position to prevent loss (even if that means hiring private fire fighters), have access to transportation and safe lodging, or simply be able to rebuild if fire claims the house. My colleague Susie Cagle spent much of the weekend in Sonoma county and returned with a heartbreaking portrait of an area still reeling from the damage and trauma wrought by a wildfire in 2017 \u2013 a firestorm that killed 44 people, destroyed thousands of homes and burned roughly 245,000 acres. As Susie points out, the Kincade fire, which over the weekend doubled in size and has already forced 185,000 to evacuate their Sonoma county homes, is a fraction of the size of the 2017 blaze. But that\u2019s small solace to to those being told to leave behind their homes and everything in them \u2013 again. Some residents simply refuse. Debbie, who declined to give her last name, stood in the doorway of her home in Coffey Park that she recently, finally finished rebuilding after it was destroyed by wildfire in 2017. She covered her face with both hands. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving again. This time I\u2019m gonna stay and I\u2019m gonna burn in my house,\u201d she said. \u201cPG&amp;E has not learned anything? Are they trying to kill us?\u201d Debbie wasn\u2019t alone: Coffey Park, a dense neighborhood in north Santa Rosa, is deep in the midst of rebuilding after it was all but destroyed in 2017. Freshly painted new homes stand next to naked wood frames, next to still empty lots, dry lumber piled on gravel. One homeowner evacuated with a hose still spraying over the fresh wood chips in their front yard. With smoke from the fire bearing down, many Coffey Park residents had evacuated, but Ken Herland stood outside, watering his yard and the new wooden fence surrounding it with a garden hose. Herland has only lived in this house since July. \u201cWe just put a new metal roof on the house,\u201d he said as he worked the hose. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I left the last time.\u201d But, he said, \u201cThis time feels worse.\u201d Good morning from the west coast, where residents in the Bay Area woke this morning to the smell of smoke. Mario Koran here, picking up the wildfire blog from my colleague Joanna Walters. I\u2019ll be bringing you updates on the latest fire news throughout the day. Cal Fire just closed its 9am press conference on the status of the Kincade fire, the state\u2019s largest fire and a blaze firefighters worked over the weekend to contain. Here are some of the highlights on that: As of 7.43 this morning, the Kincade fired had scorched 66,231 acres and destroyed 96 residential or commercial structures over four days. At one point firefighters had the blaze 10% contained, but it has since grown, and is now only 5% contained. Jonathan Cox, Cal Fire division chief, said at the press conference that over the weekend the agency had received assurance from the Department of Homeland Security that there would be no enforcement of immigration law while the wildfires burned. Cox said it was important at this time for everyone to know they could seek help, regardless of immigration status. All evacuation orders that have been issued in Sonoma county remain in effect. As of Monday morning, 185,000 people had been ordered to leave their homes. Cal Fire and the Sonoma county sheriff will meet today to discuss if and when they could begin repopulating certain parts of the county. Cox said that an area woman had been arrested for arson over the weekend, but that they think the fire she is suspected of setting was an isolated incident \u2013 reportedly retaliation for a domestic situation \u2013 and is unrelated to the larger fires. Anyone who crosses into an evacuated area without authorization will get attention from law enforcement. If the person lives in the neighborhood, they\u2019ll likely be \u201cre-escorted\u201d out of the area, Cox said. If, however, they\u2019re not local and appear to be \u201cup to no good\u201d, they\u2019ll face arrest. Prowlers beware. The Getty Museum assures the public that its edifice in the greater Los Angeles area and the priceless art inside, ranging from antiquities to European masters, are safe, despite the newest wildfire in the blazes now affecting northern and southern California being named after it. The Getty Fire broke out not far from the J. Paul Getty Museum (aka The Getty) in the early hours of this morning, next to the Getty Center Drive, a long connector road leading from the institution to the major road artery, the 405 Freeway. When the museum was threatened by wildfire in December, 2017, its leaders said that the building was well protected, they had a million-gallon water tank in reserve, and it was the best for the art to stay put. Meanwhile, people are evacuating post haste. However they can: Kincade Fire press conference to be held at 9am local time. With attention drawn to the new Getty fire raging west of downtown LA, the situation with wildfire in northern California is deteriorating. There will be a press conference about the Kincade fire raging in Sonoma county \u2013 northern wine country \u2013 at 9am local time/12pm on the east coast. A sobering reminder that the Kincade Fire is only 5% contained. Almost 200,000 people in the area are under mandatory evacuation order. Adjacent Napa Valley is not out of danger. The Los Angeles Fire Department and mayor Eric Garcetti gave a briefing a little earlier and the LAFD is updating its website regularly with information for residents wanting to know where the fire is and who is being evacuated. The fire broke out at 1.34am local time this morning (4.34am on the US east coast) near the Getty art museum and the 405 Freeway, in dry brush. Around 500 firefighters were scrambled to tackle the blaze. Helicopters brought equipment out in the night and Cal Fire (the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection) is sending aircraft to dump retardant on the blaze. Garcetti hailed \u201ca lot of amazing heroes\u201d, the firefighters who rolled out of station in dead of night to head for the flames burning about 10 to 15 miles north-west of downtown LA in the blaze now dubbed the Getty Fire. He warned that anyone receiving evacuation orders should heed them. \u201cIf you have an evacuation notice and you are still in your home, leave. We have seen tragedies before ... get your loved ones and your pets and go,\u201d he said. He said that the firefighting men and women are working in the most topographically challenging terrain around LA. The fire is affecting the scenic, winding and tree-rich canyons and lush neighborhoods with famous-name roads running through them such as Sunset Boulevard and Mulholland Drive. Progressive Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just tweeted an urgent reminder that we are racing towards the deadline for the human race to cut carbon emissions drastically or face irreversible climate breakdown. Experts have long been warning that the climate crisis and global heating create conditions that increase the risk of wildfires starting, especially in the bone-dry American west, and exacerbate them once they have ignited. We\u2019re seeing this once again with the fires scorching California this last week, which still raging, spreading and multiplying in the north and south, near San Francisco and Los Angeles. Here, AOC is promoting her key Green New Deal policy that seeks to tackle the climate crisis and economic inequality as one. And she\u2019s retweeting regular Guardian US contributor and environmental scholar Bill McKibben. McKibben unequivocally makes the link between the human-caused climate emergency and catastrophic wildfires in California, in particular. This is wildfire season in the state, as dry conditions, high temperatures and strong, seasonal Santa Ana winds turn the region into a tinder box. AOC warn of the climate crisis: \u201cJust look around, it\u2019s already starting.\u201d Fire map: The Los Angeles Times has a useful interactive map showing the many wildfires burning in southern and northern California. Here\u2019s some more footage of the Getty Fire which broke out north-west of downtown LA in the early hours of today, forcing evacuations, including that of basketball superstar LeBron James and his family. The Getty started as a brushfire next to the freeway, it seems. This new fire broke out in the early hours of this morning near the flagship J Paul Getty art museum in the greater Los Angeles area. The fire was threatening parts of the nearby, prosperous Bel Air, Brentwood, Westwood and Sherman Oaks neighborhoods, an area 10 to 15 miles north-west of the heart of downtown Los Angeles, and just north of Beverly Hills. A huge stretch of the 405 Freeway southbound, adjoining the area of the Getty Fire and a major road artery feeding into LA, has been closed to traffic. Californians in this area are waking up to unexpected chaos and danger. Kincade Fire still out of control Here is a tweet from the Sonoma Sheriff in the early hours of Monday morning, giving stark numbers on the area being ravaged so far \u2013 more than 80 square miles \u2013 and emphasizing the continued red flag warning \u2013 which means warm temperatures, very low humidity and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger. Good morning, wildfire watchers, we\u2019re going to bring you the latest news live today on the infernos burning in California and what\u2019s happening to the people there. It\u2019s an incredibly daunting situation and blazes are nowhere near contained. Two firefighters were injured yesterday fighting the Kincade fire in northern California wine country. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: There are around 18 wildfires burning in California at the moment, most dotted close to Los Angeles and to the north of San Francisco. The most recent fire is the Getty Fire, which erupted in the early hours of this morning near the Getty Museum in greater Los Angeles. It is spreading fast. The largest fire remains the Kincade Fire in Somona County, in northern California\u2019s wine country, which began last Wednesday. Almost 200,000 people came under mandatory evacuation orders in the region yesterday as a state of emergency was declared for California. The Tick Fire north of LA in the Santa Clarita Valley which we heard so much about last week is still burning fiercely. Two firefighters have been injured. No deaths have yet been reported and people have been evacuated a little earlier than in past fires, in many cases. Around three million people are without power in the state as a result mainly of intentional shut-offs to try to stop power lines that sustain wind damage from sparking new fires. Some have also lost power to functioning lines that have been ravaged by winds with gusts exceeding 80mph.",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a recap of today: The House of Representatives will have its first vote on the impeachment inquiry. House leader Nancy Pelosi said the vote will counter Republican opposition, and \u201c eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\u201d Republican lawmakers say the decision to hold a vote proves they were right all along \u2014 but also it\u2019s too little too late. So far, Republicans have avoided commenting on the substance of the allegations against Trump, instead focusing their criticism of the impeachment inquiry on the process and procedures. A democratic California state assemblywoman Christy Smith announced she\u2019ll run for the seat to be vacated by US congresswoman Katie Hill. Hill resigned yesterday amid allegations that she had an inappropriate relationship with a staffer. In a video resleased earlier today, Hill apologized and also decried what she called \u201ccoordinated campaign\u201d by Republicans and rightwing media to discredit her. Former North Carolina senator Kay Hagan has died. Donald Trump addressed a police convention and held a fund-raiser in Chicago, continued to boast about the US-milliary raid of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound and rail against the impeachment inquiry. The Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who introduced a Senate resolution denouncing the House inquiry last week, is both taking credit for House Democrats\u2019 decision to hold a full vote on the impeachment inquiry, and saying that the vote is meaningless. \u201cA vote now is a bit like un-ringing a bell as House Democrats have selectively leaked information in order to damage President Trump for weeks,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming response House Democrats heard from the American people and Senate Republicans in support of my resolution forced their hand.\u201d Trump\u2019s macabre description of the US military raid on the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound contained several inaccuracies. For one, the president said Baghdadi was \u201cwhimpering, crying and screaming all the way\u201d\u2013 which officials say they did not hear. According to NBC, officials have also expressed concerns that the revealed classified information and risked future operations in the region: The overarching concern about Trump\u2019s disclosures on the al-Baghdadi raid, officials said, is that he gave America\u2019s enemies details that could make intelligence gathering and similar military operations more difficult and more dangerous to pull off. Revealing that the U.S. possesses documents about future ISIS plans hurts the military\u2019s ability to use that information for quick follow-on operations, officials said. The president\u2019s disclosure that the U.S. had taken ISIS fighters from the compound complicated efforts to try to keep ISIS from knowing who is alive or dead for as long as possible while they interrogate them, officials said. Facebook continues to come under fire for its policy exempting political advertising from factchecking. Hundreds of the company\u2019s employees have signed a letter to executive Mark Zuckerberg voicing concerns over the policy, The Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul reported earlier today. Yesterday, Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wiley proffered his help filling in gaps in Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony. Reporting from The Guardian and other news organizations revealed last year that Facebook exposed data from up to 87 million Facebook users to a researcher who worked for Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for the Trump campaign. Zuckerberg said that he wasn\u2019t aware of the situation until it became publicly known \u201cThis was the largest data scandal with respect to your company that had catastrophic impacts with regard to 2016\u2026 and you don\u2019t know?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked during Zukerberg when he appeared before the House financial services committee last week. Zuckerberg\u2019s insistence that he was unaware is looking increasingly suspicious, writes Carole Cadwalladr: And the answers Zuckerberg gave Ocasio-Cortez only invite further questions. The fact is that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is far from over. In some ways, it\u2019s only just beginning. It\u2019s not the crime, as the saying goes, it\u2019s the cover-up. And that continues. Because we know Facebook lied. The SEC investigation says that. To us at the Observer, in fact \u201c\u2026 when asked by reporters in 2017 about its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica matter, Facebook falsely claimed the company found no evidence of wrongdoing\u201d. A state court in North Carolina ruled that the congressional map is so severely gerrymandered to benefit Republicans that it can\u2019t be used in 2020. This ruling comes a month after the same three-judge panel ruled that the state\u2019s legislative maps are also unconstitutional. Republicans currently control 1o of the state\u2019s 13 seats in the House of Representatives. In 2016, when the current maps were made, Republicans admitted in writing that they wanted to use partisan data to give their party a 10-3 advantage. GOP mapmaker Thomas Hofeller, after receiving his cancer diagnosis in May 2016, wrote in an email reviewed by The New Yorker: \u201cI still have time to bedevil the Democrats with more redistricting plans before I exit. The ruling today is a preliminary injunction that orders the state not to use the current congressional maps for the 2020 elections as the lawsuit challenging the districts proceeds. Judges said that advocacy groups are poised to show \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the maps violate the state constitution. \u201cThis victory was not due to Donald Trump\u2019s leadership,\u201d said former vice president Joe Biden. \u201cIt happened despite his ineptitude.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar told CBS that the killing of al-Baghdadi doesn\u2019t mean Trump\u2019s \u201cforeign policy overall has not been a disaster.\u201d From the AP: Trump is eager to turn al-Baghdadi\u2019s death into a defining moment of his administration, one that could remind waffling Republicans why they support him. And Democrats, who have largely been focused issues such as health care and combating rising college debt, must now decry Trump\u2019s foreign policy without appearing to disparage U.S. forces. It\u2019s a balance that could be tough for the White House hopefuls to pull off. Meanwhile, Donald and Melania Trump are celebrating Halloween at the White House. They appear to be dressed up as... themselves. Spooky. US regulators will vote next month on whether to bar companies from using federal subsidies for equipment from Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE. The FCC chair, Ajit Pai, has called Huawei and ZTE \u201cuntrusted vendors\u201d. The regulating agency will vote on whether to block companies that receive money from the $8.5bn Universal Service Fund from purchasing equipment or services from firms that pose a national security risk. The House leaders\u2019 decision to hold its first vote on the impeachment inquiry this week is \u201cclearly an admission that we\u2019ve been right all along about the need to have a more transparent process\u201d, said Greg Walden, a Republican representative from Oregon who announced his retirement today. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, echoed: \u201cToday\u2019s backtracking is an admission that this process has been botched from the start.\u201d Republicans have largely avoided commenting on the substance of allegations that Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, instead criticizing the House Democrats\u2019 process. But if the Democratic leaders imagined that holding a full vote on the inquiry would quell criticism that the inquiry is illegitimate, they\u2019ll be disappointed. According to the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, \u201csecret, shady, closed door depositions are completely and irreversibly illegitimate\u201d. Despite Charles Kupperman\u2019s refusal to testify in the impeachment inquiry this morning, it\u2019s been a busy day for US politics so far. My colleague on the west coast, Maanvi Singh, will now take over the blog and continue our coverage of live news. Today so far: The full House of Representatives will get its first vote on the impeachment inquiry. On Thursday there will be a procedural vote on the next steps in the process. It\u2019s not required but Democrats see it as a good counter to Republican attempts to tear down the process as illegitimate. A California state assemblywoman, Christy Smith, has announced she\u2019ll run to try to put another Democrat in the seat to be vacated by US congresswoman Katie Hill, who flipped her district from the Republicans last year. Departing congresswoman Katie Hill, who resigned yesterday, issued a video statement earlier today that decried an alleged smear campaign against her, while also apologizing for being obliged to leave the House. Former Senator Kay Hagan has died. Donald Trump railed against the impeachment inquiry, on a visit to Chicago, where he was addressing a police convention and holding a fund-raiser, amid protests. Kupperman case goes to next stage Deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman, who was ousted-national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s deputy, did not turn up to testify in the impeachment inquiry this morning, defying a congressional subpoena. He said he was waiting for a court to rule on which would prevail - the subpoena or a White House gag order, attempting to block administration officials from cooperating with the inquiry. He filed a lawsuit in the matter, which Democratic leaders said was a legally invalid avenue to take. A judge has now been assigned to the case. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, has reportedly pushed for the resolution outlining impeachment procedures. Several witnesses have refused to appear before the committees leading the inquiry, deferring to the White House\u2019s opinion that the investigation is illegitimate because no formal vote was held to launch the proceedings. Schiff may believe that this vote will help to invalidate those arguments and compel the witnesses to testify. The blog has another update on the US military dog that played a key role in the Baghdadi raid: his name is reportedly Conan. Meanwhile, Trump has tweeted a photo of the \u201cwonderful dog\u201d that played a crucial role in the raid of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound. The name of the dog, who is reportedly back on the job after Trump said it was injured in the attack on the Isis leader, remains classified. Even though the House resolution appears meant to discredit the Trump administration\u2019s argument that the impeachment inquiry is illegitimate, it is unclear whether the White House would comply with the investigation even if a formal vote were held. It appears that even some senior House Democrats are questioning why Nancy Pelosi is now asking her caucus to vote on a resolution solidifying impeachment procedures. The announcement comes hours after Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to John Bolton, failed to appear for his testimony in the inquiry because he is seeking a court ruling on whether to comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House\u2019s order not to participate. If the House votes to formalize impeachment procedures, it could potentially nullify those legal questions. The House resolution outlining impeachment procedures specifically calls out the Trump administration for dismissing the inquiry as illegitimate. It reads: \u201cFor weeks, the President, his Counsel in the White House, and his allies in Congress have made the baseless claim that the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry \u2018lacks the necessary authorization for a valid impeachment proceeding.\u2019 They argue that, because the House has not taken a vote, they may simply pretend the impeachment inquiry does not exist. Of course, this argument has no merit.\u201d However, a Politico reporter noted the oddness of Nancy Pelosi choosing to confront this argument just days after a federal judge said that the inquiry was legitimate. The House will vote on the resolution outlining the procedure to move the impeachment inquiry to the public hearing phase on Thursday. One paragraph in the resolution reads: \u201cThis resolution establishes the procedure for hearings that are open to the American people, authorizes the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlines procedures to transfer evidence to the Judiciary Committee as it considers potential articles of impeachment, and sets forth due process rights for the President and his Counsel.\u201d Senior House Democrats hope the vote will invalidate the Trump administration\u2019s argument that the inquiry is illegitimate because no formal vote has been held to launch the proceedings. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office is releasing a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter today outlining House Democrats\u2019 next steps in the impeachment inquiry, including public hearings. The House rules committee will also reportedly mark up a resolution on Wednesday directing various committees to continue their own investigations into Trump under the broader umbrella of the impeachment inquiry. The resolution is titled, \u201cDirecting certain committees to continue their ongoing investigations as part of the existing House of Representatives inquiry into whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States of America, and for other purposes.\u201d The terribly sad death of Maryland congressman Elijah Cummings earlier this month will prompt a special election next year. He was mourned by the people of Baltimore and eulogized by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton at his funeral last Friday, after becoming the first African-American lawmaker to lie in state at the Capitol. It was announced today that the primary will be in February and the main election in April. The congressman was the chair of the House oversight committee, one of the three panels leading the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump\u2019s questionable dealings with Ukraine and its prime minister Volodymyr Zelenskiy. California state assembly Democrat Christy Smith announced today that she will run for the seat that\u2019s being vacated by Katie Hill, who announced yesterday that she will resign. A date has not yet been set for the special election to decide the seat - a crucial flip from Republican to the Democratic party last year, Joanna Walters writes. Departing congresswoman Katie Hill in her video statement calls out \u201crevenge porn\u201d, which she alleges her husband has engaged in against her, and said: \u201cAs the victim of it, I call it one of the worst things you can do.\u201d She begins the video starkly saying of her resignation announcement:\u201cI made this decision so my supporters, my family, my staff and my community will no longer be subjected to the pain inflicted by my abusive husband and the brutality of hateful political operatives.\u201d She blames a coordinated campaign against her by \u201cthe right-wing media and Republican opponents\u201d to \u201cweaponize\u201d her imperfections and perpetuate an alleged smear campaign by her husband, which she describes as \u201cdisgusting and unforgivable\u201d and notes: \u201cThey will be held accountable.\u201d Hill goes on to say she does not want her situation to put other women and girls off pursuing a career in politics. \u201cBut I will allow myself to be a distraction from the constitutional crisis we are faced with, and the critical work of my colleagues,\u201d she says, referring to the Trump-Ukraine impeachment inquiry now being conducted by the US House of Representatives. She is clearly then trying to hold in her emotions as she says: \u201cI never claimed to be perfect but I never thought my imperfections would be weaponized and used to try to destroy me and the community that I have loved for my entire life. And for that I am truly sorry,\u201d she said. Hill had been seen as a rising star in Washington since being arriving in Congress as a freshman this year. She said: \u201cI grew up riding horses and the most important thing I learned is that when you fall off you get right back up in the saddle. So I\u2019m going to do that and I hope I can count on you to do the same - and join me on the next ride.\u201d Hill flipped a vital California seat from Republican to Democrat in the 2018 midterm elections. Hill calls alleged smear campaign against her \u201cunforgivable\u201d, also says she is \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for having to resign Democratic congresswoman Katie Hill\u2019s video statement issued on Monday is a tortured critique of her brutal downfall so soon into her promising congressional career. Her apology comes towards the end of the 3.49 minute video, where she also offers an oblique promise that, career-wise, she\u2019s down but not out for good, although she doesn\u2019t mention if she sees a future in politics. She\u2019s previously acknowledged that it was inappropriate for her to have a sexual relationship with someone employed by her on her campaign team when she was running for Congress. That\u2019s not against any rules but she expressed regret and it caused a scandal when intimate pictures of Hill and the female staffer were apparently leaked and posted online by a conservative website, then spread, with the prospect of more images and pieces of digital correspondence coming into the public domain. And last week the House ethics committee opened an investigation into separate allegations that Hill had engaged in a sexual relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly, in possible violation of a House rule forged last year in response to the era of the #MeToo movement against sexual assault, sexual harassment and abuse of power. Hill denied having such a relationship with him, in a letter to constituents, but resigned yesterday, alleging her husband and \u201chateful political operatives\u201d have coordinated a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her. She refers in today\u2019s video statement to \u201celectronic assault\u201d or \u201crevenge porn\u201d in the issuing of intimate images as a way of embarrassing her. She said she was hurt and angry. Hill apologized for her \u201cimperfections\u201d in a new video statement issued today, a day after she announced her resignation amid allegations, now being investigated, that she violated rules by conducting a sexual relationship with a member of her congressional staff, Joanna Walters writes. But she also hinted that she will not disappear from public life and will \u201cget right back up in the saddle\u201d, although she did not give details of what she plans to do next. This development followed the California Democrat acknowledging that she had previously had, separately, a sexual relationship with a member of her campaign team. In the lengthy video on Monday, Hill became emotional and alleged a smear campaign by her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, and said her personal \u201cimperfections\u201d had been used as a weapon unfairly to turn opinion against her. Greg Walden, the top Republican on the House energy and commerce committee who was first elected to Congress in 1999, said he would not seek reelection \u2013 becoming the latest in a series of House Republicans who have announced their departures in recent months. Politico reports: \u2018Based on recent polling, strong fundraising, and the backing of my wife and family, I am confident I could earn the support of 2nd District voters for another term. I\u2019m also optimistic that a path exists for Republicans to recapture a majority in the House, and that I could return for two more years as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,\u2019 Walden said in a statement given to POLITICO. \u2018But I also know that for me, the time has come to pursue new challenges and opportunities.\u2019 Walden added: \u2018So, I will not seek re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives, nor election to any other office, but instead I will close the public service chapter of my life, thankful for the friends I\u2019ve made and the successful work we\u2019ve done together.\u2019 The Oregon congressman is the 17 th House Republican to announce their retirement this cycle, a sign of how difficult it will be for the GOP to win back the majority in what\u2019s already shaping up as a tough 2020 election. Having President Donald Trump\u2019s name at the top of the ticket will ensure turnout among his supporters, yet it\u2019s also expected to bring Democrats out in huge numbers as well. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to John Bolton, failed to appear for his scheduled testimony in the impeachment inquiry. A lawyer for the former official said his client would not testify until a judge ruled on whether he should comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House\u2019s order not to appear. The Justice Department is filing its expected appeal to a judge\u2019s ruling that officials must grant the House judiciary committee access to grand jury material redacted from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. Kay Hagan, a North Carolina Democrat who served one term in the Senate before being defeated in 2014, has died at 66, her family announced. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar mourned the loss of her former Senate colleague and \u201cgood friend\u201d Kay Hagan, who died unexpectedly today at the age of 66. Washington reporters similarly remembered Hagan\u2019s kindness and wit. Hagan, a Democrat of North Carolina, served for one term in the Senate before being defeated by Republican Thom Tillis in 2014. Trump has concluded his speech at the annual convention for the International Association of Chiefs of Police and signed his executive order on addressing \u201cthe root causes of crime\u201d and law enforcement recruitment. At one point, the president went on an angry riff about immigration in which he slammed sanctuary cities and \u201copen borders.\u201d Trump said: \u201cGet \u2018em the hell out of our country.\u201d He later added: \u201cAs you know, countries love to send their worst to us.\u201d The president has previously falsely claimed that foreign countries were abusing a visa lottery program to send their \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d even though the US state department vets the applicants. Kay Hagan, a former Democratic senator from North Carolina, has died at 66, according to a statement from her family. This statement, which was obtained by the Charlotte Observer, read: \u201cWe are heartbroken to share that Kay left us unexpectedly this morning. Kay meant everything to us, and we were honored to share her with the people of North Carolina whom she cared for and fought for so passionately as an elected official. ... \u201cWe are deeply grateful for the support shared with our family as Kay worked to regain her strength these last few years after her illness, and we appreciate your continued prayers.\u201d Hagan was diagnosed with Powassan virus, a type of encephalitis, three years ago. She served a single term in the Senate before being defeated by Republican Thom Tillis in 2014. In his speech at the annual convention for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Trump praised the officers who responded to the Dayton shooting in August by mimicking the attacker. Speaking at an annual police convention in Chicago, Trump said that the Jussie Smollett case was a \u201cscam\u201d and compared it to the impeachment inquiry. Smollett, an actor on the show Empire, claimed back in January that he was attacked by two men yelling racist and homophobic slurs at him. However, authorities later said that he had staged the attack to gain sympathetic publicity. Trump is now addressing the annual convention of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in Chicago, and he opened his remarks by addressing the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The president told the audience of the Isis leader: \u201cHe was a sick and depraved man, and now he\u2019s dead. He\u2019s dead. Dead as a door nail.\u201d Trump also took a swipe at his predecessor, Barack Obama, saying: \u201c[Baghdadi] should\u2019ve been killed years ago. Another president should\u2019ve gotten him.\u201d The US district judge who ordered the justice department to grant the House judiciary committee access to grand jury material redacted from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report has given the panel until noon tomorrow to respond to the DOJ\u2019s request for a stay. The DOJ is appealing judge Beryl Howell\u2019s ruling and asked for a stay on her order to turn over the material by Wednesday. However, the judge did not immediately grant the stay. The debate continues to rage about the \u201cLock him up\u201d chant that was started during Game 5 of the World Series last night, when the camera panned to Trump in the audience. Some commentators, including Joe Scarborough from MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, equated the jeering to the \u201cLock her up!\u201d chants about Hillary Clinton that became a frequent occurrence during Trump\u2019s 2016 rallies. However, others argued the chant was merited given the allegations facing Trump in connection to the impeachment inquiry. From the president of the liberal thinktank Center for American Progress: George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, even listed the potential crimes Trump could be charged with. Trump has arrived in Chicago for fundraising events and a speech at the annual conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, where he is expected to sign an executive order on \u201cthe root causes of crime\u201d and law enforcement recruitment. Aboard Air Force One en route to the Windy City, chefs served a Halloween-themed breakfast. Trump continues to boast about the US military raid of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound, which resulted in the Isis leader\u2019s death. However, Trump\u2019s rushed decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria reportedly jeopardized military leaders\u2019 carefully crafted plans to confront Baghdadi. The New York Times reports: For months, intelligence officials had kept Mr. Trump apprised of what he had set as a top priority, the hunt for Mr. al-Baghdadi, the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist. But Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal order three weeks ago disrupted the meticulous planning underway and forced Pentagon officials to speed up the plan for the risky night raid before their ability to control troops, spies and reconnaissance aircraft disappeared with the pullout, the officials said. Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death in the raid on Saturday, they said, occurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump\u2019s actions. As expected, the justice department has filed an appeal to challenge a judge\u2019s ruling that DOJ officials must grant the House judiciary committee access to grand jury material previously redacted from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. The DOJ is also requesting a stay of the ruling until the matter is resolved, given that the previous judge ordered officials to hand over the material by Wednesday. US district judge Beryl Howell ruled on Friday the DOJ was \u201cwrong\u201d to argue that existing law prevented the department from sharing the information with Congress. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, issued a statement celebrating the \u201cthoughtful ruling,\u201d but legal experts warned that an appeal in the case was inevitable. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, called Charles Kupperman\u2019s failure to testify in the impeachment inquiry \u201cdeeply regrettable\u201d and suggested it \u201cmay warrant a contempt proceeding\u201d against the former deputy national security adviser. The California Democrat warned that the White House ordering Kupperman to ignore the congressional subpoena would be taken as \u201cadditional evidence of obstruction.\u201d Schiff added: \u201cIf this witness had something to say that would be helpful to the White House, they would want him to come and testify. They plainly don\u2019t.\u201d The committee chairman also interestingly ruled out the possibility of going to court to compel Kupperman and other witnesses to testify. Schiff said: \u201cWe are not willing to let the White House engage us in a lengthy game of rope a dope in the courts, so we press ahead.\u201d In a bit of good news today, the military dog that was injured during the Baghdadi raid has recovered and \u201creturned to duty,\u201d according to a US official. Trump said yesterday that the \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201ctalented\u201d dog had been injured in the raid after the Isis leader detonated a suicide vest. However, doubts over the president\u2019s account of Baghdadi\u2019s final moments have intensified amid reports that the White House had only seen overhead surveillance footage of the raid at the time of Trump\u2019s press conference yesterday. Meanwhile, Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, has appeared on Capitol Hill \u2013 reportedly to review the transcript from his deposition earlier this month. Reports indicate that Sondland\u2019s testimony was contradicted by Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine who said he was told Ukrainian military assistance was frozen to demand public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Some Democrats on the House committees leading the impeachment inquiry have accused Sondland of lying under oath, a claim that the ambassador\u2019s lawyer has denied. Charles Kupperman, the former deputy to John Bolton at the national security council, has officially declined to appear for his scheduled testimony in the impeachment inquiry against Trump. Kupperman\u2019s lawyer said in a letter last night to the House committees leading the inquiry that his client would not testify until a judge ruled on whether he should comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House order not to appear. Just before departing for Chicago, Trump told reporters that some of the footage from the raid of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s Syrian compound, which resulted in the Isis leader\u2019s death, may be released. The president also claimed that he did not give the House intelligence committee advance notice of the raid because the panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, Adam Schiff, is \u201cthe biggest leaker in Washington.\u201d Meanwhile, doubts have grown over Trump\u2019s account of Baghdadi\u2019s final moments. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi reports: US officials who also watched the feed have declined to echo details of Trump\u2019s macabre account of the Isis\u2019s leader death on Saturday, including that Baghdadi was \u2018whimpering, crying and screaming all the way\u2019. ... The White House monitored the Syria operation through video feeds that Trump said was \u2018as though you were watching a movie\u2019. The footage piped into the situation room would have consisted of overhead surveillance shots of the dark compound with heat signatures differentiating between US fighters and others, intelligence and military officials told the New York Times. Those cameras would not have been able to peer into the tunnel where Baghdadi died, nor provide audio proof of his conduct during the last minutes of his life. The lawyer for Charles Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser under John Bolton, reportedly said his client would not testify in the impeachment inquiry until a judge rules on whether he should comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House order not to appear. This could delay Kupperman\u2019s testimony significantly, given that no hearing has yet been scheduled in the case, per NBC News. Good morning, live blog readers! As Washington takes stock of an eventful weekend in foreign affairs and sports, the House impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump continues today with the testimony of another key witness \u2013 or at least that\u2019s the plan. Charles Kupperman, the former official who served as John Bolton\u2019s deputy at the national security council, was subpoenaed to talk to House investigators this morning about Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. However, Kupperman filed a lawsuit on Friday seeking a judge\u2019s ruling on whether he should comply with the congressional subpoena or the White House\u2019s order to ignore the investigation because it is supposedly illegitimate. It\u2019s not yet clear whether Kupperman will arrive for his testimony, but House investigators sent him a letter Saturday warning that their subpoena \u201cremains in full force\u201d and that his potential absence \u201cwill constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding\u201d. But the House Democrats leading the inquiry may soon not even need Kupperman\u2019s testimony. Reports emerged last week that Bolton is in talks to sit for a deposition with the committees leading the inquiry, and the former national security adviser may have even more insight into the Ukraine controversy than Kupperman does. In an interview yesterday, Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, called Bolton \u201ca very important witness\u201d but warned that the White House would likely try to block his appearance before the panels. Schiff added: \u201cObviously he has very relevant information, and we do want him to come in and testify.\u201d Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping its eye on: Trump is traveling to Chicago for a speech at the annual conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and fundraising events. He will fly back to Washington in time for the White House\u2019s Halloween Party. Mike Pence is speaking in Louisiana. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is appearing on \u201cLate Night\u201d with Seth Meyers. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "Larry Yeung* cuts a lonely figure in the police force these days. He joined more than 20 years ago because it appealed to his sense of justice. Proudly showing off his graduation tie, he reminisces about his desire as a young recruit to serve society and help the disadvantaged. \u201cI abide by what the force has taught me,\u201d he says, showing a list of values and mission he signed up for. Among them is \u201cupholding the rule of law\u201d, \u201cimpartiality and compassion\u201d and \u201crespect for the rights of members of the public.\u201d But the recent political crisis in Hong Kong, which has seen police using violent tactics to crack down on increasingly radical protests, has tested his loyalty to the force. \u201cPolice should protect citizens, but instead, we\u2019ve become a tool of the authorities for \u2018stability maintenance\u2019,\u201d Yeung says, with a rueful smile. \u201cOur top officials are hiding and we\u2019ve become their shields.\u201d Animosity between police and citizens has grown to an alarming level as ever-increasing amounts of tear gas, rubber bullets, beatings and water cannon have been used to deal with the resentful crowds. On 1 October, police fired a live round for the first time, injuring an 18-year-old in the chest. Three days later, a 14-year-old was shot in the thigh. In the past four months more than 2,700 arrests have been made. Protesters have also resorted to increasingly radical acts in what they see as justified retaliation. Masked activists have thrown bricks and petrol bombs at police, trashed metro stations and shops seen as pro-Beijing. They have lit street fires and even attacked police or people suspected of being undercover officers or just being pro-government. Earlier this month, a home-made bomb exploded and a police officer was slashed in the neck by a protester. Indiscriminate beatings by police gave rise to rumours of covered-up deaths. Widely circulated stories about physical and sexual abuse in a remote police detention centre have led to an unprecedented level of anger and resentment against officers. Yeung disapproves of his colleagues\u2019 behaviour, something that has driven a wedge between them. \u201cWhen we were in the academy, we were taught to use only the minimum amount of force. It\u2019s not for us to deliver punishment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now, the majority of the police think the \u2018rioters\u2019 need to be punished \u2026 they attack people indiscriminately, even non-protesters.\u201d \u201cThe awful thing is, the majority of police don\u2019t see it as a problem.\u201d \u201cWhen they watch footage of police beating people, they shout for joy: \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re hitting the cockroaches!\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t give any consideration to their high ideals of freedom and democracy.\u201d Asked why police have resorted to increasingly brutal acts, Yeung says many of his colleagues were angry and felt entitled to abuse their powers. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Lucifer effect\u2019\u2013 power drives people crazy. They\u2019re angry and they need an outlet. But this is sacrificing the reputation of the police force.\u201d Yeung says officers are no longer required to be accountable for their acts. While dealing with protests, riot police officers now wear black masks and do not show their warrant cards and their police numbers on their uniforms. Internal rules require police to write a report every time they use batons, pistols and pepper spray, but many simply don\u2019t bother anymore, he says. Yeung has tried to make his colleagues see things from another perspective, but this has led to him being labelled a traitor. \u201cI tried to explain to them what civil disobedience is about. Like, if your boss refused to grant you your entitled holidays, then you take sick leave. It\u2019s about fighting against the system through legal means,\u201d he says. The government has repeatedly refused to establish an independent commission to investigate police brutality, and this is sparking more even more public anger as it is one of several demands that protesters insist must be fulfilled. Yeung believes the authorities\u2019 endorsement of harsh crackdown is actually fuelling protests. Last month, a pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper reported that China\u2019s public security minister had become a deputy head at the Communist party\u2019s Hong Kong Macau liaison committee \u2013 an unprecedented move analysts say has bolstered the control of the city\u2019s police force by China, which sees crackdown as a natural response to unrest \u201cI think they want to push terror to an extreme. Beat them and arrest as many as you can, and people will be too scared to come out again,\u201d he says of his bosses\u2019 attitudes. Yeung sympathises with the protesters: \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a policeman I\u2019d be out on the streets like them.\u201d Even though Yeung thinks differently from many of his colleagues, in the eyes of protesters, he is still a \u201cblack cop\u201d. \u201cOne time, a group of young people yelled at me when I was inside a police van. I held up my arm as if to say it has nothing to do with me. But how can I not be one of them?\u201d \u201cI have not come out to correct my colleagues\u2019 faults \u2013 that is complicity.\u201d Asked whether he had thought about resigning, Yeung, in his 40s, says he has a young family and that makes it difficult. \u201cBut I won\u2019t rule out that possibility,\u201d he says. Yeung, a Christian, insisted that his mission was to help the weak and to speak up about inequality. He maintains he can only support a government that serves the people. \u201cIf the country is built with flesh and blood, if people\u2019s freedoms and lives have to be sacrificed for \u2018development\u2019, I\u2019d rather not have that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe very least I can do is to refrain from doing evil myself and to remind my colleagues not to get excessive. But they often ask: \u2018So, which side are you on?\u2019\u201d *name has been changed to protect identity",
