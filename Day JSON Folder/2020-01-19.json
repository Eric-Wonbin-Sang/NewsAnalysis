While it was a relatively safe bet that the Chiefs would make a deep playoff push, the Titans were not really expected to make it this far. Especially not whey had to knock off both the reigning Super Bowls champions in the New England Patriots and then the almost certain league MVP in the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 Lamar Jackson. On the road, no less. An impressive feat from a Titans team didn\u2019t even win their own division, they placed second in the AFC South behind the now-eliminated Houston Texans, yet here they are just a win away from <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2020/1/17/21070450/tennessee-titans-improbable-playoff-run-nashville-fandom-chiefs-ravens-patriots\">an improbable Super Bowl appearance</a>.</p> <p>This will Kansas City\u2019s biggest challenge yet, however. Thanks to quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs\u2019 offense looks nearly unstoppable. They fell behind to a 24-0 hole against the Texans during the AFC Divisional Round, <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2020/1/17/21070450/tennessee-titans-improbable-playoff-run-nashville-fandom-chiefs-ravens-patriots\">only to bounce-back to win 51-31</a>, rattling off 41 unanswered points during one stretch of the game. While he was overshadowed by a regular season injury, not to mention Jackson\u2019s rise and a stellar year from the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 Russell Wilson, Mahomes continues to be one of the most dangerous threats in the league and will have a bigger arsenal of weapons than the Jackson of the Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady had.<br></p> <p>The Titans, however, have a Hulk or at least the closest thing to one in running back Derrick Henry. Henry has been so dominant that he\u2019s practically rewritten the rules of being a RB, rushing for at least 180 yards in his three last games. Henry has been so good that quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who replaced a struggling Marcus Mariota during the regular season, hasn\u2019t thrown for more than 100 yards in either playoff game. With Henry on this side, he has been able to help his team win while working primarily as a game manager.<br></p> <p>He might not get that luxury in this AFC Championship Game. The Chiefs are going to put up numbers against the Titans, so they will have to prove that they can keep up with the Chiefs offensively. It\u2019s a tall task, but after the previous two games, it\u2019s foolish to completely write off their chances. In the meantime, you can send us your thoughts on today\u2019s NFL action either via email (to <a href=\"mailto:hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com\">hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com</a>) or via tweet (to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt\"> @HunterFelt</a>).

The Titans should bear in mind that, despite Patrick Mahomes\u2019 heroic performance during last Sunday\u2019s destruction of the Houston Texans, Ryan Tannehill and co are more than capable of beating the Chiefs. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401127981\">they did so in November</a>, and that was with Mahomes playing at the height of his considerable powers. Back then Tennessee won the day by doing the simple things well: Tannehill was interception-free, special teams chipped in with a blocked field goal in the 35-32 victory and Brett Kern pinned the Chiefs back in their own territory with a 51.0-yard punting average. And then of course there was Derrick Henry, who ran for 188 yards, with the Titans outrushing the Chiefs by 225 yards to 97. Side note: Andy Reid is 1-8 all time against the Titans.</p> <p><strong>What the Chiefs need to do to win:</strong> In short, if Mahomes plays well they\u2019ll probably win. Having said that, the Titans are not a great match-up for the Chiefs: Henry has been brilliant this postseason, Tannehill is a threat with his legs too and the Chiefs had the seventh-worst rushing defense in the league during the regular season. (Having said that, they were good at stopping the Texans on the ground last week.) But even if the Titans do maul them on the ground, Mahomes has the ability, and the weapons, to outscore pretty much any team in the league.</p> <p>You can read the full article below:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/17/nfc-afc-championships-games-packers-49ers-chiefs-titans-nfl\">NFL conference championship picks: a Chiefs-Packers Super Bowl?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Read the Guardian\u2019s game report for the AFC Championship Game here That was an exciting game, close to the very end, but the aftermath was basically what we expected. Now it\u2019s time to turn our attention to the NFC Championship Game, which David Lengel has already begun covering over here. Thanks to everyone for following out liveblog of the AFC Championship Game. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, FINAL The Chiefs are going into victory formation here. The crowd goes crazy and time goes off the clock, and well they should as the Kansas City Chiefs are headed to Super Bowl 54. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 1:20, 4th quarter And there\u2019s a false start on the Titans, so forget about those five yards they just got from the Chiefs\u2019 penalty. Tannehill throws to Humphries, who picks up nine yards before getting taken to the ground. Tannehill\u2019s next pass is incomplete. We\u2019re at 3rd &amp; 6, Tannehill throws a rather nifty throw but Mathieu manages to break it up. That\u2019s 4th &amp; 6 and probably the game for the Titans. The Chiefs get Mahomes to run and he isn\u2019t able to play Houdini here and he finally goes down. That\u2019s a turnover on downs and this one is over. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 2:00, 4th quarter A hands in the face penalty gives the Titans a first down and five yards. That will put them at their own 31 but they only have two minutes between them and elimination. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 2:08, 4th quarter The Chiefs gets a delay of game penalty. The punt goes into the end zone and so does one of the refs, who accidentally gets knocked down by a Chiefs player. He stays in the game however. The Titans start at their own 20 here. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 2:20, 4th quarter The officials call a \u201ctoo many men on the field\u201d penalty on the Titans, one they missed on the previous play. Not exactly the refs\u2019 finest moment today. Because there was no play, the Titans get their timeout back though. Williams gets stuffed on two consecutive drives. It\u2019s 3rd and 9 here for the Chiefs. Mahomes throws it incomplete to Mahomes, so the Chiefs are going to punt it and give the Titans a chance at a miracle ending here. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 3:46, 4th quarter Mahomes launches one and draw a flag on Tennessee. That\u2019s pass interference for 41 yards and, more crucially, an automatic first down for Kansas City. Williams is stuffed for a loss and the Titans take another timeout. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 4:07, 4th quarter Williams gets pushed out for no gain. That\u2019s exactly what Kansas City didn\u2019t want to do here. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 10 and no time has gone off the clock. Mahomes gets sacked on the next play, the Titans call a timeout. A three-and-out here would be titanic. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 4:18, 4th quarter Hill fields the Titans punt and brings it to the Chiefs 19 where the Kansas City will start what they hope will be a super-slow, methodical drive. Titans 24-35 Chiefs, 4:18, 4th quarter The fake punt breathes new life into the team here. Tannehill throws to Smith for eight yards and then throws to Davis, that\u2019s good for 22 yards. The Chiefs manage to sack Tannehill on 2st and 10 but on the very next play, Tannehill connects with Firkser. It\u2019s a touchdown, scored in a near blink of the eye, which is exactly what the Titans needed here. The extra point? It\u2019s good and we still have got a game going here. Titans 17-35 Chiefs, 5:00, 4th quarter Oh it\u2019s a fake punt! Punter Brett Kern finds Amari Hooker for 28 yards and a first down. The Titans are still alive, they\u2019re at the Kansas City 50. Titans 17-35 Chiefs, 6:22, 4th quarter The Titans are going to need to score here and they\u2019re going to have to do it super-fast. They\u2019ll start at their own 20, where Henry will be tackled for a loss of six. That was the exact opposite of what they needed there. 2nd &amp; 16 now. Tannehill has to air it out and he nearly finds Sorensen for a catch but they just don\u2019t connect. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 16. Smith is stopped well before the first down. It\u2019s 4th and 8 and Vrabel is\u2026 punting. This feels like kinda giving up here. That was a 50 yard catch for Watkins and it looked even longer because this has been such a run-heavy game. Of course, as they say, establishing the run makes passing even more effective. The Chiefs can just beat you too many ways. Yes I\u2019m rattling off cliches here, but sometimes cliches exist for a reason. Titans 17-35 Chiefs, 7:33, 4th quarter Williams again on the next two downs, gets to the Chiefs 40. It\u2019s 3rd and 6 and a chance for the Titans to get a stop and get the ball back. Instead Mahomes throws an incredible rainbow of a throw to Sammy Watkins. Mahomes makes the catch and gets to the end zone. There\u2019s a call against the defense on the play, but the Chiefs are going to obviously decline that and take the touchdown. The extra point is good and that\u2019s probably the knockout blow against Tennessee here with less than eight minutes left on the clock. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 9:02, 4th quarter Mahomes throws to Watkins for a 11-yard gain. They\u2019re on their own 24 and have yet another first down. Williams goes off, gets five yards. 2nd 7 5, Mahomes finds Watkins who has to spin around to connect with the pass but does so with almost balletic ease. That\u2019s yet another Kansas City first down. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 11:13, 4th quarter I misspelled \u201cbunt\u201d as \u201cpunt\u201d that last entry, my apologies. The baseball cheating scandal is still on my mind probably. Back in the football game, Williams picks up a yard and Titans head coach Mike Vrabel uses one of his timeouts. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 12:05, 4th quarter The Titans have to punt and they do nail the Chiefs to their own 12 yard line. That\u2019s a start, now they need to make sure that the Chiefs don\u2019t go on another long, productive drive. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 12:48, 4th quarter The Titans need points here, they don\u2019t need to go for the touchdown immediately. They just need\u2026 oh and now the announcers have copied what I was going to say here. They just need to get a little bit closer. It\u2019s a touchback. On 1st down, Tannehill finds Davis who gets them to their own 40. Not a bad start, but on the next carry Tannehill passes to Henry who takes a two yard loss. Tannehill finds Brown for 5 yards. It\u2019s 3rd and 7 and the pressure pushes Tannehill down to the 45. Huge, huge stop by the KC defense. Titans 17-28 Chiefs, 14:50, 4th quarter Mahomes first pass is to Sherman, who can\u2019t quite catch it. No worries, he just hands it to Williams again and he\u2019s into the end zone. Touchdown Chiefs! The extra point is good. It\u2019s a two possession game for Kansas City. Been all about the ground game, really. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, end of the 3rd quarter 1st &amp; 10, Williams gets four yards and only then does Mahomes go back to the passing game, finding Hill for 15 yards. It\u2019s 1st and goal at the Tennessee 3 at the end of the third. It feels like the dam is about to break for the Titans. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 1:13, 3rd quarter Darwin Thompson goes off for seven yards. Since it\u2019s working out for him quite well, Mahomes decides to run again and it\u2019s another outstanding effort. He gets 11 yards to the Titans 22 and it feels like all the pressure is on the Titans. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 3:18, 3rd quarter Williams gets the ball one more time, this time just a mere yard, before Mahomes finally throws, this one\u2019s to Watkins who gets to the Titans 47 but not a first down. It doesn\u2019t matter, Mahomes takes care of the ball on his own, taking off and getting that fresh set of downs. Hill runs for seven yards here, the Chiefs are at the Tennessee 40. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 5:11, 3rd quarter Williams gets six yards on his first carry of the drive. Williams again gets the ball and he gets three yards here. 3rd &amp; 1, which is quite manageable for the Chiefs, who go to Williams for the third straight time. That\u2019s a first down that will take them to their own 41. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 7:01, 3rd quarter Hardman returns the Titans punt to the 27 yard line, so that\u2019s where the Chiefs will begin. As uptempo as this game has been, it\u2019s weird to see two straight possessions without scoring. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 7:01, 3rd quarter Chiefs have too many men on the field, which is a five yard penalty that will make this 1st &amp; 5 situation for the Titans, who give it to Henry who\u2019s good for four yards. Henry can\u2019t quite get the first down on his next carry here, so it\u2019s first and extraordinarily short here. The Kansas City defense gets their stop but there is a flag on the play. It\u2019s a holding call on the offense. It\u2019s 3rd and 11. Tannehill has to scramble here on the next play, but unlike with Mahomes in the first half, there\u2019s nothing going and he\u2019s tackled well before the first down. It\u2019s 4th and 4 and the Titans elect to punt. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 9:47, 3rd quarter The Titans will start their first drive at their own 21. Henry gets three yards on first down. 2nd &amp; 7, Tannehill throws a ground-bouncer. 3rd &amp; 7 here while Arrowhead gets loud. This time around, Tannehill is able to throw a super low throw that Humphries is able to cradle and keep from hitting the ground. That\u2019s a first down. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 12:40, 3rd quarter Mahomes scrambled for the first down. The Chiefs are keeping this alive for another set of downs. They\u2019re at their own 47 where Mahomes throws one to Thompson but the two aren\u2019t on the same page. That\u2019s incomplete and that\u2019s 2nd &amp; 10. The Kansas City defense gets to Mahomes and it\u2019s a 3rd and 10 and the Titans have a shot here at shutting the Chiefs down. 3rd &amp; 10, Mahomes tries to find Hill but it bounces just out of his hands. Chiefs have to punt here and the Titans get a crucial stop here. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 12:40, 3rd quarter Well, they did call it a catch, so that\u2019s a first down. Williams picks up eight yards on the next play. Good challenge by Reid there. I\u2019m going to guess the call will stand, if only for insufficient evidence. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 12:58, 3rd quarter Mahomes scrambles for a bit, but this time he doesn\u2019t get away with anything and he simply throws it away. 2nd &amp; 10. Next play, Robinson gets to the seven before going out of bounds. 3rd &amp; 3. Mahomes has plenty of time and does find Watkins, but gets called out-of-bounds. Replay makes it look like he was in bounds, but it might not be enough to overturn it. Andy Reid has challenged it regardless. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 14:20, 3rd quarter Williams picks up seven yards in his first run of the second half. On 2nd &amp; 3, Williams gets the first down. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, 15:00, 3rd quarter After a penalty, the Chiefs will start at their own 10. This feels like the perfectly correct analysis here. The Titans might be playing at close to their best football here and that just might not be enough if Kansas City doesn\u2019t slip. I mean, what exactly happened here? It\u2019s the eternal question: great play or defensive breakdown. Gotta say, there were elements of both here. For most of the first half, the Titans looked right in this but the Chiefs, as they tend to operate, are definitely back in control. How their first drive of the third quarter goes might tell us a lot about whether this continue to be a close game or if this is set up for a blowout. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, end of the first half Tannehill will just take a knee to end the first half. The Chiefs are ahead and they will have the ball to start the second half. Titans 17-21 Chiefs, :11, 2nd quarter Mahomes throws it incomplete on the next down. On his next play, it looks like he\u2019s trying to find a receiver but can\u2019t quite find a spare second to stop and throw. It looks like he\u2019s doomed but he finds an exit somehow, like an escape artist working on the fly after his Plans A and B have all failed. He not only runs for the first down, which would be astounding enough on its own, but the end zone itself. That\u2019s a touchdown! The extra point is good! That was ridiculous! Titans 17-14 Chiefs, :54, 2nd quarter The Chiefs are at the Titans 45, where Mahomes scrambles to pick up 7 yards. Mahomes\u2019s next throw goes incomplete. On 3rd and 3, he finds Watkins and they\u2019re at the 27 yard line. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 1:09, 2nd quarter Mahomes finds Williams again, this one\u2019s a gain for 8 yards. That means it\u2019s 2nd and 2, He gets the pass to Hill who weaves back and forth for what ends up being a loss of about three yards. 3rd &amp; 4 and a good chance here for the Titans defense. Except not, Mahomes finds Kelce for a first down instead. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 1:42, 2nd quarter Oh hey we\u2019re getting a punt here. I almost forgot those were a thing. Jordan Lucas gets the ball at the 23 but there\u2019s a holding penalty on the play that will push them back to the 14. Mahomes doesn\u2019t mind too much, he connects with Williams for 17 yards. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 2:00, 2nd quarter Raymond gets 20 yards on the kickoff. Henry gets the ball and Henry actually gets stuffed for a mere one yard gain. Credit Chris Jones on defense for that. The next time around, it\u2019s no gain. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 9 and we might not actually see scoring this drive. Tannehill finds Dion Lewis, who doesn\u2019t make it to the first down. That\u2019s Tennessee\u2019s first three-and-out. Kansas City will get the ball back at the two minute warning plus they will get the ball at the start of the third quarter. Titans 17-14 Chiefs, 4:03, 2nd quarter Mahomes throws it away on 1st down. 2nd and 10, Mahomes finds Hill who waltzes into the endzone. How\u2019s THAT for a quick answer. The extra point is good and, you know what, this is looking like it\u2019s going to be fun. Titans 17-7 Chiefs, 5:03, 2nd quarter On the next play, there\u2019s illegal contact called on the Titans defense for an automatic first down. They\u2019ll be on their own 42. Mahomes finds Demarcus Robinson who gives them 24 yards. Mahomes then finds Watkins for 13 yard gain and this is what Kansas City\u2019s offense does: eats up yards very quickly. They\u2019re now at the Titans 20. Titans 17-7 Chiefs, 6:32, 2nd quarter Hardman goes off on a 35 yard run right up to the Chiefs 37, where they will start their next drive. Williams gets the ball and picks up a mere yard. I normally try to avoid writing run-on sentences but it was hard not to on that particular sequence for the Titans. It was really a series of interconnected \u201cand then\u201d plays. Just a seamless flow of play calls. Rather impressive, taking over nine minutes of play time. Titans 17-7 Chiefs, 6:39, 2nd quarter Henry picks up four yards and then they bring in Marcus Mariota for a play here, he picks up five yards to get the Chiefs 2. On 3rd &amp; 1, Tannehill is back in the game and Henry never left. He gets to the Kansas City 2 and it\u2019s 2nd and goal. With all the attention on Henry, Tannehill finds Dennis Kelly instead for the touch down and the Chiefs are up 10 after the extra point is good. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 9:05, 2nd quarter So, now that\u2019s 1st and 20 and ouch Tyrann Matthieu hits Davis for a two yard loss. That\u2019s 2nd and 22 and this drive is going backwards. Tannehill\u2019s next pass is incomplete. 3rd &amp; 22, there\u2019s a completion short of first down BUT there\u2019s a flag. Let\u2019s see what this is Oh man, pass interference on the offense. Automatic first down and the Titans drive stays alive. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 10:39, 2nd quarter Henry picks up fie yards. Tannehill finds Brown again to get them the first down at the Chiefs 13. They look to be in control, but there\u2019s a flag on the next play. That\u2019s holding on the offense and that\u2019s a 10 yard penalty. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 12:30, 2nd quarter Tannehill goes deep but just a bit too deep. It\u2019s an incomplete pass. He gives it to henry who gets 3 yards. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 7\u2026 and there\u2019s a neutral zone infraction on Kansas City. Yet another avoidable Kansas City penalty and it makes it 3rd &amp; 2 and Tannehill finds Humphries for a first down. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 13:46, 2nd quarter The five yard penalty doesn\u2019t hurt them, as Tannehill finds Corey Davis for an 18 yard gain and then gets it to Henry who barrels through for a 13 yard gain and just like that, the Titans are right at the Kansas City 40. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, end of the first quarter The Chiefs kick off and it\u2019s a touchback. The Titans start at their own 25 as a result, Tannehill finds MyCole Pruitt for a nine yard gain. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 1 and, right before the first quarter is set to come to an end, the Titans get a false start penalty for 5 yards. Not\u2026 not a pristine way to end the first fifteen minutes here. Titans 10-7 Chiefs, 1:46, first quarter Mahomes makes a spectacular throw to Kelce almost in the end zone, but it\u2019s out of bounds. There is a call on the Titans\u2019 defense. That\u2019s a five yard penalty and an automatic first down. On his next pass, Mahomes gets it to Hill and he gets it in for the first Kansas City touchdown. Now that\u2019s how you respond. The extra point is good. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 1:35, first quarter Hardman picks up 8 yards. And they\u2019re at the 16 now. On 2nd and 2, Williams gets to the 13 for another first down. This is more like the Chiefs we\u2019ve seen. Tennessee\u2019s Rashaan Evans is injured on the play. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 2:54, first quarter The Chiefs are keeping the offense on the field. Probably the right move given the situation and it absolutely works out as Mahomes finds Kelce for a first down to put them on the Titans 24. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 2:58, first quarter Mahomes just throws the ball away on first down. His next pas s is to Sammy Watkins, who can\u2019t finagle it. It\u2019s 3rd and 10 here, Mahomes scrambles and finds Travis Kelce, it\u2019s 4th and 2 on the Titans 28. The Chiefs take a timeout to decide what they\u2019re doing here. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 4:28, first quarter And THERE is Mahomes, who throws a deep pass to Tyreek Hill who just barely gets the catch, that\u2019s a 26 yard game and in an instant they\u2019re on the Tennessee 36. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 5:09, first quarter Williams picks up three yards for Kansas City\u2019s first 1st down of the day. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 5:46, first quarter The good news for Kansas City is that they have a love of time and they know they can put up pinball numbers. Hardman is here to return the kick and he gets about 19 yards to get them to their own 26. Mahomes finds Damien Williams for a nine yard gain on first down. Titans 10-0 Chiefs, 5:52, first quarter Tannehill finds Jonnu Smith for a 22 yard gain, and on the next play, they hand it to Henry and he drives into the end zone for the game\u2019s first touchdown. And the extra kick is good. The Titans are up 10 early and it\u2019s looking like the Chiefs will once again look to dig themselves out of an early hole. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 7:13, first quarter Henry can only squeak in about a yard on second down. It\u2019s 3rd and 2 and a big task here from Kansas City\u2019s defense. And they do a decent job, Tannehill\u2019s pass gets blocked by Terrell Suggs. Because of their kicking situation, partly at least, the Titans decide to go for it on 4th and 2. And they get it! Adam Humphries with a three-yard catch to get them to the Kansas City 26. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 8:09, first quarter And now the Titans get the Chiefs to commit encroachment and that\u2019s an extra five yards for the Titans, who are in a 1st &amp; 5 situation. They give it to Henry who picks up about two yards on the carry. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 8:35, first quarter The Titans draw the Chiefs offsides for a five-yard penalty which gives them an automatic first down without having to call an actual play. Pretty sneaky sis. That will just be an incomplete pass. It\u2019s now 3rd &amp; 5 for the Titans. Life in the \u201cWhat Is Even A Catch\u201d League: Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 8:40, first quarter They decide to go with Henry again, because why not, and he gets them half-way to another first down picking up 5 yards to get to the 42 yard line but Tannehill\u2019s next pass is intercepted by Kansas City\u2019s Bashaud Breeland. Or is it? The play is under review to see if hit the ground and is therefore an incomplete pass. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 9:29, first quarter Henry with his first big run on the day, a gain of eleven for an easy first down. It\u2019s like watching a knife cutting through butter. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 10:09, first quarter And the Titans will start at their own 42 after a Kalif Raymond run for about nine yards. That\u2019s pretty decent field percentage. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 10:14, first quarter And Mahomes is sacked by Kamalel Correa for a loss and his next pass ends up incomplete. That\u2019s a good defensive stand for Tennessee. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 11:29, first quarter Mecole Harman takes the kickoff to the Kansas City 21, where the Chiefs will start their drive. Mahomes scrambles under pressure and picks up two yards. Titans 3-0 Chiefs, 11:33, first quarter Tannehill throws three straight incompletions and the Titans bring out the field goal unit. Greg Joseph, who has barely been used, hits a 30-yarder to put Tennessee on the board, but that could have gone worse for the Chiefs. Titans 0-0 Chiefs, 12:25, first quarter Henry gets another yard on his next carry. Tannehill finds Corey Davis for a first down and then hands off for Henry who picks up four more yards to get them to Kansas City\u2019s 12 yard line. Titans 0-0 Chiefs, 14:18, first quarter Derrick Henry gets fours yards on his first carry. On 2nd &amp; 6, Tannehill passes to A.J. Brown who goes off for 37 yards. The Titans are right there on the Chiefs\u2019 29. Titans 0-0 Chiefs, 15:00, first quarter And we\u2019re off, the Titans will start around their own 35 after bringing in the opening kick. Kansas City wins the toss and they have decided to defer. The Titans will start the game on offense, while the Chiefs will get the ball coming out of halftime. National Anthem It\u2019s performer by retired Navy officer. Generald Wilson. He has a nice, resonant voice and doesn\u2019t try to do too much with it in the beginning untl the very end with an extended \u201ctheeeere.\u201d 8/10. The Chiefs are being introduce on the field, so we\u2019re getting closer to actual game time here. Am I... am I the only one getting nonstop ads for Mike Bloomberg? I am the exact opposite of a stick-to-sports guy, but I am not sure if I need to think about the 2020 primaries any more than I already have to. I will post anything Malkovich related. The NFL Today guys are giving their predictions now. I always wonder if they talk early beforehand to make sure that they don\u2019t all give the same picks. It\u2019s 3-1 for Kansas City among the announcers, which sounds about right: the Chiefs should be favorites but not writing off the Titans completely. Today\u2019s big celebrity guest? That would apparently be Paul Rudd. Will he be doing the war chant? Because, uh, that sounds like it will backfire. The winner of this game will go on to face the winner of the NFC Championship Game between the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. This feels like it will be a closer game, if we could be guaranteed to see the Aaron Rodgers of a few seasons ago I would have no hesitations about chosing the Packers but I think the 49ers, who will be playing at home, have the edge here. Predictions Man, it\u2019s just hard to pick the Titans here. The Chiefs are clearly the better team on paper and it looks like a complete mismatch. However, we could have said that before their games against New England and Baltimore. Still, my gut is telling me that there won\u2019t be much drama here after the second half, if the Chiefs find a rhythm here I don\u2019t see the Titans being able to fight back. I hope I\u2019m wrong, it\u2019s way more entertaining to covers these games when there\u2019s lots of drama, but I\u2019m going with Chiefs 41-17 Titans. Have your own predictions? Feel free to send them our way, either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (to @HunterFelt). Andy Reid Okay, here\u2019s one potential area of concern for the Chiefs: Head coach Andy Reid\u2019s team has gone 1-8 lifetime against the Titans. On top of that, his record in championship games? 1-5. The Chiefs are going to want to have a decent lead built up by the end of the fourth quarter because Reid is notoriously bad at clock management in key games to the point where it\u2019s become something clich\u00e9. If the Titans pull off the upset today, there\u2019s absolutely going to be some questions on Reid despite his inarguable NFL success. Email from Ezra Finkelstein: This hasn\u2019t got the attention it merits, but Tenessee Titans\u2019 kicking situation is by far the worst in the teams that made the playoffs. They made 1 out of 15 last attempted Field Goal attempt, began the year with Codey Parkey, he of double doink noiterity and wil be in big trouble if a kick is the option late on the game. Perhaps something to watch for. One wonders if this will effect their decision-making, Field goal range might mean something different for them. Preamble Welcome all to the AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the\u2026 wait, hold up, the Tennessee Titans? While it was a relatively safe bet that the Chiefs would make a deep playoff push, the Titans were not really expected to make it this far. Especially not whey had to knock off both the reigning Super Bowls champions in the New England Patriots and then the almost certain league MVP in the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 Lamar Jackson. On the road, no less. An impressive feat from a Titans team didn\u2019t even win their own division, they placed second in the AFC South behind the now-eliminated Houston Texans, yet here they are just a win away from an improbable Super Bowl appearance. This will Kansas City\u2019s biggest challenge yet, however. Thanks to quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs\u2019 offense looks nearly unstoppable. They fell behind to a 24-0 hole against the Texans during the AFC Divisional Round, only to bounce-back to win 51-31, rattling off 41 unanswered points during one stretch of the game. While he was overshadowed by a regular season injury, not to mention Jackson\u2019s rise and a stellar year from the Seattle Seahawks\u2019 Russell Wilson, Mahomes continues to be one of the most dangerous threats in the league and will have a bigger arsenal of weapons than the Jackson of the Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady had. The Titans, however, have a Hulk or at least the closest thing to one in running back Derrick Henry. Henry has been so dominant that he\u2019s practically rewritten the rules of being a RB, rushing for at least 180 yards in his three last games. Henry has been so good that quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who replaced a struggling Marcus Mariota during the regular season, hasn\u2019t thrown for more than 100 yards in either playoff game. With Henry on this side, he has been able to help his team win while working primarily as a game manager. He might not get that luxury in this AFC Championship Game. The Chiefs are going to put up numbers against the Titans, so they will have to prove that they can keep up with the Chiefs offensively. It\u2019s a tall task, but after the previous two games, it\u2019s foolish to completely write off their chances. In the meantime, you can send us your thoughts on today\u2019s NFL action either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or via tweet (to @HunterFelt). It\u2019s the AFC Championship Game between the Tennessee Titans and the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead stadium. Kickoff is scheduled at 3:05pm EST, but I\u2019ll be back well before then. Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime, here\u2019s our preview of today\u2019s game: What the Titans need to do to win: Ummm, avoid blowing a 24-0 lead? The Titans should bear in mind that, despite Patrick Mahomes\u2019 heroic performance during last Sunday\u2019s destruction of the Houston Texans, Ryan Tannehill and co are more than capable of beating the Chiefs. In fact, they did so in November, and that was with Mahomes playing at the height of his considerable powers. Back then Tennessee won the day by doing the simple things well: Tannehill was interception-free, special teams chipped in with a blocked field goal in the 35-32 victory and Brett Kern pinned the Chiefs back in their own territory with a 51.0-yard punting average. And then of course there was Derrick Henry, who ran for 188 yards, with the Titans outrushing the Chiefs by 225 yards to 97. Side note: Andy Reid is 1-8 all time against the Titans. What the Chiefs need to do to win: In short, if Mahomes plays well they\u2019ll probably win. Having said that, the Titans are not a great match-up for the Chiefs: Henry has been brilliant this postseason, Tannehill is a threat with his legs too and the Chiefs had the seventh-worst rushing defense in the league during the regular season. (Having said that, they were good at stopping the Texans on the ground last week.) But even if the Titans do maul them on the ground, Mahomes has the ability, and the weapons, to outscore pretty much any team in the league. You can read the full article below:",

A report from the World Economic Forum found that only a handful of 82 countries surveyed had put in place policies that would foster social mobility but that a concerted effort to increase opportunities for people to achieve their full potential would have a marked impact on economic performance. The WEF report found that the top five countries for social mobility were all Scandinavian, with only the US and Italy having a weaker performance than Britain among the G7 industrialised nations. The UK scored especially poorly for education and fair wage distribution. Launched to mark the start of the annual meeting of the WEF in Davos, the report was published amid globally organised protests at rising inequality. Njoki Njehu, the pan-Africa coordinator for the Fight Inequality Alliance, said it was time for the billionaire class to be abolished. The WEF said the world\u2019s biggest economies \u2013 the US, China, Japan, Germany and India \u2013 had the most to gain from increasing social mobility, adding that the four priorities were fair wages, social protection, lifelong learning and better working conditions \u201cThe social and economic consequences of inequality are profound and far-reaching: a growing sense of unfairness, precarity, perceived loss of identity and dignity, weakening social fabric, eroding trust in institutions, disenchantment with political processes and an erosion of the social contract, said Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF. \u201cThe response by business and government must include a concerted effort to create new pathways to socioeconomic mobility, ensuring everyone has fair opportunities for success.\u201d In recent decades, the rich have been taking a bigger share of the proceeds of growth and the WEF report said inequality had become entrenched. It said the trend was likely to worsen in an era of technological change and as efforts towards a green economic transition were stepped up. The report said the economic return from lifting social mobility across the board was \u201cconsiderable\u201d: if economies were able to improve their social mobility score by 10 points, GDP would increase by 4.4% by 2030 on top of the societal benefits such investments would bring. Greater social mobility would require a new set of public investments but also needed shifts in business practice, the WEF said.",

They intend to spend the majority of their time there, as they begin independent lives free from any financial oversight from the royal family.</p> \n<p>The couple were forced to sacrifice their royal roles in exchange for \u201ccomplete and absolute\u201d freedom from Buckingham Palace financial scrutiny over commercial deals after being told they could not have it both ways, it is understood.</p> \n<p>During 10 days of \u201cintense\u201d talks between royals and aides after Harry and Meghan\u2019s bombshell announcement, the issue causing the \u201cangst\u201d was how they could embark on commercial enterprises in order to become \u201cfinancially independent\u201d.</p> \n<p>Netflix is among global companies already eyeing them up. The streaming giant\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said of working with the couple: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be interested? Yes, sure.\u201d</p> \n<p>The couple were unwilling to subject themselves to any financial scrutiny or review in future contracts they struck. The trade-off was they could not use their HRH styles, though they retain them.</p> \n<p>In another blow they will no longer be able to officially represent the Queen. The couple was told \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways\u201d and chose not to be constrained \u201cby some sort of review process \u201c by the institution on contracts they signed.</p> \n<p>As questions over their future remain, Meghan\u2019s estranged father, Thomas Markle, has been outspoken in his criticism. Speaking to a Channel 5 documentary, yet to be aired, he said the couple was in danger of \u201cturning into lost souls\u201d .</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are turning it [the royal family] into Walmart with a crown on,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Under the arrangement announced on Saturday their new titles will be Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. They will repay the \u00a32.4m public funds used to refurbish Frogmore House, their official residence in Windsor, which will largely remain empty as they spend the majority of their time in Canada. They will no longer receive public funding through the Sovereign Grant, although will remain funded privately by the Prince of Wales.</p> \n<p>They will retain their patronages, but Harry, a former soldier, will have to give up his honorary military titles, including that of captain general of the Royal Marines, passed on to him by Prince Philip.</p> \n<p>Though \u201crequired\u201d to step down from royal duties, they will still be able to attend family occasions, such as trooping the colour.</p> \n<p>The negotiations are said to have been \u201cfriendly\u201d, in contrast to the \u201churt\u201d and \u201cdisappointment\u201d felt by the Queen, Charles and William over the Sussexes timing of their announcement without forewarning.</p> \n<p>As they embark on the next chapter, they are said to be \u201cvery much feeling their way\u201d. They \u201cunderstand the parameters\u201d and there will be a period of transition to see if it can work. The commercial model has not worked in the past, most notably with the Earl and Countess of Wessex. This has caused the royal family the most \u201cangst\u201d because a model does not exist yet.</p> \n<p>Harry had recently been working as an executive co-producer with chat show host Oprah Winfrey on a series about mental health for Apple TV. Meghan has done a voiceover for a Disney nature film with fees going to a conservation charity. This indicates one direction they might travel in.</p> \n<p>But whether they will escape allegations of cashing in on their status is questionable. Already new video footage, showing the couple at the premiere of Disney\u2019s Lion King in London, is circulating. It shows Harry telling the film\u2019s director Jon Favreau that Meghan is available for voiceover work, with Meghan seemingly joking: \u201cThat\u2019s really why we\u2019re here \u2013 it\u2019s the pitch.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b8630e43-d64f-4597-b31e-948e9c5af14f\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(July 1, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The pair meet in London through friends and begin a relationship.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(October 30, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>News breaks that the prince and Markle are dating.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(November 8, 2016)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Kensington Palace confirms in an unprecedented statement that they are dating.

Expressing his gratitude to the Queen and the rest of his family for their support, he said: \u201cI will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his life to supporting the causes, charities and military communities that are so important to me.\u201d The prince told those gathered at the fundraiser for the charity, which helps young people in Lesotho, that he and Meghan \u201care taking a leap of faith \u2013 thank you for giving me the courage to take the next step\u201d. Harry is expected to fly to Canada within days, to join Meghan, and baby son Archie. They intend to spend the majority of their time there, as they begin independent lives free from any financial oversight from the royal family. The couple were forced to sacrifice their royal roles in exchange for \u201ccomplete and absolute\u201d freedom from Buckingham Palace financial scrutiny over commercial deals after being told they could not have it both ways, it is understood. During 10 days of \u201cintense\u201d talks between royals and aides after Harry and Meghan\u2019s bombshell announcement, the issue causing the \u201cangst\u201d was how they could embark on commercial enterprises in order to become \u201cfinancially independent\u201d. Netflix is among global companies already eyeing them up. The streaming giant\u2019s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said of working with the couple: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be interested? Yes, sure.\u201d The couple were unwilling to subject themselves to any financial scrutiny or review in future contracts they struck. The trade-off was they could not use their HRH styles, though they retain them. In another blow they will no longer be able to officially represent the Queen. The couple was told \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways\u201d and chose not to be constrained \u201cby some sort of review process \u201c by the institution on contracts they signed. As questions over their future remain, Meghan\u2019s estranged father, Thomas Markle, has been outspoken in his criticism. Speaking to a Channel 5 documentary, yet to be aired, he said the couple was in danger of \u201cturning into lost souls\u201d . \u201cThey are turning it [the royal family] into Walmart with a crown on,\u201d he said. Under the arrangement announced on Saturday their new titles will be Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. They will repay the \u00a32.4m public funds used to refurbish Frogmore House, their official residence in Windsor, which will largely remain empty as they spend the majority of their time in Canada. They will no longer receive public funding through the Sovereign Grant, although will remain funded privately by the Prince of Wales. They will retain their patronages, but Harry, a former soldier, will have to give up his honorary military titles, including that of captain general of the Royal Marines, passed on to him by Prince Philip. Though \u201crequired\u201d to step down from royal duties, they will still be able to attend family occasions, such as trooping the colour. The negotiations are said to have been \u201cfriendly\u201d, in contrast to the \u201churt\u201d and \u201cdisappointment\u201d felt by the Queen, Charles and William over the Sussexes timing of their announcement without forewarning. As they embark on the next chapter, they are said to be \u201cvery much feeling their way\u201d. They \u201cunderstand the parameters\u201d and there will be a period of transition to see if it can work. The commercial model has not worked in the past, most notably with the Earl and Countess of Wessex. This has caused the royal family the most \u201cangst\u201d because a model does not exist yet. Harry had recently been working as an executive co-producer with chat show host Oprah Winfrey on a series about mental health for Apple TV. Meghan has done a voiceover for a Disney nature film with fees going to a conservation charity. This indicates one direction they might travel in. But whether they will escape allegations of cashing in on their status is questionable. Already new video footage, showing the couple at the premiere of Disney\u2019s Lion King in London, is circulating. It shows Harry telling the film\u2019s director Jon Favreau that Meghan is available for voiceover work, with Meghan seemingly joking: \u201cThat\u2019s really why we\u2019re here \u2013 it\u2019s the pitch.\u201d The Queen, in her statement, acknowledged the \u201cintense scrutiny\u201d the couple has been subjected to. The question remains if it will be less intense in North America, where there are broader freedoms over issues such as privacy, and where use of paparazzi photographs is not constrained by the agreed stricter rules of the UK media, drawn up following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said of the couple: \u201cI think the whole country will want to join in wishing them the very best for the future. \u201cAs I said before \u2026 I was sure the royal family, which has been around a very long time, will find a way forward.\u201d",

The conference in Berlin of 11 countries was aimed at bringing an end to the fighting between the UN-recognised government in Tripoli led by the prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, and the Libyan National Army in the country\u2019s east led by Gen Khalifa Haftar. While both sides to the conflict have agreed to nominate five members to an UN ceasefire monitoring committee, they are still far apart and not yet willing to negotiate directly. The presidents of Russia, Turkey and France joined other global leaders at the talks hosted by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and held under the auspices of the UN. The summit\u2019s main goal was to get foreign powers wielding influence in the region to stop interfering in the war \u2013 be it through weapons, troops or financing. Eleven countries, including the key players of France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Egypt, Russia, the US and the UK, attended, as well as Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, in the biggest show of international attention on Libya for many years.

The Italian and German defence ministers both said they were willing to send troops but only under a clear UN mandate. The Berlin conference was largely designed to discourage external actors from turning Libya into a battleground for rival countries backing either side in the civil war.

A lengthy statement prepared for the conference vowed that renewed UN sanctions would be enforced on any country breaching the arms embargo. It also called for a durable ceasefire, demobilisation and disarming of militias, talks to form a single government, a fair distribution of oil resources, a group of experts to advise on the Libyan economy and free elections to endorse the new government. A UN-led international follow-up commission will be charged with tracking progress on the conference commitments. The communique makes no mention of a peace monitoring force but does refer to technical committees to monitor the ceasefire. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told the conference that the presence of Syrian and other foreign forces in Libya must end immediately. Russia is also accused of sending mercenaries to support Haftar\u2019s forces. Different peace conferences over the past two years in Paris, Rome, Moscow and Abu Dhabi have not produced enduring solutions. The latest round of fighting broke out in April 2019 when Haftar tried to seize Tripoli by force days before a UN-brokered peace conference was about to start. In a key meeting before the formal summit, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, met the UAE foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed, to impress on the UAE the need for an end to all foreign intervention in Libya. On Saturday, Merkel also met the UAE\u2019s true decision-maker, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed. Prince Mohammed said he could not attend the conference, where there was likely to be criticism of the UAE\u2019s role in arming Haftar and providing extensive air support. The conflict has been made more complex by Turkey\u2019s determination to extend its gas drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean. In return for its offer to help Sarraj militarily, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Libya to extend Turkey\u2019s drilling rights \u2013 a move that has infuriated other countries including Greece and Cyprus. A group representing southern Libyan tribesmen said on Sunday it had closed the southern El Shahara and El Feel oilfields, virtually halting all of Libya\u2019s oil output.",

      "bodyText": "Here is Sid Lowe\u2019s report. Right, I\u2019ll be off then. Here\u2019s a few highlights from Quique Setien\u2019s post-match reaction. Bye! I think it was a notable result and performance. We lacked a bit of effectiveness in front of goal in the first half, but Granada defended very well and it wasn\u2019t easy to break through. The weather wasn\u2019t great, it was very windy. But I\u2019m happy, because we only conceded one shot in the first half. I think we did a lot of things well, and little by little I hope that we keep on improving and we have a bit more fluidity and effectiveness in front of goal. We need to find different ways to hurt teams. The only coach in the last 14 years of La Liga football to debut with as much possession as Setien was Pep Guardiola. The home side ended with 83% of possession, 18 shots (to Granada\u2019s five) and six on target (to Granada\u2019s one, which came two minutes into stoppage time). But they couldn\u2019t break Granada down until they went down to 10 men, and even then couldn\u2019t do it very often. Work to do, but the main thing is that they pocketed the points. Victory takes Barcelona back to the top of the table, ahead of Real Madrid on goal difference (theirs is superior by two). 90+4 mins: It\u2019s all over! Barcelona have won! It wasn\u2019t that impressive, for all their possession, but it\u2019ll do for now. 90+3 mins: Messi plays it short, and Barcelona ping the ball around a bit. 90+3 mins: Barcelona break and win a corner, which is probably going to be where the action ends. 90+2 mins: Granada have a shot! Machis with it, from 25 yards, but it goes straight to Ter Stegen. 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time. We\u2019ll have about three minutes of it. 90 mins: Barcelona work it from right to left, back to right, back left, and into the middle. Eventually they decide they might as well have a shot, but Griezmann\u2019s effort goes straight into a defender. Thirty seconds later he has another, also from the edge of the area, that also goes straight into a defender. 87 mins: Jordi Alba bursts into the area, but his cross from the left is too high for Arthur to head in at the back stick! 85 mins: Granada have an attacking free-kick, but when the ball is sent into the box it\u2019s headed straight back out again. 84 mins: Chance for a second! Puig bursts forward and passes to Vidal, who hits a left-foot shot into the side netting! 83 mins: I was wrong about that sub thing, because Vidal has just been replaced by Arthur. Now we\u2019re all out of subs. 80 mins: Carles Perez comes on for Ansu Fati. We\u2019re now all out of subs. 79 mins: Save! Barcelona, having been poor for the first 75 minutes of the game, now have the wind in their sails! Messi curls in a shot which was dipping towards the top corner until Rui Silva tipped it to safety! The breakthrough! And guess who scores the first goal of the Setien era? It\u2019s a nice build-up: Messi passes to Griezmann, who flicks to Vidal, who controls and backheels to Messi, now 12 yards out, who passes it into the corner! 72 mins: Granada bring Yan Eteki off, and bring on another centre-back in the shape of Jose Antonio Martinez. Just before that, Fernandez is booked. 71 mins: Barcelona bring Riqui Puig on for Rakitic. The fans seem very happy about it. 69 mins: Messi is tripped out on the right. It\u2019s a pretty innocuous challenge, but it earns him a second yellow card! 66 mins: Nearly a goal - for Granada! Sergi Roberto gives it away in his own half, it\u2019s passed to Yan Eteki, and his 20-yarder smacks the base of the post! 65 mins: Vadillo thunders a shot well over the bar and is immediately substituted, Antonio Puertas coming on. 64 mins: Vidal fouls Machis, and Granada can have a shot of their own here, from 30 yards or so. 63 mins: Messi\u2019s shot flicks off a defender and goes wide. As it does so, one of the adverts that are laid out just off the pitch on either side of the goal blows into the penalty area. 62 mins: A pile-up of bodies on the edge of Granada\u2019s area ends with a Barcelona free-kick, presumably for German\u2019s challenge on Griezmann. 60 mins: German gets booked, for landing his foot on Vidal\u2019s. 58 mins: Barcelona really don\u2019t seem to have many clever ideas here. Still, there\u2019s always Messi. He runs at the heart of the Granada defence, but then loses the ball to them. 56 mins: Messi passes to Rakitic, who tries a first-time backheel return which is a complication too many. Granada bring Yangel Herrera on for Azeez. 53 mins: Vidal picks Gonalons\u2019 pocket, and suddenly Barcelona have four forwards with only two defenders around to deal with them. Vidal passes inside to Messi, who returns it right to Vidal, and with Rui Silva rushing towartds him the Chilean fails to produce a decent cross. 50 mins: Oooh! Messi exchanges passes with Fati and sends the ball curling towards the far corner with his left foot, from 30 yards or so. The ball bounces a yard wide. 48 mins: Granada have had the ball for a minute or two. They even mounted something that could be called an attack, getting three or four bodies in the box to compete for a right-wing cross. There\u2019s no shot at the end of it, but still, fair dos. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! They\u2019re off! The players are back in the tunnel/staircase area. Can Barcelona find the key to unlock the Granada defence? We\u2019re about to find out! 45+1 mins: Barcelona have had 82% of possession and eight shots to Granada\u2019s one, but only two of those have been on target and Rui Silva has been pretty comfortable. Must do better. 45 mins: Close! Jordi Alba gets down the left and pulls back to Messi, whose first-time shot whistles a foot wide of the near post! 42 mins: Nothing much is happening here. Barcelona\u2019s attacks end in Barcelona corners; Granada\u2019s attacks end in Barcelona throw-ins. 39 mins: Lovely pass by Messi to Fati, but nobody busts a gut to offer him an option for a first-time centre, and the attack peters out. Another corner. 37 mins: Barcelona have twice got runners to the byline in the last couple of minutes, but both have been well tracked and have won nothing more than corners, neither of which have led to anything. 33 mins: Jordi Alba\u2019s foot has been trodden on by Gonalons, and stays down while he makes sure the referee knows how angry he is about it. Barcelona put the ball out of play, but their player will be fine. 31 mins: Barcelona are not really finding a path through Granada\u2019s defence. They have time, of course, and the away side\u2019s fitness or focus may well let them down sooner or later, but still. 28 mins: Umtiti gives the ball away to Fernandez, who runs forward and then shoots well wide from 30 yards or so. Still, it\u2019s a shot. 26 mins: Jordi Alba is pretty much playing in midfield, giving Barcelona a wonky 3-4-3 formation with a left-sided midfielder, three central midfielders and nobody on the right except Fati/Messi, who are interchanging in the forward line. 24 mins: This time Messi\u2019s effort clips the wall and goes over. 23 mins: Messi is brought down by Gonalons, and can have another shot from this free-kick. As for that miss, Fati was clearly distracted by Foulquier\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to get a foot the ball just before him. 22 mins: Impossible miss! Griezmann rolls the ball across goal, it runs to Fati at the back post, and he ... forgets to kick? Leaves it? Whatever, the ball is not in the net. 21 mins: Granada are pressing well as soon as the ball is in their half, but this constant chasing and harrying is going to knacker them out pretty quickly, and they are getting very little respite. 18 mins: Messi bustles into the area, but his shot hits Victor Diaz. The Argentinian gets the ball back and chips it to Vidal, who chests down and shoots limply at Rui Silva. 16 mins: Granada attack, and Fernandez is played into space on the left. Griezmann, though, sprints most of the length of the pitch to get into the right-back position, close him down and win the ball, and gets a healthy ovation for his pains. 14 mins: Messi\u2019s shot floats over the bar. It is very windy in Barcelona tonight, which probably makes floated free-kicks a bit harder than usual. 12 mins: The evening\u2019s first yellow card is shown to Machis, who brings Messi down from behind about 25 yards from goal. Very much Messi territory, this. 11 mins: Chance! Messi\u2019s dancing feet, and a lucky rebound, takes him past a couple of defenders. He passes left to Jordi Alba, who moves it on to Fati, who spears over the bar from just inside the area! 10 mins: Barcelona keep winning free-kicks in Granada\u2019s half but within 15 yards of the halfway line. Gonalons brings down Vidal from behind for the latest. 7 mins: Save! Griezmann passes to Fati, on the right side of the area, whose shot is parried by the keeper. Messi\u2019s attempt to reach the rebound first ends with two defenders on the turf and a Granada free-kick. 4 mins: Barcelona are predictably possession-hogging, but are yet to threaten the Granada goal. 1 min: Peeeeeep! After a minute\u2019s silence (though with some music playing) for Sergi Roberto\u2019s mum, we\u2019re off! Watford fans will be familiar with the Granada left-back, Dimitri Foulquier, who made three substitute appearances for them this season before moving on loan to Spain. He didn\u2019t look very good. And out they come! Setien himself, looking both in manner and clothing like an undertaker, follows. The players gather in the Camp Nou\u2019s tunnel/staircase thing. I wonder what Roy Keane, who was raging a little earlier about the silly hats worn by a couple of Manchester United players during their warm-up at Anfield, would think of this: He could at least smile for the camera. It looks like he\u2019s come to identify the corpse of a beloved but recently-deceased hamster. Quique Setien\u2019s first Barcelona XI looks like this: Ter Stegen, Sergi Roberto, Piqu\u00e9, Umtiti, Jordi Alba; Busquets, Vidal, Rakitic; Messi, Griezmann, Ansu Fati. Hello world! It\u2019s a new dawn at the Nou Camp, as Quique Seti\u00e9n makes his managerial bow against 10th-placed Granada. Here, allow Sid Lowe to set the scene for you: \u201cIt\u2019s not normal to take over at a team that\u2019s top,\u201d Quique Seti\u00e9n said after the call that took him from a stroll among the cows in Liencres, Cantabria, to a job among the sacred cows at the Camp Nou. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out of work, waiting for an opportunity, you imagine a team near the bottom, in trouble,\u201d said Barcelona\u2019s new manager. Instead on Sunday night he will occupy his place in the dugout at a place where they have not seen their team lose for 38 games, going back more than a year \u2013 not since the last time he was there. Ernesto Valverde lost one home game as Barcelona manager: to Seti\u00e9n\u2019s Real Betis, 4-3 in November 2018. As a player Seti\u00e9n beat Barcelona too. In Santander some Racing fans still cling to the old, fading T-shirt that celebrated their 5-0 victory over the Dream Team in February 1995 like some religious relic. On the front is a green hand, a finger for every goal they put past Carlos Busquets, Sergio\u2019s father, the scorer\u2019s name at each of its tips: Esteban Torre, Jes\u00fas Merino, Dmitri Radchenko, twice, and Quique Seti\u00e9n.

Morrison said although the government will review the possibility of reaching zero emissions by 2050, in line with its Pacific Island Forum commitment, it would not adopt the target if it \u201cdidn\u2019t know the cost\u201d. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg backed Morrison\u2019s position, by saying Kean was \u201cwrong\u201d to say cabinet ministers want the government to do more on climate change. After an unprecedented summer season of bushfires which Kean and even Morrison himself have conceded is caused in part by climate change, the federal government is under pressure to do more to fight global heating. At the 2019 election a record number of voters nominated climate change or the environment as their top concern. Morrison has suggested the Coalition could go \u201ceven further\u201d than the target of 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030, which was met with a chorus of approval from moderate Liberals but sparked warnings of negative consequences for Morrison by conservative Liberals and Nationals MPs.

Without retired Maria Folau and Casey Korpua, and with Laura Langman and Katrina Rore both on sabbatical, the new-look team beat an understrength Roses side in three of the four quarters to run away with the win.

Folau\u2019s absence in the shooting circle left a huge gap of experience and volume, but the three other shooters \u2013 Bailey Mes, Maia Wilson and Te Paea Selby-Rickit \u2013 all took the court. Wilson started the game in goal shooter, putting up an impressive 27 from 29 alongside the Silver Ferns\u2019 new captain, Ameliaranne Ekenasio, at goal attack. Te Paea Selby-Rickit also got a run in goal shooter and Bailey Mes impressed in goal attack when she was subbed in for Ekenasio. Circle defender Phoenix Karaka was given the start alongside vice captain Jane Watson in goal keeper, and Shannon Saunders started with the centre bib, in Langman\u2019s place.

The water purchase in the Condamine Balonne catchment has been controversial because it cost taxpayers $80m, was concluded without tender and the company was founded by the energy minister, Angus Taylor. But Taylor says he had ended his association with EAA before entering parliament in 2013 and was unaware of the $80m sale before it was announced.</p> \n<p><strong>How Africa\u2019s richest woman amassed a fortune at vast cost to the Angolan state can be revealed for the first time</strong> after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/19/isabel-dos-santos-revealed-africa-richest-woman-2bn-empire-luanda-leaks-angola\">huge leak of confidential documents</a> from her business empire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/isabel-dos-santos\">Isabel dos Santos</a>, who is known as \u201cthe princess\u201d in Angola, the oil-rich nation her father ruled as president for almost four decades, has long denied that her estimated $2.2bn (A$3.2bn) fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption. But an investigation by the Guardian and journalists in 20 countries, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, suggests Dos Santos benefited from extraordinary opportunities afforded to her by the government of her father before he stood down as president in 2017.</p> \n<h2><strong>Australia</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Roger Federer has again tiptoed around tough questions about the impact of the climate crisis</strong> on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/roger-federer-australian-open\">smoke-haunted Australian Open</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 20 January. Top stories The bushfire crisis is the latest in a string of bad news for the Australian economy, according to Deloitte Access Economics, sapping consumer confidence along with the downturn in housing construction and prolonged drought. In the latest business outlook report, released on Monday, Deloitte partly blames the Reserve Bank for its communication of the reasons driving rate cuts and warns that poor consumer and business confidence \u201crisks becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy\u201d. The report cites downturns in the retail, construction and finance sectors as cause for concern but notes that healthcare, education and the public sector are growing. The government rejected several offers from Eastern Australia Agriculture over the past decade to sell its overland-flow water rights because the deals were \u201cnot value for money\u201d, before paying $80m for the same rights, new documents show. The water purchase in the Condamine Balonne catchment has been controversial because it cost taxpayers $80m, was concluded without tender and the company was founded by the energy minister, Angus Taylor. But Taylor says he had ended his association with EAA before entering parliament in 2013 and was unaware of the $80m sale before it was announced. How Africa\u2019s richest woman amassed a fortune at vast cost to the Angolan state can be revealed for the first time after a huge leak of confidential documents from her business empire. Isabel dos Santos, who is known as \u201cthe princess\u201d in Angola, the oil-rich nation her father ruled as president for almost four decades, has long denied that her estimated $2.2bn (A$3.2bn) fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption. But an investigation by the Guardian and journalists in 20 countries, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, suggests Dos Santos benefited from extraordinary opportunities afforded to her by the government of her father before he stood down as president in 2017. Australia Roger Federer has again tiptoed around tough questions about the impact of the climate crisis on the smoke-haunted Australian Open. Federer was similarly careful with his words two weeks ago when it was revealed that his sponsor, Credit Suisse, had invested heavily in fossil fuels. Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova have, meanwhile, admitted to concerns about the impact of the bushfires and air quality. Anthony Albanese has called the decision to automatically recommit to a 45% emissions reduction target at the 2019 election was \u201ca mistake\u201d and declared that Labor would not take the same franking credits policy to the next election. Sports clubs that missed out on funding under the $100m sports program overseen by Bridget McKenzie could bring a class action to overturn the former sports minister\u2019s decisions, lawyers from two plaintiff firms have said. The education minister, Dan Tehan, has defended the Coalition\u2019s record on childcare after revelations that fees have increased by 3% in the last quarter and by more than 34% since the Coalition was elected in 2013. The world Donald Trump wants his impeachment trial to end before his state of the union address in two weeks\u2019 time, Lindsey Graham said on Sunday. That timeline is ambitious, given overwhelming public support for a fair airing of the charges against Trump at his Senate trial, in which opening arguments will be heard on Tuesday. The UK Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey has condemned the treatment of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by the media as \u201cintrusive and racist\u201d after the Queen announced plans for them to step back from royal duties. Meanwhile the Netflix chief, Ted Sarandos, has said Harry and Meghan in are in the streaming giant\u2019s sights. Hundreds of protesters have been injured in the most violent night of protests in Beirut since the beginning of mass anti-government demonstrations in Lebanon three months ago. A police force in London labelled Extinction Rebellion one of its \u201ckey threats\u201d in a counter-terrorism assessment and provided awareness training on the climate crisis group across the capital, resulting in \u201cintelligence\u201d tipoffs, the Guardian can reveal.

But more often the chief burden of responsibility lies elsewhere.

They show that EAA offered to sell its water entitlements, including the overland flows, on three earlier occasions but its offers were judged to not be value for money.</p> <p>An analysis of the information by the Australia Institute says the new documents raise additional questions about the $80m purchase price.</p> <p>In 2008/09 EAA offered to sell more than 37,000ML of overland flow for $1,495 a megalitre. But this was rejected by the Commonwealth as not value for money.

      "bodyText": "The government rejected several offers from Eastern Australia Agriculture over the past decade to sell its overland-flow water rights because the deals were \u201cnot value for money\u201d, before paying $80m for the same rights, new documents show. The water purchase in the Condamine Balonne catchment has been controversial because it cost taxpayers $80m, was concluded without tender and the company was founded by the energy minister, Angus Taylor. But Taylor says he had ended his association with EAA before entering parliament in 2013 and was unaware of the $80m sale before it was announced. The water deal was also controversial because overland flows are irregular. Since the deal was done in 2017, the commonwealth has received not one drop of water due to the drought. Now the new documents, which were produced late last year in response to Senate estimates\u2019 questions on notice, raise more questions. They show that EAA offered to sell its water entitlements, including the overland flows, on three earlier occasions but its offers were judged to not be value for money. An analysis of the information by the Australia Institute says the new documents raise additional questions about the $80m purchase price. In 2008/09 EAA offered to sell more than 37,000ML of overland flow for $1,495 a megalitre. But this was rejected by the Commonwealth as not value for money. In 2013-14 and again in 2014/5, the company again offered to sell a portion of its overland flows but its offers were rejected for the same reason. Yet in 2017 the then agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, agreed to pay $2,745 a megalitre for the same water entitlements. \u201cThat is higher than any previous offer by EAA and almost double [84% higher] the previous offers that the department considered too expensive,\u201d the Australia Institute\u2019s senior water researcher, Maryanne Slattery, said. \u201cThere has been very little variability in water prices in the Condamine-Balonne since 2008/09 and the price increase cannot be explained by increased market prices.\u201d The government has refused to release independent valuations of the water rights, despite requests from the Senate, and instead released documents that are so heavily redacted as to be meaningless. Four water purchases \u2013 all conducted without tender in 2017 \u2013 including the $80m EAA deal and another $80m water purchase from Tandou are now under scrutiny from the auditor general. The report is expected by March. The new documents also mention Growth Farms Australia, a company in which Taylor has an indirect shareholding, through his family investment company. It is declared in his pecuniary interests register. The new documents say the consultant for EAA, Tony Reid, was attending a negotiation with the department \u201cas a director of Growth Farms\u201d in the negotiations for the water sale. Reid, who remains a director of Growth Farms, has several business interests with Angus Taylor and his family. He told the Guardian it was an error by the department to say he attended as a Growth Farms director. Previously he has told the Guardian that he was acting as an individual when he consulted to EAA on the sale of its water to the government in 2017. \u201cI personally and independently, through my own personal company, worked for EAA from April 2010,\u201d he said. \u201cI can take no responsibility for various media or government entities getting their facts wrong.\u201d Growth Farms was responsible for the management of the two huge cotton properties in Queensland until 2010, when the contract ended, but Reid continued his association.

With the way my body has been, it\u2019s something you can\u2019t take it for granted, it could be my last game. \u201cBeing a fast bowler you want to play on quick decks. I\u2019d love to play there. I\u2019ve trained there once and it flew through. I\u2019d love to have a go, I\u2019ve never played a match there so we\u2019ll wait and see what happens. But there\u2019s a job to do here first. We\u2019ll get through this and see what happens.\u201d There were also words of praise for Root, whose off-spin played a decisive role in the final session of this fourth day. \u201cI think because he\u2019s captain, he under-bowls himself a lot. He does get key wickets when he bowls and he\u2019s been working on it a lot in the nets. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen in practice, he\u2019s doing a lot more bowling. \u201cAs a group we\u2019re really pleased for him to see him get four wickets. Hopefully he\u2019ll get the five-for tomorrow.\u201d Wood\u2019s fellow fast bowler Jofra Archer is progressing well from the elbow injury that has ruled him out of the past two matches, raising hopes he will be fit for the final Test.",

In the readers\u2019 editor role in recent years I have had a unique vantage point from which to watch Guardian and Observer journalism develop in both the print and digital realms, and to discern similarities and differences in the audiences for each. Strongly growing digital audiences are global, vast, multicultural and increasingly important contributors to keeping this journalism organisation sustainable. The commercial environment is harsh for longstanding newspapers, two of which are definitely the Guardian, born 1821, and the Observer, 1791. Looking back through past Open door columns, many of the issues that have arisen were familiar, and will be back in some form or other: tragedy; fame, including royal fame; terror, too many times by far; dependability; the cruelty of states; prejudice and memory; change, redesign, misunderstandings and adjustments; offence, coarse language, disputation and misjudgment. Fake news is not new, but its recent forms are virulent and threaten democratic norms in new ways. I entered the world of newspapers in 1977 when digital technologies were barely flickering. As I leave, the development I find most interesting (and wish I could see more of) is the intermingling of human and artificial intelligence. It is spreading in many parts of life, and it will grow in journalism too. As it does, the humans will need to be vigilant to preserve notions that have both guided and reflected the best in journalism during its first few hundred years.

The hope that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can find the answers, that the flickers of promise from his tenure can morph into meaningful momentum, that the romance inherent in his appointment can somehow over-ride the problems and the drift at the top of the club.</p> <p>This was a game in which Liverpool\u2019s superiority was so pronounced for most of the first half and the early part of the second that it would have been no surprise had they led by five or six. The intensity of their football coupled with the surgical nature of their incisions were enough to take the breath. It certainly seemed to take that of United. During the period, it felt like the latest reality check for Solskjaer and his players. And yet at the end, the very end, after United had loaded men into the Liverpool area for an all-or-nothing corner, there was Mohamed Salah racing onto Alisson\u2019s clearance, holding off Daniel James and finally giving Liverpool the breathing space they had craved. </p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/19/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Van Dijk and Salah goals take dominant Liverpool past Manchester United</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e24a1808f08e97ed2126538\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-19T18:40:35.780Z\">6.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Virgil van Dijk talks </strong>to Jamie Carragher, first about his goal:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We tried to find the near post and it worked. Fantastic delivery and the timing was there. It\u2019s never easy, set pieces. For us I\u2019ve always been marked by the strongest defensive header guys. Today it was two opponents. It\u2019s always difficult, but I think if the timing is right it\u2019s a big chance.</p> </blockquote> <p>And then about the disallowed goal:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I didn\u2019t jump with my hands up. It\u2019s difficult to say. But if the VAR gives it, you have to just accept it. I thought it was no foul, but you have to accept it. That\u2019s the rules these days. But we had many more opportunities to score goals today and make it look easy. We had two, three, maybe four clear-cut chances. You have to find a way, and in the end we did.</p> </blockquote> <p>And finally, after Carragher tries to make him admit Liverpool look title-bound:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think everyone wants us to say something about it but we won\u2019t. We won\u2019t get carried away. We cannot, and we won\u2019t. I think what we experienced last year is something that made our mentality like this.

Liverpool could have made it easier for themselves, and but for a couple of poor final passes to Mane and a silly Salah miss it would surely have been a straightforward home win.

      "bodyText": "Undefeated, you say? More bad news for United\u2026 That\u2019s all from me. Here\u2019s the match report again. Bye! There was a snippet of breaking news mid-match, and as far as United were concerned it wasn\u2019t good. Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s match report from Anfield: For Manchester United fans, it is the hope that kills them. The hope that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can find the answers, that the flickers of promise from his tenure can morph into meaningful momentum, that the romance inherent in his appointment can somehow over-ride the problems and the drift at the top of the club. This was a game in which Liverpool\u2019s superiority was so pronounced for most of the first half and the early part of the second that it would have been no surprise had they led by five or six. The intensity of their football coupled with the surgical nature of their incisions were enough to take the breath. It certainly seemed to take that of United. During the period, it felt like the latest reality check for Solskjaer and his players. And yet at the end, the very end, after United had loaded men into the Liverpool area for an all-or-nothing corner, there was Mohamed Salah racing onto Alisson\u2019s clearance, holding off Daniel James and finally giving Liverpool the breathing space they had craved. Virgil van Dijk talks to Jamie Carragher, first about his goal: We tried to find the near post and it worked. Fantastic delivery and the timing was there. It\u2019s never easy, set pieces. For us I\u2019ve always been marked by the strongest defensive header guys. Today it was two opponents. It\u2019s always difficult, but I think if the timing is right it\u2019s a big chance. And then about the disallowed goal: I didn\u2019t jump with my hands up. It\u2019s difficult to say. But if the VAR gives it, you have to just accept it. I thought it was no foul, but you have to accept it. That\u2019s the rules these days. But we had many more opportunities to score goals today and make it look easy. We had two, three, maybe four clear-cut chances. You have to find a way, and in the end we did. And finally, after Carragher tries to make him admit Liverpool look title-bound: I think everyone wants us to say something about it but we won\u2019t. We won\u2019t get carried away. We cannot, and we won\u2019t. I think what we experienced last year is something that made our mentality like this. We just want to go one game at a time, try to stay fit, try to improve. Not a great game, but certainly a gripping one. Liverpool could have made it easier for themselves, and but for a couple of poor final passes to Mane and a silly Salah miss it would surely have been a straightforward home win. But United eventually fought their way into the game, and after Mata and Greenwood were introduced they were the more dangerous team. Martial had their one real chance, and fluffed it real bad. Sky try very hard to force Henderson and/or Salah to admit that they look title-bound, but it\u2019s not happening. Here\u2019s Henderson: We\u2019re not really thinking about the end. Why should we change now? Why think about the end of the season? There\u2019s still a lot of games left. For us as players it\u2019s the next game, the next challenge, and the Premier League\u2019s tough. United played well at times today, but overall I think we deserved the three points. 1-0\u2019s a dangerous scoreline. I feel as though we should have killed the game off earlier, with the chances that we had, but we kept going, defended well and managed to get a second in the end. This is special. We\u2019re enjoying our football. But you\u2019ve got to stay hungry, you\u2019ve got to keep learning, keep wanting more. We\u2019re going to keep going until the end of the season. 90+4 mins: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win the league!\u201d sing the home fans as the final seconds tick away. And it\u2019s all over! And from United\u2019s corner, Liverpool score! Alisson gets the assist, booting upfield to release Salah, who runs into the area and slides past De Gea! 90+2 mins: United win another corner. De Gea is denied permission to go up for it. 90+2 mins: Every cross seems to dip onto Van Dijk\u2019s forehead. He heads coear again, the ball is kicked high into United\u2019s half, and De Gea runs from his goal to beat Salah to it. 90+1 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time, or thereabouts. United have the ball back, and continue to press. 90 mins: Liverpool break. Henderson runs through but can\u2019t quite outpace Dalot and thus has to rush and indeed fluff his cross. 89 mins: United take a short corner to Mata. Lallana pokes the ball away from the Spaniard, who manages to convert the situation into a free kick, which leads to another corner. Pressure. 88 mins: The home side counter. Alexander-Arnold sets Salah sprinting against Wan-Bissaka, who keeps up well enough. Salah eventually chips a decent cross to the far post, where nobody is there to head in. 87 mins: Shaw is suffering from a spot of cramp, forcing United to take him rather than Wan-Bissaka off as Diogo Dalot comes on. 86 mins: Liverpool\u2019s post-substitional tactical rejig has seen them switch to a 4-5-1, with Salah on his own up front. 84 mins: There have been spells in this match where United have been on the verge of being submerged. Had Salah converted that chance early in this half, that might indeed have happened. Instead here they are, still a single goal down and with six minutes to take advantage of an increasingly jittery Anfield. 82 mins: Liverpool use up their last two substitutions, bringing on Fabinho and Divock Origi, and taking off Firmino and Mane. 81 mins: United win a corner, and it\u2019s curled towards the near post where four of their players compete with one defender. It looked to me like Maguire headed it clear. 80 mins: United keep the ball around Liverpool\u2019s area for a while, until Mata plays a one-two with Wan-Bissaka and scoops in a lovely-looking but inaccurate cross that bounces through to Alisson. 78 mins: Martial\u2019s excellent cross is just too high for Greenwood. United, though, are starting to sniff an equaliser. 77 mins: Alexander-Arnold crosses towards the onrushing Mane, who backheels towards Firmino, but there\u2019s a little bit too power on his touch and by the time the Brazilian has it under control and is facing the goal, there are too many defenders there for him to get a shot on target. 74 mins: United make a double substitution, bringing Juan Mata and Mason Greenwood on and taking Williams and Pereira off. 73 mins: Alexander-Arnold takes; United head clear. 72 mins: Salah spins past Shaw, who has both hands round the Egyptians waist as he attempts to recover. Free kick, and a booking. 70 mins: For the last 10 minutes or so we have had a pretty even game, with both sides threatening. 67 mins: Now a better shot from distance, this time from Fred. This time Alisson shovels it behind for a corner. 67 mins: Martial hits a low 30-yarder straight at Alisson. 66 mins: Liverpool take off Oxlade-Chamberlain, who looks extremely grumpy about either this decision or his own performance, and bring on Lallana. 63 mins: Another chance for Liverpool. They break from the edge of their area, Wijnaldum does excellently to beat Maguire in the centre circle and he releases Mane, but Lindelof does well to hold up his run and force him onto his left foot, and his eventual shot is feeble and off target. 61 mins: How Liverpool\u2019s goal survived the last five minutes I don\u2019t know. Those two chances, for Fred and Martial, have changed the flow of the game a bit, building United\u2019s confidence and weakening Liverpool\u2019s. 59 mins: Impossible miss! Martial plays a one-two with Pereira, chests the ball down, and lashes the ball goalwards from 12 yards or so, but it flies over the bar! 57 mins: A chance for an equaliser! Fred intercepts Alexander-Arnold\u2019s poor long throw on the halfway line and runs without any kind of challenge into Liverpool\u2019s penalty area, where he shoots wide of the near post. \u201cAs frustrating as the whole situation was around the first disallowed goal, I take some small crumb of satisfaction from the fact that De Gea picked up an insanely unnecessary yellow card,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cHis protests had no effect on the final outcome. He screamed in a man\u2019s face, then the decision went his way anyway. Also, my father played in goal back in the \u2018good old days\u2019. He fondly remembers times when, in the face of a couple of 14 stone forwards charging at him, he had no choice but to throw the ball over the crossbar and concede a corner. Keepers today don\u2019t know they\u2019re born.\u201d 56 mins: How United\u2019s goal survived the last 10 minutes I don\u2019t know. 55 mins: Firmino dances inside the penalty area, humiliating a couple of defenders before shooting into Wan-Bissaka\u2019s bum. 52 mins: Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross hits Shaw\u2019s hand, but no dice from the officials (it was, to be fair, thundered into him from no distance). Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s low shot is easily saved by De Gea. 52 mins: Lindelof goes down clutching his groin, but plays on. Wan-Bissaka seems unable to sprint, and is either injured, knackered or lazy. 51 mins: How United\u2019s goal survived the last five minutes I don\u2019t know. 49 mins: Henderson\u2019s left-footed shot from the edge of the area hits a post! De Gea got a fingertip to that, an excellent save. 49 mins: Liverpool seem keen to extend their lead. Now Mane shoots over from an acute angle. 48 mins: Impossible miss! Robertson streaks past Wan-Bissaka on the left and crosses, Shaw trips over his own feet, and Salah, with the goal at his mercy from the six-yard line, hits it into his left foot off his right foot, and it bobbles wide! A comedy of errors. 47 mins: Henderson has the first shot of the second half, from 25 yards or so after Salah gave up attempting to create a shooting chance for himself and laid it off, but it\u2019s deflected to safety. 46 mins: Peeeeeeeep! Both sides unchanged. The players are back out and ready for more. There was also this: Of Sky\u2019s three studio guests, Patrice Evra says Van Dijk fouled De Gea, and both Graeme Souness and Roy Keane are furious about it. Souness\u2019s argument is that it is impossible for an outfield player to challenge a goalkeeper more fairly than Van Dijk did, and thus if that is a foul then it is impossible for goalkeepers to be challenged, but goalkeepers should be challengeable, and that therefore is not a foul. It has some merit, I think. Even goalkeepers think it wasn\u2019t a foul: The debate over Liverpool\u2019s first disallowed goal continues. \u201cI was a goalkeeper In football and ice hockey, and a catcher in baseball,\u201d writes Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI\u2019ll flat out tell you we\u2019re over-protected. Contact before the ball arrives? That\u2019s a foul. If we drop, fumble or bumble? Not a foul! Keepers are, or should be, made of stern stuff. Don\u2019t treat the brethren of the nets like porcelain dolls. Now get me a whisky in a dirty glass.\u201d 45+3 mins: That\u2019s all for now. Liverpool took the lead before they started playing, and have failed to extend it since - though they\u2019ve come pretty close. 45+2 mins: Liverpool win their eighth corner of the half; United are still in search of their first. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be a couple more minutes. Wijnaldum passes to Mane inside the area, but his first touch takes him away from goal and again defenders get over to challenge. 45 mins: Chance! United\u2019s defence falls apart like so much sodden toilet paper. Salah passes to Mane, who is in all sorts of space. It\u2019s not a great pass, forcing Mane to stall his run and giving Lindelof a chance to recover, but he still pushes it ahead of himself and lashes a shot goalwards from just inside the area. De Gea saves with his right boot. 44 mins: Pereira shoots from 25 yards, and Allison catches. 43 mins: Robertson boots the ball upfield, and with Salah lurking behind him Shaw raises his right foot, volleys gently over his shoulder, spins and is away. One for the showreel there. 41 mins: Chance for United! Martial curls an excellent cross to Wan-Bissaka, who half-volleys across to Pereira, who just needs to touch it in at the far post but can\u2019t quite reach it! \u201cThe reaction of the United players following what seemed a perfectly legit challenge by van Dijk was an unwelcome reminder of the days of Roy Keane,\u201d fumes Tony Wawryk. \u201cPlayers shouting in the ref\u2019s face, pointing, manhandling - they lost their heads. Half the team should have been booked and de Gea sent off. Shocking behaviour.\u201d 40 mins: A moment of promise for United as Pereira runs into the area, but for some reason James steps across to tackle him. 37 mins: This is your traditional hurly-burly, wild and error-strewn old-fashioned English top-flight fare. Wijnaldum is playing excellently, having been pretty much immune so far. 36 mins: Liverpool have the ball in the net again, but this time the linesman\u2019s got a flag up! It\u2019s a fabulous through-ball from Oxlade-Chamberlain to Wijnaldum, who nudges it past De Gea, but he was six inches offside. 34 mins: United are experimenting with different methods of losing the ball on the edge of their own area. 31 mins: Van Dijk did look over his left shoulder to check De Gea\u2019s position before he jumped. Perhaps without that the goal would have stood. He certainly didn\u2019t make much contact with De Gea. 28 mins: After a promising start, United are wobbling like Weebles. Firmino tries to play through to Salah, but it\u2019s just about intercepted. Gary Neville is furious about this, insisting Van Dijk\u2019s challenge was fair. Both players jumped, the Dutchman getting high enough to stop De Gea catching. The ball rolled left, was played back to Firmino, whose curling finish was fabulous. Apparently the VAR decided Van Dijk made no attempt to play the ball, but it would have landed on his head if De Gea hadn\u2019t reached over it to flap it nowhere much. United are furious! They think Van Dijk fouled De Gea in the build-up, and VAR will have a look. 24 mins: Chance! Firmino \u2018s pass deflects off Fred to Mane, inside the area, who tries to take a touch, takes a bad one, and gives Shaw the chance to clear. 22 mins: An excellent sliding challenge from Wan-Bissaka on Robertson, but Liverpool have another corner. Williams finds himself dealing with Van Dijk again, but this time it\u2019s headed clear at the near post. 20 mins: Andreas Pereira goes down, for no obvious reason. The physio swiftly persuades him to get up again. 19 mins: \u201cYou posted at 5 minutes that Matip passed to James. Tough to do when he\u2019s on the bench for the other team,\u201d writes Joe Pearson. Ah, ye olde Matic-Matip brainfart. I\u2019ve edited it out now. 18 mins: Liverpool win a free-kick on the right, and Van Dijk nearly gets on the end of this one too. Maguire beats him to it, at the expense of a corner. 17 mins: Liverpool have played with no rhythm, but if that\u2019s how United are going to defend set-pieces they don\u2019t really need to. Liverpool win a right-wing corner, Alexander-Arnold swings it into the middle and Van Dijk is somehow being marked by Brandon Williams. Van Dijk jumps, Williams ducks, and the header ripples the net! 13 mins: By the look of the red skies over Anfield this evening, local shepherds are in for a good night. Indeed, Matip is in a Premier League squad for the first time since the last United game in October, and Fabinho for the first time since 23 November. 10 mins: Robertson slides in to prod the ball away from James, who had looked destined to win the race. James doesn\u2019t seem to understand where the ball went or why he hasn\u2019t got a free-kick for it. 8 mins: Wijnaldum heads a bouncing ball, which Matic tries to beat him to with a boot. The Serbian doesn\u2019t get anything on the ball and not much on the player either, but Wijnaldum makes the most of it and the referee gets a card out. 7 mins: The corner isn\u2019t up to much, and as Liverpool try to recycle the ball Alexander-Arnold shanks a left-footed crossfield pass out of play. 6 mins: Liverpool attack, but they too hit a poor pass, which forces Mane out wide. He lays back to Robertson, whose cross deflects behind for a corner. 5 mins: Matic sends James scurrying into space on the right, but his low centre is cut out by Van Dijk before it can reach Martial. That looked a decent chance, but the cross was not great. 4 mins: United have started encouragingly. They win a free-kick on the right, which Pereira crosses in and Van Dijk cuts out. \u201cPlease Roy, what would you do in Ole\u2019s place?\u201d wonders Mary Waltz. \u201cYour top scorer is out. Your two best midfielders, McTominay and Pogba, can\u2019t or won\u2019t play. Your facing the best team in the UK and Europe on their home turf where they have not lost for 51 fixtures. You parked the bus at Old Trafford and earned a tie. the best result against Liverpool this season.what other choice does Ole have?\u201d Yeah, but hats. 1 min: United are indeed fielding a back four. Alisson scuffs a pass to Robertson, which goes straight out of play for a United throw-in. 1 min: Action! United get the game started! All handshakes and preambles complete, it\u2019s time for action. Well, nearly. Out come the players! Not long to go now! There weren\u2019t exactly a lot of silly hats among the United players pre-match. I think only Martial and Shaw were hatted, and even they were wearing beanie hats, which I think is a straightforward, no-messing practical winter hat, rather than a silly one. There was talk of United playing a back five, with Shaw a bonus additional centre-half. But a four of Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire and Shaw appears to be warming up together, so that\u2019s probably what they\u2019re going to do. Here\u2019s a snippet from Jurgen Klopp: Our fans know that we take each game 100% serious. So we can\u2019t be even more serious today. It\u2019s all good. In the last game [in October] I didn\u2019t see us there in the first half. Here today we can be a completely different animal, and that\u2019s what we have to show. And then, it\u2019s a football game against a strong opponent and we want to win the game. Matt Dony is worried. Nay, terrified: \u201cHaving spent so many of my formative years watching United hoovering up trophies and swaggering to titles, they\u2019ve got me in a kind of Stockholm Syndrome situation,\u201d he writes. \u201cOn the one hand, the way they\u2019ve fallen apart in the post-Fergie years is obviously enormously entertaining. But on the other hand, it just seems somehow wrong and unsettling to see them playing listless, goes-nowhere football, and flirting with mid-table mediocrity. They still have some lovely players to watch, but my word they also have some average ones. And yet, I\u2019m terrified about this game. They\u2019re still \u2018United\u2019. Liverpool\u2019s run has to end sometime; I have no problem with that. But please, not against United. They still bang on about ending The Invincibles\u2019 run. Having little else to cheer about these days, I simply can\u2019t imagine how many ties we\u2019ll have to hear about today should they win.\u201d Roy Keane, hat-hater: Roy Keane, part of Sky\u2019s team, is already angry. \u201cI can\u2019t say what he said off-air,\u201d says Graeme Souness. Here\u2019s what Keane said on air: When I see people like Shaw coming back into the team ... the nearer we\u2019re getting to kick-off the more worried I\u2019m getting actually. I think I was fine about two hours ago. Do you know what, I look at the players, I look at them getting warmed up, and I see their silly hats. Do you know what, it\u2019s as if their mindset is let\u2019s not be beaten. That negative talk already. I\u2019m worried, I have to say. Here are the highlights of Solskjaer\u2019s pre-match interview with Sky: He got a couple of knocks again and jolts when he came on against Wolverhampton. He\u2019s aggravated his back, he\u2019s had some trouble before, and of course we\u2019re going to give him time to recover and rest before we put him back on the pitch. He\u2019s always recovered quickly before, so let\u2019s hope he does that again. I wouldn\u2019t expect him to be back in the next few weeks. I think we\u2019ve got a way that ... we have to come to a difficult place, to play against a very good team, and we have to try to maximise the players we\u2019ve got. I think we\u2019ve got a chance to give them some trouble with the way we\u2019re playing. More pre-match reading: Here\u2019s that Solskjaer bit on Rashford: Burnley have indeed beaten Leicester by two goals to one goal. John Brewin has the aftermath: Meanwhile, some news breaks about Marcus Rashford, who according to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be out \u201cfor weeks\u201d with his back injury. It\u2019s looking like another bad weekend for the Liverpool-chasers: Manchester City having drawn yesterday, Leicester are currently 2-1 down at Burnley, with nine minutes (plus stoppages) remaining. So Liverpool play their familiar first-choice XI. United, meanwhile, play both Brandon Williams and Luke Shaw, presumably as some kind of Alexander-Arnold neutralising double-left-back combo. Team news is in, and without further ado, or really any ado at all, here it is! Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Salah, Firmino, Mane. Subs: Fabinho, Adrian, Minamino, Lallana, Origi, Matip, Jones. Man Utd: De Gea, Wan Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams, Fred, Matic, James, Andreas Pereira, Shaw, Martial. Subs: Bailly, Jones, Mata, Lingard, Dalot, Romero, Greenwood. Referee: Craig Pawson. Liverpool\u2019s team coach arrives at Anfield. Team news should be upon us very shortly. Hello world! As you survey Liverpool\u2019s path to the title in search of potential banana skins, there\u2019s really not much to see between now and the trip to Manchester City in early April. After Wolves away next week (potential danger there as well, although Wolves\u2019 home record isn\u2019t all that great) they have a run of league games against the teams currently (in league position order, rather than chronological) 13th, 16th, 16th again, 17th, 19th and 20th. Win all of their games between now and the end of that run and they will be at the very minimum 19 points ahead with 27 available, and in need of three wins from their last nine to seal the deal. In other words, it\u2019s die or do now for Liverpool. Today they play the only team to have taken points off them this season, in October\u2019s 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. If Liverpool are to win the title by a gazillion points, one thing that might make the experience very fractionally less sweet is if they have failed to beat Manchester United along the way. Today\u2019s the day to rectify that. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading:",

The disintegration of a non-aggression pact between Warren and Sanders \u2013 and the resulting online backlash from supporters in both camps \u2013 caused handwringing among progressive groups, which urged supporters of the two senators to reserve their fire for centrist rivals. Sanders is leading Warren in most national opinion polls but both trail former vice-president Joe Biden, a moderate. Interviews with more than 20 voters who attended the two progressives\u2019 events on Friday and Saturday showed that they largely wanted the candidates to move on.

      "body": "<p>Patients have had to sleep overnight in the A&amp;E unit of one of the NHS\u2019s biggest hospitals because it is overwhelmed by the number of people needing care, a leaked memo reveals.</p> <p>The situation has arisen at Sunderland Royal hospital because it has been running out of beds despite it having recently added an extra 50 to its normal stock of 970 beds to help it cope with winter pressures.</p> <p>In a message sent to local GPs last Friday titled \u201csignificant surge within the trust\u201d, NHS leaders in the city said: \u201cThere has been increased pressures on bed capacity over the past two to three days which is having a severe impact across the trust. Fifty more beds are being used, 40 boarding in different wards and 20 patients were stuck in ED [the emergency department] as no beds available, resulting in some patients having to sleep overnight in ED.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been some cancellations of elective activity [operations] and extra consultants have been pulled into ED to help manage the demand. It would be very much appreciated if you could only refer patients to ED if all other possible solutions have been exhausted.\u201d</p> <p>The hospital is seeking to buy places in local care homes as another way of freeing up beds and ending the logjam in its A&amp;E.</p> <p>Those who slept overnight in the unit will have been patients whom doctors had decided to admit as medical emergencies but for whom hospital staff had not been able to find a bed.</p> <p>Sunderland\u2019s overcrowding is the latest example of how hospitals have been struggling to cope with demand this winter, especially with higher-than-usual levels of flu increasing the pressure on beds. The NHS in England has added about 1,000 beds to help relieve the strain but some hospitals have ended up full despite that.</p> <p>One local GP said the hospital\u2019s request to send patients to the A&amp;E only if there was no alternative was \u201cexasperating\u201d and made family doctors feel like they were being \u201ca nuisance\u201d when they were already using alternatives to hospital care as often as possible.</p> <p>Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for EveryDoctor, a network of frontline NHS medics, said: \u201cThis email perfectly illustrates the immense strain that NHS hospitals are currently under. Hospitals shouldn\u2019t run at more than 85% occupied bed capacity. However, we know that many are now forced to run at a bed capacity much higher than this.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a hospital where all staff are working extremely hard to cope with increased winter pressures.

      "bodyText": "Patients have had to sleep overnight in the A&amp;E unit of one of the NHS\u2019s biggest hospitals because it is overwhelmed by the number of people needing care, a leaked memo reveals. The situation has arisen at Sunderland Royal hospital because it has been running out of beds despite it having recently added an extra 50 to its normal stock of 970 beds to help it cope with winter pressures. In a message sent to local GPs last Friday titled \u201csignificant surge within the trust\u201d, NHS leaders in the city said: \u201cThere has been increased pressures on bed capacity over the past two to three days which is having a severe impact across the trust. Fifty more beds are being used, 40 boarding in different wards and 20 patients were stuck in ED [the emergency department] as no beds available, resulting in some patients having to sleep overnight in ED. \u201cThere has been some cancellations of elective activity [operations] and extra consultants have been pulled into ED to help manage the demand. It would be very much appreciated if you could only refer patients to ED if all other possible solutions have been exhausted.\u201d The hospital is seeking to buy places in local care homes as another way of freeing up beds and ending the logjam in its A&amp;E. Those who slept overnight in the unit will have been patients whom doctors had decided to admit as medical emergencies but for whom hospital staff had not been able to find a bed. Sunderland\u2019s overcrowding is the latest example of how hospitals have been struggling to cope with demand this winter, especially with higher-than-usual levels of flu increasing the pressure on beds. The NHS in England has added about 1,000 beds to help relieve the strain but some hospitals have ended up full despite that. One local GP said the hospital\u2019s request to send patients to the A&amp;E only if there was no alternative was \u201cexasperating\u201d and made family doctors feel like they were being \u201ca nuisance\u201d when they were already using alternatives to hospital care as often as possible. Dr Julia Patterson, the lead for EveryDoctor, a network of frontline NHS medics, said: \u201cThis email perfectly illustrates the immense strain that NHS hospitals are currently under. Hospitals shouldn\u2019t run at more than 85% occupied bed capacity. However, we know that many are now forced to run at a bed capacity much higher than this. \u201cThis is a hospital where all staff are working extremely hard to cope with increased winter pressures. But after 10 long years of austerity, the NHS is underfunded and understaffed, and there is little resilience left in the system.\u201d Angela Wadmore, the divisional director for urgent and emergency care at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS foundation trust, which runs the hospital, said: \u201cOver the past week we have seen a big increase in seriously ill people requiring emergency admission to hospital. As we safely manage these pressures, sometimes it may not be possible to accommodate patients into an appropriate inpatient bed as quickly as we would like, resulting in some patients having to spend longer within our emergency department. \u201cWhen this does occur, patients are cared for with compassion and looked after safely by our excellent emergency department staff, each within their own dedicated individual room to ensure patient privacy and dignity is maintained. As soon as an inpatient bed becomes available, patients are then safely transferred to another part of the hospital.\u201d In recent weeks the Guardian has documented other examples of how hospitals are struggling to cope this winter. Cornwall Royal hospital recently told doctors they should discharge patients even though they may come to harm as a result because it was so short of beds. The Doctors\u2019 Association UK called the move \u201cmorally repugnant and against the very fibre of what doctors stand for\u201d while the British Medical Association said it was \u201ca dire indictment of the state our NHS has been allowed to creep into\u201d. Last month Norfolk and Norwich hospital trust advised its senior doctors to make \u201cthe least unsafe decision\u201d when deciding how best to treat patients, again because it was under what its medical director, Dr Erika Denton, said was \u201cextreme pressure\u201d. Growing numbers of hospitals are redeploying nurses from wards as \u201ccorridor nurses\u201d to look after the queues of patients building up waiting to get a bed. Very sick children have had to be transferred sometimes many miles from home in order to get a place in a paediatric intensive care unit because of widespread shortages of such specialist beds. Despite staff\u2019s best efforts, a decade-long NHS funding squeeze, a serious lack of personnel in many areas of care and rising demand for care have led to the service recording its worst ever performance figures against key waiting-time targets in each of the last four months. Boris Johnson declared last week that waiting times had become \u201cunacceptable\u201d and vowed to end the long delays.",

Genuinely the most inspiring moment was the sound of a baby crying in the audience. That was Baby Alfie, whose mother I knocked doors with while he was still safe in the womb. She knocked doors in the rain, in a seat we lost, while she was nine months pregnant and in possible slow labour.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/19/labour-hustings-watch-from-working-class-dads-to-a-very-democratic-poll\">Labour hustings watch: from working-class dads to a very democratic poll</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The hustings was awful. I was awful because I was trying to hit a million different lines and messages in 40 seconds. Some were my lines, some were other people\u2019s, and it fell flat.</p> \n<p>It was not all my failing. The format of the hustings is terrible. To answer any question in 40 seconds is ridiculous. If it were possible to sum up, for example, an economic plan or an industrial strategy in 40 seconds, one wonders why they are actually hundreds of pages long. What a ridiculous farce.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow will you unify the party?\u201d is an example of a question we will be asked in every hustings. Everyone is going to give the same bloody answer: \u201cI\u2019ll build a broad team, I\u2019ll end factionalism, I\u2019ll make sure all are welcome \u2026 blah blah blah.\u201d The truth is it is going to be a long hard slog of carrot and stick. This is no criticism of the other candidates \u2013 I did it, too. The real truth is you have to inspire change. You have to lead people to it, they have to believe in your intentions and want to go along with you.</p> \n<p>I have absolutely no idea what kind of test of leadership it is for five people to stand on a stage and deliver frankly dull pre-rehearsed lines, some that have clearly been focus-grouped to death. How does it show how you will lead a team, inspire people to action or reach out into the country? It doesn\u2019t. It proves some people can practise lines.</p> \n<p>What galls me the most is the triangulation, the lines planned to reach different parts of the membership of the Labour party, all while talking about the end of factionalism. This is fundamentally dishonest. I get that repetition is an important part of political marketing but I am not sure I can take six weeks of it.</p> \n<p>Ready for some more honesty? The likelihood that anyone but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/08/keir-starmer-secures-support-labour-mps-run-leadership\" title=\"\">Keir Starmer</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/15/momentum-back-rebecca-long-bailey-poll-labour-leadership\" title=\"\">Rebecca Long-Bailey</a> is going to win is, well, pretty low. Shock horror! What I am meant to say is, \u201cAnything is possible, the campaign is long.\u201d I get it. I am not blind. The likelihood of someone like me, who speaks like I do and says the things I say, ever being elected to be a party leader is slim. So I tried to do what was required, to learn lines, appear statesmanlike (as if!) and say the things I am meant to say. Turns out I cannot do it, because when I try it looks fake.</p> \n<p>Also, I don\u2019t think it is what leadership actually looks like. Leadership to me is deeds not words.</p> \n<p>Leadership is the woman in my constituency who was sick of the dangerous parking around her school and so every morning put on a yellow tabard and patrolled the street, moving people on. Week in week out she did this until there was a rota of parents, neighbours and friends all helping her.</p> \n<p>Leadership is those brave whistleblowers who have never given up in the face of pushback to expose the sexual exploitation of vulnerable kids in Rochdale and Rotherham. It is the Hillsborough families who took their grief, pain and the slights against their people and kept on going until others were inspired to follow. None of these people have lines; they have heart and grit and they inspire.</p> \n<p>That isn\u2019t the political leadership people look for, but it should be. What would show actual bloody leadership would be if the prime minister said: I will not rest until the plague of violent crime on our streets has disappeared. Not only changing policy and pulling levers of government to do it, like police numbers, youth service investment and changes to the criminal justice system, but also by inspiring and empowering communities.

      "bodyText": "I said at the beginning of this process that I would tell the truth. I said that I was the bold choice and only bold could beat Boris Johnson, and I meant it. And then I did something I didn\u2019t think I would do, and I stopped being bold. I didn\u2019t lie, but I certainly stopped being real. I really believe that authentic, big-hearted, funny, kind and different politics is the only way to beat Johnson. So I am going to practise it. So now for the honesty. I hated the first hustings on Saturday. Genuinely the most inspiring moment was the sound of a baby crying in the audience. That was Baby Alfie, whose mother I knocked doors with while he was still safe in the womb. She knocked doors in the rain, in a seat we lost, while she was nine months pregnant and in possible slow labour. The hustings was awful. I was awful because I was trying to hit a million different lines and messages in 40 seconds. Some were my lines, some were other people\u2019s, and it fell flat. It was not all my failing. The format of the hustings is terrible. To answer any question in 40 seconds is ridiculous. If it were possible to sum up, for example, an economic plan or an industrial strategy in 40 seconds, one wonders why they are actually hundreds of pages long. What a ridiculous farce. \u201cHow will you unify the party?\u201d is an example of a question we will be asked in every hustings. Everyone is going to give the same bloody answer: \u201cI\u2019ll build a broad team, I\u2019ll end factionalism, I\u2019ll make sure all are welcome \u2026 blah blah blah.\u201d The truth is it is going to be a long hard slog of carrot and stick. This is no criticism of the other candidates \u2013 I did it, too. The real truth is you have to inspire change. You have to lead people to it, they have to believe in your intentions and want to go along with you. I have absolutely no idea what kind of test of leadership it is for five people to stand on a stage and deliver frankly dull pre-rehearsed lines, some that have clearly been focus-grouped to death. How does it show how you will lead a team, inspire people to action or reach out into the country? It doesn\u2019t. It proves some people can practise lines. What galls me the most is the triangulation, the lines planned to reach different parts of the membership of the Labour party, all while talking about the end of factionalism. This is fundamentally dishonest. I get that repetition is an important part of political marketing but I am not sure I can take six weeks of it. Ready for some more honesty? The likelihood that anyone but Keir Starmer or Rebecca Long-Bailey is going to win is, well, pretty low. Shock horror! What I am meant to say is, \u201cAnything is possible, the campaign is long.\u201d I get it. I am not blind. The likelihood of someone like me, who speaks like I do and says the things I say, ever being elected to be a party leader is slim. So I tried to do what was required, to learn lines, appear statesmanlike (as if!) and say the things I am meant to say. Turns out I cannot do it, because when I try it looks fake. Also, I don\u2019t think it is what leadership actually looks like. Leadership to me is deeds not words. Leadership is the woman in my constituency who was sick of the dangerous parking around her school and so every morning put on a yellow tabard and patrolled the street, moving people on. Week in week out she did this until there was a rota of parents, neighbours and friends all helping her. Leadership is those brave whistleblowers who have never given up in the face of pushback to expose the sexual exploitation of vulnerable kids in Rochdale and Rotherham. It is the Hillsborough families who took their grief, pain and the slights against their people and kept on going until others were inspired to follow. None of these people have lines; they have heart and grit and they inspire. That isn\u2019t the political leadership people look for, but it should be. What would show actual bloody leadership would be if the prime minister said: I will not rest until the plague of violent crime on our streets has disappeared. Not only changing policy and pulling levers of government to do it, like police numbers, youth service investment and changes to the criminal justice system, but also by inspiring and empowering communities. People love a grafter. People love to see someone giving something a go. They would love it in a political leader, too. I might not look the most like a prime minister in this race. I cannot win that war so I am going to stop fighting it. I am going to do the thing that made tens of thousands of people ask me to run to be the leader. I am going to say what I think. I probably won\u2019t win, but I am guessing that I might just inspire others to give it a go, too.

Over that time the civil war that devastated Angola ended, an oil boom that generated billions ended in bust, and one of the longest-ruling leaders in Africa, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/19/angola-elections-jose-eduardo-dos-santos-marxism-crony-capitalism-mpla\">step down as president</a>.

In her mid-20s, having recently returned to Angola after studying in London, Dos Santos acquired a stake in what was then a struggling, scruffy bar. The money was wisely spent. The Ilha is now one of the most fashionable and valuable locations on the entire western coast of Africa between Cape Town and Lagos. One person who has not been seen on the premises in a long time, however, is Dos Santos, now the richest woman in Africa.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"6ce2caf0-93aa-4a78-9d6e-a3dbfb9b2093\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Luanda Leaks project is based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts detailing the business operations of Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of the former president of Angola.</p>\n    <p>The files were initially obtained by the anti-corruption charity Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).</p>\n    <p>The documents, which cover a period between 1980 and 2018, have been reviewed by more than 120 journalists from 37 media outlets, including the Guardian, the BBC and the Portuguese newspaper&nbsp;Expresso.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Critics allege her vast fortune is an outrage in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, a flagrant example, they claim, of a brand of nepotistic corruption that scars so many African nations.

Her father was then an official in the Communist-aligned Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and had been sent to study engineering in the USSR.

She left with A-levels in maths, further maths and physics, and took a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at King\u2019s College London, where she worked hard, she later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ffd2edc-955e-11e2-a4fa-00144feabdc0\">told interviewers</a>, and had little time for partying. After graduating, she spent two years at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm now known as PwC.</p> \n<p>Later, when it briefly looked like the civil war was over, she returned to Angola, where she started a transport business. Dealing with communications for trucks led her to mobile phone technology, then in its infancy.

      "bodyText": "From the terrace of the Miami Beach club, the sand stretches down to the Atlantic ocean. Waves lap the long shoreline of the Ilha de Luanda. On weekends, the bar-restaurant is full of wealthy drinkers and dancers who have driven over from Luanda, the Angolan capital, a few kilometres away. The Miami Beach club has been a fixture on the Luanda party scene for 20 years. Over that time the civil war that devastated Angola ended, an oil boom that generated billions ended in bust, and one of the longest-ruling leaders in Africa, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, was forced to step down as president. It was a period when a lucky elite of Angolans made very large fortunes \u2013 but none seems to have made more than the former president\u2019s daughter, Isabel dos Santos, whom Forbes says is worth $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn). The beach bar was Dos Santos\u2019s first foray into business in Angola, and it marked her out as a savvy investor. In her mid-20s, having recently returned to Angola after studying in London, Dos Santos acquired a stake in what was then a struggling, scruffy bar. The money was wisely spent. The Ilha is now one of the most fashionable and valuable locations on the entire western coast of Africa between Cape Town and Lagos. One person who has not been seen on the premises in a long time, however, is Dos Santos, now the richest woman in Africa. Critics allege her vast fortune is an outrage in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, a flagrant example, they claim, of a brand of nepotistic corruption that scars so many African nations. Dos Santos, 46, insists her wealth is the result of hard work and business acumen, and her supporters say her success story is inspirational, especially for African women. Precisely how Dos Santos made so much money is the subject of mounting scrutiny. Angolan prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into her actions while at the helm of the state oil company, Sonangol, in September. Three weeks ago, in a separate move, the country\u2019s attorney general announced a freeze on the assets of Dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo, claiming their dealings with the country\u2019s publicly owned oil and diamond companies had \u201charmed\u201d the state to the tune of $1bn. The couple have fiercely denied any wrongdoing in a series of public interviews that appear to have been timed to get ahead of this week\u2019s reports from 37 media outlets, including the Guardian, which have had access to a leaked cache of financial records from Isabel dos Santos\u2019s business empire. Dos Santos was born in 1973 in Baku, Azerbaijan, where her parents had met. Her father was then an official in the Communist-aligned Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and had been sent to study engineering in the USSR. Her mother was a chess champion, who was studying the same subject. Two years later, the Portuguese colonial regime collapsed and four years after that, in 1979, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos took over the leadership of the fledgling free nation and the family moved into the presidential palace. After her parents divorced and the country plunged into a civil war, Isabel Dos Santos went with her mother to London to be educated at St Paul\u2019s girls school. She left with A-levels in maths, further maths and physics, and took a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at King\u2019s College London, where she worked hard, she later told interviewers, and had little time for partying. After graduating, she spent two years at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm now known as PwC. Later, when it briefly looked like the civil war was over, she returned to Angola, where she started a transport business. Dealing with communications for trucks led her to mobile phone technology, then in its infancy. This proved fortuitous, and she rejects absolutely any suggestion that being the eldest daughter of the president helped when a consortium she was part of won a public tender for a licence \u2013 only the second in Angola \u2013 for mobile telecommunications towards the end of the 1990s. Unitel is now the country\u2019s biggest mobile phone provider. From then on, her business empire has grown and grown, prompting further allegations, which she denies, that her father\u2019s influence, direct or indirect, helped her to amass fabulous riches. She also owns large parts of Angola\u2019s cement, diamond and banking industry, as well as stakes in a supermarket network, a satellite TV chain and a brewery. Dos Santos says she is the subject of a politically motived \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, and denies the allegations of corruption and nepotism levelled against her.

The falling price of oil and longstanding inefficiency were draining the company\u2019s revenues. With oil the keystone of the Angolan economy, <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/angola/overview\">responsible for a third of its GDP and 90% of its exports</a>, a bankrupt Sonangol would mean economic catastrophe.</p> \n<p>The government took drastic action. By decree of the then president, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, a committee to restructure the Angolan oil sector was constituted, and it invited a Maltese company, Wise Intelligence Solutions, to coordinate a group of consultants to advise on reforms . Wise\u2019s owner was the president\u2019s daughter, Isabel dos Santos.</p> \n<p>She had no background in oil and gas, but believes she was selected for her extensive business experience. \u201cThey wanted to have a view of someone that\u2019s coming in from the private sector, and to have private sector eyes look at a state enterprise,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Six months later, Isabel dos Santos would be granted even greater influence over the reforms. A second presidential decree announced her appointment as chair of Sonangol, mandated with overseeing its turnaround.</p> \n<p> Dos Santos said her work on the first contract made her the logical choice for the commission. \u201cOnce we\u2019d finished, they had difficulties recruiting a team that could actually go ahead and implement it, and I was invited to come in and head Sonangol,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Dos Santos says she spent the next year and a half dedicating herself to saving Sonangol. \u201cWe were working from nine in the morning until 10 at night,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring nine months of this time I was pregnant. My son was born on 31 July, and on 27 July I was in a board meeting.

      "bodyText": "The transfers began on 16 November 2017, with $38m wired (then \u00a332.3m) to a bank account in Dubai. A little later another sum, this time $15m, exited, followed by a third for $4m. At the start of the day, the bank account of Sonangol, Angola\u2019s state oil company, had contained $57m. By sunset, it had just $309. The story of these payments, as told by a Sonangol bank statement and internal report, lies at the centre of an Angolan government investigation into Africa\u2019s richest woman. Isabel dos Santos, 46, says the Angolan government is presenting a series of highly selective, or even fabricated, documents to attack her. \u201cToday I\u2019m facing charges that are completely false. These allegations have absolutely no grounds whatsoever, and they\u2019re completely politically motivated,\u201d she told BBC News. The investigation relates to her management of Sonangol in 2016 and 2017, and events that took place in the days before her sacking. As Africa\u2019s second-largest oil producer Angola has vast petroleum wealth, which is licensed exclusively by Sonangol. It has ventures in a swath of other sectors, such as helicopters, telecoms and real estate, to support its core business. In 2018, its turnover was $18bn. But by 2015 Sonangol was in crisis. The falling price of oil and longstanding inefficiency were draining the company\u2019s revenues. With oil the keystone of the Angolan economy, responsible for a third of its GDP and 90% of its exports, a bankrupt Sonangol would mean economic catastrophe. The government took drastic action. By decree of the then president, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, a committee to restructure the Angolan oil sector was constituted, and it invited a Maltese company, Wise Intelligence Solutions, to coordinate a group of consultants to advise on reforms . Wise\u2019s owner was the president\u2019s daughter, Isabel dos Santos. She had no background in oil and gas, but believes she was selected for her extensive business experience. \u201cThey wanted to have a view of someone that\u2019s coming in from the private sector, and to have private sector eyes look at a state enterprise,\u201d she said. Six months later, Isabel dos Santos would be granted even greater influence over the reforms. A second presidential decree announced her appointment as chair of Sonangol, mandated with overseeing its turnaround. Dos Santos said her work on the first contract made her the logical choice for the commission. \u201cOnce we\u2019d finished, they had difficulties recruiting a team that could actually go ahead and implement it, and I was invited to come in and head Sonangol,\u201d she said. Dos Santos says she spent the next year and a half dedicating herself to saving Sonangol. \u201cWe were working from nine in the morning until 10 at night,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring nine months of this time I was pregnant. My son was born on 31 July, and on 27 July I was in a board meeting. People were saying: \u2018Shouldn\u2019t you be going to the hospital?\u2019\u201d But Angolan government documents describe a series of developments that are the focus of the investigation into Dos Santos by the Angolan government . They took place in the weeks before she was dismissed by her father\u2019s successor, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o. On 7 November 2017, the head of Sonangol\u2019s London subsidiary was sacked, and the following day a company memo, signed by Dos Santos, announced that a woman called Maria Rodrigues would replace her. The memo was dated 30 August 2017. Within 48 hours, Rodrigues had signed a contract for consultancy services on behalf of the UK subsidiary, according to a Sonangol internal report.

They are working with counterparts in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, the US and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace assets, prevent money transfers and gather information.</p> \n<p>Dos Santos says she is the subject of a witch-hunt by Angola\u2019s government, designed to neutralise her as a potential political opponent. On Wednesday, she provoked speculation about a bid for the presidency, telling a TV interviewer it was \u201cpossible\u201d she would run for office.</p> \n<p>However, Dos Santos has not visited Angola for more than a year. A prosecutor told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso she was thought to have left the country hours after receiving a request from prosecutors to appear for questioning in July 2018. Through her lawyers, Dos Santos said she had \u201cno record of having received any such request\u201d, and that there was no question of her having refused to meet prosecutors.</p> \n<p>Dos Santos and her half-brothers and sisters are among the most prominent members of the oligarchy of powerful families in Angola. Her father came to office in 1979 as head of the People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). After the end of the civil war in 2002, President Dos Santos and the MPLA consolidated power by bringing the most valuable sectors of the economy into government ownership.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"153d2b52993705c16537d865e72592ce9ffd8a68\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/153d2b52993705c16537d865e72592ce9ffd8a68/0_0_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos during his presidency\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos pictured during his presidency.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Cotrim/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The spoils were shared with a select group with links to politics and the military. As a result, Africa\u2019s second-largest oil producing nation became known as one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, ranking near the bottom of the Transparency International <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/corruption-index\">corruption</a> perceptions index. </p> \n<p>\u201cThese are the classic symptoms of a captured state,\u201d said Steve Goodrich, a senior research manager at Transparency International UK, after reviewing the Luanda Leaks findings. \u201cHere we have industry and politics all in one family, with no apparent separation of powers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The leak includes data from Fidequity, a team of advisers who acted as a family office for the couple, administering their empire from plush premises above a Louis Vuitton salesroom in Lisbon.</p> \n<p>As the couple grew richer, emails and board minutes show the number of banks prepared to have them as clients dwindled. The data indicates that top-tier lenders severed ties after the Dos Santos regime was ruled a corruption risk by compliance departments.</p> \n<p>Company service providers in the Netherlands and the Isle of Man also turned down their business, the files suggest. Dokolo says he has been unable to open bank accounts under his own name in London and Paris since 2001.</p> \n<p>Other European companies appear to have taken a different approach, helping the couple move money and win lucrative contracts from the Angolan state. The blue chip firms PwC and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) collected millions in fees, providing services such as auditing of accounts and management consultancy.</p> \n<p>PwC, which handled auditing and accounts for Dokolo companies in Malta, Switzerland and the Netherlands, said it had opened an internal investigation \u201cin response to the very serious and concerning allegations\u201d and \u201ctaken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the Dos Santos family\u201d.</p> \n<p>BCG said senior partners conducted regular reviews. \u201cWe are proud of and take responsibility for our work, and are strict in adhering to our policies and values,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> \n<p>Since taking over the leadership of the country and its ruling party, with the blessing of Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, the new president, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, has vowed to fight the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-22/angola-vows-to-fight-cancer-of-corruption-as-economy-recovers\">cancer of corruption</a>\u201d. The most high-profile targets of his anti-graft drive have been the children of his predecessor.</p> \n<p>Isabel dos Santos\u2019s half-brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/11/head-angola-wealth-fund-fired-paradise-papers-revelations\">Jos\u00e9 Filomeno dos Santos</a>, is on trial for the attempted looting of $500m from the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. He has pleaded not guilty. Her half-sister, Welwitschia dos Santos, a member of parliament, was impeached last year after moving to Britain. She fled after alleging she had been threatened by the Angolan secret service.</p> \n<p>Dos Santos, however, is fighting back.

      "bodyText": "The complex financial schemes that helped Africa\u2019s richest woman amass a fortune at vast cost to the Angolan state can be revealed for the first time after a huge leak of confidential documents from her business empire. Isabel dos Santos, who is known as \u201cthe princess\u201d in Angola, the oil-rich nation her father ruled as president for almost four decades, has long denied that her estimated $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) fortune is the result of nepotism or corruption. However, an investigation by the Guardian and journalists in 20 countries, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), suggests Dos Santos benefited from extraordinary opportunities afforded to her by the government of her father, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, before he stood down as president in September 2017. The businesswoman, who spends much of her time in London, controls interests across Africa and Europe spanning banking, telecoms, TV, cement, diamonds, alcohol, supermarkets and real estate. The Luanda Leaks are based on a trove of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts that was obtained initially by the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), an anti-corruption charity whose work with key witnesses helped topple the South African leader Jacob Zuma. The trove was then shared with the ICIJ. Dos Santos and her husband, the businessman and art collector Sindika Dokolo, say computers belonging to their employees and legal advisers were hacked. They say they are the subjects of a politically motivated witch-hunt led by Angola\u2019s new president. Through their lawyers, they rejected any allegation of wrongdoing, and vehemently denied being financed by state money. \u201cThere is an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated, it\u2019s completely unfounded,\u201d Dos Santos told BBC News. \u201cI can say my holdings are commercial, there are no proceeds from contracts or public contracts or money that has been deviated from other funds.\u201d Dokolo described the government actions as \u201carmageddon\u201d and a risk to the economy. The couple say their businesses employ thousands of people in Angola and are among the country\u2019s biggest tax contributors. \u201cWe have worked and invested in this country, more than many others,\u201d he said. In an open letter, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos rejected allegations of wrongdoing, saying he had \u201cnot transferred to himself, or to any other entity, money from the state\u201d. After a seven-month-investigation, the Guardian, working alongside outlets including the BBC, the New York Times and Portugal\u2019s Expresso newspaper, has uncovered documents that raise questions over preferential deals and lucrative transactions with the Angolan state worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The material reveals an opaque network of about 400 companies, many of them offshore, connected to Dos Santos, Dokolo and their associates, and the assistance given to the couple in managing them by a coterie of European and American management consultants, accountants and lawyers. The documents appear to suggest that: \u2022 The state oil company Sonangol sold Dokolo what has become the couple\u2019s most valuable asset: a stake in the Portuguese oil corporation Galp, now worth \u20ac750m after an initial loan-backed payment of just \u20ac11m. \u2022 A total of $115m in payments to consultancy firms, ordered while Dos Santos was chair of the state oil company, were routed through a Dubai company controlled by her associates. \u2022 A business venture with the state diamond company allegedly resulted in $200m of public debt propping up an ailing Swiss jewellery brand partly owned by Dokolo. \u2022 Two Dos Santos companies and their subcontractors stood to collect up to $500m in fees from a Dubai-style real estate development in the Angolan capital, Luanda, that was later cancelled by the new president for \u201cover-invoicing\u201d and \u201cdisproportionate compensation\u201d. Three weeks ago, Angola\u2019s attorney general announced a freeze on the assets of Dos Santos, Dokolo and their chief adviser, alleging that their dealings with the country\u2019s publicly owned oil and diamond companies had \u201charmed\u201d the state to the tune of $1bn. Angolan prosecutors launched a criminal investigation into her actions while at the helm of the state oil company, Sonangol, in September. They are working with counterparts in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, the US and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to trace assets, prevent money transfers and gather information. Dos Santos says she is the subject of a witch-hunt by Angola\u2019s government, designed to neutralise her as a potential political opponent. On Wednesday, she provoked speculation about a bid for the presidency, telling a TV interviewer it was \u201cpossible\u201d she would run for office. However, Dos Santos has not visited Angola for more than a year. A prosecutor told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso she was thought to have left the country hours after receiving a request from prosecutors to appear for questioning in July 2018. Through her lawyers, Dos Santos said she had \u201cno record of having received any such request\u201d, and that there was no question of her having refused to meet prosecutors. Dos Santos and her half-brothers and sisters are among the most prominent members of the oligarchy of powerful families in Angola. Her father came to office in 1979 as head of the People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). After the end of the civil war in 2002, President Dos Santos and the MPLA consolidated power by bringing the most valuable sectors of the economy into government ownership. The spoils were shared with a select group with links to politics and the military. As a result, Africa\u2019s second-largest oil producing nation became known as one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, ranking near the bottom of the Transparency International corruption perceptions index. \u201cThese are the classic symptoms of a captured state,\u201d said Steve Goodrich, a senior research manager at Transparency International UK, after reviewing the Luanda Leaks findings. \u201cHere we have industry and politics all in one family, with no apparent separation of powers.\u201d The leak includes data from Fidequity, a team of advisers who acted as a family office for the couple, administering their empire from plush premises above a Louis Vuitton salesroom in Lisbon. As the couple grew richer, emails and board minutes show the number of banks prepared to have them as clients dwindled. The data indicates that top-tier lenders severed ties after the Dos Santos regime was ruled a corruption risk by compliance departments. Company service providers in the Netherlands and the Isle of Man also turned down their business, the files suggest. Dokolo says he has been unable to open bank accounts under his own name in London and Paris since 2001. Other European companies appear to have taken a different approach, helping the couple move money and win lucrative contracts from the Angolan state. The blue chip firms PwC and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) collected millions in fees, providing services such as auditing of accounts and management consultancy. PwC, which handled auditing and accounts for Dokolo companies in Malta, Switzerland and the Netherlands, said it had opened an internal investigation \u201cin response to the very serious and concerning allegations\u201d and \u201ctaken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the Dos Santos family\u201d. BCG said senior partners conducted regular reviews. \u201cWe are proud of and take responsibility for our work, and are strict in adhering to our policies and values,\u201d a spokesperson said. Since taking over the leadership of the country and its ruling party, with the blessing of Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, the new president, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, has vowed to fight the \u201ccancer of corruption\u201d. The most high-profile targets of his anti-graft drive have been the children of his predecessor. Isabel dos Santos\u2019s half-brother, Jos\u00e9 Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial for the attempted looting of $500m from the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. He has pleaded not guilty. Her half-sister, Welwitschia dos Santos, a member of parliament, was impeached last year after moving to Britain. She fled after alleging she had been threatened by the Angolan secret service. Dos Santos, however, is fighting back. In recent weeks, she has toured media outlets giving interviews, saying her wealth is the result of hard work and business acumen. Her husband has opened an arbitration dispute in London against the state diamond company, and says he is involved in a second arbitration over Galp in the Netherlands. The Netherlands dispute centres on a loan from the state oil company, Sonangol, which sold part of its shareholding in Galp to a vehicle controlled by Dokolo in 2006. The agreed price was \u20ac75m, with Dokolo\u2019s company making an upfront payment of \u20ac11.2m and committing to pay the rest at a later date from dividends. If the whole amount had not been repaid by 31 December 2017, in euros, Dokolo\u2019s vehicle risked losing the shares. While Dos Santos was chair of Sonangol, it agreed to let Dokolo\u2019s vehicle make the repayment in Angola\u2019s volatile currency, the kwanza. After Dos Santos was sacked from the state oil company, its new managers cancelled the deal and sent the money back. Sonangol is now demanding compensation. Dokolo denies the deal was a preferential one, and said there was \u201cabsolutely no wrongdoing\u201d. Through his lawyers, he said that it had been approved after an internal review at Sonangol, and that the state oil company\u2019s purchase of a shareholding in Galp, one of its most successful investments, was originally his wife\u2019s idea and had been negotiated by him. Dokolo said he invested $115m in equity in the Swiss jeweller; that his commitment matched that of the state diamond company; and that the business \u201csteadily improved\u201d under his ownership. Dos Santos said under her leadership, Sonangol spent far less on consultants than previously. Her lawyers said the Dubai company that handled Sonangol\u2019s payments to consultancy firms was a lead contractor with a formal contract approved by the board of directors, and was not owned by Dos Santos. Challenged about how she has apparently benefited from her father\u2019s decrees, Dos Santos said the president\u2019s role was to ratify government concessions and licences, and that it would be hard to do business in Angola without ever having a decree relating to one of her companies. Her lawyers added that the prices agreed with her companies for the proposed redevelopment of Luanda were competitive, and that the allegations of overcharging were \u201cfalse and unfounded\u201d. In a sign that the international community is beginning to close ranks against Dos Santos, her name has been removed from a list of participants preparing to meet in Davos this week for the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual gathering of business and political leaders. Her company Unitel had paid to be a sponsor. The event\u2019s organisers said they were \u201cre-evaluating\u201d Unitel\u2019s participation. Additional reporting by Caelainn Barr.",

Despite boasting fans including Naomi Campbell, Sharon Stone and Rihanna, in 2009 it was struggling. Its boutiques in St Moritz and Las Vegas were not ringing up enough sales, and it had bank debts of more than 60m Swiss francs (\u00a350m).</p> \n<p>A search for investors to take on the debt and restructure the business led to Angola \u2013 source of some of the world\u2019s largest diamonds \u2013 and a partnership between Sodiam and Melbourne Investments, a private business ultimately owned by Dokolo. Between them, the documents show, they co-owned two Maltese companies, Victoria Holding Limited and a subsidiary, Victoria Limited. These took over<strong> </strong>the lion\u2019s share of the jeweller\u2019s Luxembourg parent, DG Holding, and with it the business, and debts, of the high-end brand, buying out an existing debt and paying 3.5m Swiss francs into the company.</p> \n<p>On paper, Victoria Holding Limited was a 50/50 venture between Melbourne Investments and Sodiam. Documents suggest that in practice, however, the Angolan state<strong> </strong>appears to have provided most, if not all, of the funds that made the purchase of De Grisogono possible.</p> \n<p>In February 2012, in the days before the De Grisogono deal went through<strong>,</strong> Sodiam transferred $45m-worth of loans to Victoria Holding Limited, which was used to pay off the jeweller\u2019s debt and provide investment. In contrast, the documents seen by the Guardian do not appear to show any sign of money having come in from Dokolo\u2019s company <em>before</em> the purchase. The first payment from him, of $4m, seems to have come through in early March after the payments for the debt and shares were met.</p> \n<p>In a letter, Dokolo\u2019s lawyers said: \u201cIt is not correct that Sodiam provided the majority of the funding to acquire the stake in De Grisogono.\u201d They provided no further details.</p> \n<p>The potential mismatch in risk appears to have continued in the early years, with papers produced at the end of 2015 stating that Sodiam had advanced $129m while Dokolo had loaned $17m. A draft copy of the shareholders\u2019 agreement from the time of the purchase suggests that Melbourne \u201chas the full control of the management of [Victoria Holding], Victoria Limited, De Grisogono Holding SA and De Grisogono, SA\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e39d60865625b5eb54960c4bdb82d178b9b4064a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e39d60865625b5eb54960c4bdb82d178b9b4064a/0_209_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sindika Dokolo and Isabel dos Santos pose with Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka at a De Grisogono party during the 2018 Cannes film festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sindika Dokolo and Isabel dos Santos pose with Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka at a De Grisogono party during the 2018 Cannes film festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dokolo\u2019s lawyers said both partners had invested the same sums into the company. \u201cSince the acquisition and until Sodiam\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the joint-venture in 2018, Mr Dokolo invested about $115m in equity into De Grisogono \u2013 verified through an independent audit by a leading global professional services firm and presented to both shareholders. Similarly, Sodiam invested $115m in equity in De Grisogono.\u201d</p> \n<p>By 2017, Sodiam\u2019s<strong> </strong>investmenthad grown to $147m.</p> \n<p>It was financed with a loan it took from Banco Bic- an Angolan bank part-owned by Isabel Dos Santos. The debt had an interest rate of 9% and was guaranteed by the Angolan treasury. This suggests Dos Santos\u2019s bank earned interest from the state-backed company but had no risk of losses should things have gone wrong and Sodiam found itself unable to repay its loans.</p> \n<p>How Sodiam seemingly came to get the rough end of the stick is part of what the Angolan authorities are investigating. But there is another twist. According to the documents, Sodiam not only paid for most of the couple\u2019s stake in De Grisogono, it might also have unwittingly funded Dokolo\u2019s initial investment.</p> \n<p>Shortly before the De Grisogono purchase was arranged, a British Virgin Islands-based company, Almerk International, signed an agreement with Victoria Holding to advise on the acquisition. The document, drawn up in October 2011, said Almerk was a \u201cfinancial consultant\u201d to Victoria Holding, although \u201cnot responsible for giving the company legal, accounting or taxation advice in relation to the transaction\u201d.</p> \n<p>It said that for these services Almerk International would receive a success fee. What was not stated in the agreement, or apparently disclosed to the auditors of Victoria Holding, is that Almerk International was owned by Dokolo. Immediately after the deal went through, Almerk received $4m from Victoria Holding for its services.

      "bodyText": "The jeweller De Grisogono may not be a household name, but it has cachet among the stars. Its annual party at the Cannes film festival is a sparkling occasion, and not just for the A-listers who get to wear the diamond necklaces the company produces. This is a glamorous world \u2013 and one in which Isabel dos Santos, Africa\u2019s richest woman and daughter of the former president of Angola, and her husband, Sindika Dokolo, have had a place since he acquired a stake in the Swiss company in 2012. But this share of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious jewellery makers, and the money behind it, is now part of an investigation in Angola, where prosecutors have said they are looking at allegations that the couple enriched themselves at the expense of the country. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest the Angolan state-backed diamond company Sodiam was instrumental in buying and financing De Grisogono, exposing itself to huge loans to pay for the purchase of the company and its ongoing support. But despite its financial investment, Sodiam took no role in deciding how De Grisogono was run. Instead, Dokolo and his team appear to have managed the loss-making business, involving Dos Santos in key decisions such as the establishment and design of new premises in London. Concern about this arrangement was expressed in an announcement by the country\u2019s new government last month saying it was freezing the couple\u2019s assets, and accusing them of making, and hiding, money at the state\u2019s expense. The decree included a claim that Sodiam is owed $147m for loans used to prop up De Grisogono, money it borrowed from a bank linked to Dos Santos. It also alleged that Dokolo and Dos Santos were able to buy diamonds from the state at below market value, through several companies that were given the status of \u201cpreferential buyer\u201d with Sodiam. The couple have denied the claims and say they are the victims of a political \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. In December, Dokolo launched legal action against Sodiam at a London arbitration tribunal, claiming he had lost $120m in the venture. The De Grisogono deal is one of many that has been investigated by the Guardian, the BBC and other partners as part of the Luanda Leaks project, coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Leaked documents seen by the Guardian and partners reveal a complex set of companies and loans behind the purchase of the stake in the jeweller. The documents, which include company accounts from the years after the purchase and emails describing transactions, offer an insight into the ownership of the Swiss jeweller, and raise questions about why the state invested so much in a loss-making venture while apparently allowing Dokolo to have day-to-day control over the company it was buying. How Sindika Dokolo and the Angolan state came to acquire a Swiss luxury jeweller That De Grisogono needed money is one thing that is not in doubt. Despite boasting fans including Naomi Campbell, Sharon Stone and Rihanna, in 2009 it was struggling. Its boutiques in St Moritz and Las Vegas were not ringing up enough sales, and it had bank debts of more than 60m Swiss francs (\u00a350m). A search for investors to take on the debt and restructure the business led to Angola \u2013 source of some of the world\u2019s largest diamonds \u2013 and a partnership between Sodiam and Melbourne Investments, a private business ultimately owned by Dokolo. Between them, the documents show, they co-owned two Maltese companies, Victoria Holding Limited and a subsidiary, Victoria Limited. These took over the lion\u2019s share of the jeweller\u2019s Luxembourg parent, DG Holding, and with it the business, and debts, of the high-end brand, buying out an existing debt and paying 3.5m Swiss francs into the company. On paper, Victoria Holding Limited was a 50/50 venture between Melbourne Investments and Sodiam. Documents suggest that in practice, however, the Angolan state appears to have provided most, if not all, of the funds that made the purchase of De Grisogono possible. In February 2012, in the days before the De Grisogono deal went through, Sodiam transferred $45m-worth of loans to Victoria Holding Limited, which was used to pay off the jeweller\u2019s debt and provide investment. In contrast, the documents seen by the Guardian do not appear to show any sign of money having come in from Dokolo\u2019s company before the purchase. The first payment from him, of $4m, seems to have come through in early March after the payments for the debt and shares were met. In a letter, Dokolo\u2019s lawyers said: \u201cIt is not correct that Sodiam provided the majority of the funding to acquire the stake in De Grisogono.\u201d They provided no further details. The potential mismatch in risk appears to have continued in the early years, with papers produced at the end of 2015 stating that Sodiam had advanced $129m while Dokolo had loaned $17m. A draft copy of the shareholders\u2019 agreement from the time of the purchase suggests that Melbourne \u201chas the full control of the management of [Victoria Holding], Victoria Limited, De Grisogono Holding SA and De Grisogono, SA\u201d. Dokolo\u2019s lawyers said both partners had invested the same sums into the company. \u201cSince the acquisition and until Sodiam\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the joint-venture in 2018, Mr Dokolo invested about $115m in equity into De Grisogono \u2013 verified through an independent audit by a leading global professional services firm and presented to both shareholders. Similarly, Sodiam invested $115m in equity in De Grisogono.\u201d By 2017, Sodiam\u2019s investmenthad grown to $147m. It was financed with a loan it took from Banco Bic- an Angolan bank part-owned by Isabel Dos Santos. The debt had an interest rate of 9% and was guaranteed by the Angolan treasury. This suggests Dos Santos\u2019s bank earned interest from the state-backed company but had no risk of losses should things have gone wrong and Sodiam found itself unable to repay its loans. How Sodiam seemingly came to get the rough end of the stick is part of what the Angolan authorities are investigating. But there is another twist. According to the documents, Sodiam not only paid for most of the couple\u2019s stake in De Grisogono, it might also have unwittingly funded Dokolo\u2019s initial investment. Shortly before the De Grisogono purchase was arranged, a British Virgin Islands-based company, Almerk International, signed an agreement with Victoria Holding to advise on the acquisition. The document, drawn up in October 2011, said Almerk was a \u201cfinancial consultant\u201d to Victoria Holding, although \u201cnot responsible for giving the company legal, accounting or taxation advice in relation to the transaction\u201d. It said that for these services Almerk International would receive a success fee. What was not stated in the agreement, or apparently disclosed to the auditors of Victoria Holding, is that Almerk International was owned by Dokolo. Immediately after the deal went through, Almerk received $4m from Victoria Holding for its services. Days later, the money appears to have been paid back to Victoria Holding by Melbourne Investments. It would appear that Dokolo\u2019s investment in Victoria Holding, and ultimately De Grisogono, was in effect paid for by Sodiam. Giving a different figure, his lawyers said: \u201cFor the successful complex negotiations and structuring of the acquisition of De Grisogono, which included buying back the company\u2019s bank debts in Switzerland at a significant discount resulting from a payment of only CHF [Swiss francs] 25.7m of the CHF 63.5m outstanding, Mr Dokolo, through his company Almerk, received a remuneration fee of $5m.\u201d Tom Keatinge, the director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, said there were questions over the involvement of Almerk and the \u201ccircular movement of funds\u201d. \u201cIt seems a bit odd to work as an adviser or consultant on a deal which you are going to benefit from. It\u2019s not illegal but it just doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is not a zero-risk proposition, but who is bearing the risk is the question. We can say that the bank is not bearing the risk, because it has the guarantee from the state. Dokolo is bearing the risk, but he has an influential connection with Sodiam ...

The business was losing money, with a turnaround plan and big-budget spending on marketing failing to have much impact on sales and profits. Late that year, shortly after Dos Santos\u2019s father, Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, stepped down as president of Angola, the new leadership of Sodiam announced it wanted to withdraw from De Grisogono for \u201creasons of public interest\u201d, although it still holds its investment. Sodiam\u2019s new chairman, Eug\u00e9nio Pereira Bravo da Rosa, said the loan taken out from Banco Bic had grown to almost $200m with interest.

      "bodyText": "The Labour leadership contender Jess Phillips has pledged to stop trying to appear prime ministerial as she battles to secure a place on the ballot paper after what she described as an \u201cawful\u201d first hustings in Liverpool on Saturday. Writing for the Guardian, Phillips acknowledges that it looks highly unlikely anyone but the two frontrunners, Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, would win the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. She conceded that she had \u201cstopped being real\u201d during the hustings event on Saturday \u2013 the first of a dozen \u2013 as she tried to deliver carefully prepared lines in a limited time. \u201cThe hustings was awful. I was awful because I was trying to hit a million different lines and messages in 40 seconds. Some were my lines, some were other people\u2019s and it fell flat,\u201d she wrote. She lamented what she called \u201ctriangulation\u201d, as candidates try to appeal to different factions in Labour, and said she would now ditch any attempt to appear \u201cstatesmanlike\u201d. \u201cI might not look the most like a prime minister in this race, because apparently looking like a prime minister is a thing. I cannot win that war, so I am going to stop fighting it. I am going to do the thing that made tens of thousands of people ask me to run to be the leader. I am going to say what I think. I am going to give honest answers. I probably won\u2019t win, but I am guessing that I might just inspire others to give it a go too,\u201d she wrote. The outspoken Phillips appears to be faltering at the second hurdle that candidates must clear to get on to the ballot paper after receiving enough nominations from MPs. Each contender must win the support either of 33 constituency Labour parties (CLPs); or of three affiliates, two of which must be unions, and which between them account for at least 5% of the affiliated membership. In practice, that means they need either a strong base among grassroots members or one of the \u201cbig five\u201d unions on their side. Of those, only the shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw appears likely to consider supporting Phillips. Its 15-strong executive will meet on Monday to make a decision, and some trades union sources have suggested it could opt for Starmer in an attempt to \u201cback a winner\u201d. In that case, Phillips would have to hope for an upsurge in support from CLPs. Only 14 CLPs have nominated so far \u2013 and of those, 11 have backed Starmer and three have gone for Long-Bailey. There are fewer than four weeks left until the 14 February deadline for gathering nominations. Of the other \u201cbig five\u201d unions aside from Usdaw, Unison has already backed Starmer; the GMB is expected to choose between him and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy on Tuesday; and Unite is highly likely to support Long-Bailey when its executive meets, also this week. The leftwing Communication Workers Union (CWU) also appears unlikely to throw its weight behind Phillips, who is not from the left of the party. While Starmer has been ahead in recent opinion polls of Labour members, Long-Bailey can count on the backing of the leftwing Labour campaign group Momentum. That will give her team access to its formidable database of party members, who will be encouraged to staff phone banks supporting her candidacy. The shadow business secretary has said she would score Corbyn\u2019s leadership 10 out of 10 but has sought to distance herself from the party\u2019s disastrous general election campaign, saying that it had no overarching message. At the hustings on Saturday, she said she and her colleagues needed to become \u201csalespeople for socialism\u201d. \u201cHow do we show people that everything we believe in in this room is sensible, credible and will transform our economy?\u201d she said. \u201cBecause what we are talking about is being done in other European countries and they are not calling it far-left or crazy. It\u2019s what a civilised society expects. And I want to be the leader that gets the aspirational message through to people.\u201d Like Phillips, Emily Thornberry\u2019s campaign appears to be struggling to make headway. She urged union bosses last week not to \u201ckeep the gates closed\u201d to a wide field of candidates. Nandy will visit the port of Grimsby on Monday, and argue that the government\u2019s industrial strategy should be reshaped to prioritise the \u201cfoundational economy\u201d \u2013 the things Britain relies on, including food and energy. \u201cThe Brexit debate has lifted up the bonnet of the UK economy and should let us better appreciate who owns what, who supplies it, and from where.

Labour, Hillsborough families and the justice charity Inquest have backed survivors\u2019 calls for Mehra\u2019s removal from the panel. The inquiry has so far said it does not consider that her previous role \u201cin any way affects her impartiality as a panel member\u201d. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said there were \u201crobust processes \u2026 [to ensure] any potential conflicts of interest are properly considered and managed\u201d. A Grenfell United spokesperson said: \u201cIt was apparent in the meeting last week that the prime minister is out of touch with what we\u2019ve gone through the last few years. If we are ever going to see justice and real change for what happened to our 72 loved ones, it will be on Johnson\u2019s watch. The shamefully poor due diligence shown by the government on the panel appointment has the potential of putting the entire inquiry process in question.\u201d Mohamed Ragab, whose nephew Hesham Rahman died in the fire, said he told Johnson in a meeting last Thursday that he used to work for the TMO. \u201c[Johnson] said: \u2018What is the TMO?\u2019 and one of the officials sitting next to him said it was the tenants\u2019 management organisation,\u201d said Ragab. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got any idea about the meaning of TMO.\u201d In October when Moore-Bick issued his findings from the first phase of the inquiry, Johnson told the House of Commons that the survivors and bereaved \u201chave been let down many times before. Too often overlooked and ignored in the months and years before the tragedy.\u201d He said it was \u201cthe cladding that turned a routine and containable kitchen fire into a disaster of unprecedented proportions,\u201d and it had been fitted in breach of building regulations. \u201cWhy this was allowed to happen \u2013 and who was responsible for it \u2013 will be covered in phase two of his inquiry,\u201d he said. A Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister is completely committed to doing whatever it takes to secure justice for the bereaved and survivors and all those affected by the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower. This government will ensure that they have an active and engaging role to play in implementing the lessons of Grenfell.\u201d",

Sullenberger, known as \u201cSully\u201d, became famous in January 2009 after his airliner struck a flock of Canada geese but he managed to land it on the Hudson river, saving the lives of all 155 people onboard. In 2016, Clint Eastwood made the story into a film with Tom Hanks in the eponymous title role.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/opinion/sully-biden-stutter-lara-trump.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email&amp;login=email&amp;auth=login-email&amp;login=email&amp;auth=login-email\">a column for the New York Times</a>, Sullenberger began by remembering his own experiences with a stutter in his childhood in Texas, \u201cthe anguish of being called on in grade school, knowing that I was going to have a hard time getting the words out; that my words could not keep up with my mind, and they would often come out jumbled\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy neck and face would quickly begin to flush a bright red,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe searing heat rising all the way to the top of my head; every eye in the room on me; the intense and painful humiliation, and bullying that would follow, all because of my inability to get the words out.</p> <p>\u201cThose feelings came rushing back, when I heard Lara Trump mocking former Vice-President Joe Biden at a Trump campaign event, with the very words that caused my childhood agony.\u201d</p> <p>Sullenberger disclosed that he attended a Biden fundraiser last year, but said: \u201cThis issue goes beyond politics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRegardless of how you feel about Joe Biden,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president; whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or none of the above; whether you stuttered as a child or laughed at one who did; whether as a parent you try to protect your own stuttering child from taunts such as those made by the president\u2019s daughter-in-law; these words come without hesitation: Stop. Grow up. Show some decency. People who can\u2019t have no place in public life.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s words, he said, were indicative of a \u201cculture of cruelty\u201d which \u201cdrives decent people from public service and \u2026 makes millions of Americans recoil from politics, and even from participating in our democracy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVice-President Biden has spoken openly \u2013 and courageously, in my view \u2013 about the pain of his severe childhood stutter,\u201d Sullenberger wrote. \u201cHe takes time to reach out to children who have suffered as he did.</p> <p>\u201cSo, to every child who feels today, what I felt, after hearing those cruel remarks by an adult who should know better, here is what I want you to know: \u201cYou are fine, just as you are.\u201d</p> <p>Sullenberger concluded by saying \u201ca speech disorder is a lot easier to treat than a character defect\u201d and telling any children reading to \u201cignore kids (and adults) who are mean, or don\u2019t know what it feels like to stutter.</p> <p>\u201cRespond by showing them how to be kind, polite, respectful and generous, to be brave enough to try big things, even though you are not perfect.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1218930361402634242\">a tweet on Sunday</a>, Biden thanked Sullenberger for \u201csharing your story. There\u2019s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it. Being different isn\u2019t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing \u2013 or even run for president.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who performed the \u201cMiracle on the Hudson\u201d, has told Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump to \u201cgrow up\u201d and \u201cshow some decency\u201d, after she mocked Joe Biden for stuttering. Biden, a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to face President Trump in November, has spoken openly about his lifelong experiences with a stutter. Lara Trump, who is married to the president\u2019s second son Eric, works for the Trump re-election campaign and spoke in that capacity at an event in Iowa on Friday, the day after the seventh Democratic debate. \u201cI feel kind of sad for Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you know that\u2019s when it\u2019s not going well for him, right, because I\u2019m supposed to want him to fail at every turn. But every time he comes onstage or they turn to him, I\u2019m like, \u2018Joe, can you get it out? Let\u2019s get the words out, Joe.\u2019\u201d Trump is not the first prominent supporter of her father-in-law to face criticism for mocking Biden\u2019s stutter: Fox News has aired montages of his stuttering on the debate stage and former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders deleted a mocking tweet in December. Nonetheless, on Friday Trump criticised reporting of her remarks and insisted in a tweet that \u201canyone who takes 10 seconds to watch what I actually said can clearly see that I never mention a stutter \u2013 didn\u2019t even know he had one\u201d. On Saturday, a well-known voice fired back. Sullenberger, known as \u201cSully\u201d, became famous in January 2009 after his airliner struck a flock of Canada geese but he managed to land it on the Hudson river, saving the lives of all 155 people onboard. In 2016, Clint Eastwood made the story into a film with Tom Hanks in the eponymous title role. In a column for the New York Times, Sullenberger began by remembering his own experiences with a stutter in his childhood in Texas, \u201cthe anguish of being called on in grade school, knowing that I was going to have a hard time getting the words out; that my words could not keep up with my mind, and they would often come out jumbled\u201d. \u201cMy neck and face would quickly begin to flush a bright red,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe searing heat rising all the way to the top of my head; every eye in the room on me; the intense and painful humiliation, and bullying that would follow, all because of my inability to get the words out. \u201cThose feelings came rushing back, when I heard Lara Trump mocking former Vice-President Joe Biden at a Trump campaign event, with the very words that caused my childhood agony.\u201d Sullenberger disclosed that he attended a Biden fundraiser last year, but said: \u201cThis issue goes beyond politics.\u201d \u201cRegardless of how you feel about Joe Biden,\u201d he wrote, \u201cor his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president; whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or none of the above; whether you stuttered as a child or laughed at one who did; whether as a parent you try to protect your own stuttering child from taunts such as those made by the president\u2019s daughter-in-law; these words come without hesitation: Stop. Grow up. Show some decency. People who can\u2019t have no place in public life.\u201d Trump\u2019s words, he said, were indicative of a \u201cculture of cruelty\u201d which \u201cdrives decent people from public service and \u2026 makes millions of Americans recoil from politics, and even from participating in our democracy\u201d. \u201cVice-President Biden has spoken openly \u2013 and courageously, in my view \u2013 about the pain of his severe childhood stutter,\u201d Sullenberger wrote. \u201cHe takes time to reach out to children who have suffered as he did. \u201cSo, to every child who feels today, what I felt, after hearing those cruel remarks by an adult who should know better, here is what I want you to know: \u201cYou are fine, just as you are.\u201d Sullenberger concluded by saying \u201ca speech disorder is a lot easier to treat than a character defect\u201d and telling any children reading to \u201cignore kids (and adults) who are mean, or don\u2019t know what it feels like to stutter. \u201cRespond by showing them how to be kind, polite, respectful and generous, to be brave enough to try big things, even though you are not perfect.\u201d In a tweet on Sunday, Biden thanked Sullenberger for \u201csharing your story. There\u2019s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it. Being different isn\u2019t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing \u2013 or even run for president.\u201d",

Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 Schools have to publish Sats results because the government says that tables help drive up standards by providing valuable information and increasing local accountability. Matt Hancock feels that NHS A&amp;E targets are no longer \u201cclinically appropriate\u201d, so wants to scrap them. If the results on meeting targets are embarrassing, the solution is not to scrap publication but take positive action to improve them.

Fabulous to see Mark Wood back in the wickets, let\u2019s hope those six overs on the trot at the end don\u2019t give him too much gip overnight. Spinmeister Joe Root still in the market for his first five-fer. South Africa can\u2019t have a prayer, unless the weather switches again. Thanks for all the emails and tweets - remember play starts at tomorrow at 8am GMT. Good evening!</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e247ef28f0879d539efb074\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-19T16:24:24.263Z\">4.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Mark Wood is on the mic, </strong>and as excellent as always: \u201cA good day, it certainly started different to how I expected it. The pitch isn\u2019t doing much for the seamers but Broady and Sam have done brilliantly.It\u2019s not been a pitch where you blast people out so plenty of hard work ahead.</p> \n  <p>\u201cObviously the pitch wasn\u2019t that responsive the first time around, so it was a case of getting the stumps into play and seeing what happens. With a new ball you have to take that risk. a crucial session for us at the start of play. If there hadn\u2019t been the weather around we might have batted again.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen he [Root] bowls himself he gets key wickets, he bowled really well. My rhythm is is pretty good, my first game since July and I was feeling it a bit by the end. It was good when Dean Elgar\u2019s stump went flying back. I was deliberately a bit fuller after the rain-break. </p> \n  <p><strong>How do you balance what you want to do and what the skipper wants to do? </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to do what the team needs, trying to create rough for the right-hander. No reverse-swing here today, tried to look after the ball but not happened for us. It is a bit lush and with the weather around it has dampened the ball.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>The South African coach Mark Boucher</strong> is now under the pump. He\u2019s brtutally honest \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. We were outskilled. I\u2019ve got to find a way to get the players up mentally and upskill them in the shortest possible time to help them get a better performance out of them. Mentally the guys are probably switched on but it\u2019s about understanding the situation. A new ball, you have to take care of that, things that you expect the guys to know but perhaps they don\u2019t. Joe Root is quite difficult to play, one that slides on, one that turns, <strong>the harder you try, the quicker you sink. </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cYes, when you\u2019re under the pump for long periods of time, every side has a breaking point, but our breaking point was early today which was disappointing. We talk about plan A and plan B but sometimes you have to change your game plan. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no place to hide in Test cricket and ultimately our nation wants results but I want to compete. The captain is disappointed, we\u2019ve got a Test series on the line and lots of things have been said in the media but he\u2019s trying really hard. I don\u2019t make any excuses, the off-field pressures are no excuses.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-19T16:26:37.496Z\">at 4.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e247dd68f0879d539efb067\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-19T16:07:45.466Z\">4.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stumps</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>62nd over: South Africa 102-6 (Philander 13, Maharaj 5) </strong>Philander eyes up a Root leg-side bouncer and, despite it being the last over of the day, flays it for four.

Lastly, if the right hip drives more efficiently, the bowler\u2019s weight is more evenly distributed and they can generate far more torque and consequently bowling speed.\u201d</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2476a68f08a6950eb44cd3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-19T15:35:55.899Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>54th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) </strong>Just one off the captain\u2019s over.<strong> </strong>Root\u2019s best bowling figures are bringing much musing from OBO-ers.</p> \n  <p>John Starbuck: <em>Perhaps Root is becoming so successful a bowler because batsmen don\u2019t take him seriously (a captain bowling just because he can), rather like Atherton was.

Thanks for all the emails and tweets - remember play starts at tomorrow at 8am GMT. Good evening! Mark Wood is on the mic, and as excellent as always: \u201cA good day, it certainly started different to how I expected it. The pitch isn\u2019t doing much for the seamers but Broady and Sam have done brilliantly.It\u2019s not been a pitch where you blast people out so plenty of hard work ahead. \u201cObviously the pitch wasn\u2019t that responsive the first time around, so it was a case of getting the stumps into play and seeing what happens. With a new ball you have to take that risk. a crucial session for us at the start of play. If there hadn\u2019t been the weather around we might have batted again. \u201cWhen he [Root] bowls himself he gets key wickets, he bowled really well. My rhythm is is pretty good, my first game since July and I was feeling it a bit by the end. It was good when Dean Elgar\u2019s stump went flying back. I was deliberately a bit fuller after the rain-break. How do you balance what you want to do and what the skipper wants to do? \u201cI\u2019m happy to do what the team needs, trying to create rough for the right-hander. No reverse-swing here today, tried to look after the ball but not happened for us. It is a bit lush and with the weather around it has dampened the ball.\u201d The South African coach Mark Boucher is now under the pump. He\u2019s brtutally honest \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. We were outskilled. I\u2019ve got to find a way to get the players up mentally and upskill them in the shortest possible time to help them get a better performance out of them. Mentally the guys are probably switched on but it\u2019s about understanding the situation. A new ball, you have to take care of that, things that you expect the guys to know but perhaps they don\u2019t. Joe Root is quite difficult to play, one that slides on, one that turns, the harder you try, the quicker you sink. \u201cYes, when you\u2019re under the pump for long periods of time, every side has a breaking point, but our breaking point was early today which was disappointing. We talk about plan A and plan B but sometimes you have to change your game plan. \u201cThere\u2019s no place to hide in Test cricket and ultimately our nation wants results but I want to compete. The captain is disappointed, we\u2019ve got a Test series on the line and lots of things have been said in the media but he\u2019s trying really hard. I don\u2019t make any excuses, the off-field pressures are no excuses.\u201d 62nd over: South Africa 102-6 (Philander 13, Maharaj 5) Philander eyes up a Root leg-side bouncer and, despite it being the last over of the day, flays it for four. Root approaches the umpire with his empty bowl, but is told no. No extra half hour. Still -an unbelievable day for England and one to forget for South Africa. The forecast for tomorrow, by the way, is now pretty good. 61st over: South Africa 97-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 5) Ok, this was the penultimate over of the day as Bess rushes through and Maharaj plays him out. One more over before the clock strikes for Root to clutch his five-fer. 60th over: South Africa 97-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 5) A quiet Root over, the penultimate of the day. And I\u2019d meant to reply to Quinn\u2019s tweet (below). Steve Waugh was a pretty handy golden arm in that Australian golden age. 59th over: South Africa 96-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 4) Philander pulls a Wood bouncer like a wet gaberdine and it flies to backward square leg where it hits Stokes hard and sprays through his hands and hits him in the ribs as he slips backwards. I\u2019m not sure he picked it up at all - which might focus the umpires\u2019 minds. Incidentally, that is Stokes\u2019s fourth drop this Test. 58th over: South Africa 93-6 (Philander 8, Maharaj 1) Philander sprays a Root juicy long hop inelegantly through mid wicket for four. The umpires have a long chat and glance up at the floodlights. 57th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) A Wood maiden, as South Africa play the survival game. 56th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) Big lbw appeal against Maharaj by Root, but it doesn\u2019t impress the umpires and England are out of reviews. Gabriel and/or Juliet write: \u201cIf Archer comes back for Johannesburg, who makes room? Curran has done his usual solid and excellent thing, Wood has been electric, and both have added depth to the batting in this match. Who gets dropped? Stokes?\u201d Eeek. Bess? 55th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) Wood rockets a ball just past Philander\u2019 flying elbow, and he survives. Wood also goes sprawling in the PE dust for the first time today in his follow-through, something he takes in typical smiling stride. A fascinating email on Wood\u2019s action from Scott Roberts, \u201cI disagree with Mike Selvey re Mark Wood\u2019s back foot. I work with javelin throwers, and in my opinion his \u2018front on\u2019 back foot is exactly what you\u2019re looking for when throwing/bowling. I come across countless throwers (including myself) who have a \u2018lazy\u2019 or \u2018dragging\u2019 back foot that lands parallel to the crease and all it does is create a lazy right hip (for the right handed bowler) which doesn\u2019t drive at the target, meaning the left hip (again for the right handed bowler) has to work harder to rotate over the front foot, whilst also creating far more chance of injury to the left hip, right groin and lower back. Lastly, if the right hip drives more efficiently, the bowler\u2019s weight is more evenly distributed and they can generate far more torque and consequently bowling speed.\u201d 54th over: South Africa 87-6 (Philander 4, Maharaj 0) Just one off the captain\u2019s over. Root\u2019s best bowling figures are bringing much musing from OBO-ers. John Starbuck: Perhaps Root is becoming so successful a bowler because batsmen don\u2019t take him seriously (a captain bowling just because he can), rather like Atherton was. The problem with this is that it\u2019s a law of diminishing returns; the more he takes wickets, the less goofy he can appear and he loses the surprise element. 53rd over: South Africa 86-6 (Philander 3, Maharaj 0) An eventful over from Wood, who steams in as the conditions darken around him. Eight overs left today, with the option, if the umpires agree, for the extra half hour. Philander slams a pull square which Sibley leaps, grabs, and then drops, before Philander and Maharaj nearly run each out, just beating a diving stump-crash by Wood. And the band play on. 52nd over: South Africa 83-6 (Philander 0, Maharaj 0) Just seen that catch again, a simple-ish two-handed plop high into Pope\u2019s hands. Sensational bowling by Root today! His batting average is now higher than his bowling average so can he pin the badge of all rounder? du Plessis reviews after chewing the fat for four or five seconds, but no matter. He is out, a huge inside edge onto his pad which billows out to Pope at short leg. South Africa who have lost 10 for 83 today. 51st over: South Africa 83-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 36) Wood not as incisive as Root. Which is not a sentence I ever expected to write. \u201cRoot should do the decent thing here and take himself out of the attack in order to avoid getting a five-for, or he might undermine Bess\u2019s confidence having done the same by devaluing the achievement,\u201d muses Tom vd Gucht, somewhat harshly. \u201cAs the captain, he needs to be pumping up his team\u2019s tyres, not saying, \u201cAnything you can do, I can do better!\u201d 50th over: South Africa 83-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 36) Root delves into his box of tricks and flicks out a leg-break that turns into a bouncer that digs in a quarter of the way down the pitch and du Plessis swivel-thuds through mid-wicket for four. Graham Thorn has been watching the swaying, bending, palm trees: It\u2019s no wonder England are bowling well in these conditions - they appear to have brought some of Manchester\u2019s finest summer weather with them to Port Elizabeth. 49th over: South Africa 79-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 32) Wood replaces Bess and hares in. Du Plessis edges him through second slip, or rather where second slip would be, if England had one. 48th over: South Africa 74-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 27) Philander survives the Daemon Root. 47th over: South Africa 74-5 (Philander 0, du Plessis 27) Second-fiddle Bess rattles through another. Michael Robinson writes: \u201cAll the talk of who has been England\u2019s best all rounder during the last but I don\u2019t remember anyone mentioning Root. Incredible stuff from him today, amy idea what his bowling average is?\u201d It was 24 at 52 before this match, I think. 46th over: South Africa 74-5 (Philander 03, du Plessis 27) de Kock out for the second time today, a shot he\u2019ll want to wipe from all memory banks. A shot you might play after discovering you\u2019ve dropped a purse bulging with fifty pound notes down the drain. Root now has bowled eight overs, 3-11. de Kock has a moment of madness, playing a free-wheeling golf shot against Root which flies off the back of the bat to Wood at backward point, who times his leap to perfection and grabs it high with both hands. 45th over: South Africa 74-4 (de Kock 3, du Plessis 27) de Kock\u2019s shots have a lovely flow to them as he defends and drives Bess away. Tis windy out there - the flags jigging a merry dance. On the radio they think it is gusting wildly, yet to decide on direction. Some thoughts from Selv on Mark Wood: 44th over: South Africa 72-4 (de Kock 2, du Plessis 26) Root bowling wide of the crease and has a huge appeal against de Kock. The ump isn\u2019t interested and replays show the ball probably pitching outside the line, and an inside edge too for good measure. That\u2019s drinks, as Derek Stocker dreams of the Peak District. 43rd over: South Africa 71-4 (de Kock 1, du Plessis 26) Bess round the wicket to de Kock who prods and pokes him away. 42nd over: South Africa 71-4 (de Kock 1, du Plessis 26) du Plessis breaks the spell by sweeping Root hard, for four. 41st over: South Africa 66-4 (de Kock 0, du Plessis 16) Nowt much happened. Just waiting for the unplayable Root. For those still looking for commentary: 40th over: South Africa 66-4 (de Kock 0, du Plessis 16) Such a sensational catch by Pope, who was not only wearing a helmet but also chewing gum. England bounce about in delight. Van der Dussen had been dropped at leg slip by Dom Sibley (a sharp chance) two balls earlier. An acrobatic flying leap by Ollie Pope at short leg, diving to his left, and with his left hand plucking the ball high from behind him and clutching it in as he falls. Eye Popping! Van der Dussen had prodded forward one time too many, and got an inside edge onto his pads which plopped up tastily. 39th over: South Africa 66-3 (van der Dussen 10, du Plessis 16) Bess bowls full, but du Plessis plays him away without too many problems. 38th over: South Africa 66-3 (van der Dussen 10, du Plessis 16) Root around the wicket, van der Dussen digs him out, squiffs him out, and angles the ball away. Root\u2019s got the bit between his fingers this afternoon. But no joy for the spin twins yet in the half hour since tea. An ode to Faf arrives, from Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cFaf du Plessis is an exemplary leader. He may not be the most talented batsman in any international line-up, but he is akin to Eoin Morgan in the way he commands respect from both his teammates as well as opponents. That reputation has taken a hit in recent times owing to off-field controversies coinciding with a dip in personal form. The team\u2019s returns are being questioned, so is his age. I hope he is not made a scapegoat if they lose this series. It would help a lot if he gets a big score in this innings.\u201d 37th over: South Africa 66-3 (van der Dussen 10, du Plessis 16) Anything you can do Rassie... du Plessis shuffle-dances and bangs Bess over long off for six tasty ones. 36th over: South Africa 60-3 (van der Dussen 10, du Plessis 16) It\u2019s silly season out there: Van der Dussen is given out to one that seems to be sliding past the stumps - and, on review, is . Van der Dussen then spots a short one and rocks back and pulls Root for six. 35th over: South Africa 54-3 (van der Dussen 4, du Plessis 16) Bess. Maiden. Derek in Zimbabwe again. 34th over: South Africa 54-3 (van der Dussen 4, du Plessis 16) Root has now bowled 5-4-4-1. Here\u2019s another maiden. Ian Forth asks, \u201cCan anyone remember a worse review than that?\u201d 33rd over: South Africa 54-3 (van der Dussen 4, du Plessis 16) du Plessis decides he can\u2019t stand any more of this tiki taka batting and hoops into Bess and launches him, not entirely convincingly, over mid-off for four . The run- rates today for the first two sessions: 1.39 and 1.40. 32nd over: South Africa 50-3 (van der Dussen 4, du Plessis 12) Joe Root feels the magic juice flowing through his veins. Van der Dussen off the mark with a hoick through mid-wicket for four. He plays out the rest of the over. 31st over: South Africa 46-3 (van der Dussen 2, du Plessis 12) A most peculiar review from England as Bess hits the lunging du Plessis\u2019s leading leg. Replays show the ball missing not only the stumps but also the corner flag. Another maiden. 30th over: South Africa 46-3 (van der Dussen 2, du Plessis 12) Phoof! Joe Root rips it off the pitch last ball as van der Dussen prods forward and it passes the edge of his bat and whispers past off stump. A maiden. 29th over: South Africa 46-3 (van der Dussen 2, du Plessis 12) Bess continues this longish spell, the only runs a couple of byes down to fine leg. 28th over: South Africa 44-3 (van der Dussen 0, du Plessis 12) Joe Root resumes his broken-time over after the break and appeals hugely for an lbw against van der Dussen first ball. The umpire shakes his head but England review, unsuccessfully. The ball pitches outside off and zips over the top of the stumps. and we resume after tea... Nasser is praising the length that England have bowled today, saying it gives them options on all modes of dismissal. Jackets are on, it looks a bit nippy out there, though not as nippy as it is in Bulgaria. Talking of chilly, I had a lovely slow walk around Mam Tor yesterday with some friends. Not quite Table Mountain but such a treat to see some blue sky and sun after such an unrelenting succession of grey days. England sup happy, the crabbed Malan gone. I\u2019m off for a quick plate of sustaining beans on toast - back in ten! Root around the wicket, the ball pitches middle and off and spins back to skid into Malan\u2019s stretched front pad . Malan reviews, presumably feeling the ball has skimmed his bat before hitting pad, but the third umpire disagrees, and England are well on their way. And that\u2019s TEA. 27th over: South Africa 44-2 (Malan 12, du Plessis 12) Ok, so Bess switches ends, toiling up the hill now with the breeze behind him. Time for a couple more overs before tea. 26th over: South Africa 43-2 (Malan 11, du Plessis 12) Hmmm, Root replaces Bess and zips through, finding some bounce and zip against du Plessis. A maiden. The flags and palm trees surrounding the ground ripple with vigour. 25th over: South Africa 43-2 (Malan 11, du Plessis 12) A hit, a hit, a palpable hit! Malan hits the first boundary of his 102 minute vigil, sending an over-pitched Stokes through long off. 24th over: South Africa 39-2 (Malan 7, du Plessis 12)They trot a single off Bess, who fires a full toss in between more testing deliveries. South Africa are content to mindfully see him out. Meanwhile, Matt Emerson travels down memory lane: \u201cThe mention of Hofmeister reminds me of the time we had George, our first son. As usual, we were asked why we\u2019d called him that and there was no real reason except we liked the name. So we told people that it was after the bear in the Hofmeister adverts...simple pleasures...\u201d 23rd over: South Africa 38-2 (Malan 6, du Plessis 12) And yet another maiden as Ben Stokes thuds into the PE earth and delivers wide, full, short and all the rest. Just a reminder that you can join Adam Collins covering India v Australia in what is building up into a thriller at Bengaluru. 22nd over: South Africa 38-2 (Malan 6, du Plessis 12) A couple off the over, Bess not threatening but steady. Which probably ensures he\u2019ll take three wickets in his next . I loved the way he was thinking about Jim Laker yesterday after he\u2019d captured the first five. Aim high! 21st over: South Africa 36-2 (Malan 5, du Plessis 12) Stokes charging in here, as Plessis lowers his head respectfully and the ball skims over the top of his neck. There\u2019s a muddle over how many balls have ben bowled in the over, but eventually Stokes finishes it off with another dot. This is why I love the OBO... Ian Forth writes: \u201cI used to work with the guy who came up with that Pepsi campaign. His name was John Webster and if it\u2019s possible for there to be such a thing as an advertising genius, he was it. He also wrote, or oversaw at least (authorship is sometimes disputed) the Smash Martians, the Cresta Bear, the Hofmeister Bear, the Honey Monster, John Smiths\u2019 Arkwright and Jack Dee, the Courage Best Chas\u2019n\u2019Dave campaign, The Guardian Skinhead ad, the Prize Guys yoghurt ads, Walkers\u2019 Gary Lineker campaign and so on and on.\u201d 20th over: South Africa 35-2 (Malan 4, du Plessis 12) At leg slip someone, who I haven\u2019t yet identified, squats down on his calves, the blue soles of his feet and his spikes clearly visible. That can\u2019t be comfortable. Anyway, another maiden. A game of patience out there. 19th over: South Africa 35-2 (Malan 4, du Plessis 12) A maiden from Ben Stokes as Malan examines his nails and bats back another six balls. Glenn writes with radio expertise from Cape Town. Thanks Glenn! Good to listen in to Radio2000 on SABC. It\u2019s online and has a great, mostly SA commentary team with the best stats person in the world. 18th over: South Africa 35-2 (Malan 4, du Plessis 12) Out of the corner of the screen, Root gestures to the fielders, a dancer beckoning the Furies . The wind buffets Best\u2019s shirt as he wheels through another steady over. 17th over: South Africa 34-2 (Malan 3, du Plessis 12) Wood is wrapped back up in layers of tissue paper and we have Ben Stokes, who skulked in the long grass for most of the first innings. du Plessis leaves one alone that skittles in rather alarmingly. Careful Faf. 16th over: South Africa 30-2 (Malan 3, du Plessis 8) Bess rattles through another over, which Malan plays back without alarm. Another maiden. Colum Farrelly writes: I used to want Cardinal Sicola of USA to be Pope and develop a facial tic do he could be lip-smacking Pope Sicola. I was younger, then. 15th over: South Africa 30-2 (Malan 3, du Plessis 8) Wood sprays a bit wide and wild and du Plessis leaves gratefully. Then a beautiful back-foot drive brushing through the covers for four. Daniel kindly sends the session times for tomorrow - local time: 10:00-12:00 - session 1 12:00-12:40 - lunch 12:40-15:10 - session 2 15:10-15:30 - tea 15:30-17:30 - session 3 Extra 30min to close at 18:00 if required While Graham Lees asks if any readers have ideas on how to watch or listen to the test match without subscribing? Asking for a friend. I found England vs. Australia on Channel 9 in Australia. I don\u2019t know Graham, but OBO readers have written in before with the info that you can find highlights online. 14th over: South Africa 26-2 (Malan 3, du Plessis 4) Root turns to Bess - he already seems to have more confidence in Bess than he has shown in Moeen or Leach. An appeal for a catch in short leg, but it has come off the leg. 13th over: South Africa 26-2 (Malan 3, du Plessis 4) From the sublime ... Wood generously welcomes du Plessis with a fruity full toss which du Plessis tries to drive and squeezes through gully for four. Two in three overs for Wood since the re-start! Hamza looks to turn Wood off his hip and manages only to dribble the ball to Buttler behind. Another miserable January innings for Hamza. 12th over: South Africa 22-1 (Malan 3, Hamza 2) Just a couple off Broad\u2019s over as I spill the cold coffee I\u2019m trying to feed the cactus. 11th over: South Africa 20-1 (Malan 1, Hamza 2) Wood sprints in, oozing menace? Too much. Oozing danger. He tests Hamza, bowling consistently between 88-90 mph. Hamza snaffles two off the last ball, forcing a couple off the back foot \u201cA free-wheeling, cart-wheeling, lipsmacking, stump-flying wicket\u201d.... writes Phil Keegan. That actually made me look up the pepsi advert from the 1970s which began \u2018lipsmacking, thirst quenching...\u2019 and then went on for a bit. I was jealous as hell of a kid in my class who managed to memorise the whole thing. Phil, you\u2019ve nailed me - that was my inspiration. My mum used to have a silver belt which was emblazoned with the words from the ad, she probably sent off for it having collected the requisite number of tokens. 10th over: South Africa 18-1 (Malan 1, Hamza 0) The ball is back with Broad, who bowls a maiden, which Malan is mostly able to leave alone. After the fifth ball, Root runs down to the bowler\u2019s end to chat to his bowler... as a result, midwicket goes to square leg - and Malan bats a ball on off stump away. Ok, whisky! Suntory Sherry Cask whisky is greatly appreciated in this household writes Piet Morant. Now I live alone, I can sample the world\u2019s produce morning, noon and night, and there always seems to be cricket to watch or listen to with a bottle or three of fine whisky! M&amp;H is an incredible whistle-wetter at a conference (in between jobs again) while Mes writes As any proper County Cricket fan knows, whisky is alright, but Mandarin Brandy* is where it really is. *Calvados is a suitable substitute. Just don\u2019t mix the two 9th over: South Africa 18-1 (Malan 1, Hamza 0) A cracking ball from Wood, sharp - 89mph sharp - and then Hamza endures a torrid welcome. A sharp bouncer followed by a couple more short of a length at the body. A free-wheeling, cart-wheeling, lipsmacking, stump-flying wicket! Elgar gets a wee outside edge onto the stumps and there is drama. 8th over: South Africa 18-0 (Malan 1, Elgar 15) Broad takes the ball from the other end and immediately bowls a no ball. And the PE brass band strike up - such a beautiful noise. I covered a Test there in late 1999 and it is that sound that sticks with me over any of the cricket. 7th over: South Africa 16-0 (Malan 1, Elgar 14) And we restart: Mark Wood finishes off his five ball over before the rain delay and it goes for a quick single. South Africa - following on - trail by 274. Do read this if you have a chance, always lovely to read Vic on spinners, and he has a soft spot for Dom Bess. On telly they\u2019re whizzing through South Africa\u2019s loose batting this morning - Athers keeps glancing over his left shoulder for rain. Sky is slate grey. Crowd is sparse. Thanks Daniel, and hello everyone! I\u2019m welcoming play with open arms as I was wondering how I was going to continue Daniel\u2019s expert rain-stopped-play whisky analysis. We seem to be still on for the 12.10 restart - cross everything. Let\u2019s be having you! Right then, that\u2019s us; Tanya Aldred is here to guide you through the rest of the day, such that it is. You can email her on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com. \u201cI\u2019ll add another to the Wendell Pierce fan club,\u201d says Toby Sims. \u201cWhat a man. I\u2019d certainly share a whisky with him. Lovely to see some suggestions for the tipple - I\u2019ll add Rittenhouse 100 and EH Taylor Single Barrel to the list... Waiting to try some cask-strength M&amp;H at the weekend.\u201d One of my favourite things about synagogue \u2013 let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s a short list \u2013 is that when you finish, you\u2019re rewarded for your sacrifice and endurance by a quantities of scotch. As a kid, I used to feign interest in its provenance in order to be provided with it by adults eager to educate me, and as an adult the same trick works for me providing it to myself. Of course it is. We\u2019ve got ourselves a ball-game! It\u2019s a bit brighter in PE and the outfield is uncovered. \u201cLast October I played in a mini tournament on the beautiful island of Vis,\u201d says Ben Heywood. \u201cI bowled ok but was in wretched form with the bat. I scored 4 in my first innings, and was caught first ball at slip the next. On my third go, I was dropped first ball, nearly dropped second ball and caught third ball. I was therefore determined not to get three ducks in a row when I arrived at the crease for my fourth and final outing. I defended my first two, connected sweetly with my third and ambled up the wicket for my run as the ball hit the deep square leg boundary fielder. Who then luzzed it in like an exocet. I realised that split-second too late that it was heading directly for the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end and that if I didn\u2019t peg it I\u2019d be run out. I got a move on, ran through, but was then triggered by the umpire despite thinking I was safely home. \u2018What?\u2019 I protested. \u2018I was miles in!\u2019 \u2018Didn\u2019t ground your bat,\u2019 replied the umpire, who just happened to be my guesting Dad. \u2018Silly twat,\u2019 he added for unnecessary emphasis. Still love cricket. And the old man.\u201d I hope you get all Edmond Dant\u00e8s on his arse. Shake it all about. \u201cI would need proof that AB de Villiers was focused on Test cricket,\u201d says Piet Morant, \u201cor 70% ABV proof. Bain\u2019s Cape Mountain whisky - one bottle for breakfast, fire on. A good un.\u201d Oooh, that looks extremely interesting. If we\u2019re doing non-Scotch, I heartily recommend the Indian Amrut, and i\u2019m also looking forward to trying the Israeli M&amp;H. There\u2019s still plenty of time for England to resolve this, but lose the entirety of the afternoon and this start to become a problem. \u201cHello from NSW,\u201d says Ray Hill. \u201c I expect AB de Villiers wishes that he was playing in PE also. He scored two runs from his first ball, before being bowled by the second ball! His Brisbane team went from 84-0 to all out for 119! They lost by 44 runs!\u201d I just spotted Ricky Ponting talking about a choke on Twitter. I guess that\u2019s it. The covers are coming off! \u201cSecond, third and fourth you on Wendell Pierce, there,\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cOne of the best episodes of DID I\u2019ve ever listened too. Utterly inspirational, and all delivered in that rich baritone drawl. While we\u2019re here, I\u2019d nod to Stephen Graham\u2019s as well. Another brilliant actor, whose story was as fascinating as it harrowing. We\u2019re lucky to have him around. It beats talking about the rain, certainly.\u201d His performance in the first episode of Shane Meadows\u2019 the Virtues was astonishingly brilliant. What\u2019s the most stupid thing you\u2019ve done on a cricket pitch? The first time I ever played, they sent me out to open because I\u2019d batted well indoors. I didn\u2019t know how gloves worked and I\u2019m a lefty, so picked up any old pair, wondered why I couldn\u2019t hold my bat, got a straight one. Golden duck. Breaking news: it\u2019s raining. \u201cConspiracy theory,\u201d begins John Starbuck. \u201cYou can see why the ECB wanted the Hundred: having been too dim to see how successful T20 was going to be, they are trying to re-invent the game again but monetise it better. In this instance, what about the proposals for 4-day Tests? Everyone with some authority has rejected this, but could it have been meant as a distraction from the Hundred all along?\u201d I think it\u2019s slightly harsh to criticise the ECB for being dim as regards T20 when then introduced it to the professional game. I doubt there\u2019s a connection between four-day Tests and the Hundred, save their cockeyed rationale and financial underpinnings \u201cKim Thonger might also be interested in last Sunday\u2019s Desert Island Discs as Lewis was on that too,\u201d says David Wall. \u201cI know it\u2019s a cliche but given his previous interest in baseball you\u2019d think developing an interest in cricket would be natural.\u201d Tangentially, everyone should listen to the Wendell Pierce episode, which is absolutely sensational. He is an absolute mensch, and one I\u2019m absolutely certain would appreciate cricket in every single aspect. \u201cSince it\u2019s still raining,\u201d says Alistair Connor, \u201cit\u2019s not too late to offer you some cake. I\u2019m breakfasting on a plateful of delicious leftovers from last night, Day Two of my first Moroccan wedding, my brother-in-law\u2019s. They used to be as long as a Test match, but that\u2019s rare these days. Dancing and singing in a fancy ballroom with a traditional orchestra -- ladies only, while the men take tea and cakes in the lobby. It\u2019s much more fun than it sounds, honestly.\u201d I know the koo. Jewish weddings do, in some circles, entail seven days of celebration. Often, with too much parents\u2019 friend involvement for comfort, but nonetheless they extend the simcha, which is very nice. There\u2019s also a custom for the groom to get together with his male mates and family before the ceremony to sing and \u2013 not for the groom, who\u2019s fasting \u2013 tip down buckets of whisky while guzzling crisps and fish balls. It is never not glorious. \u201cOnce upon a time, players proved they had the temperament for international cricket in ODIs before getting a gig in the Test XI,\u201d emails Gary Naylor. \u201cBut hasn\u2019t the Trevor Bayliss era proved the opposite? The \u2018no-fear\u2019 cricket that led to the World Cup doesn\u2019t work in Tests, whether batting with freedom (the doomed \u2018natural game\u2019) nor going through the variations with the ball. Test cricket demands almost the opposite - forbearance, strategy, marginal gains through incremental victories. Red ball success breeds red ball success (as does white ball). England, with Sibley and Pope established and Bess and Leach doing a job, have learned this at last.\u201d At close of play on Friday, Ollie Pope gave a (great) interview on the wireless, and when he was asked about the ramping, basically made a pitch for limited-overs recognition. Anyhow, I disagree that \u2018no-fear\u2019 cricket isn\u2019t what you\u2019re after, more that sensible thinking is also in order. In all formats. \u201cI\u2019m reading The Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis,\u201d emails Kim Thonger, \u201ca thrillingly informative book about the utter wilful incompetence and complete intransigence of the Trump team during the transition from the Obama presidency. This is a plea for Michael to make his next book about the ECB\u2019s ridiculous plan to introduce The Hundred this summer. Equally stupidly stubborn and disrespectful of the good judgement and advice of everyone whose opinion about Test cricket I value. I\u2019m so cross my grammar went wonky there. *strikes face with rigid palm*.\u201d Talking Politics\u2019 interview with Lewis \u2013 on this topic \u2013 was excellent. David Runciman is the best analyst around by an absolute aeon, and gave by far the best lectures that I didn\u2019t go to at university. It\u2019s not heavy but, so hopefully we\u2019ll get some play this afternoon and make up what we\u2019ve lost this evening. In any event, England can\u2019t have expected to be where they are, so will still feel ahead of the game. \u201c\u2018When Wood, Archer, Broad and Anderson are fit\u2019...\u201d says Chris Drew. \u201cNot a time we are ever likely to see.\u201d It\u2019s coming around the time we get a Labour government. All four will be retired. No value judgment from me \u2013 what people do with their lives is absolutely none of my business \u2013 but I wish AB de Villiers was playing in this Test, not the in the Big Bash. Malan feels bat on ball. Elsewhere: Australia are 174-4 off 32 overs; Mitchell Starc, batting 5, is out. Follow that here: Bad news I\u2019m afraid: it\u2019s raining again and that\u2019s lunch. I\u2019ll be back in 30 or so. \u201cRe the Curran question,\u201d begins Nico Bentley. \u201cWhen Wood, Archer, Broad and Anderson are fit surely you rotate them like Australia did with their pace attack in the last Ashes? Three seamers with a spinner, plus Stokes on all but a few pitches around the world.\u201d But you still have a first XI. And when do you pick our quicks? On a pitch expected to something, to make them even more terrifying, or pitch expected to do nothing, to try and find something? Bill Hargreaves has another on the war-film issue: \u201cSaving Private Ryan Sidebottom\u2019s bowling average\u201d. No way he\u2019s getting away with that barnet in the army. According to the indispensable Cricinfo, the covers are coming off and the players are coming on... Yes! Robert Key has just pluralised \u201cthe Overtons\u201d, but I think he meant \u201cyour Overtonses of this world. \u201cWanted to get your thoughts on a proposal I sent in yesterday,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cA day in Test cricket should be divided into four sessions of 23 overs each instead of three sessions of 30 each. This will allow players to be more refreshed and on top of their game, especially in strenuous weather like the Australian summer. Thoughts?\u201d I\u2019d worry that by extending the day you leave yourself open to rain and light at the end of it. I might think about extending the first two sessions to avoid marathon final ones, though when those are good, they\u2019re so so good. Update: the rain stopped, they started to take the covers off, then the rain started again. Lovely stuff. \u201cYour preamble and the makings of a decent England Test team,\u201d tweets Andrew Curray. \u201cIf Bairstow and Buttler aren\u2019t scoring runs, could we have Ben Foakes back in the team please?\u201d It\u2019s a tricky one, this. I\u2019d say that if the team is functioning, you can afford the wild-card that is Buttler; though I guess you could say the same about Foakes\u2019 superior keeping. If England had a serious spinner, or if Buttler was missing lots of chances, I\u2019d probably feel differently, but in the meantime, I prefer the thrill of what might happen. \u201cEver since Rob Smyth (aptly) described Joe Denly as the \u2018pretty boy who went to war\u2019 on this MBM two tests back, I can\u2019t shake the idea that this England team would make the ideal cast for a middling war movie,\u201d says Isaac Parham. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Dom Bess as a farm hand turned ruddy-faced private, Root as the seen-too-much-too-young Captain, and Stokes would be your maverick, devil-may-care sharp-shooter. And let\u2019s face it, Anderson would make a rather dashing lead.\u201d Zak Crawley is definitely getting it at the end of Act I. Update: it\u2019s bucketing down. That will, I imagine, be our morning session. \u201cDo you know what is the win and loss percentage for international test teams who has won and lost the toss respectively?\u201d asks Braam Visser. \u201cFaf needs to do something to win the next toss.\u201d Not as high as you think it is, though this was a good one to win. For some reason, Stasguru is failing me, or, more likely, I am failing it. But Ric Finlay investigated this in Jukly 2018 and discovered that, this century, the captain who calls correctly wins 42 percent of the time and the captain who does not wins 36 percent of the time. \u201cSteven Finn is in the Sky studio, speaking very eloquently about his bowling issues over the years,\u201d emails Kevin Wilson. \u201cI\u2019ve seen players come and go and careers briefly flicker and fade out, but none make me more sad than Finn never hitting the ceiling his ability offered. He could\u2019ve been a very, very good quick bowler with 300 Test wickets by now.\u201d Yes, I agree. First of all, that he\u2019s great on telly \u2013 and also on the radio \u2013 and also that he had it in him to be better than he turned out to be. He was never quite the same after that stump-flicking incident \u2013 Graeme Smith was a ruthless man. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened at the tail-end of our innings because I was sorting out the fire,\u201d says Piet Morant, \u201cwhich gives you some idea of how moody the weather here in PE is. I do know however that I\u2019m now in Dante\u2019s circle of hell since the fire has gone out again and I don\u2019t want to move, in case Elgar and co again go down in a puff-flash of crap cover drives!\u201d In fairness, Maharaj aimed for midwicket. The variety of the left-armer. In the meantime, let\u2019s reflect on a ridiculous morning for both teams. England bowled really well first up, but South Africa\u2019s batting was something else. I am in awe of anyone able to play elite-level sport, and have not a scooby what it takes, but I do know that when you\u2019re fighting to stay in the game, you don\u2019t go out and play like a blacksmith. I guess there\u2019s a fair chance that\u2019s that for our morning session; if it rains for half an hour, it\u2019ll be half an hour before we can get going again. I\u2019d expect an early lunch, then two extended periods. In the studio, they\u2019re less optimistic, and think we may have a fairly long disruption. Hoepfully not for too long, but in the meantime, has anyone got any cake? 7th over: South Africa 15-0 (Malan 1, Elgar 13) Here comes Mark Wood; \u201cIt should say \u2018right arm very fast\u2019\u201d says Shaun Pollock of the caption, and yerman start from around to the left-handed Elgar. Wood looks so lean and whippy; I daren\u2019t think he\u2019s found the balance, but of course I\u2019m assuming he\u2019ll bowl Australia out at the Gabba in just under two years from now. 6th over: South Africa 15-0 (Malan 1, Elgar 13) Our camerawoman tells us it\u2019s definitely going to rain; in fact it already is raining, and the cameras have got their coats on. In the meantime, Curran scurries through another over, Elgar nudging a single in the drizzle. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to get too heavy for too long. 5th over: South Africa 14-0 (Malan 1, Elgar 12) Sake; no, not what South Africa had on their Ricicles, but an expression of dismay that there\u2019s some rain coming in. In the meantime, Malan gets away with a shove to cover, a leg-bye follows, and the groundsman waves arms like the air traffic controller in Jimbo and the Jet Set. 4th over: South Africa 12-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 12) They\u2019re piling them up now! Curran, who was so accurate first up, strays to leg again and gets the treatment again, Elgar easily flicking him away to fine leg for four. He\u2019s a funny cricketer, Curran, and I wonder where he fits into England\u2019s long-term plans. He\u2019s not a good enough bowler or batsman to get into the team solely for one of his two disciplines, but he has the priceless gift of timing. On the other hand, including him means you need to leave out one of Broad, Anderson, Archer and Wood \u2013 let\u2019s assume for a second all are fit at the same time \u2013 and medium pace gets whacked in Australia. 3rd over: South Africa 8-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 8) Malan sees away a maiden from Broad. I wonder if the England bowlers fancied hanging onto the ball they had first up. \u201cI think South Africa are playing rope-a-dope here,\u201d says Tom van der Gucht. \u201cThey\u2019ve come out swinging with the aim of getting out and forcing Root into asking for the follow on. They\u2019re now going to demonstrate that, actually, there\u2019s nothing in the pitch as they bat out the next two days with no fuss and wear down the English bowlers - leading to Wood getting injured having been overbowled in an attempt to get some life from the moribund pitch.\u201d England will just bring back Martin McCague for Joburg, which is where this dastardly plan will fall down. 2nd over: South Africa 8-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 8) Curran strays onto Elgar\u2019s pads and that\u2019s a perfect starter for him, turns away off the pads to deep backward. But Curran responds well, hitting a length, and Elgar presses forwards, missing and wearing it on the pad; that wasn\u2019t far away, but England don\u2019t review. Then another full one from Curran \u2013 fuller than the last \u2013 and Elgar plays, squeezing it where third slip isn\u2019t and to the fence fo fo mo. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Malan 0, Elgar 0) I am pleased to report that it\u2019s time for another rendition of Jerusalem, adult humans showing you their bows and such. *APPLAUSE*. I\u2019m choking up here. Anyway, Malan plays out the over by virtue of not despatching an imaginary Hollywood drive back to Cape Town, though Broad beats him with the final delivery, one that nips past the forward defensive off a full length. Right then, we\u2019re back. Broad has the ball, and in he charges... That injury to Rory Markham is looking a killer for South Africa. They\u2019ve a fragile batting line-up to begin with, never mind losing the bloke at the top of it. Dean Elgar has a huge responsibility here. So England have a day and a half to win the match, and South Africa have to bat for a decent chunk of that. It\u2019s extremely hard to see. And rightly so. South Africa are 91 runs shy of them, there\u2019s weather about, the bowlers are fresh and doing plenty. Rabada taps a catch to mid off and there it is; four wickets, one run, 26 minutes. England cannot have expected this, and it\u2019s been almost painful to watch because these are elite sportsmen who\u2019ve worked their entire lives to play situations like this, and somehow they\u2019ve delivered that. 87th over: South Africa 209-9 (Rabada 1, Paterson 0) Stuart Broad has picked a good meteorite here. The overcast conditions and moisture in the air are probably helping too, but just an hour ago I watched Nasser lament the lack of life in the pitch. It just goes to prove the adage that it doesn\u2019t need to do a lot, just enough. 86th over: South Africa 209-9 (Rabada 1, Paterson 0) And there it is! South Africa score a run! Rabada turns Curran to long leg and they amble a single, when he could have got himself bowled smashing an air-drive through cover. Who does he think he is? Pathetic. 85th over: South Africa 208-9 (Rabada 0, Paterson 0) It\u2019s Dom Bess I feel sorry for, who was targeting ninefer. I really cannot twizzle my swede around what South Africa are up to here. To lose it under pressure and after a long effort, yes; to come out first up and donate the match like that, no. This is shambolic and inexplicable; I can be sure of this because I spend a lot of time watching England. WHAT A TEAMTALK FAF GAVE THIS MORNING! THREE WICKETS FOR 0 RUNS IN 15 BALLS, ALL OF THEM BOWLED! Maharaj has a big yahoo, looking to crack a drive to the fence, because that\u2019s who he is and what he does; instead he yanks it onto his leg stump. This is extremely anger-inducing for South Africans and extremely hilarious for everyone else. 84th over: South Africa 208-8 (Maharaj 0, Rabada 0) I\u2019m not sure what De Kock was thinking there; sure, his team need runs and maybe he doesn\u2019t trust the bloke at the other end, but get yourself in first. The ball\u2019s new, the opponent have their tails up, you don\u2019t need to smoke a straight one to the fence. THAT\u2019S WHY! SAM CURRAN HAS TIMING! Curran straightens one off the seam, De Kock plays for it to do nothing, another airy drive, and takes it right on the middle stump instead! 84th over: South Africa 208-7 (De Kock 63, Maharaj 0) Curran gets the ball from other end; why?Presumably because he\u2019s not that much use once the ball is old, but also because De Kock likes the pace that Wood puts on it. Imagine wanting to face that! These lads are something else. Cartwheel! Broad finds some nip off the seam, Philander opens the gate with an airy drive, and is it zips to the fence in his dreams, in our reality the ball careers into his off peg which goes for a little dance. 83rd over: South Africa 208-6 (De Kock 63, Philander 27) Yes! The performative Jerusalem is away. Can\u2019t wait for the actions and applauding of self. AND IT\u2019S THERE! THERE IT IS! Wood and Curran both warm up like it\u2019s their gig from the other end; I\u2019d go Wood, now that you ask. SJ Broad is ready. South Africa need 92 more to avoid the follow-on, which ought to secure them a draw. Elsewhere: \u201cIn case anyone cares,\u201d says Michael McClelland in Carlsbad, California, of our feathered friend above, \u201cit\u2019s an osprey. I never have anything wise or funny to say about cricket, so this is my big chance.\u201d You have decreed. Badabing! There\u2019s one for the history A-level lads. Jeetan Patel is an extremely articulate and impressive individual. England spin-coach Jeetan Patel says Bess is beginning \u201cto understand his art\u201d. He says he focuses on details \u2013 the ball does whatever you do to it \u2013 and Bess is prepared to do whatever it takes. He says it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens to the ball until just before it bounces, as it bounces and just after it bounces. So Bess has to get his wrist-position right and get the ball off his last finger, hard, and past the vertical, so it comes out straight. \u201cYou mention the unique confluence that was Peter Such,\u201d says Ian Forth. \u201cHe once took the most Test wickets in a calendar year for England (1993). This feat is diminished somewhat once you discover the actual number - 16. That\u2019s three less than fellow off-spinner Jim Laker once took in one match. Steve Harmison took 67 in 2004, Beefy 66 in 1978 and Graeme Swann 64 in 2010. But Such is not the post-war nadir! John Snow won with just 14 in 1970 (remarkably the year England won down under), while Neil Foster topped the list with just 12 (twelve, as the teleprinter used to clarify) in 1989.\u201d In fairness they do play a lot more these days, but my days that 1993 was miserable \u2013 the Oval and the Gaffer in Bridgetown apart. Email! \u201cWhy no early start to make up time lost,\u201d says David Griffiths. I guess because we\u2019re already getting underway at 10 because we don\u2019t get late doors light in Africa, and we can\u2019t start any earlier than that. \u201cHe can only play one way,\u201d he says of De Kock, and that he tried to play a different way in Cape Town and it didn\u2019t work. He goes on to say that De Kock is a \u201cspecial, special cricketer\u201d and that Philander \u201cisn\u2019t doing a lot with the ball at the moment, it\u2019s his last series and he needs to do something\u201d. Arf. Kevin Pietersen wonders if the bowlers are \u201cwilling to do the hard yards\u201d. I think we know the answer to that. It\u2019s not currently raining in PE, but there\u2019s a chance of showers before play starts, as there is in the first scheduled hour. If South Africa bat sensibly, they\u2019ve a decent chance of going to Joburg all-square. For reasons which will become immediately apparent I\u2019m going to whisper this in invisible ink, but: might England have the bones of a decent Test side? Our name is Guardian OBO, and we\u2019re hopeless optimistics. But stick with us. Let\u2019s say that Sibley and Crawley are good \u2013 at batting time if nothing else. When Burns comes back, the latter moves to first wicket down; the middle-order is already decent when it\u2019s allowed to be an actual middle-order; and suddenly the batting line-up that has bestowed such consistent hilarity looks a serious proposition. And then there\u2019s the bowling. Archer is a superstar; Broad and Anderson are bowling as well as ever; a fit Wood is an exceptional weapon; and all of a sudden the only thing missing is a top-class spinner. Ideally, one able to take first-innings wickets, but given the artillery at the other end, it\u2019d be enough to holding one down before stepping in on day 3 \u2013 or whenever Tests are finishing this time next year \u2013 to clean up. Done and done. Whether Dom Bess is that man remains to be seen \u2013 Trent Bridge 06 aside, tracks like this current one don\u2019t exist anywhere outside the sub-continent. Still, you need the head and heart to succeed, and he\u2019ll be hoping yesterday was the first of many, not a Peter Such-style confluence of circumstance. He\u2019s got a lot of work to do this morning, and he can be sure that Quinton de Kock won\u2019t simply let him go about it. We\u2019re in for a treat. Play: 10am local time, 8am GMT",

Frankly, I think it is more likely than not that intercity fliers and the reluctant Tories of the now-collapsed red wall form two mutually exclusive groups.</p> <p>The bottom line is that both bailing out Flybe and pushing through HS2 are appalling options from an environmental perspective. The green way forward is simple and straightforward. Leave Flybe to sink or swim, keep air passenger duty as it is (or preferably hike it further), and scrap HS2.

      "bodyText": "In his discussion of Flybe and HS2 (Growth versus green? The short-term view always prevails, Journal, 16 January), Larry Elliott seems to be tying himself in knots. On the one hand, he rightly claims that it is the better-off who fly intercity in the UK, while on the other hand he suggests that allowing Flybe to go under would hack off a lot of voters, many of whom voted Tory for the first time in December. Frankly, I think it is more likely than not that intercity fliers and the reluctant Tories of the now-collapsed red wall form two mutually exclusive groups. The bottom line is that both bailing out Flybe and pushing through HS2 are appalling options from an environmental perspective. The green way forward is simple and straightforward. Leave Flybe to sink or swim, keep air passenger duty as it is (or preferably hike it further), and scrap HS2. The \u00a3100bn or so saved should be diverted to developing railways \u2013 and reopening some of those lost to Beeching\u2019s axe \u2013 in those parts of the country where improved transport links are needed most. Bill McGuire Emeritus professor of geophysical and climate hazards, University College London \u2022 Larry Elliott\u2019s article is a worrying warning that politicians are very unlikely to do anything to head off the developing climate catastrophe. Perhaps it is time to ditch the facile terminology \u2013 green initiatives, wildlife protection, special scientific interest \u2013 which give the impression that these considerations are somehow external to our own interests. Perhaps if we started talking about the biosphere of which we are all a part as \u201cthe life support system\u201d and the choices politicians make as being between the protection of life and the destruction of life, then the consequences of these choices might be easier for us to grasp.

Women of colour in public life are subject to bullying, harassment, disrespect and smears \u2013 and all the while are expected to be grateful that they\u2019re getting any attention at all.\u201d</p> <p>Long-Bailey likened Meghan\u2019s treatment by the UK media to that of the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. \u201cHer litany of groundbreaking achievements \u2013 a welder\u2019s daughter who made it to Cambridge, becoming the first black woman in the House of Commons \u2013 are routinely ignored,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd this treatment has consequences. Diane has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/05/diane-abbott-more-abused-than-any-other-mps-during-election\">received over half of all abuse meted out to MPs</a>, including death threats against her and her family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe toxic combination of sexism and racism that runs rife through the rightwing press must be stopped. As leader of the Labour party, I will do everything I can to fight it.\u201d</p> <p>Writing on Twitter, Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary and one of the party\u2019s deputy leadership candidates, said Meghan\u2019s treatment \u201cshows exactly why we need to have a discussion about race\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs a proud black woman I\u2019m not surprised Meghan has chosen peace of mind over dealing with racism every day,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Another Labour leadership candidate, Jess Phillips, called the media coverage racist and xenophobic. \u201cShe\u2019s been treated like a foreign upstart \u2013 not British enough,\u201d she said. She wrote on Twitter that the couple\u2019s plan sounded \u201cfair enough\u201d, adding: \u201cGood luck to them.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/18/meghan-gets-more-than-twice-as-many-negative-headlines-as-positive\">Research by the Guardian</a>, published on Saturday, found that the duchess gets more than twice as many negative as positive headlines. Analysis of articles published between May 2018 and mid-January 2019 found that of 843 articles in 14 print newspapers, 43% were negative. Only 20% of the articles were positive, with the remaining 36% remaining neutral.</p> <p>Meghan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/01/meghan-sues-mail-on-sunday-for-publishing-letter-to-her-father\">began legal proceedings </a>in October against the Mail on Sunday after the paper published a letter she had sent to her estranged father. At the time, Prince Harry issued a scathing statement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/02/put-simply-its-bullying-prince-harrys-full-statement-on-the-media\">denouncing the media\u2019s \u201cbullying\u201d of his wife</a>, which he likened to the treatment of his mother, Princess Diana.</p> <p>In November 2016, before the couple married, the Duke of Sussex accused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/prince-harry-lambasts-press-over-meghan-markle-coverage\">the British press</a> of introducing \u201cracial overtones\u201d into the reporting of their relationship.</p> <p>It was reported at the time that Kensington Palace was particularly unhappy with a comment piece by Rachel Johnson in the Mail on Sunday that said the match meant \u201cthe Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rebecca Long-Bailey has condemned the treatment of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by the media as \u201cintrusive and racist\u201d, after the Queen announced plans for them to step back from royal duties. Ten days after the couple announced they planned to give up their position as senior members of the royal family and move to North America, the monarch issued a statement on Saturday night setting out a new arrangement that would allow the Sussexes \u201cto start building a happy and peaceful new life\u201d. Meghan and Prince Harry will give up using their Royal Highness titles, stop receiving a share of the publicly funded sovereign grant and return \u00a32.4m to the taxpayer to cover the costs of refurbishing their Windsor home. The Queen described the agreement as a \u201cconstructive and supportive way forward\u201d, adding that she was \u201cparticularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family\u201d. Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary and a Labour leadership candidate, said: \u201cA young couple have been hounded out of the country by the intrusive and racist treatment of the rightwing press. Women of colour in public life are subject to bullying, harassment, disrespect and smears \u2013 and all the while are expected to be grateful that they\u2019re getting any attention at all.\u201d Long-Bailey likened Meghan\u2019s treatment by the UK media to that of the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott. \u201cHer litany of groundbreaking achievements \u2013 a welder\u2019s daughter who made it to Cambridge, becoming the first black woman in the House of Commons \u2013 are routinely ignored,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this treatment has consequences. Diane has received over half of all abuse meted out to MPs, including death threats against her and her family.\u201d \u201cThe toxic combination of sexism and racism that runs rife through the rightwing press must be stopped. As leader of the Labour party, I will do everything I can to fight it.\u201d Writing on Twitter, Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary and one of the party\u2019s deputy leadership candidates, said Meghan\u2019s treatment \u201cshows exactly why we need to have a discussion about race\u201d. \u201cAs a proud black woman I\u2019m not surprised Meghan has chosen peace of mind over dealing with racism every day,\u201d she said. Another Labour leadership candidate, Jess Phillips, called the media coverage racist and xenophobic. \u201cShe\u2019s been treated like a foreign upstart \u2013 not British enough,\u201d she said. She wrote on Twitter that the couple\u2019s plan sounded \u201cfair enough\u201d, adding: \u201cGood luck to them.\u201d Research by the Guardian, published on Saturday, found that the duchess gets more than twice as many negative as positive headlines. Analysis of articles published between May 2018 and mid-January 2019 found that of 843 articles in 14 print newspapers, 43% were negative. Only 20% of the articles were positive, with the remaining 36% remaining neutral. Meghan began legal proceedings in October against the Mail on Sunday after the paper published a letter she had sent to her estranged father. At the time, Prince Harry issued a scathing statement denouncing the media\u2019s \u201cbullying\u201d of his wife, which he likened to the treatment of his mother, Princess Diana. In November 2016, before the couple married, the Duke of Sussex accused the British press of introducing \u201cracial overtones\u201d into the reporting of their relationship. It was reported at the time that Kensington Palace was particularly unhappy with a comment piece by Rachel Johnson in the Mail on Sunday that said the match meant \u201cthe Windsors will thicken their watery, thin blue blood and Spencer pale skin and ginger hair with some rich and exotic DNA\u201d.",

I knew the counterterrorist team were training for an amphibious assault so I said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.\u201d That upset them a bit, so I said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do a JFK-style motorcade and run alongside the car?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Julian Morrow (The Chaser/executive producer):</strong> Tony\u2019s an ex-British commando and he got right into it. He gave us really good advice, like the drivers should keep both hands on the wheels at all times, never go for cigarettes. The drivers just turned up with the hire cars on the day and all of a sudden they\u2019re in this intense situation.</p> <p><strong>Giles Hardie (extra):</strong> I got a call from [producer/director] Nathan Earl, saying, \u201cYou look convincing in a suit. Are you free tomorrow?\u201d The ABC costume department provided the suit, right down to the sunglasses and the secret service pins, which were, from memory, Sydney Rugby League Club pins. We had earpieces, not that they were attached to anything.

We were told to redesign the laminates so that they looked fake, so we wrote on them \u201cThis is a joke\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Julian Morrow:</strong> I describe it as a stunt that went horribly right because it was designed to fail, in the sense that Chas was going to be the comic relief, to be deployed when we got stopped.</p> <p><strong>Giles Hardie:</strong> Tony and Julian had outlined everything, right up to the supposed shoot-to-kill order. Snipers were very much part of the objective.

      "bodyText": "It was September 2007, six years into the \u201cwar on terror\u201d, and two seasons into The War on Everything. John Howard was prime minister, George W Bush was in town, and, in a fake motorcade with Canadian flags, Chas Licciardello was slowly rolling down Sydney\u2019s Macquarie Street dressed as Osama bin Laden. Formed in 1999 as a satirical Onion-style newspaper, The Chaser (often erroneously called The Chasers) made their TV debut in 2001 on the ABC with The Election Chaser, followed by 2002\u2019s CNNNN (a spoof of cable news) and 2004\u2019s The Chaser Decides. By 2007 the comedy group had honed a formula of sharp political satire mixed with on-camera stunts, from giving John Howard the anniversary present of a heart to crashing the Labor party\u2019s national conference as the ghost of Mark Latham. Paired with Spicks and Specks, Wednesday nights on Aunty become a somewhat surprising ratings juggernaut. The peak came that September in Sydney, as the world\u2019s most important leaders gathered for Apec \u2013 an economic meeting of Pacific rim states. The New South Wales government had passed a suite of emergency laws and spent $170m on security. In an atmosphere of increasingly draconian national security laws, The Chaser had fake security passes that said \u201cJOKE\u201d. They had a crew of nine. And, in the backseat, in flowing white robes, they had Licciardello dressed as the most wanted terrorist on earth. \u2018Snipers were very much part of the objective\u2019 Sophia Zachariou (executive producer): The concept of the show was that everything was fair game. Tony Loughran (high-risk safety adviser to the ABC): The original idea was to sail down Sydney Harbour in a battered flotilla and let a pyrotechnic off, because the Apec leaders were going to be at the Opera House for a group photograph. I knew the counterterrorist team were training for an amphibious assault so I said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.\u201d That upset them a bit, so I said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do a JFK-style motorcade and run alongside the car?\u201d Julian Morrow (The Chaser/executive producer): Tony\u2019s an ex-British commando and he got right into it. He gave us really good advice, like the drivers should keep both hands on the wheels at all times, never go for cigarettes. The drivers just turned up with the hire cars on the day and all of a sudden they\u2019re in this intense situation. Giles Hardie (extra): I got a call from [producer/director] Nathan Earl, saying, \u201cYou look convincing in a suit. Are you free tomorrow?\u201d The ABC costume department provided the suit, right down to the sunglasses and the secret service pins, which were, from memory, Sydney Rugby League Club pins. We had earpieces, not that they were attached to anything. Judging by the flags on the cars we were part of a Canadian convoy. Sophia Zachariou: We\u2019d done recces and had maps and detailed analysis sheets. The advice from the ABC legal department was we could play around the green zone but do not enter the red zone at any cost. We were told to redesign the laminates so that they looked fake, so we wrote on them \u201cThis is a joke\u201d. Julian Morrow: I describe it as a stunt that went horribly right because it was designed to fail, in the sense that Chas was going to be the comic relief, to be deployed when we got stopped. Giles Hardie: Tony and Julian had outlined everything, right up to the supposed shoot-to-kill order. Snipers were very much part of the objective. They talked to us about how to deal with that situation; it was very reassuring. Tony Loughran: [Cagily] We knew in some respects where some of the sniper positions were. Julian Morrow: I once met a guy in a pub who introduced himself as somebody who\u2019d had me in the crosshairs of his rifle. \u2018All hell broke loose\u2019 Giles Hardie: We got through the first gate because no one was looking. When we read the police reports later we discovered they\u2019d been instructed to not look into the cars because visiting dignitaries don\u2019t like to be stared at. It ended up in a funny situation where I was staring stonily at a police officer who was outside the barrier, staring in. I was confident she was going to say: \u201cYou\u2019re not a security guard, you\u2019re an idiot.\u201d But all I could hear in the back of my mind was \u201cDo not break character\u201d, so I just stared and eventually she turned away.

      "body": "<p>Around the middle of last year a scandal broke out in the US after it emerged that 50 people \u2013 including some B-grade celebrities for extra juice \u2013 had been bribing college admissions officials to get underperforming rich kids enrolled at prestigious universities. This was fuel to the already-blazing fire of doubt around how meritocratic elite higher education in the US really is.</p> <p>The problem isn\u2019t <em>just </em>that the briberies made for an unfair enrolment system. Rather, it\u2019s that we think the trajectories of two people \u2013 one who enrolled in a prestigious school and one who didn\u2019t \u2013 are likely to deviate considerably after that point.</p> <p> The other factor at the heart of the Varsity Blues scandal is social justice. It\u2019s not just that <em>some </em>students received an unfair advantage. It\u2019s that they were predominantly white and universally wealthy. By contrast, those from non-white or working-class backgrounds struggle to access the highest-rated universities, for reasons that have more to do with systemic issues than the personal quality of the potential applicants.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/jun/15/teachers-as-guides-inside-the-uks-first-montessori-secondary-school\">Teachers as 'guides': inside the UK\u2019s first Montessori secondary school</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For these reasons, the outrage following the Varsity Blues scandal makes complete sense. What makes less sense to me is why we don\u2019t extend that same criticism to other education pathways.</p> <p>We\u2019ve recently been enrolling our three-year-old into a preschool. After some failed experiences at a local daycare, we opted for an extremely expensive Montessori-style school. The program is incredible, and within a term we\u2019ve started seeing results. Our son\u2019s teachers are nurturing his independence, developing his creativity, treating him with empathy and respect as well as communicating basic literacy, numeracy and all the other stuff he needs to know.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got him there in part because we think it\u2019s the right place for him to be <em>right now</em>, given his current needs, but also because we\u2019re confident it\u2019s the kind of environment that will help him grow into a capable, independent person. The kind of person who will succeed in life.</p> <p>And we\u2019re paying an arm and a leg for the opportunity. The education doesn\u2019t come cheap. In fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ll be able to continue it once we\u2019re no longer eligible for childcare subsidies.</p> <p>I can\u2019t see any way the child of a low-income family would be able to attend without some kind of scholarship. Not only are the fees considerable, there are once-off enrolment fees that cost a few thousand dollars, compulsory working bees for families of the school (there\u2019s a small fee if you don\u2019t rock up) and a range of other bells and whistles. The place is full of compassion and support for kids and families, but it\u2019s also catering to a very wealthy audience, to the point where it feels slightly uncomfortable at times.</p> <p>Of course, some might suggest \u2013 rightly \u2013 that you don\u2019t need to be enrolled in a Montessori school to practice the methods. You can do it at home, and there are plenty of excellent resources online to get you started. However, unless you\u2019re a parent who can be (and wants to be) at home most of the time, that horse has bolted before it\u2019s gotten out the gate.</p> <p>But for those who do have the time and resources, the approach seems to get results. Not only have we experienced a notable change in our son, tentative research suggests Montessori-style education does indeed give kids a leg up in life. A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-017-0012-7#Sec7\">2017 literature review</a> suggests that the Montessori philosophy, when taught faithfully, benefits children both cognitively and socially.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, Montessori education has been shown to actually break down class barriers in education. A 2017 <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5670361/\">study</a> found that \u201cMontessori preschool also equalised outcomes among subgroups that typically have unequal outcomes.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/01/do-we-have-to-choose-between-being-a-good-parent-and-good-at-our-job\">Do we have to choose between being a good parent and good at our job? | Matthew Beard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the research is to be believed, we\u2019ve got an education offering that could actually reduce the advantage gap between rich and poor that is, in effect, only available to the rich. Why?</p> <p>The sad reality is it appears to be intellectual laziness as much as anything else. Angeline Lillard <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-019-09483-3#Sec9\">argues</a> that the conventional \u201cgrammar\u201d of education is so allergic to the Montessori approach that it relegates it to the fringes, despite the documented benefits both for individual students and societies.</p> <p>We can\u2019t conceive of remodelling the education system to make it better, so we tinker around the edges of the system. Those who want to tip the apple cart entirely are left to do it on their own \u2013 privately, and only if they can afford it. And this happens more than a decade before anybody is thinking about university admissions.</p> <p>It\u2019s a measure of our attitudes to education that we\u2019re most upset about unfairness in education when it seems to effect job prospects. Inequality in early childhood education \u2013 particularly the kind of education that\u2019s centred on building genuinely human virtues, skills and abilities like creativity and empathy \u2013 doesn\u2019t just promise to make better job candidates. It offers more resilient, curious and imaginative people. It doesn\u2019t just set them up for better jobs, but better lives. At least, that\u2019s the promise (and in our case, the hope).</p> <p>But if the promise comes true, then we\u2019ve got the same social disparity, the same beneficial outcomes for students as in the Varsity Blues scandal.

      "bodyText": "Around the middle of last year a scandal broke out in the US after it emerged that 50 people \u2013 including some B-grade celebrities for extra juice \u2013 had been bribing college admissions officials to get underperforming rich kids enrolled at prestigious universities. This was fuel to the already-blazing fire of doubt around how meritocratic elite higher education in the US really is. The problem isn\u2019t just that the briberies made for an unfair enrolment system. Rather, it\u2019s that we think the trajectories of two people \u2013 one who enrolled in a prestigious school and one who didn\u2019t \u2013 are likely to deviate considerably after that point. The other factor at the heart of the Varsity Blues scandal is social justice. It\u2019s not just that some students received an unfair advantage. It\u2019s that they were predominantly white and universally wealthy. By contrast, those from non-white or working-class backgrounds struggle to access the highest-rated universities, for reasons that have more to do with systemic issues than the personal quality of the potential applicants. For these reasons, the outrage following the Varsity Blues scandal makes complete sense. What makes less sense to me is why we don\u2019t extend that same criticism to other education pathways. We\u2019ve recently been enrolling our three-year-old into a preschool. After some failed experiences at a local daycare, we opted for an extremely expensive Montessori-style school. The program is incredible, and within a term we\u2019ve started seeing results. Our son\u2019s teachers are nurturing his independence, developing his creativity, treating him with empathy and respect as well as communicating basic literacy, numeracy and all the other stuff he needs to know. We\u2019ve got him there in part because we think it\u2019s the right place for him to be right now, given his current needs, but also because we\u2019re confident it\u2019s the kind of environment that will help him grow into a capable, independent person. The kind of person who will succeed in life. And we\u2019re paying an arm and a leg for the opportunity. The education doesn\u2019t come cheap. In fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ll be able to continue it once we\u2019re no longer eligible for childcare subsidies. I can\u2019t see any way the child of a low-income family would be able to attend without some kind of scholarship. Not only are the fees considerable, there are once-off enrolment fees that cost a few thousand dollars, compulsory working bees for families of the school (there\u2019s a small fee if you don\u2019t rock up) and a range of other bells and whistles. The place is full of compassion and support for kids and families, but it\u2019s also catering to a very wealthy audience, to the point where it feels slightly uncomfortable at times. Of course, some might suggest \u2013 rightly \u2013 that you don\u2019t need to be enrolled in a Montessori school to practice the methods. You can do it at home, and there are plenty of excellent resources online to get you started. However, unless you\u2019re a parent who can be (and wants to be) at home most of the time, that horse has bolted before it\u2019s gotten out the gate. But for those who do have the time and resources, the approach seems to get results. Not only have we experienced a notable change in our son, tentative research suggests Montessori-style education does indeed give kids a leg up in life. A 2017 literature review suggests that the Montessori philosophy, when taught faithfully, benefits children both cognitively and socially. What\u2019s more, Montessori education has been shown to actually break down class barriers in education. A 2017 study found that \u201cMontessori preschool also equalised outcomes among subgroups that typically have unequal outcomes.\u201d If the research is to be believed, we\u2019ve got an education offering that could actually reduce the advantage gap between rich and poor that is, in effect, only available to the rich. Why? The sad reality is it appears to be intellectual laziness as much as anything else. Angeline Lillard argues that the conventional \u201cgrammar\u201d of education is so allergic to the Montessori approach that it relegates it to the fringes, despite the documented benefits both for individual students and societies. We can\u2019t conceive of remodelling the education system to make it better, so we tinker around the edges of the system. Those who want to tip the apple cart entirely are left to do it on their own \u2013 privately, and only if they can afford it. And this happens more than a decade before anybody is thinking about university admissions. It\u2019s a measure of our attitudes to education that we\u2019re most upset about unfairness in education when it seems to effect job prospects. Inequality in early childhood education \u2013 particularly the kind of education that\u2019s centred on building genuinely human virtues, skills and abilities like creativity and empathy \u2013 doesn\u2019t just promise to make better job candidates. It offers more resilient, curious and imaginative people. It doesn\u2019t just set them up for better jobs, but better lives. At least, that\u2019s the promise (and in our case, the hope). But if the promise comes true, then we\u2019ve got the same social disparity, the same beneficial outcomes for students as in the Varsity Blues scandal. What\u2019s less obvious is the unfairness. I don\u2019t believe parents are behaving improperly by sending their kids to schools like this. Nor are the schools necessarily in the wrong if cost-effectiveness means they can\u2019t accommodate every income level. Still, the structures of privilege remain. I can\u2019t help but feel a little bit guilty, knowing our son benefits from an education method that might benefit so many more. Maria Montessori wrote that \u201cEducation is the best weapon for peace\u201d, adding that \u201ctrue peace suggests the triumph of justice and love among men; it reveals the existence of a better world where harmony reigns\u201d. This model of peace and social justice can\u2019t be served where education reflects and entrenches disadvantage. Obviously, this isn\u2019t to say that those not enrolled in Montessori education are doomed to failure or mediocrity. Really, it\u2019s not about Montessori at all. It\u2019s about the principle. If we have reason to believe a product, a pedagogy or any other resource that\u2019s necessary for individual or communal flourishing is better-than-average, then we have an obligation to make it accessible to everyone. Parents have every right to pursue what they think is going to help their kids to live well. In fact, I\u2019d argue they\u2019re obliged to do so. But setting your child up for success in ways less advantaged kids can\u2019t access is uncomfortable and can feel morally sketchy. So I\u2019m gonna send my kids to Montessori; the least I can do is demand others have the ability to do so, regardless of what\u2019s sitting in their bank account. \u2022 Matt Beard is an Australian moral philosopher, fellow at The Ethics Centre and a regular writer on philosophy and ethics",

Although she does suggest trying a few different formulas (milky, dry touch, tinted, the list goes on) to see what appeals. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding a formula that you like because then you\u2019re more likely to use it.\u201d</p> <p>Also, the Cancer Council wants you to wear a lot.

The recommended full-body amount for an adult is seven teaspoons.<em> </em>That\u2019s one for each arm and leg, front of body, back of body, and face, neck and ears.</p> <h2><strong>Australian made or imported?</strong></h2> <p>When it comes to guidance on skincare and cosmetics, Australians have a tendency to look abroad. Our grandmothers worshipped French products, while this century we\u2019ve turned to Asia for skincare trends. But Walker says you\u2019ll struggle to beat an Australian product, as the active ingredients in sunscreens here are regulated in a similar way to medicines.</p> <p>Look for an AUST L number on the bottle. \u201cThat tells you it\u2019s to the standards that the Australian regulator says it should be.\u201d</p> <p>While Australia has some of the strictest regulations in the world, many other countries (especially in Europe) also have very high standards. </p> <h2><strong>But sunscreen is already in everything</strong></h2> <p>As we\u2019ve become more conscious of the value of sunscreen, we\u2019ve added it to other products like makeup and moisturisers. While that\u2019s great, it\u2019s not a reason to ditch your daily broad spectrum, TGA-approved favourite.</p> <p>This is because, as mentioned, you need to wear a lot of sunscreen. Most of us aren\u2019t applying makeup and moisturiser thickly enough to offer a good level of protection. Also, as Walker stresses, \u201ccosmetics aren\u2019t regulated the same way as the primary sunscreen, so they might not be held to as high a standard\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say these enriched cosmetics don\u2019t have a place. They offer great second wave protection; especially for incidental sun exposure (like when you\u2019re in the car or popping out to buy lunch). So hedge your bets and use both.</p> <h2><strong>What about the reef?</strong></h2> <p>In 2018, Hawaii passed a law blocking the sale of sunscreens containing the chemicals benzophene-3 and octinoxate <a href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/goodbye.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%252Fs00244-015-0227-7\">over fears the ingredients aggravate coral bleaching</a>, <a href=\"https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2018/05/24/sunscreen-killing-coral-reef/\">damage coral\u2019s DNA</a> and harm marine environments. This was the beginning of the \u201creef-safe\u201d sunscreen trend, and the fear that sun protection was poisoning the planet. Popular beach destinations like<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/19/could-banning-sunscreens-to-save-coral-do-more-harm-than-good\"> Palau, Key West and the Virgin Islands followed Hawaii\u2019s lead</a> and banned non reef-safe products.</p> <p>While any<a href=\"https://www.icriforum.org/sites/default/files/ICRI_Sunscreen_0.pdf\"> threat to the planet\u2019s vulnerable reefs</a> is cause for alarm, it\u2019s a bit more complicated than it\u2019s often presented. Professor of marine biology at James Cook University, Terry Hughes, takes aim at the research behind the claim that sunscreen contributes to coral bleaching. He points out that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/theres-insufficient-evidence-your-sunscreen-harms-coral-reefs-109567\">only two studies</a> have looked at the environmental impacts of sunscreens and they weren\u2019t \u201crepresentative of real-world conditions\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/26/how-to-treat-sunburn\">How to treat sunburn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rather than worry too much about sunscreen, he pushes the focus around coral bleaching to heat stress and warming oceans. \u201cAfter Hawaii banned sunscreen, hot temperatures returned this year, triggering more coral bleaching,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia.</p> <p>But while the research is thin, it\u2019s fair to say reefs need all the support they can get. So you may as well use a reef-safe sunscreen \u2013 one that\u2019s mineral based or free from benzophene-3 and octinoxate \u2013 if you\u2019re spending time in the ocean. Just don\u2019t use this as an excuse to skip sun protection.</p> <h2><strong>Mineral v chemical</strong></h2> <p>One of the biggest sources of sunscreen confusion is the distinction between mineral and chemical formulas. The major difference between the two is that mineral sunscreens sit on top of your skin, providing a physical barrier to UV \u2013 which is why they\u2019re sometimes called physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens contain ingredients that sink into your skin and absorb UV.</p> <p>This is why so many chemical sunscreens weirdly recommend you apply them <em>under </em>your moisturiser and wait 20 minutes before sun exposure. They need time to absorb, and can react badly with other products.</p> <p>While they offer the same end result, there are usage differences. Dermal therapist <a href=\"https://jamesvivian.co/\">James Vivian</a> is a fan of mineral sunscreens. He recommends them to his clients because they\u2019re often part of a multi-step skincare routine. \u201cWe encourage our clients to never use a chemical sunscreen over the top of serums and moisturisers as these can reduce the ingredients from penetrating into the skin\u201d.</p> <p>So if sunscreen is one of several products you apply each morning, mineral could be the way to go. Mineral sunscreens are also sometimes preferred by people with sensitive skin. Although Walker notes that less than 1% of the population is actually allergic to sunscreen itself; most reactions are to fragrances rather than active ingredients. She recommends consulting a dermatologist and trying a few different formulas if you experience irritation.</p> <p>Finally, mineral sunscreens also exclude ingredients that could harm reefs, making them a good option if you\u2019re in the ocean.</p> <h2><strong>Naturally better?</strong></h2> <p>For something that\u2019s pretty obviously good for you, sunscreen has a small but vocal pool of critics. Mostly found on unregulated health blogs, YouTube and Pinterest, they\u2019re fans of \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201chomemade\u201d alternatives. There\u2019s no point getting into their arguments because they\u2019re disputed by pretty much every doctor and skin cancer specialist. But in reflecting on the trend towards homemade sunscreens, Walker is clear: \u201cWe just would not go there. It\u2019s really not advised. Sunscreens are tested so rigorously in Australia because we have such a high UV environment. You can\u2019t be sure what on earth it\u2019s doing in terms of protecting your skin, and it\u2019s probably nothing. That\u2019s definitely a no-no.\u201d</p> <h2>The vitamin D-bate</h2> <p>Additionally, some have <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2380751/sunscreen-sun-exposure-skin-cancer-science?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=tweet\">expressed concern</a> over the role sunscreen may play in vitamin D deficiencies. Vitamin D is needed to ensure calcium absorption, which results in healthy muscles and bones. While it\u2019s possible to get vitamin D through food, the sun\u2019s UVB rays are the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/preventing-cancer/sun-protection/vitamin-d\">best source</a>.</p> <p>In the past, when we spent more time outside, vitamin D wasn\u2019t something people really worried about. As we\u2019ve become indoor creatures, there\u2019s been an <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6075634/\">uptick in deficiencies</a> \u2013 especially among younger people. But <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/preventing-cancer/sun-protection/vitamin-d/\">several studies</a> have shown that sunscreen has minimal impact on vitamin D levels. Even high-protection SPF30 formulas only stop 97% of UV exposure. No matter how much you put on, you\u2019re still absorbing vitamin D.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org.au/preventing-cancer/sun-protection/vitamin-d/\">Cancer Council explains</a> that during summer most people reach adequate vitamin D levels through regular incidental exposure to the sun. A <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/sunscreen-cancer-risk-assessment-health-benefits.html\">few minutes outside</a>, a few times a week, should do it. In winter, or when the UV index is low, it\u2019s worth spending a bit of extra time with your arms or legs uncovered in the sun. But again, incidental exposure \u2013 like popping out for a coffee or watering your garden \u2013 will be enough.</p> <h2><strong>The labels that matter</strong></h2> <p>Amid all this noise, the core message is the same. A good sunscreen will have an SPF rating of 30 or higher, an AUST Number and be waterproof. But no matter what you choose, it needs to be applied liberally and often. As Walker reiterates: \u201cWith any sunscreen people put it on and think they\u2019re protected to stay outside for hours and hours. No sunscreen completely blocks the UV, it filters it.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re using it with other skincare products or heading oceanside, consider a mineral option. Otherwise, in short, primary school rules still apply: slather it on, cover up, wear a hat and stay in the shade. Simple.</p>",

He points out that only two studies have looked at the environmental impacts of sunscreens and they weren\u2019t \u201crepresentative of real-world conditions\u201d. Rather than worry too much about sunscreen, he pushes the focus around coral bleaching to heat stress and warming oceans. \u201cAfter Hawaii banned sunscreen, hot temperatures returned this year, triggering more coral bleaching,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. But while the research is thin, it\u2019s fair to say reefs need all the support they can get. So you may as well use a reef-safe sunscreen \u2013 one that\u2019s mineral based or free from benzophene-3 and octinoxate \u2013 if you\u2019re spending time in the ocean. Just don\u2019t use this as an excuse to skip sun protection. Mineral v chemical One of the biggest sources of sunscreen confusion is the distinction between mineral and chemical formulas. The major difference between the two is that mineral sunscreens sit on top of your skin, providing a physical barrier to UV \u2013 which is why they\u2019re sometimes called physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens contain ingredients that sink into your skin and absorb UV. This is why so many chemical sunscreens weirdly recommend you apply them under your moisturiser and wait 20 minutes before sun exposure. They need time to absorb, and can react badly with other products. While they offer the same end result, there are usage differences. Dermal therapist James Vivian is a fan of mineral sunscreens. He recommends them to his clients because they\u2019re often part of a multi-step skincare routine. \u201cWe encourage our clients to never use a chemical sunscreen over the top of serums and moisturisers as these can reduce the ingredients from penetrating into the skin\u201d. So if sunscreen is one of several products you apply each morning, mineral could be the way to go. Mineral sunscreens are also sometimes preferred by people with sensitive skin. Although Walker notes that less than 1% of the population is actually allergic to sunscreen itself; most reactions are to fragrances rather than active ingredients. She recommends consulting a dermatologist and trying a few different formulas if you experience irritation. Finally, mineral sunscreens also exclude ingredients that could harm reefs, making them a good option if you\u2019re in the ocean. Naturally better? For something that\u2019s pretty obviously good for you, sunscreen has a small but vocal pool of critics. Mostly found on unregulated health blogs, YouTube and Pinterest, they\u2019re fans of \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201chomemade\u201d alternatives. There\u2019s no point getting into their arguments because they\u2019re disputed by pretty much every doctor and skin cancer specialist. But in reflecting on the trend towards homemade sunscreens, Walker is clear: \u201cWe just would not go there. It\u2019s really not advised. Sunscreens are tested so rigorously in Australia because we have such a high UV environment. You can\u2019t be sure what on earth it\u2019s doing in terms of protecting your skin, and it\u2019s probably nothing. That\u2019s definitely a no-no.\u201d The vitamin D-bate Additionally, some have expressed concern over the role sunscreen may play in vitamin D deficiencies. Vitamin D is needed to ensure calcium absorption, which results in healthy muscles and bones. While it\u2019s possible to get vitamin D through food, the sun\u2019s UVB rays are the best source. In the past, when we spent more time outside, vitamin D wasn\u2019t something people really worried about. As we\u2019ve become indoor creatures, there\u2019s been an uptick in deficiencies \u2013 especially among younger people. But several studies have shown that sunscreen has minimal impact on vitamin D levels. Even high-protection SPF30 formulas only stop 97% of UV exposure. No matter how much you put on, you\u2019re still absorbing vitamin D. The Cancer Council explains that during summer most people reach adequate vitamin D levels through regular incidental exposure to the sun. A few minutes outside, a few times a week, should do it. In winter, or when the UV index is low, it\u2019s worth spending a bit of extra time with your arms or legs uncovered in the sun. But again, incidental exposure \u2013 like popping out for a coffee or watering your garden \u2013 will be enough. The labels that matter Amid all this noise, the core message is the same. A good sunscreen will have an SPF rating of 30 or higher, an AUST Number and be waterproof. But no matter what you choose, it needs to be applied liberally and often. As Walker reiterates: \u201cWith any sunscreen people put it on and think they\u2019re protected to stay outside for hours and hours. No sunscreen completely blocks the UV, it filters it.\u201d If you\u2019re using it with other skincare products or heading oceanside, consider a mineral option. Otherwise, in short, primary school rules still apply: slather it on, cover up, wear a hat and stay in the shade. Simple.",

I take responsibility for the set-up.\u201d With Arsenal pressing harder for a reply they were understaffed at the back and Jonna Andersson\u2019s cross from the left just had to be glanced in by Reiten for Chelsea\u2019s fourth, and a goal for the 25-year-old to add to her two assists. The substitutes Lisa Evans and Beth Mead linked up for the home team\u2019s consolation but it did little to paper over the cracks of a side out of ideas. \u201cThis is an amazing team, these are amazing players and you\u2019re allowed a slip-up every once in a while,\u201d Montemurro said. \u201cBut if you look historically at this team it is always one that comes back and will be there.\u201d Goals from the England duo Ellen White and Kiera Walsh either side of the break ensured Manchester City went top of the Women\u2019s Super League with a 2-0 defeat of Birmingham. It took White just 34 seconds to pounce, firing her first-time strike after a sharp cross from Jill Scott. Scott provided the assist for the second too, her pull-back to Walsh ricocheting in off the post to kill any hopes of a Birmingham fightback. Two goals from Katie Zelem helped Manchester United see off Tottenham 3-0 at a foggy Leigh Sports Village. A penalty in the second half from the United captain gave them the lead before Jess Sigsworth capitalised from a corner. Zelem sealed the points late on but the substitute Ella Toone was sent off in added time to dampen the win which takes them above Everton into fourth on goal difference. A hat-trick from the Everton youngster Chloe Kelly ensured they overtook Reading with a 3-1 win. Fara Williams cancelled out the 22-year-old\u2019s opener but she helped her side regain the lead with a goal direct from a corner before converting a cross for her third. New recruit Rachel Furness scored the only goal as Liverpool earned their first win of the season to move off the bottom and above their opponents Bristol City on goal difference. An Alisha Lehmann double enabled West Ham to move four points clear of ninth-placed Brighton. Danique Kerkdijk had given the Seagulls the lead but Lehmann struck with 11 minutes to play and then found the winner four minutes later.",

Last week it was revealed that Greenpeace, Peta and other non-violent groups were included in a counter-terrorism police document distributed to medical staff and teachers as part of anti-extremism briefings.

City of London falls under a separate division of the CT policing network, Counter Terrorism Command (SO15), along with the Metropolitan police. The Guardian has since heard from teachers and council workers across the country who have received Prevent training that referenced Extinction Rebellion.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump wants his impeachment trial to end before his state of the union address in just two weeks\u2019 time, Lindsey Graham said on Sunday. \u201cHis mood is, to go to the state of the union [on 4 February] with this behind him and talk about what he wants to do for the rest of 2020 and what he wants to do for the next four years,\u201d the South Carolina senator and close Trump ally told Fox News Sunday. That timeline is ambitious, given overwhelming public support for a fair airing of the charges against Trump at his Senate trial, in which opening arguments will be heard on Tuesday. Graham conceded that a swift dismissal of the charges, which he had hoped for, will not be possible. The trial could include testimony from top Trump advisers with firsthand knowledge of his alleged attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. But the White House has indicated that Trump would invoke executive privilege to prevent such advisers from testifying, setting up a court fight that could drag the trial out for weeks or longer. \u201cThe sooner this is over the better for the country,\u201d Graham insisted. On Saturday evening, House Democrats and the Trump legal team outlined their approaches to the trial. The House impeachment managers, who will act as prosecutors, declared the president must be removed for putting his political career ahead of the public trust and seeking to hide that betrayal from Congress and the American people. The seven managers led by intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff published a 46-page tiral brief. A 61-page \u201cstatement of material facts\u201d was attached. In a much slimmer filing, the White House replied to a congressional writ of summons notifying Trump of the charges against him and inviting him to attend the trial. The six-page White House filing was a work of blanket denial, stating: \u201cPresident Trump categorically and unequivocally denies each and every allegation in both articles of impeachment.\u201d Signed by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and by Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer to Trump, it also charged the Democrats with \u201ca brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election, now just months away\u201d. Speaking to ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Schiff noted that the White House did not attempt to rebut the case on its facts. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising in that it really doesn\u2019t offer much new beyond the failed arguments we heard in the House,\u201d he said. \u201cThe facts aren\u2019t seriously contested.\u201d Another impeachment manager, Jason Crow of Colorado, said the White House was in effect arguing that Trump was above the law. \u201cIf all of the president\u2019s arguments are true, that a president can\u2019t be indicted, and that the abuse of power, the abuse of public trust doesn\u2019t count as an impeachable offense \u2013 if that is true, then no president can be held accountable,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cThen the president truly is above the law.\u201d The battle lines roughly plotted by the two documents will be engaged in earnest on Tuesday, when the House managers are expected to begin making their case against the president. A two-thirds majority of senators would be required to remove Trump from office. That is vastly unlikely, given a Republican party aligned behind the president and a Senate leadership openly in lockstep with the White House. Trump must be removed, Democrats argue, owing to the egregiousness of his past misconduct and his ongoing efforts to encourage foreign tampering in US elections. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s continuing presence in office undermines the integrity of our democratic processes and endangers our national security,\u201d the managers wrote. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s abuse of power requires his conviction and removal from office.\u201d On Sunday Alan Dershowitz, the controversial Harvard law professor who has joined Trump\u2019s legal team, argued on CNN that the charges against the president were not impeachable because abuse of power does not constitute a \u201chigh crime and misdemeanor\u201d as stipulated in the US constitution as grounds for impeachment. That view is an extreme outlier among legal scholars, but it is not the only time that Dershowitz, who formerly represented OJ Simpson and the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has gone against his colleagues. Dershowitz denied that his past representation of and friendship with Epstein could \u201cbackfire\u201d in the impeachment trial, besmirching the president\u2019s defense in the eyes particularly of women in Senate and beyond. \u201cThey understand that it\u2019s pure McCarthyism to hold a lawyer responsible for having represented controversial clients,\u201d he said. Republicans have never attempted to mount a point-for-point rebuttal of evidence amassed by Democrats that Trump mounted a months-long effort to extract announcements from Ukraine that Trump thought could damage Joe Biden, his political rival. Evidence indicates that the effort derailed the career of a respected US ambassador at the wishes of corrupt Ukrainian elements, potentially threatening her personal security; used the promise of a White House meeting to extract the \u201cdeliverable\u201d Trump wanted; and escalated to the suspension by Trump of security aid for Ukraine appropriated by Congress. The Democratic briefing highlighted evidence that has emerged since Trump was impeached in the House in December. That evidence includes documents and testimony from Lev Parnas, a former close associate of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s designated point person in Ukraine. Identifying himself as the \u201cpersonal counsel to President Trump\u201d, Giuliani sought a meeting with Ukrainian president-elect Volodymyr Zelenskiy in May 2019, according to Parnas evidence cited in the briefing. \u201cPresident Trump has betrayed the American people and the ideals on which the nation was founded,\u201d the Democratic briefing concluded. \u201cUnless he is removed from office, he will continue to endanger our national security, jeopardize the integrity of our elections, and undermine our core constitutional principles.\u201d",

Dycheball is having a crisis. There have been crises before during the club\u2019s long stay in the Premier League but losing every single game in 2020 is not a good portent for a new decade. They have also scored just one goal since Christmas, and that came in a defeat to Aston Villa. It has them plunging down the table, and if Eddie Howe and Bournemouth are in trouble so is another manager who embodies his unfashionable club. <br><br>Let\u2019s also talk of Leicester, for whom any chance of a title challenge relies on a Devon Loch scenario unmatched in human history. Liverpool have got this, but second place is very much within the grasp of Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team, what with Manchester City looking at the end of their cycle and dodgy of defence. A victory at Turf Moor would take Leicester level on points with Pep Guardiola, who has taken to admitting his team is playing for second. There has been something of a stall, after last week\u2019s defeat to Southampton and being held at home by Aston Villa in the first leg of the League Cup. <br><br><strong>Kick-off at 2pm UK time</strong> <br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/18/burnley-leicester-match-preview-premier-league\">Burnley v Leicester: match preview</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Paul Wilson\u2019s match report from Turf Moor. Nick Pope and Ashley Westwood, man of the match and winning goalscorer, speak. NP: [On saving from Jamie Vardy] At the World Cup, he took a few against me. It\u2019s nice to be involved and make a few saves. Massive win for us and the atmosphere was electric. You go on bad runs, and to go four without a win is hard. To go 1-0 down and recover like that is important for us. AW: I don\u2019t get many, me and Corky have been saying that. It\u2019s a great win for us. Nick Pope\u2019s penalty save was the key moment and from that platform, coming as it did not long after Chris Wood\u2019s equaliser, Burnley seized the win and via a fine goal from Ashley Westwood. Leicester were, in truth, flat for most of the game. They have won only two of their last six games. 90+5 min: One last corner from James Maddison and Kasper Schmeichel goes up. It comes to naught and that\u2019s that. Well done to Burnley. 90+3 min: Leicester look somewhat demoralised. Burnley are dealing just fine with the long balls aimed at them. 90+2 min: Chris Wood goes off for Aaron Lennon for Burnley and Phil Bardsley has been taking some treatment. The clock is being run down rather professionally. 90 min: Three minutes added on. Ricardo\u2019s cross is headed away in desperation by Bardsley as an extra three minutes are added on. Then, the ball goes loose in the Burnley area and Nick Pope is only to too happy to smother the ball. 89 min: Maddison and Ricardo scurry into the box, and Burnley concede a corner. Maddison takes and it is cleared. Maddison then whips a low ball in that Ben Mee clears with a low, Phil Jones-esque header. 87 min: Soyuncu gets the ball in space and gets greedy. The jeers denote his failure to get the ball down anywhere near the goal. Leicester getting somewhat desperate. 86 min: Leicester pour forward but Burnley hold firm. Leicester look a little shapeless in truth while Burnley look organised. 84 min: Maddison is fouled by Tarkowski on the touchline and will take a free-kick. This time, Pope is less than convincing but there is nobody to stop him claiming it at the second attempt. 82 min: The remaining moments will likely see Leicester push on for an equaliser. They have been off it today while Burnley have been excellent in chasing this one down. They started poorly but have pulled themselves through this. 80 min: Well. Well. That was excellent midfield play from Westwood, who realised Chris Wood had started that move from deep so the space needed filling. And Leicester were left rocking on their heels. Burnley lead! Charlie Taylor\u2019s ball beats Jonny Evans, comes off Fuchs and Westwood, surging forward finds the space to shoot. 77 min: Tielemans, after that billing, is jeered after whacking the ball out of play, and off the touchline. But then his ball means Vardy goes close with Pope making another fine save. Vardy looks vexed. 75 min: Leicester, with Tielemans on, step it up. Maddison has a shot blocked by Ben Mee, who has been in the thick of matters. 74 min: Brendan Rodgers is doing some pointing and directing. His team have looked ragged this afternoon. 73 min: Two Leicester changes: Off goes Ayoze Perez for Kelechi Iheanacho, and Dennis Praet for Youri Tielemans. 72 min: Leicester have to defend a free-kick, then a corner and the home fans are roaring on their men. The Burnley spirit is very far from extinguished. 71 min: Would Leicester\u2019s have been a deserving lead? They have not been great in this game. barring Harvey Barnes, who has been a constant danger. And Vardy has been peripheral. 69 min: Well. Vardy made a mess of that but Pope was excellent. Now the home fans are up for this. Good atmosphere now. There is a delay for VAR, looking for an offside, but then comes the kick itself. It\u2019s casual, and readable and Nick Pope makes a great save. 67 min: Penalty to Leicester! Mee brings down Barnes, who had sped away from him. 66 min: A Leicester wildcat attack as Ricardo and then Barnes speed on but the final ball is just behind James Maddison and he fails to direct his shot away from Pope. 65 min: Soyuncu now taking the brunt off the crowd for his running battle with Chris Wood. This is turning into the type of physical contest that Burnley will relish far more than Leicester. 63 min: Leicester free-kick from the left, drifted by Fuchs at Soyuncu and there are some acrobatics from Jonny Evans before the ball is cleared at the third attempt. 62 min: Another clash between Bardsley and Maddison results in rage from the Salfordian defender and his manager. Burnley had wanted an advantage called after a previous foul by Soyuncu. The referee is taking the brunt from fans again. Moral probity is being questioned. 59 min: Maddison\u2019s lofted ball is headed away by Taylor, just when Barnes was ready to receive the pass. Then, Perez gets space to shoot but Pope is ready for it, and stops it with ease. 58 min: Maddison booed as he goes to ground and doesn\u2019t get a foul; there is a crackling atmosphere at last at Turf Moor. 57 min: The set piece always looked the likely route to goal for Burnley and so it proved. Leicester found themselves overmanned. The goal owed much to the quality of Dwight McNeil, who has suddenly come into this game. McNeil whips in the corner. Mee clatters above everyone and Wood has a tap-in, having anticipated the knock-down. 55 min: Better from Burnley but still ponderous. Rodriguez does, though, force a corner. 53 min: Jonny Evans shows his experience in cutting back across himself to clear up the sliver of danger that had opened up when the ball was aimed at Chris Wood. 52 min: Maddison goes close, as he seizes on a bouncing ball, and suddenly a spectacular goal looks on, only for his shot to go wide. He saw glory there but didn\u2019t get it. 50 min: Perhaps Burnley have some urgency after all. McNeil is their man for fliar and he gets to the byline and whips in a cross that evades all. 48 min: But what\u2019s this? A Burnley attack of note, as Charlie Taylor whips in the ball and Chris Wood heads over. He just couldn\u2019t get over it, even at his great height. 47 min: Next, Vardy manages to squeeze through the middle before the ball is cleared. Burnley reeling from a blast of Dyche? 46 min: We are back underway at a muted Turf Moor. Hope in short supply for the home fans? Leicester look to turn the screw early with a James Maddison shot which Nick Pope saves well and manages to direct the ball away from his area. Joe Pearson from Indianapolis sums it up. \u201cThis is dire. Not much of a satisfying appetizer for the coming main course.\u201d New to Liverpool v Manchester United, mate? Usually awful games. Mary Waltz emails in: \u201cOn the Stateside feed, the crowd goes silent at certain moments and Americans are getting to hear individual Burnley fans thoughts on their team. I especially liked \u201cnow why would you ***ing do that. F***!\u201d Leicester\u2019s goal came amid a morass of poor play from each team. The interception from Dennis Praet was the best moment of the half, and Harvey Barnes\u2019 finish decent enough. Sean Dyche is raging, and well he might. His team have been poor, but he thinks Jack Cork was fouled by Praet. He wasn\u2019t. 45 min: Leicester free-kick, and Maddison whips it in. Mee gets there first before McNeil commits another foul, and Maddison gets another chance to deliver. This time, Perez heads over. 44 min: Schmeichel has to make a save but it is not much of one. Chris Wood\u2019s header was straight at him when it would have been far better directed at Jay Rodriguez as he was making a belated run into the box. 42 min: Leicester playing some slow passes as they try to take the sting out of Burnley, who have not presented much of a threat. The home fans continue to complain about the referee, but their team\u2019s performance is the true source of their ire. 40 min: James Maddison down? Does that continue the woes of England\u2019s Euro 2016 squad? No, he seems to be ok. Phew. 38 min: Burnley have a free-kick, a set-piece to feed off, and it comes from the left. There is brief chaos in the Leicester box, then a ricochet then a goal kick. 37 min: Leicester have confidence and so does Harvey Barnes who releases Maddison with a fine pass. That forces a corner which is cleared. 34 min: Burnley yet to win a game in which they have conceded the first goal. That came against the run of play, in that there had been no run of play to speak of. It was a bad goal to concede. Cork says he was fouled by Praet but VAR says no. Dennis Praet slides in on Jack Cork and Barnes speeds on, with Jamie Vardy pulling defenders with him. Barnes goes on and his shot beats Pope, who was not too impressive in attempting to save that. 32 min: A shot, an actual shot. The ball is flicked to Rodriguez, and he shoots from a very long way out indeed. It is easily claimed by Kasper Schmeichel. 30 min: Harvey Barnes hassled into a mistake but Burnley cannot force anything from it. Phil Bardsley then launches himself over Barnes and ends up in a heap. He will be OK to carry on, though. He has a sore neck but is made of stern stuff. 28 min: A burst by Ricardo adds a brief amount of zest but he is stopped by Ben Mee. It\u2019s pedestrian stuff. Then, Evans comes across to wallop a ball angled for Rodriguez out of play. 26 min: Soyuncu has to take evasive action when he charges across to hack clear when the ball was in danger of dropping to Chris Wood. 25 min: Leicester have a corner, which Maddison takes and Pope punches clear. The ball comes to Praet but he can\u2019t make much of the opportunity. 23 min: Leicester have been patient to the point of looking a little leaden. Jamie Vardy has only made on burst as he is being kept watch by a Burnley defence that is sitting deep. 21 min: Chris Wood penalised for a foul on Evans. Seems to be some ref rage from the locals. Burnley have stepped this up a bit, look the more energetic team. 20 min: Leicester called upon to do some defending; Jonny Evans smells the danger when a ball is launched towards a waiting Ben Mee and then Kasper Schmeichel has to be first to the resultant corner. He does the same when McNeil whips in the next corner but Jack Cork is ruled to have baulked the Leicester goalie. 18 min: Dare I say that these teams look tired? Good thing that they will get a rest this week...oh, Leicester play West Ham and Burnley go to Old Trafford on Wednesday. 17 min: Jack Cork piles into a challenge on Praet. It was wild but the lack of contact meant there was no booking. He had left the ground, so was lucky to escape without a yellow. 15 min: Dennis Praet, in the team ahead of Tielemans, is at the centre of a patient build-up of a move that results in one of those trademark Burnley blocks. Burnley try to relieve the pressure but Wood and Rodriguez don\u2019t appear to be on the same wavelength. 13 min: Perez is outnumbered by a phalanx of Burnley players. and that would appear to be the plan of action. The midfield is crowded but then Vardy springs on to a pass from deep, speeds past Wood, and then passes for Maddison to have chance to shoot. Instead, he takes an extra touch and loses the ball. 11 min: First roar of the home crowd after some neat skill from Hendrick but he then slows up and has his cross blocked by Fuchs. 9 min: This has not been great so far, with neither team looking in much nick. Burnley are taking their time over throw-ins and free-kicks. 8 min: Am proud to say that Christian Fuchs follows me on Twitter but he also follows 88,500 other people so maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so proud. He\u2019s taken over from Ben Chilwell for the day, and it has to be said that Chilwell has looked a little tired of late. 6 min: Not exactly the loudest of atmospheres at Turf Moor, it has to be said. 5 min: Barnes of Leicester has been lively and skips pass Hendrick, and it takes some hurried defending to clear Burnley\u2019s lines. 3 min: Burnley have, on each occasion they have had the ball, launched it forward. Wood and Rodriguez almost linked up but the shot whips wide. 1 min: Burnley began with a long ball, funnily enough, and then Leicester quickly mount an attack with Harvey Barnes getting a shot in. That was allowed to happen rather too easily. The game is afoot and Sean Dyche, of all people, is doing that talk behind the hand thing as he addresses the linesman in front of him. Ahead of the match, a minute\u2019s silence is being observed. Two facts worth mentioning: Ashley Barnes has had a hernia operation, and Leicester have lost three of their last five Premier League matches. And Brendan Rodgers on the absence from his squad of Ben Chilwell. Ben has played a lot for us this season, and this week he missed a bit of training...It\u2019s an opportunity to get three points. We are in a good position in the league and we will need to focus and if we do the result will come. Sean Dyche in pre-match on the return of Jay Rodriguez and Robbie Brady, in lieu of the continuing absence of Ashley Barnes. It\u2019s helpful, it\u2019s good to see them coming back into the next group of game. They [Leicester] are a very good side, with good coaching, it\u2019s not an easy task. PA Media have the lowdown on those team selection for this match. Jay Rodriguez returned for Burnley as they looked to end a run of four league defeats on the bounce at home to Champions League-chasing Leicester. Rodriguez, who missed last weekend\u2019s 3-0 defeat to Chelsea through illness, started up front alongside Chris Wood in the continued absence of Ashley Barnes, while Phil Bardsley replaced Matt Lowton at right-back. Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers made two changes after a 2-1 home defeat to Southampton, with Nampalys Mendy and Christian Fuchs replacing Ben Chilwell and Hamza Choudhury. Dyche and Rodgers worked together at Watford, with Brendan as manager for a brief spell and Dyche working with the youth team at the club he eventually managed. There is obviously warmth between the pair. Rodgers dished out the praise. He is a guy I know well. He is a real student and a deep thinker of the game, and as a coach he is first class. He is very progressive, his teams have clarity in how they work, the players understand their roles, and he has them super-organised and committed. Like us all, in various sections of the league, there is a limit in terms of budget which gets you certain types of players. What he does is give confidence to the players he brings in, where it might not have worked out for them at other clubs. Absolutely no disrespect to Burnley, but if there was an opportunity at a higher level for him, then he could go on and do that, without any shadow of a doubt. Ahead of this game, Sean Dyche spoke in his pre-match press conference and had some kind words for Leicester and Brendan Rodgers. I like the manager and what he is trying to achieve there. They have invested heavily in the players but they are a younger group who are developing all the time with enough experience in key players in there as well. We are on a tough run of form, but I don\u2019t think they are naive enough to think it is turn up and get the business done. We are not a million miles away. The last time these teams met, big bad VAR reared its head. An Opta stat which tells something of the problem with Burnley, Burnley have gone 10 Premier League games without scoring a first-half goal, since beating West Ham 3-0 in November. The last team to have a longer run of games without netting in the opening 45 minutes were Burnley themselves in May 2015 (12 games). Those teams again in analogue fashion. Burnley: Pope, Tarkowski, Mee, Taylor, Bardsley, Westwood, Cork, McNeil, Hendrick, Wood, Rodriguez Subs: Hart, Lowton, Brady, Pieters, Lennon, Vydra, Long Leicester: Schmeichel, Ricardo, Soyuncu, Evans, Fuchs, Mendy, Perez, Praet, Maddison, Barnes, Vardy Subs: Ward, Justin, Morgan, Gray, Tielemans, Albrighton, Iheanacho The referee is Anthony Taylor of Wythenshawe. We need to talk about Burnley. Dycheball is having a crisis. There have been crises before during the club\u2019s long stay in the Premier League but losing every single game in 2020 is not a good portent for a new decade. They have also scored just one goal since Christmas, and that came in a defeat to Aston Villa. It has them plunging down the table, and if Eddie Howe and Bournemouth are in trouble so is another manager who embodies his unfashionable club. Let\u2019s also talk of Leicester, for whom any chance of a title challenge relies on a Devon Loch scenario unmatched in human history. Liverpool have got this, but second place is very much within the grasp of Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team, what with Manchester City looking at the end of their cycle and dodgy of defence. A victory at Turf Moor would take Leicester level on points with Pep Guardiola, who has taken to admitting his team is playing for second. There has been something of a stall, after last week\u2019s defeat to Southampton and being held at home by Aston Villa in the first leg of the League Cup. Kick-off at 2pm UK time",

It was pretty clear that the captain was trying to find a route to three figures by aiming for the vacant midwicket after pinpointing it with a powerful pull earlier in the over, but this time he\u2019s skittled. He declined the single on offer from the previous delivery, so maybe that\u2019s a bit of cricket karma.

I don\u2019t expect it\u2019ll be a good professional decision for the younger man if he takes too many runs here, which could increase the degree of difficulty on the skipper getting to 100 before this is done.

Another short one follows, which he misses when making room outside leg stump. Hazlewood goes for the yorker next up but the No4 is well up to this task, adjusting in the crease to hammer it from middle stump out to cover for four. He makes it two in a row from a length delivery, again after backing away to make space to swing, middled over point this time for four more. 11 from the over, leaving India 41 to collect across the final 42 balls of this match and series.<strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e246f968f0879d539efafe5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-19T15:09:16.646Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>42nd over: India 235-2 (Kohli 75, Shreyas 13) Target 287.</strong> A stange one to begin, Starc appealing for caught behind down the legside but a wide called by Umpire Gough.

Certainly, 26 fours and two sixes for the 50 overs looks a little on the lean side. Revealingly, Australia were helped along by an at-times errant India pace attack; 27 extras were recorded and just three batsmen could better this total. One of them was Steve Smith, who continued his love affair against India in this format with a ninth ODI century and first for three years. Smith put on 127 for the third wicket with Marnus Labuschagne, the only other Australia batter to really put pressure on India. Mohammed Shami was the most damaging bowler, returning 4-63, but the pick of the attack was a man who went wicketless, Jasprit Bumrah.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s score, just shy of 300, is by no means meagre, but they will have to bowl and field extremely well to limit India\u2019s dangerous batting line-up. Shikhar Dhawan is under a cloud after injuring his shoulder early in Australia\u2019s innings. There\u2019s no word yet if he\u2019s fit to bat, but India will fancy not needing him at all as they chase a series victory.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019ll do us from Bangalore. Thanks for your company throughout the series this week - a lot of fun! Be sure to join us again on the OBO tomorrow as England try and take the last few wickets down at Port Elizabeth. Goodbye for now. Rohit wins an award. Virat wins an award. Jadeja wins an award. Everybody wins an award! Rohit is also player of the match for his 119 from 128 balls. Aaron Finch speaks. Wicket was turning a bit when they were batting; felt they needed 300-plus. Didn\u2019t maximise partnerships. Losing wickets at tough times. But that\u2019s a part of learning with a relatively young batting group. A great learning curve for the team in this series. Agar bowled beautifully; big difference the line he bowled in this series - closer to the stumps. Zampa also exceptional. Bowled the part-timers to pinch some overs but it wasn\u2019t to be. Sorry, I\u2019m not sure why the presentation is taking so long. But I\u2019ll be here with you for it. We\u2019ll hear from the captains, the players of the match/series and the other half a dozen or so awards that tend to be handed out in these ceremonies. Ravi Shastri is on TV. Great. He immediately has a pop at the media about criticism of the strength of Australian teams they have beaten in the past. Yawn. Meanwhile in Port Elizabeth, Joe Root is bowling out South Africa. For real. Join Tanya Aldred for the final 20 minutes of an eventful fourth afternoon there. 47.3 overs: India 289-3 (Shreyas 44, Pandey 8) Target 287. Nice shot from Pandey, driving Hazlewood straight back past his boots for four from his second ball. Hazlewood responds with a misdirected bouncer, called a wide. Two runs to get and there it is! Pandey secures the win with an emphatic slap, straight back over the bowler\u2019s head for four. India get the job done with 15 balls to spare. Clinical. 47th over: India 280-3 (Shreyas 44, Pandey 0) Target 287. Shreyas is determined to finish this off in style, lofting a superb square drive off Starc for four to start the new over, landing inches away from the boundary. Nine to get, will he get them with three overs to spare? Nup. Six from it, leaving seven runs left for the win. Hazlewood bowls Kohli. It was pretty clear that the captain was trying to find a route to three figures by aiming for the vacant midwicket after pinpointing it with a powerful pull earlier in the over, but this time he\u2019s skittled. He declined the single on offer from the previous delivery, so maybe that\u2019s a bit of cricket karma. Either way, forget about all that, another clincial and altogether matchwinning hand from the best there has ever been in the limited-overs format of the game. 46th over: India 274-3 (Shreyas 38, Pandey 0) Target 287. 45th over: India 268-2 (Kohli 84, Shreyas 37) Target 287. Shreyas clips a couple off Starc to start the new over. When Kohli gets his turn he is about to duck then elects to pull, from the duck position, upon realising it is a slower ball. Ridiculous shot. It\u2019s only a single though, so Shreyas is back on strike and slamming Starc over midwicket for SIX! Hard and flat - bosh! And again over point to finish, inside-out for four! Whaddashot! It makes it very difficult for Kohli to get his ton but ever so likely that India will finish this in the next couple of overs. Starc: 8-0-60-0. 44th over: India 254-2 (Kohli 83, Shreyas 24) Target 287. Zampa begins his tenth over at Kohli and the Indian captain finally takes him on, leaping on a long-hop, smashing it through cover to reach the 80s. He has a ton on the shelf here, make no mistake. Cutting hard, he adds a couple more wide of the man at deep point before turning the strike back to Shreyas. I don\u2019t expect it\u2019ll be a good professional decision for the younger man if he takes too many runs here, which could increase the degree of difficulty on the skipper getting to 100 before this is done. Yep - that holds up: foward defence, forward defence, single to point. Clever. All told, another night where Zampa\u2019s reputation has been enhanced, finishing with 1/44. 43rd over: India 246-2 (Kohli 76, Shreyas 23) Target 287. Hazlewood to Kohli, but what they really want is the big quick at Shreyas who doesn\u2019t have a reputation of fancying the short stuff. Sure enough, a bumper is what comes his way when getting on strike, hacked away unconvincingly over midwicket for a couple. Another short one follows, which he misses when making room outside leg stump. Hazlewood goes for the yorker next up but the No4 is well up to this task, adjusting in the crease to hammer it from middle stump out to cover for four. He makes it two in a row from a length delivery, again after backing away to make space to swing, middled over point this time for four more. 11 from the over, leaving India 41 to collect across the final 42 balls of this match and series. 42nd over: India 235-2 (Kohli 75, Shreyas 13) Target 287. A stange one to begin, Starc appealing for caught behind down the legside but a wide called by Umpire Gough. Now, there\u2019s clearly a sound - shown later by technology to be Kohli\u2019s thigh pad. Finch did make the review signal but after the 15 seconds had expired. Let\u2019s pretend he did get it upstairs before the clock ran to zero. If the spike showed a touch on the pad would Australia have lost the review but won the extra run back in their column? Shreyas keeps the board moving India\u2019s way when his turn comes, timing a full ball out of the block hole, directed too square for Labuschagne to drag it back from the rope. Very handy shot. They\u2019re cruising to this. 41st over: India 227-2 (Kohli 73, Shreyas 8) Target 287. Agar completes his ten with a classy and tidy over, in keeping with the theme of his night. With a bit of turn, he finds Kohli\u2019s outside edge to start before keeping the pair pinned to the crease. The West Australian finishes with 1/38 from his ten. He\u2019s bowled really well. 40th over: India 224-2 (Kohli 71, Shreyas 7) Target 287. Starc let\u2019s the new man Shreyas off the hook with a short ball well wide off off-stump, slapped away with ease through cover point. He\u2019s on the money for the rest of the set but the problem tonight with the left-armer has been that one boundary ball an over - usually early on too - which has denied him the chance to build pressure. 63 needed in 60 balls. 39th over: India 219-2 (Kohli 70, Shreyas 3) Target 287. Agar returns to the attack for his ninth over and starts it with his poorest delivery of the night, giving some help-yourself stuff to Kohli halfway down the track. He\u2019s back on his mark after that but there are no concerns here for the boys in blue. 38th over: India 212-2 (Kohli 64, Shreyas 2) Target 287. Starc on for his third spell, which in the World Cup was usually when he was able to cause the most chaos with late swing and the like. The pace is here but not quite the movement, tending to bang it in a touch short of a length rather than attacking the woodwork. He has five overs left and will probably be needed for all of those if it goes that far. 37th over: India 207-2 (Kohli 61, Shreyas 0) Target 287. Shreyas Iyer walks out at number four, his 16th ODI. There\u2019s still a bit of work to do too, 80 needed from 78 balls at the end of the successful Zampa over. But none of this matters if Kohli still batting in over 45 or something like that. The window is ajar but won\u2019t be for long. Talk about earning a wicket. Zampa has bowled so well and now he has Rohit\u2019s scalp, miscuing a slog sweep, the leading edge taken by Starc in from long-off. The end of another wonderful hand from the Hitman. Matchwinning, surely. 36th over: India 205-1 (Rohit 119, Kohli 59) Target 287. Here he goes! Kohli to 50 with a boundary, pulling a short ball through midwicket with complete control. Here\u2019s a ridiculous stat: it is the 100th time he has made it to 50 in ODIs. He backs it up with the shot of the night, an on-drive to die four. Nobody is stopping that. Finch swings the changes as best he can but with 13 from the over, that\u2019s surely game over with drinks on the field and the RCB chant going around Chinnaswamy. 35th over: India 192-1 (Rohit 118, Kohli 48) Target 287. Zampa into his eighth over - can he force a twist in this chase? He\u2019s certainly bowling well enough, his accuracy now better than ever with a wrong\u2019un good enough to consistently trouble Kohli, again finding his inside edge in this set. He follows it with a conventional legbreak, finding the outside edge this time. Through the stump-mic it\u2019s clear how frustrating that is for the spinner. Kohli smiles. The required rate is 6.33. 34th over: India 188-1 (Rohit 116, Kohli 46) Target 287. It\u2019s just not Cummins\u2019 night, back into the attack and giving Kohli a ball to throw his hands at short and well outside the off-stump - it gets the treatment. With that in the tank, they work the singles: a pull, a flick, a steer. Harsha Bhogle hints at a very good point on the telly: why is Cummins being risked on this tour? We\u2019re all grown-ups and we all know why this series is happening: cold, hard cash. Anyway, India need 99 to win. 33rd over: India 179-1 (Rohit 113, Kohli 40) Target 287. Zampa to Kohli. Despite the fact that India are still more than 100 runs from the finish line, this has a bit of a last-chance feel about it. So guess what? They take the foot back off, take the four singles presented to them down the ground, and leave it at that. Clinical. 32nd over: India 175-1 (Rohit 111, Kohli 38) Target 287. And now the foot goes down against Hazlewood! Rohit, clear of his century, backs himself to pick up a length delivery over long-on, going all the way for SIX. He barely swung at that - supreme timing. It\u2019s Kohli\u2019s turn later in the over, hooking a bouncer straight into the turf to make it a big set, 14 coming from it. In the process, the 100 partnership is raised. This is the 18th time in ODIs they\u2019ve added three-figures together. 31st over: India 161-1 (Rohit 103, Kohli 32) Target 287. They are working this wonderfully now, picking off risk-free runs from Agar and Zampa, doing the bulk of the work when the main spinners aren\u2019t in the attack. The required rate of 6.4 should be a doddle from here unless they lose both of these set men in a hurry. 30th over: India 156-1 (Rohit 101, Kohli 29) Target 287. But it nearly ends on 97! Hazlewood, so good earlier, is back into the attack and prompts a miscue from Rohit, only just clearing Finch at midwicket. Coming back for a couple, on 99, he steers the easiest of singles to third man to record three figures, there in 110 balls. It\u2019s the eighth time he\u2019s tallied three figures against Australia in 50-over cricket. Of course, the job is far from done here and the visitors throw themselves around accordingly, Smith making a brilliant diving stop at backward point to finish. 29th over: India 151-1 (Rohit 97, Kohli 28) Target 287. They can\u2019t get Agar away so they don\u2019t try to, happy playing him conservatively to the sweepers. Not a bad strategy given how strongly they have scored off Starc and Cummins. 28th over: India 147-1 (Rohit 94, Kohli 27) Target 287. Finch brings himself on! So, we\u2019ve seen Labuschagne and now the skipper in terms of the part-time options. And just as it was with Marnus, it is Rohit who gets to tuck right in, lifting a half-tracker waaaaay back into the second deck for SIX to move into the 90s. Nine from the over all told. I can see what he\u2019s thinking: with the frugality of the frontline spinners, it makes sense to get some overs from a third. But it hasn\u2019t worked. 27th over: India 138-1 (Rohit 87, Kohli 25) Target 287. Starc is off and Agar is back, Finch sensing that they need to find a way through and his spinners are the best vehicle for that. Oooh, Kohli has hurt him first up when stopping a straight drive in his follow through. It was a good bit of fielding but the spinner keeps shaking his hand. He continues. Rohit moves to 87 later in the over, which Slater is very excited about on television. A little fact: in Test cricket, 87 is the number that Australian batsmen have been dismissed on least in the 80s. There\u2019s another leg before appeal to finish, Agar thinking he might have The Hitman the same way he removed Rahul earlier tonight, but there\u2019s no review forthcoming this time. Another excellent over from the left-arm tweaker; he has 1/19 from his six. 26th over: India 135-1 (Rohit 86, Kohli 23) Target 287. Zampa drops short for the first time in his spell and Rohit takes full advantage, launching him 30 rows back into the stand for SIX! Sure enough, he\u2019s right back where he needs to be after that blip, giving up just one other single. The leggie has four left... bowl them straight? \u201cScientific research might credit the pleasure we derive from elegance to geometry or genes,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma on The Hitman, \u201cbut there is something too fundamentally emotional in nature about elegance to ever describe in numbers or confine to a definition. Rohit Sharma is my favourite cricketer, even when Kohli bats at the other end. Something about his batting, his leadership, and his aura energises me in a way nothing else ever has. When he is on song, he leaves me in awe; his translation of talent to success an inspiration; the front-foot pull from the willow he wields is the greatest shot in the history of the game. Cheers, Rohit, you are the best for me, and always will be.\u201d Ahh, the passion! Go well, young man. 25th over: India 128-1 (Rohit 80, Kohli 22) Target 287. Starc is too full and too wide and Rohit is too good to miss out, hammering him out past point to start the over. He reverts to a shorter line at Kohli, beating his edge with one of those. The captain keeps the strike with a steer to third man. Good recovery from Starc. 24th over: India 122-1 (Rohit 75, Kohli 21) Target 287. Big shout... not out! Zampa went past Kohli\u2019s blade when trying to work him through the legside. The right decision again from Finch not to send it through the DRS process - it was missing. Even so, it\u2019s another little win for the spinner, his wrong\u2019un working a treat. His five overs so far tonight have gone for just 19 runs. He and Agar hold the key. 23rd over: India 118-1 (Rohit 73, Kohli 19) Target 287. Right, so the Marnus Experiment has been brought to an end, Starc returning. Oooh, Kohli is well into that decision, launching into a magnificent cover drive on the up. Stand and deliver. With that, he moves to 5000 ODI runs as captain of India, reaching the mark in 82 innings. Of course, that\u2019s a record - breaking Dhoni\u2019s 127 hits. \u201cHello Adam.\u201d Hello, Krish on the tweet. \u201cI predict (euphemism for hope for) a middle order collapse, a late rally and India falling tantalizingly close to lose both the match and the series. By the way, it is confirmed that Smith is not human.\u201d I just hope it\u2019s a good contest and everyone has a nice time. How\u2019s that sound? 22nd over: India 112-1 (Rohit 72, Kohli 14) Target 287. Zampa is doing his job, giving neither batsmen an opportunity to attack without risk, five singles taken instead. 21st over: India 107-1 (Rohit 69, Kohli 12) Target 287. Marnus? Now? When the squeeze is right on? Finch has had a great hour but this backfires, his part-time spinner given the treatment by Rohit, a long-hop launched for SIX into the crowd at midwicket. 11 off the over and the pressure lifted. Will Agar come straight back? 20th over: India 96-1 (Rohit 61, Kohli 9) Target 287. Rinse and repeat. Finch consults his bowler halfway through the over and Zampa responds with his first slower legbreak, good enough to beat the mighty Kohli outside the off-stump. This is fine bowling. But they have to turn it into a wicket or it won\u2019t count for much. 19th over: India 92-1 (Rohit 59, Kohli 7) Target 287. If Australia do go on to win this match, the headlines will be all about Smith. Fair enough. But Agar has just pushed through his fifth over for 16, the wicket of Rahul picked up along the way. The last five overs all up have been worth 16 for the hosts as well. Hazlewood has conceded ten from his five overs and Zampa six from two. The squeeze is on. 18th over: India 90-1 (Rohit 57, Kohli 7) Target 287. Fantastic from Zampa to Kohli, pitching just short of a length with his overspinners, finishing with a leg break that the captain fails to cut from the middle of the bat, straight to a man. Judging by what he said to himself, audible through the stump mic, he\u2019s very cross about it. 17th over: India 88-1 (Rohit 56, Kohli 6) Target 287. Agar isn\u2019t far away with a flighted delivery that finds Rohit\u2019s edge but the opener isn\u2019t one for losing his head, waiting on a slightly shorter and flatter ball later in the over, cutting it behind point for four. Beautifully timed. They\u2019re the only runs from the over as they head off for a drink. India require 199 to win at just on six an over. 16th over: India 84-1 (Rohit 52, Kohli 6) Target 287. With Kohli in, Zampa is on - the man who has dismissed him both times in this series. A probing first set, too, up for leg before against Rohit with his wrong\u2019un. That\u2019s turned into his stock delivery of late, keeping right-handers honest by always attacking their stumps. 15th over: India 80-1 (Rohit 50, Kohli 4) Target 287. Rohit moves to 50 and barely acknowledges the milestone. Matt Hayden is far more excited on telly, once again describing this series as a heavyweight title fight. Earlier in the Agar over the main attraction was Warner, twice throwing himself around inside the ring to stop runs. India only need a run a ball but you can tell the Australians believe they\u2019re close. 14th over: India 77-1 (Rohit 49, Kohli 2) Target 287. It has been a long time coming but from the final ball of Hazlewood\u2019s fifth over, a boundary has been taken off his bowling with Rohit steering him expertly, just square of the third man sweeper. To that point, it was dots aplenty once again. It\u2019s the bleedingly obvious point, but we\u2019re into the most important partnership of the match right now. 13th over: India 71-1 (Rohit 45, Kohli 1) Target 287. They earned that error after such a solid period of tight bowling from bowl ends. Partnerships, and all that. And a good point from Bharat too: credit to Carey for making the case to Finch. Magnificent review! Finch took each and every one of those 15 seconds to make the sign and it right he was, the ball pitching just in line before straightening just enough to hit middle and leg. The Australians are elated and rightly so. HAS AGAR GOT RAHUL LBW WHEN MISSING A SWEEP? It has been turned down but Finch wants another look. To DRS we go! 12th over: India 64-0 (Rohit 43, Rahul 18) Target 287. This is brilliant from Hazlewood. His four overs have gone for 1, 1, 0 and 2. Rohit is savvy enough to know when he\u2019s taking on a bowler going as well as this, very happy to play him with respect. The foundation has already been laid and there\u2019s no rush here. 11th over: India 64-0 (Rohit 42, Rahul 16) Target 287. Agar is into the attack with the field back and supports Hazlewood with a frugal over of his own, three singles taken out to the legside sweepers but nothing further. We saw how effective the left-armer can be at denying boundary balls across the six T20s Australia played late last year against Sri Lanka and Paksitan. A much-improved operator. 10th over: India 61-0 (Rohit 41, Rahul 14) Target 287. Quite outstanding from Hazelwood. While bulk runs are leaking from the other end, he\u2019s keeping a player of Rohit\u2019s capacity - hitting them as well as he is - quiet for the entire over. Along the way, he beats him with another superb delivery, pitching middle and beating off. A maiden to finish the power play. But can they convert this into a mistake? 9th over: India 61-0 (Rohit 41, Rahul 14) Target 287. This is not something I\u2019m conditioned to saying: Pat Cummins is copping a pasting. Of course, it\u2019s all about Rohit who beats third man with a slash, down to the rope. A much better stroke follows, picking up the off-cutter slower ball nice and early, easing it from the crease through the gap at backward point for a second boundary. Rahul\u2019s turn, who makes it three fours behind point for the set, off the edge this time but the result is the same. 13 from the over making 0/43 from five for Cummins. 8th over: India 48-0 (Rohit 32, Rahul 10) Target 287. Hazlewood has started beautifully, Rohit kept quiet for the first half of the over then beaten by a beauty just outside the off-stump. He gets off strike to third man, leaving Rahul one delivery to deal with, which finds his inside edge. Hazlewood 2-0-0-2. It was tough to argue against him being left out of the World Cup squad (although I\u2019m sure that case will be made retrospectively; in fact, Michael Slater is doing it now) but he\u2019s issuing a timely reminder here that he has plenty to offer this white-ball team. 7th over: India 47-0 (Rohit 31, Rahul 10) Target 287. Between overs, they show the highlights of Rohit hitting his first ODI double ton, which came against Australia on this famous ground during that bombastic seven-game series in 2013. He\u2019s straight back on it here against Cummins, taking advantage of a ball on leg stump to clip four more behind square. The required rate is 5.6 - very comfortable. Meanwhile at Port Elizabeth, they are back on the field and Mark Wood is running amok with the home side following on. Follow that too, with Tanya Aldred. 6th over: India 39-0 (Rohit 25, Rahul 8) Target 287. Hazlewood is on to replace Starc and does just what his captain asks of him after a couple of expensive overs, hitting his length form the get-go and giving up just one single to finish the set. A good result, too, that it denied Rohit the strike to start the next over. The hosts will want their champion taking as many deliveries as possible while the field is up. 5th over: India 38-0 (Rohit 25, Rahul 7) Target 287. Ooh, that stings. It\u2019s hard to believe how, at Cummins\u2019 pace, a genuine edge from Rohit falls well short of Carey. Salt in the wounds: after that slice of luck, he picks up the final ball of the over from middle stump, lifting it over midwicket for his second SIX! What a shot. 4th over: India 31-0 (Rohit 19, Rahul 6) Target 287. Rohit is away! Granted, he\u2019s helped by Starc who twice gives the biffer loads of width to work with, the first of those poor balls slapped past point and the second lifted over third man for SIX! The mighty Chinnaswamy is jumping - definitely in my top few grounds in the world with those VFL Park-style lights. Starc bites back to finish with another delivery jagging back at Rohit, not to dissimilar the shout in his first over; a fraction shorter. But once again, a good decision by Umpire Gough. 3rd over: India 20-0 (Rohit 9, Rahul 5) Target 287. Cummins starts on that familiar length of his, banging away short of a length on the fourth stump line, but he falls away towards the end, spraying five wides down the legside then conceding a boundary through cover. To be fair, it\u2019s a lovely shot on the up, stroked expertly by KL Rahul - today, of course, in his third batting position across this short series. 2nd over: India 10-0 (Rohit 9, Rahul 0) Target 287. Oooh, that\u2019s a big shout for LBW! Starc is very keen but Carey less so when Finch consults him about a review. Michael Gough had the decision to make and went in Rohit\u2019s favour. The replay shows that it was the correct decision - just a fraction too much swing back to the righthander. But a good early sign for the left-armer. Less so the half-volley he serves up to finish, well outside the off-stump, put away with ease past point. 1st over: India 5-0 (Rohit 5, Rahul 0) Target 287. A steady start, Cummins clipped by Rohit to begin for a couple and then a couple more. The second of those strokes moves the opener beyond 9000 ODI runs in his 217th innings - the third fastest to that mark. What a career. If you\u2019re wondering, Kohli did it in 194 hits; ABdV 208. The players are back on the field. But Shikhar is not there - his left arm is in a sling after that shoulder injury, the commentary confirms. Rohit to take the first ball, to be sent down by Cummins. KL Rahul is out there with the Indian superstar. PLAY! What\u2019s it look like where I\u2019m doing this? Here\u2019s my kitchen. Due to the vagaries of international media rights, the only want I can watch is via an iPad, but it\u2019s working just fine. You\u2019ll see the big fitness ball in the background - that\u2019s for my partner, who is 37 weeks pregnant. If I run off suddenly at some stage during India\u2019s chase, you\u2019ll know why. Oh, let\u2019s talk, by the way. It\u2019s better that way. Thanks, Scott. Lovely stuff. I\u2019ve just heard that David Warner doesn\u2019t like playing off the front foot, Steve Smith doesn\u2019t have a \u201ctenth\u201d gear and Andrew Symonds\u2019 name dropped three times in three minutes. It must be Star\u2019s mid-innings show! After winning the toss, Australia might feel they under performed on a pitch that is used to producing more runs. Certainly, 26 fours and two sixes for the 50 overs looks a little on the lean side. Revealingly, Australia were helped along by an at-times errant India pace attack; 27 extras were recorded and just three batsmen could better this total. One of them was Steve Smith, who continued his love affair against India in this format with a ninth ODI century and first for three years. Smith put on 127 for the third wicket with Marnus Labuschagne, the only other Australia batter to really put pressure on India. Mohammed Shami was the most damaging bowler, returning 4-63, but the pick of the attack was a man who went wicketless, Jasprit Bumrah. Australia\u2019s score, just shy of 300, is by no means meagre, but they will have to bowl and field extremely well to limit India\u2019s dangerous batting line-up. Shikhar Dhawan is under a cloud after injuring his shoulder early in Australia\u2019s innings. There\u2019s no word yet if he\u2019s fit to bat, but India will fancy not needing him at all as they chase a series victory. That\u2019s all from me. Over to Adam Collins for the remainder of this match. 50th over: Australia 286-9 (Agar 11, Hazlewood 1) Agar and Hazlewood do their best to swell the total but just five runs and a wicket come from the final over of the innings. Shami returns 4-63, relatively expensive but his wickets were mostly timely. Shami has got it right in these concluding overs - full and straight - and if India weren\u2019t looking good before he returned to the attack, they are now. Zampa gets himself in tangles, misses and is bowled off his pads. 49th over: Australia 281-8 (Agar 8, Zampa 1) These two batsmen can do no more than work Bumrah around the ground for singles. Just five runs come from the paceman\u2019s last over, the penultimate of the innings, and it\u2019s far fewer than Australia need right now. Bumrah returns 0-38 from his 10 overs. Take away those successive fours hit by Smith, and it\u2019s 0-30 from 9.4 overs. But cricket doesn\u2019t really work like that, right? A brilliant yorker from Shami sneaks under Cummins\u2019 bat and shatters the stumps. That ball would\u2019ve accounted for batters far more accomplished that Cummins. Two wickets and three runs from the over. Well played, Shami. 48th over: Australia 276-8 (Agar 6, Zampa 0) Smith tries again to go over mid-wicket but this time he doesn\u2019t get his timing quite right and Iyer takes a very smart diving catch in the deep. A lovely 132-ball 131 from Smith, but Australia could\u2019ve done with him remaining in the middle. 47th over: Australia 273-6 (Smith 131, Agar 3) Bumrah return to the attack with two overs of his allotment remaining. Shame. I could watch this bloke bowl all day. Evidently so could Smith, who waits on a shortish one and edges it through tghe vacant slip cordon for four. He follows it up with a boundary through the covers. After conceding 25 runs from his first eight overs, Bumrah has leaked eight in two balls. Looks like Australia will land somewhere near that 300 mark. 46th over: Australia 261-6 (Smith 121, Agar 3) Saini\u2019s attempted yorker ends up being a low full-toss, inviting Smith to smack him backward of point for four. The shot of the day follows, a six that Smith picks up from outside off, flicks the wrists and sends over the deep mid-wicket fence. Incredible shot. How on earth did he do that? Well, he\u2019s Steve Smith. Sixteen from the over. Better from Australia but might it be too little, too late? 45th over: Australia 245-6 (Smith 106, Agar 2) A good over from Shami so late in the innings, restricting Australia to ones and twos. Just seven from the over and, frankly, they need to do far better than that. Even 10 an over from here still won\u2019t get them to 300. See below. Turner did indeed edge it! India launch a review after Turner swings and apparently misses. They\u2019re convinced he got bat on it and send the not-out call upstairs. Turner did indeed hit the ground with his bat, but technology, blessed technology, indicates he also bottom edged the ball en route to the keeper. On your way, son. 44th over: Australia 238-6 (Smith 101) Smith sends a thick edge down to third-man to register his ninth ODI century and first in three long years. Coming from 117 balls, it\u2019s been a steady knock and now Australia need him to step on the gas. More confused running between the wickets follows, with Smith setting off for a single but Turner knowing little about it. Despite both batsmen being almost at the same end at the same time, there\u2019s enough time for survival. 43rd over: Australia 234-5 (Smith 99, Turner 2) Smith is stranded on 99 but also stranded at the non-striker\u2019s end as Turner sees off five successive dot balls from Bumrah. A single off the last ball of the over keeps Turner on strike ... and Smith stranded on 99. And stranded at the non-striker\u2019s end. Aaaagh. The torment! Did I mention that Bumrah is bowling rather well? Kuldeep returns for his final over and at gets a wicket that his toil, if not his excellence, has deserved. Carey goes for the big shot over cover but it has no hope of clearing the rope, presenting Iyer with a straightforward catch. 42nd over: Australia 233-5 (Smith 99, Turner 1) 41st over: Australia 228-4 (Smith 96, Carey 34) Carey plays all around a straightish one from Shami but the ball misses the inside edge en route to the keeper. No such issues later in the over as the left hander gives himself room and cuts backward of point for four. 40th over: Australia 223-4 (Smith 95, Carey 30) The miserly Bumrah returns in place of Kuldeep. And it\u2019s more of the same from this man, whom India would love to clone. At least it is until his final delivery, short and wide of off-stump, which Carey edges down to third-man for four. Two runs from the first five balls, but six from the over. 39th over: Australia 217-4 (Smith 94, Carey 25) Saini strays down the leg-side, and you just don\u2019t do that to Steve Smith. A boundary to fine-leg takes Smith past 4,000 ODI runs ... and into the 90s. 38th over: Australia 210-4 (Smith 89, Carey 24) Sharp running from Carey turns Smith\u2019s punch through the covers into two runs, keeping Smith on strike and paving the way for him to crunch Kuldeep through point for four. Carey ends the over with a slog sweep, getting very little of it at all, and living to fight another day as the ball lands safely. 37th over: Australia 200-4 (Smith 82, Carey 21) Saini on for Bumrah. His first ball back is full, wide of off-stump and is given the required treatment by Carey, who drives through extra cover for four. A short one follows, and it really is too short, inviting Carey to help it on his way to the third-man fence. An update on Shikhar Dhawan: he\u2019s off to the hospital for an x-ray after that mishap in the field early in the game. 36th over: Australia 190-4 (Smith 81, Carey 12) Kuldeep returns for the expired Jadeja. A wrong\u2019un confuses Smith, underscoring how India have applied the shackles here. But Carey breaks them, or at least loosens them, with a sweep over mid-wicket for four. 35th over: Australia 183-4 (Smith 80, Carey 6) Another fine over from Bumrah, who again races through his six deliveries and again proves very hard to get away. An expert display of mixing line, length and pace and always keeping the batsman guessing. That\u2019s six overs now from Bumrah, with an economy rate of 3.0. Nice work. 34th over: Australia 181-4 (Smith 79, Carey 5) Carey reverse sweeps for four before trying the same again, missing despite India\u2019s suspicion that he might have edged it, and Jadeja\u2019s breathless spell comes to an end. And 2-44 is a good return. 33rd over: Australia 176-4 (Smith 78, Carey 1) Bumrah is back. Carey gets off the mark courtesy of an another overthrow from a direct hit. Three from the over. Just like London buses, we wait forever for a wicket and then two come at once. Starc, elevated to wield the willow, does what is asked of him but picks out a fielder in the deep. A double-wicket maiden for Jadeja. Not bad at all. 32nd over: Australia 173-4 (Smith 77) A very timely breakthrough for India as Labuschagne tries to press the matter but picks out Kohli, who takes a ripper of a catch low down at extra cover. Australia\u2019s 127-run stand for the third wicket comes to an end. Australia continue their period of consolidation and compilation, trading in ones and twos, but Labuschagne decides to notch his maiden ODI fifty in style, working Shami through mid-wicket for four. The Australia star is going at slightly worse than a run-a-ball and looks in good nick. 31st over: Australia 173-2 (Smith 77, Labuschagne 54) 30th over: Australia 165-2 (Smith 75, Labuschagne 48) Smith works Jadeja around the ground for ones and twos, Kohli helping the cause by taking an unnecessary shy at the stumps - which finds its target - but runs away for an overthrow. 29th over: Australia 158-2 (Smith 69, Labuschagne 47) Shami back in the attack now. His opening contribution brought a wicket but was expensive also. These two batsmen, well set now, will like the ball coming onto the bat. Labuschagne goes for it, eyeing the fence over mid-wicket, but mistimes his shot and gains only a single. Three from the over. A good return from Shami. 28th over: Australia 155-2 (Smith 67, Labuschagne 46) Sorry, was getting all wistful about Kylie and Jason and pretty much missed this over. Well, Jadeja does rip through them. Even moreso when all it produces is four nurdled singles. 27th over: Australia 151-2 (Smith 65, Labuschagne 44) Ooooh, Smith is one lucky customer! Charging down the pitch to Kuldeep, his expansive swat misses by miles and India look on, aghast, as the ball deflects off his leg and just wide of off-stump. It all happened too fast for Rahul, who could get nowhere near the ball. If he gloved it, a stumping was his. Four leg-byes is the net result. Lucky, lucky, lucky, Smith should be so lucky. 26th over: Australia 144-2 (Smith 64, Labuschagne 42) Jadeja continues, much to the liking of our reader in the post below. Smith has removed the helmet and is donning a bright yellow cap. Reminds me of Sir Viv Richards, in the loosest of loose ways. Four from the over. 25th over: Australia 140-2 (Smith 62, Labuschagne 40) Labuschagne sweeps but what should have been one run becomes two thanks to a fumble in the deep. Halfway through now. Are Australia on for 300-plus? Methinks so. Here\u2019s Abhijato Sensarma, who has a few good words to say about Jadeja: \u201cJadeja is one of the best players in the world, yet till recently even his own team neglected him. He\u2019s always been a streetsmart bowler and an epic fielder. The recent increase in productivity with the willow has re-established his worth as a premium all-rounder. This Indian ODI side always lacked quality batting in the lower order, but this changes with Jadeja\u2019s inclusion - it gives the top three much needed breathing room to play with more freedom. He needs to be in the playing eleven for a long time, he offers too much to be left out!\u201d 24th over: Australia 134-2 (Smith 60, Labuschagne 36) This outfield, I tells ya, is greased lightning. Smith\u2019s deft late cut off Jadeja is delicately hit, no more, but timed so well that is careers away to the third-man fence. Tell me more, tell me more ... Smith registers his fifty with a boundary to third man. Not his most convincing shot, but a boundary nonetheless. Smith\u2019s 25th ODI fifty consumed 63 balls. Now to capitalise and cash in, especially after his role in Finch\u2019s run-out. Labuschagne gets involved later in the over, clipping Saini past square for four. 23rd over: Australia 126-2 (Smith 54, Labuschagne 34) 22nd over: Australia 117-2 (Smith 49, Labuschagne 30) Jadeja\u2019s doing a nice job at limiting the run-rate. He\u2019s straight and neither full nor short, meaning both batsmen are finding it hard to get the spinner away. 21st over: Australia 114-2 (Smith 48, Labuschagne 28) Saini returns to the attack as Kuldeep is given a breather. Tandem spin worked OK for India, but didn\u2019t bring a breakthrough. And that is what they need now. Three runs from the over, including a hurriedly run single. These two, thankfully for Australia, are on the same page between the uprights. 20th over: Australia 111-2 (Smith 46, Labuschagne 27) Some good turn for Jadeja, who succeeds in finding Smith\u2019s outside edge. The result, however, isn\u2019t to India\u2019s liking, with slip beaten and the ball rolling away for four. Another edge ends the over but Labuschagne has enough downward pressure on the shot as Rohit collects the ball on the bounce at slip. 19th over: Australia 104-2 (Smith 40, Labuschagne 26) Kuldeep again, a lot straighter this time. Smith shuffles across his crease and is lucky - or just extremely good - that he gets bat on ball. Miss that and he is plumb. 18th over: Australia 100-2 (Smith 38, Labuschagne 24) Four runs from Jadeja\u2019s second over - a good start from him - with a single taking Australia into triple figures. Smith and his mate are starting to look rather comfortable out there. 17th over: Australia 96-2 (Smith 36, Labuschagne 22) You don\u2019t need pace on the ball when you get a delectable half-volley, and Smith fills his boots by driving Kuldeep down the ground for four. Shreyas made good ground to get his body to the ball, but it was travelling so fast that it ricochets off his thigh and to the fence. Labuschagne then gets involved, sweeping with intent for four. That\u2019s the fifty partnership for these two. 16th over: Australia 85-2 (Smith 31, Labuschagne 17) Possibly spin from both ends now as Jadeja replaces Bumrah. Both batsmen are watchful and can do little with the pace off the ball, adding just two runs to the total. It\u2019s frightfully hard to say who\u2019s on top here: another wicket and it\u2019s India, 20 more runs for these two and it\u2019s Australia. 15th over: Australia 83-2 (Smith 30, Labuschagne 16) Kuldeep keeps it tight, enticing an edge onto the pads of Smith before Pandey fields brilliantly at extra cover to deny Smith a boundary and cap a good over for India. 14th over: Australia 80-2 (Smith 29, Labuschagne 14) Bumrah returns to the fray and to good effect at that, keeping Australia to two singles and Labuschagne in two minds angling into the right hander off a good length. Smith looks in good touch. He\u2019ll be set for a big one after running out Finch. 13th over: Australia 78-2 (Smith 28, Labuschagne 13) Labuschagne does little more than nudge Kuldeep through the covers, but this outfield is like ice and the shot somehow has enough on it to find the rope. A wide follows - shrouded by a laughable appeal for caught behind - and this is another good over for the tourists. 12th over: Australia 69-2 (Smith 26, Labuschagne 7) Saini continues, straying ever so slightly onto Smith\u2019s pads and being clipped backward of square for four. The paceman\u2019s line doesn\u2019t improve much, ending the over with more leg-side drivel that is glanced for four more. 11th over: Australia 61-2 (Smith 18, Labuschagne 7) India go for spin. Kuldeep makes a solid start with a slip in place, restricting Australia to ones and twos. 10th over: Australia 56-2 (Smith 14, Labuschagne 6) A good over from Saini is spoiled on the last delivery by Labuschagne, who punches a half volley through the covers for four. The first power play is over. Advantage India. Here\u2019s that run-out. Doesn\u2019t look good for Australia, no matter which way you look at it. DRS Review! Saini traps Labushchagne on his crease, right in front, but the appeal falls on deaf ears. India like this one and send the decision upstairs. Yes, the ball is clipping the top of middle, but it\u2019s the umpire\u2019s call that matters in this instance. Not out! Oh. My. Lord. Mass confusion between the wickets - well, at first glace it looks like Smith has run out his skipper - as Smith nurdles one to backward point, Finch calls yes, Smith doesn\u2019t want a bar of it, Finch keeps running, Smith dives back in his crease ... all of which leaves Finch to make the long, inevitably futile, rush back to the non-striker\u2019s end. He\u2019s out by metres. And he is not happy. 9th over: Australia 50-2 (Smith 14, Labuschagne 0) 8th over: Australia 41-1 (Finch 19, Smith 6) Nice fielding from Kuldeep, whose lunging left hand turns Smith\u2019s on-drive from a certain boundary into a single. Two from the over. Here\u2019s that Finch six. Remarkable shot. Hand-eye coordination in living colour. 7th over: Australia 39-1 (Finch 18, Smith 5) Speaking of Shami, as we have been, he returns to the attack in place of Bumrah. Smith shuffles across his crease, as is his wont, giving himself more room for a leg glance, and is struck on the pads. A fair shout for leg before follows but is turned down. India consider reviewing it, but think better, likely thinking the ball was going over. The first six of the game follows, Finch clearing the long-off fence with what can only be described as a full-blooded whack. Good over for Australia. 6th over: Australia 28-1 (Finch 9, Smith 5) An early change with Saini on for the man with a \u20181\u2019 in the wicket column. And he hits the spot straight away, giving Finch plenty to think about with his movement off the seam. Speaking of Shami, here\u2019s his removal of Warner. 5th over: Australia 27-1 (Finch 8, Smith 5) Shikhar is nursing his left shoulder after diving to save a run in the covers. And it\u2019s bad enough for him to go off and have it looked at. Watch this space. A better over from Bumrah - and importantly no wides. Here\u2019s Nuggehalli Nigam: \u201cI think Kumble had a longer run up than Bumrah. Bumrah is a freak of nature, but a damn effective one.\u201d He sure is. And so was Kumble. He would\u2019ve been a nightmare to face. Basically a leg-spinning medium pacer. 4th over: Australia 26-1 (Finch 7, Smith 5) Precisely the breakthrough, and the scalp, India wanted. But enter Smith, who opens his account with a pulled boundary and enter more errant bowling, with Shami delivering another wide. Yep, there\u2019s something in the air tonight - well, movement in the air at least - and Warner is livid with himself after offering his willow to Shami and edging behind. In truth, it was a great delivery and Warner\u2019s shot was tepid, unsure and his footwork non-existent. 3rd over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 3, Finch 6) OK, did I miss the memo about starting overs with leg-side wides? Bumrah does precisely that, again, meaning each over has commenced this way. That triviality aside, Bumrah is having a torrid time controlling his line this over: that initial wide was followed immediately by another down the off-side and then another, back down leg, two balls later that raced all the way to the fence. 2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Warner 2, Finch 6) Not to be outdone, Shami also begins his spell with a leg-side wide. Next ball he overpitches to Finch and pays the price, the right hander driving exquisitely past mid-on for four. Singles follow, underlining how good these two are at rotating the strike. And ones and ones means fewer dot balls. Heard a lot about dot balls in the build-up to this game. 1st over: Australia 3-0 (Warner 1, Finch 1) Bumrah, off that wonderfully short run-up, starts with a leg-side wide. But thereafter there is no shortage of movement in the air and both batsmen struggle to find the middle, or indeed adapt to the pace of the pitch in the early stages. The pick of the over is a jaffer that beats the outside edge of Finch\u2019s bat. Good start from the India quick. Not long now... India will be brimming with confidence after their triumph is the second ODI, but Australia will not be wanting for self-belief. They have won nine of their past 10 ODIs in Asia and hold a slender edge against India in India in this format. And that is not to be sneezed at. It goes without saying, but I\u2019ll say it anyway: Finch and Warner will be looking for a big opening stand. And, yes, the sky is blue. The pitch, as predicted, does look an absolute belter. And here are the teams in full. \u201cIt looks like a bloody good wicket. We feel like we can put a good total on the board. We feel it will play well for 100 overs,\u201d said Australia captain Aaron Finch. Another lost toss for Virat Kohli! Whatever happened to the law of averages? Kohli doesn\u2019t sound fussed, however, and is predicting dew to be a factor later on. In fact, he sounds almost happy to be batting second. Team news: For Australia Josh Hazlewood comes in for Kane Richardson, who according to Finch is a bit sore. India are unchanged. Hello and welcome to the third, final and deciding ODI between India and Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. This brief series has produced a plethora of quality cricket, most notably with the bat, and on a pitch that traditionally favours those who hold the willow, we should expect lots of runs today. It\u2019s expected that Australia will field an unchanged XI but there are injury concerns for India with Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan under a cloud. Teams and toss will be soon.

      "body": "<p>Burnley came from behind to pick up their first points this year against an oddly unconvincing Leicester, who have lost two games in a row to opponents from the bottom half of the table.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team started well enough but in the second half in particular found Nick Pope an unbreachable last line of defence. The Burnley goalkeeper saved his side on at least three occasions, most notably in the 66th minute when he kept out a Jamie Vardy penalty that would have put Leicester 2-1 in front.</p> <p>\u201cNick didn\u2019t have a ridiculous amount to do but when he was called on he made some big saves,\u201d Sean Dyche said. \u201cWe\u2019d lost our previous four games and it\u2019s not easy when you go a goal down but we showed our character and it\u2019s great to get back to winning ways.\u201d</p> <p>Rodgers was annoyed about the winning goal \u2013 \u201ctheir desire to score was greater than our desire to stop it\u201d \u2013 but conceded Pope had been the key performer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take our chances and a lot of that was down to the goalkeeper,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big unit, he blocks a lot of the goal off and he made some amazing saves.\u201d</p> <p>Leicester could have taken the lead in the opening minute but for the Burnley-born Harvey Barnes shooting rather tamely at Pope. As soon as James Tarkowski sliced a clearance Leicester sent men streaming forward, and it was apparent from that early stage that if they were allowed to get anywhere near the Burnley penalty area James Maddison\u2019s passing and Vardy\u2019s movement would cause problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/19/burnley-v-leicester-premier-league-live\">Burnley 2-1 Leicester: Premier League \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After surviving a couple more scares from those two players Burnley were doing a good job of keeping Leicester safely pinned back in their own half until they were caught unprepared just before half-time. Dennis Praet dispossessed Jack Cork on the halfway line, bringing down the Burnley man as he did so, but while Cork and several of his teammates expected a free-kick Anthony Taylor waved play on and allowed Barnes to surge towards goal. With what remained of the Burnley defence retreating it was a relatively straightforward task for the winger to take the ball round Ben Mee and shoot past Pope.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e7fdafdfc62760b9b8eb9851d40067c1c8bd183\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e7fdafdfc62760b9b8eb9851d40067c1c8bd183/0_323_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Vardy reacts after his penalty is saved by Nick Pope.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Vardy reacts after his penalty is saved by Nick Pope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the second half commenced it produced enough goalmouth action in the first few minutes to banish memories of a featureless first half. Praet seemed certain to score when Maddison and Barnes found him a way into the penalty area, only for Pope to dive to his right to get a good hand to a well-struck shot. Then Burnley came down the field for Chris Wood to head over the bar from Charlie Taylor\u2019s cross, before Maddison almost scored at the other end with a shot from just outside the area.</p> <p>With Ashley Barnes out injured, Wood\u2019s aerial ability appeared to be Burnley\u2019s best hope of pulling a goal back, though when the equaliser arrived just before the hour it was Mee who met Dwight McNeil\u2019s corner with a header. Kasper Schmeichel got a hand to the ball but could do no more, allowing Wood to pounce for a close range tap-in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/19/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-live\">Liverpool v Manchester United: Premier League \u2013\u00a0live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No sooner had Burnley regained parity than they threatened to throw it away again when Mee was adjudged to have fouled Barnes in the area. The defender was at least guilty of a messy challenge that got nowhere close to the ball, and VAR backed the referee\u2019s decision to award a spot-kick. Pope came to his side\u2019s rescue again by diving to his left to reach the penalty with Ricardo Pereira shooting narrowly wide from the rebound.</p> <p>If it was unlike Vardy to fail from 12 yards, it was even stranger to see him pass up a perfect invitation from Kelechi Iheanacho a few minutes later, running behind the Burnley defence to reach a superbly weighted pass but managing to find Pope\u2019s chest instead of the usual target.</p> <p>The goalkeeper deserved credit for standing tall and his third notable save was followed almost immediately by Ashley Westwood\u2019s winner, the midfielder latching on to an ineffective clearance from Jonny Evans to score for the first time at Turf Moor.</p> <p>For showing more fight and purpose than their opponents in the second half it was probably what Burnley deserved, though without Pope\u2019s penalty save it might have been very different.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Burnley came from behind to pick up their first points this year against an oddly unconvincing Leicester, who have lost two games in a row to opponents from the bottom half of the table. Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team started well enough but in the second half in particular found Nick Pope an unbreachable last line of defence. The Burnley goalkeeper saved his side on at least three occasions, most notably in the 66th minute when he kept out a Jamie Vardy penalty that would have put Leicester 2-1 in front. \u201cNick didn\u2019t have a ridiculous amount to do but when he was called on he made some big saves,\u201d Sean Dyche said. \u201cWe\u2019d lost our previous four games and it\u2019s not easy when you go a goal down but we showed our character and it\u2019s great to get back to winning ways.\u201d Rodgers was annoyed about the winning goal \u2013 \u201ctheir desire to score was greater than our desire to stop it\u201d \u2013 but conceded Pope had been the key performer. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take our chances and a lot of that was down to the goalkeeper,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big unit, he blocks a lot of the goal off and he made some amazing saves.\u201d Leicester could have taken the lead in the opening minute but for the Burnley-born Harvey Barnes shooting rather tamely at Pope. As soon as James Tarkowski sliced a clearance Leicester sent men streaming forward, and it was apparent from that early stage that if they were allowed to get anywhere near the Burnley penalty area James Maddison\u2019s passing and Vardy\u2019s movement would cause problems. After surviving a couple more scares from those two players Burnley were doing a good job of keeping Leicester safely pinned back in their own half until they were caught unprepared just before half-time. Dennis Praet dispossessed Jack Cork on the halfway line, bringing down the Burnley man as he did so, but while Cork and several of his teammates expected a free-kick Anthony Taylor waved play on and allowed Barnes to surge towards goal. With what remained of the Burnley defence retreating it was a relatively straightforward task for the winger to take the ball round Ben Mee and shoot past Pope. When the second half commenced it produced enough goalmouth action in the first few minutes to banish memories of a featureless first half. Praet seemed certain to score when Maddison and Barnes found him a way into the penalty area, only for Pope to dive to his right to get a good hand to a well-struck shot. Then Burnley came down the field for Chris Wood to head over the bar from Charlie Taylor\u2019s cross, before Maddison almost scored at the other end with a shot from just outside the area. With Ashley Barnes out injured, Wood\u2019s aerial ability appeared to be Burnley\u2019s best hope of pulling a goal back, though when the equaliser arrived just before the hour it was Mee who met Dwight McNeil\u2019s corner with a header. Kasper Schmeichel got a hand to the ball but could do no more, allowing Wood to pounce for a close range tap-in. No sooner had Burnley regained parity than they threatened to throw it away again when Mee was adjudged to have fouled Barnes in the area. The defender was at least guilty of a messy challenge that got nowhere close to the ball, and VAR backed the referee\u2019s decision to award a spot-kick. Pope came to his side\u2019s rescue again by diving to his left to reach the penalty with Ricardo Pereira shooting narrowly wide from the rebound. If it was unlike Vardy to fail from 12 yards, it was even stranger to see him pass up a perfect invitation from Kelechi Iheanacho a few minutes later, running behind the Burnley defence to reach a superbly weighted pass but managing to find Pope\u2019s chest instead of the usual target. The goalkeeper deserved credit for standing tall and his third notable save was followed almost immediately by Ashley Westwood\u2019s winner, the midfielder latching on to an ineffective clearance from Jonny Evans to score for the first time at Turf Moor. For showing more fight and purpose than their opponents in the second half it was probably what Burnley deserved, though without Pope\u2019s penalty save it might have been very different.",

      "body": "<p>Unlikely as it may seem, #inflammation has become a hashtag. It seems to be everywhere suddenly, up to all sorts of tricks. Rather than simply being on our side, fighting infections and healing wounds, it turns out to have a dark side as well: the role it plays in causing us harm.</p> <p>It\u2019s now clear that inflammation is part of the problem in many, if not all, diseases of the body. And targeting immune or inflammatory causes of disease has led to a series of breakthroughs, from new treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and other auto-immune diseases in the 1990s, through to the advent of immunotherapy for some cancers in the 2010s. Even more pervasively, low-grade inflammation, detectable only by blood tests, is increasingly considered to be part of the reason why common life experiences such as poverty, stress, obesity or ageing are bad for public health.</p> <p>The brain is rapidly emerging as one of the new frontiers for inflammation. Doctors like myself, who went to medical school in the 20th century, were taught to think that there was an impermeable barrier between the brain and the immune system. In the 21st century, however, it has become clear that they are deeply interconnected and talk to each other all the time. Medical minds are now opening up to the idea that inflammation could be as widely and deeply implicated in brain and mind disorders as it is in bodily disorders.</p> <p>Advances in treatment of multiple sclerosis have shown the way. Many of the new medicines for MS were designed and proven to protect patients from brain damage caused by their own immune systems. The reasonably well-informed hope \u2013 and I emphasise those words at this stage \u2013 is that targeting brain inflammation could lead to breakthroughs in prevention and treatment of depression, dementia and psychosis on a par with the proven impact of immunological medicines for arthritis, cancer and MS. Indeed, a drug originally licensed for multiple sclerosis is already being tried as a possible <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03093064\" title=\"\">immune treatment</a> for schizophrenia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/13/joining-a-choir-helped-me-combat-anxiety-and-find-a-meditative-state-of-pure-joy\">Joining a choir helped me combat anxiety and find a meditative state of pure joy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is that hope realistic for depression? It is beyond reasonable doubt that inflammation and depression are correlated with each other \u2013 or <a href=\"https://acmedsci.ac.uk/file-download/82222577\" title=\"\">comorbid</a>, to use some unlovable but important medical jargon. The key scientific questions are about causation, not correlation. Does inflammation cause depression? And, if so, how? One experiment that scientists have designed to tackle these questions is to do two functional MRI brain scans, one before and one after an inflammatory response has been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19423079\" title=\"\">deliberately provoked</a> by the injection of typhoid vaccine. If there\u2019s a difference in the two scans, that shows that bodily inflammation can cause changes in the way the brain works; if not, that would be a problem for the theory that inflammation can cause depression.</p> <p>A recent meta-analysis reviewed data from 14 independent versions of this <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30067939\" title=\"\">experiment</a>. On average, the data showed a robust effect of inflammation on brain activity. These results confirmed that bodily inflammation can cause changes in how the brain works. Encouragingly, they also localised the effect of inflammation to particular parts of the brain that were already known to be involved in depression and many other psychiatric disorders.</p> <p>If inflammation can cause depression then anti-inflammatory drugs should work as antidepressants. Several <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-019-0471-8\" title=\"\">studies</a> have reviewed clinical trial data on thousands of patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and other bodily disorders that are commonly associated with depressive symptoms. Overall, patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, rather than a placebo, had significantly improved mental health scores. However, there is a caveat. The largest and most rigorous of these studies were designed to test drug effects on physical health and that makes it difficult to interpret the results too strongly as proof of beneficial effects on mental health.</p> <p>The next step is to run studies designed from the outset to test new anti-inflammatory drugs as antidepressants, or to test existing antidepressants for anti-inflammatory effects. In doing so, we must avoid repeating one of our most habitual mistakes about depression, which is thinking that it\u2019s all one thing, always with the same root cause. So we shouldn\u2019t be looking for the next \u201cblockbuster\u201d that can be automatically prescribed to make the whole world happier. We should be looking for ways to match the choice of treatment to the cause of psychiatric symptoms on a more personalised basis. And using blood tests to measure inflammation could help us to make those choices.</p> <p>For example, a consortium funded by the Wellcome Trust has just <a href=\"https://www.neuroimmunology.org.uk/\" title=\"\">started a trial</a> of a new anti-inflammatory drug for depression. It is one of the first antidepressant trials ever to use blood tests to screen for inflammation in potential participants. If the blood tests show no evidence of inflammation then patients will not be recruited into the trial, because if they are not inflamed, there is no reason to think they will benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.</p> <p>An alternative example might be ketamine, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/dec/19/ketamine-like-drug-depression-uk-licence-esketamine\">a form of which has just been licensed in the UK for treatment of depression</a>. It works by blocking a receptor for glutamate in the brain but it doesn\u2019t work equally well for everyone. We know that inflammation can increase the amount of glutamate in the brain, so it\u2019s predictable that more inflamed patients might be more responsive to the glutamate-blocking effects of ketamine.

      "bodyText": "Unlikely as it may seem, #inflammation has become a hashtag. It seems to be everywhere suddenly, up to all sorts of tricks. Rather than simply being on our side, fighting infections and healing wounds, it turns out to have a dark side as well: the role it plays in causing us harm. It\u2019s now clear that inflammation is part of the problem in many, if not all, diseases of the body. And targeting immune or inflammatory causes of disease has led to a series of breakthroughs, from new treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and other auto-immune diseases in the 1990s, through to the advent of immunotherapy for some cancers in the 2010s. Even more pervasively, low-grade inflammation, detectable only by blood tests, is increasingly considered to be part of the reason why common life experiences such as poverty, stress, obesity or ageing are bad for public health. The brain is rapidly emerging as one of the new frontiers for inflammation. Doctors like myself, who went to medical school in the 20th century, were taught to think that there was an impermeable barrier between the brain and the immune system. In the 21st century, however, it has become clear that they are deeply interconnected and talk to each other all the time. Medical minds are now opening up to the idea that inflammation could be as widely and deeply implicated in brain and mind disorders as it is in bodily disorders. Advances in treatment of multiple sclerosis have shown the way. Many of the new medicines for MS were designed and proven to protect patients from brain damage caused by their own immune systems. The reasonably well-informed hope \u2013 and I emphasise those words at this stage \u2013 is that targeting brain inflammation could lead to breakthroughs in prevention and treatment of depression, dementia and psychosis on a par with the proven impact of immunological medicines for arthritis, cancer and MS. Indeed, a drug originally licensed for multiple sclerosis is already being tried as a possible immune treatment for schizophrenia. Is that hope realistic for depression? It is beyond reasonable doubt that inflammation and depression are correlated with each other \u2013 or comorbid, to use some unlovable but important medical jargon. The key scientific questions are about causation, not correlation. Does inflammation cause depression? And, if so, how? One experiment that scientists have designed to tackle these questions is to do two functional MRI brain scans, one before and one after an inflammatory response has been deliberately provoked by the injection of typhoid vaccine. If there\u2019s a difference in the two scans, that shows that bodily inflammation can cause changes in the way the brain works; if not, that would be a problem for the theory that inflammation can cause depression. A recent meta-analysis reviewed data from 14 independent versions of this experiment. On average, the data showed a robust effect of inflammation on brain activity. These results confirmed that bodily inflammation can cause changes in how the brain works. Encouragingly, they also localised the effect of inflammation to particular parts of the brain that were already known to be involved in depression and many other psychiatric disorders. If inflammation can cause depression then anti-inflammatory drugs should work as antidepressants. Several studies have reviewed clinical trial data on thousands of patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and other bodily disorders that are commonly associated with depressive symptoms. Overall, patients treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, rather than a placebo, had significantly improved mental health scores. However, there is a caveat. The largest and most rigorous of these studies were designed to test drug effects on physical health and that makes it difficult to interpret the results too strongly as proof of beneficial effects on mental health. The next step is to run studies designed from the outset to test new anti-inflammatory drugs as antidepressants, or to test existing antidepressants for anti-inflammatory effects. In doing so, we must avoid repeating one of our most habitual mistakes about depression, which is thinking that it\u2019s all one thing, always with the same root cause. So we shouldn\u2019t be looking for the next \u201cblockbuster\u201d that can be automatically prescribed to make the whole world happier. We should be looking for ways to match the choice of treatment to the cause of psychiatric symptoms on a more personalised basis. And using blood tests to measure inflammation could help us to make those choices. For example, a consortium funded by the Wellcome Trust has just started a trial of a new anti-inflammatory drug for depression. It is one of the first antidepressant trials ever to use blood tests to screen for inflammation in potential participants. If the blood tests show no evidence of inflammation then patients will not be recruited into the trial, because if they are not inflamed, there is no reason to think they will benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment. An alternative example might be ketamine, a form of which has just been licensed in the UK for treatment of depression. It works by blocking a receptor for glutamate in the brain but it doesn\u2019t work equally well for everyone. We know that inflammation can increase the amount of glutamate in the brain, so it\u2019s predictable that more inflamed patients might be more responsive to the glutamate-blocking effects of ketamine. In future, we might use blood tests or biomarkers of inflammation to predict which depressed people are most likely to benefit from ketamine. The therapeutic scope of these new insights is potentially bigger than depression or drugs. The pharmaceutical and biotech industry is invested in testing anti-inflammatory drugs for Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. There is also interest in the role of diet, obesity, stress, gum disease, the gut microbiome and other risk factors in low-grade inflammation that could be controlled without drugs. There are now dozens of studies measuring the anti-inflammatory effects of psychological interventions, such as meditation or mindfulness, or lifestyle management programmes, diets or exercise regimes. My personal favourite is an American trial to test the idea that low-grade inflammation can accelerate cognitive impairment with ageing, and that cleaning our teeth more carefully can control low-grade gum inflammation (periodontitis) and thus protect us from senility as we grow older. This trial is still ongoing so the results are not yet known. But I like the thinking behind it. Who would have thought that a brighter smile and a better short-term memory could be so directly connected? And, ideally, attainable by an intervention as simple and scalable as a toothbrush? All of this gives us an interesting new perspective on how body, brain and mind are related to each other. And that could be important in thinking about how we scientifically design and deliver the most effective physical and mental healthcare systems for the future. This is vital at a time when mental health disorders and dementia account for a growing proportion of global disability, and health and social care costs. Currently, physical and mental health services are sharply segregated, reflecting a philosophical prejudice against viewing the mind and body as deeply intertwined.

More than that, though, it has the potential to transform our thinking about illness more broadly. The barrier between mind and body, for so long a dogmatic conviction, appears to be crumbling. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 February 2020 because an earlier version said that ketamine has just been licensed in the UK for treatment of depression.

The match-up would be a huge moneyspinner after their last fight, in October 2018, ended in acrimony and violence.

This is a massive fight with global appeal. It\u2019s the fight you make, it\u2019s the fight that makes sense. It\u2019s for the 155lbs title \u2026 Khabib is the fight to make. It\u2019s huge for Khabib\u2019s legacy, too. If he beat Conor McGregor, then he beats Tony Ferguson, then he beats Conor McGregor again, I mean this is how this kid, when he retires, he\u2019s 30-something-and-0 and he\u2019s beaten all of the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nurmagomedov is due to fight Tony Ferguson in April, and on Saturday McGregor hinted he did not want to wait while the Russian recovered from his next bout. </p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the \u2018who\u2019 matters,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThe who doesn\u2019t matter for me now.

I\u2019ll chill with my kids tomorrow. I\u2019ll show [my son] Junior the fight on the telly and see how he reacts. I\u2019ll see what he thinks of it. Then back to training.\u201d</p> \n<p>McGregor also expressed an interest in fighting Ferguson, welterweight Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, who he fought in two high-profile contests in 2016. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Nathan,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, brother.

      "bodyText": "Shortly after Conor McGregor had dispatched Donald Cerrone within 40 seconds in his UFC comeback on Saturday night, attention turned to the Irishman\u2019s next opponent. Dana White, the UFC president, was quick to talk up the prospect of a rematch with the undefeated lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. The match-up would be a huge moneyspinner after their last fight, in October 2018, ended in acrimony and violence. McGregor taunted his Russian opponent before that fight, and made negative references to his Muslim faith. Worse was to come when Nurmagomedov ended up brawling with some of his opponent\u2019s entourage after defeating the Irishman. Both men received suspensions and fines for their part in the tawdry scenes. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Hagler-Hearns,\u201d White said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at like Ali-Foreman, Ali-Frazier. This is a massive fight with global appeal. It\u2019s the fight you make, it\u2019s the fight that makes sense. It\u2019s for the 155lbs title \u2026 Khabib is the fight to make. It\u2019s huge for Khabib\u2019s legacy, too. If he beat Conor McGregor, then he beats Tony Ferguson, then he beats Conor McGregor again, I mean this is how this kid, when he retires, he\u2019s 30-something-and-0 and he\u2019s beaten all of the best.\u201d Nurmagomedov is due to fight Tony Ferguson in April, and on Saturday McGregor hinted he did not want to wait while the Russian recovered from his next bout. \u201cI don\u2019t think the \u2018who\u2019 matters,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThe who doesn\u2019t matter for me now. I\u2019m looking at dates now. I know March was there. I\u2019m going to have a look at a calendar and see where we\u2019re at \u2026 I\u2019ll be ready. I\u2019ll have a celebration tonight. I\u2019ll chill with my kids tomorrow. I\u2019ll show [my son] Junior the fight on the telly and see how he reacts. I\u2019ll see what he thinks of it. Then back to training.\u201d McGregor also expressed an interest in fighting Ferguson, welterweight Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz, who he fought in two high-profile contests in 2016. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Nathan,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cLet\u2019s go, brother. [Fight] number three is always here. We\u2019re right here, Nathan.\u201d There could also be a move away from mixed martial arts. After Saturday\u2019s bout, Floyd Mayweather posted a fake promotional advert for a rematch of their 2017 boxing fight. That contest earned both men tens of millions of dollars, even though the quality of boxing on show was debatable.

In a rebuff to critics of her granddaughter-in-law, the Queen added that she was \u201cparticularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family\u201d.</p> <p>In new arrangements that will take effect from an unspecified date in the spring, the Sussexes will \u201cstep back\u201d from royal duties and Harry will not conduct any further official military appointments.</p> <h2>Can they still brand themselves Sussex Royal?</h2> <p>The new <a href=\"http://sussexroyal.com/\">sussexroyal.com</a> website was launched last week. A personal message posted on Saturday suggests some refining. It reads: \u201cIn line with the statement by Her Majesty the Queen, information on the roles and work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be updated on this website in due course.\u201d</p> <p>It had referred to \u201ctheir Royal Highnesses\u201d. But Harry and Meghan have agreed not to use their HRH titles even though they technically retain them.</p> <p>Now no longer working members of the royal family, who will no longer formally represent the Queen, it remains to be seen if they will retain the Sussex Royal brand name and monogram of crown above an entwined H&amp;M. They have already trademarked Sussex Royal for use for up to 100 items.</p> <h2>How will they be funded?</h2> <p>The couple will give up the sovereign grant they receive from the public purse and say they want to become \u201cfinancially independent\u201d. In the short term at least, while they work towards this, they will continue to be privately financially supported by the Prince of Wales.</p> <p>They will also repay the \u00a32.4m in public money used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage, the Windsor mansion they moved into nine months ago.</p> <h2>What does it mean for the remaining royals?</h2> <p>The royal family has now lost four senior working royals. The Duke of Edinburgh, 98, retired in 2017. The Duke of York stepped down from royal duties in November following his disastrous Newsnight interview about his relationship with the financier and convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Now the Sussexes\u2019 star power is also gone.</p> <p>It means extra workload for remaining core royals. All indications are that Prince Charles wanted a slimmed down monarchy, but clearly thought up until now Harry and Meghan would be part of it.</p> <p>The spotlight on the Sussexes will not diminish, regardless of their geographical location. But requiring them not to use their HRH styles, and not allowing them to carry out duties on behalf of the Queen, prevents any official rival royal court.</p> <p>The blueprint has implications for young royals in future, including Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the Cambridge\u2019s youngest two children.</p> <h2>Who will foot their security costs?</h2> <p>Buckingham Palace does not comment on security matters. But it did say: \u201cThere are well-established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security.\u201d</p> <p>Until now, the Sussexes have received armed personal protection from the Metropolitan police at taxpayers\u2019 expense. But they are no longer working royals, which may influence what taxpayer-funded security they are entitled to.</p> <p>Harry and Meghan intend to live mainly in Canada. This would have financial implications for any security provided by the Met. Any property they reside in would also require advanced security measures.</p> <p>If British taxpayers are no longer required to pay, one option is for Canadian taxpayers to bear the burden. This is not likely to go down well. Another is for the couple to pay for themselves, through money provided by the Prince of Wales.</p>",

The Queen said in a statement that this \u201cconstructive and supportive way forward\u201d would allow the Sussexes \u201cto start building a happy and peaceful new life\u201d. In a rebuff to critics of her granddaughter-in-law, the Queen added that she was \u201cparticularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family\u201d. In new arrangements that will take effect from an unspecified date in the spring, the Sussexes will \u201cstep back\u201d from royal duties and Harry will not conduct any further official military appointments. Can they still brand themselves Sussex Royal? The new sussexroyal.com website was launched last week. A personal message posted on Saturday suggests some refining. It reads: \u201cIn line with the statement by Her Majesty the Queen, information on the roles and work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be updated on this website in due course.\u201d It had referred to \u201ctheir Royal Highnesses\u201d. But Harry and Meghan have agreed not to use their HRH titles even though they technically retain them. Now no longer working members of the royal family, who will no longer formally represent the Queen, it remains to be seen if they will retain the Sussex Royal brand name and monogram of crown above an entwined H&amp;M. They have already trademarked Sussex Royal for use for up to 100 items. How will they be funded? The couple will give up the sovereign grant they receive from the public purse and say they want to become \u201cfinancially independent\u201d. In the short term at least, while they work towards this, they will continue to be privately financially supported by the Prince of Wales. They will also repay the \u00a32.4m in public money used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage, the Windsor mansion they moved into nine months ago. What does it mean for the remaining royals? The royal family has now lost four senior working royals. The Duke of Edinburgh, 98, retired in 2017. The Duke of York stepped down from royal duties in November following his disastrous Newsnight interview about his relationship with the financier and convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Now the Sussexes\u2019 star power is also gone. It means extra workload for remaining core royals. All indications are that Prince Charles wanted a slimmed down monarchy, but clearly thought up until now Harry and Meghan would be part of it. The spotlight on the Sussexes will not diminish, regardless of their geographical location. But requiring them not to use their HRH styles, and not allowing them to carry out duties on behalf of the Queen, prevents any official rival royal court. The blueprint has implications for young royals in future, including Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the Cambridge\u2019s youngest two children. Who will foot their security costs? Buckingham Palace does not comment on security matters. But it did say: \u201cThere are well-established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security.\u201d Until now, the Sussexes have received armed personal protection from the Metropolitan police at taxpayers\u2019 expense. But they are no longer working royals, which may influence what taxpayer-funded security they are entitled to. Harry and Meghan intend to live mainly in Canada. This would have financial implications for any security provided by the Met. Any property they reside in would also require advanced security measures. If British taxpayers are no longer required to pay, one option is for Canadian taxpayers to bear the burden. This is not likely to go down well. Another is for the couple to pay for themselves, through money provided by the Prince of Wales.",

It\u2019s a fictional biography of one Elsa Weiss, an aloof but admired English teacher at a Tel Aviv high school who jumped to her death from the roof of her apartment building.

Creating new work in the same trailblazing spirit feels like the next natural step. The result is an invigorating, filmic fusion of sometimes disparate influences that rattles along at a lively clip. Cellist Rudi de Groote\u2019s overture begins with bongos and tubular bells before resolving into a waltz that morphs into a widescreen reel, while fiddler Patsy Reid pitches pipers against jazzy offbeat brass stabs to create a highly danceable hybrid. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/15/capercaillie-at-the-heart-review\">Capercaillie vocalist Karen Matheson</a> cameos to sing a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n3OUFaa_Ag&amp;feature=youtu.be\">new arrangement of Oran do Loch Lall</a>, a soothing detour before the Declaration\u2019s centrepiece: an expansive fanfare section composed by fiddler Chris Stout and harpist Catriona McKay that picks up momentum like a runaway train and features the poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/16/liz-lochhead-interview-you-re-stuck-writing-something-until-you-go-to-hell-with-it\">Liz Lochhead</a> defining this declaration as a statement of \u201cwhat you stand for, and what you will not stand for\u201d.</p> <p>Fraser Fifield\u2019s atmospheric penultimate section features actor David Hayman booming over the PA before some evocative trumpet and flute solos. Then saxophonist Paul Towndrow brings it all home with a brass-heavy, swaggering big-band ending. After the interval, the orchestra revisits some of its persuasive Bennett remixes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSRHpA2giUk&amp;feature=youtu.be\">including the crowd favourite Blackbird</a> \u2013 an ingenious melding of Latin chanting and traditional folk \u2013 and a thumping rendition of the reliable floor-filler Chanter. As declarations go, it is a compelling one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cd4c26f04fc709102c85c139c77d0f375a6b82f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cd4c26f04fc709102c85c139c77d0f375a6b82f/1138_195_3220_1932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virtuosity \u2026 B\u00e9la Fleck and Abigail Washburn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virtuosity \u2026 B\u00e9la Fleck and Abigail Washburn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sterling Munksgard/Zuma Press/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Compared with the mob-handed Grit Orchestra, US husband-and-wife banjo duo B\u00e9la Fleck and Abigail Washburn offer a more stripped-down experience, interspersing their synchronised playing with slyly timed comic asides. The celebrated veteran Fleck manages to be both virtuosic and impressively laid-back, his fingers flying over his instrument as he blends classical etudes with twangier moonshine workouts. Washburn\u2019s trump card is her singing voice, exquisite on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R0WOzAVlv4&amp;feature=youtu.be\">vintage protest song Come All You Coal Miners</a> and the quavering <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJIfyrP7oRI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Take Me to Harlan</a>. For their encore, the pair lead the crowd in an a capella singalong of Keys to the Kingdom while their six-year-old son snaps his fingers and shyly shows off some dance moves.

Since debuting at Celtic Connections in 2015, this 80-strong band of strings, woodwind, percussion, pipers and vocalists has reinterpreted Bennett\u2019s music to boisterous effect. Creating new work in the same trailblazing spirit feels like the next natural step. The result is an invigorating, filmic fusion of sometimes disparate influences that rattles along at a lively clip. Cellist Rudi de Groote\u2019s overture begins with bongos and tubular bells before resolving into a waltz that morphs into a widescreen reel, while fiddler Patsy Reid pitches pipers against jazzy offbeat brass stabs to create a highly danceable hybrid. Capercaillie vocalist Karen Matheson cameos to sing a new arrangement of Oran do Loch Lall, a soothing detour before the Declaration\u2019s centrepiece: an expansive fanfare section composed by fiddler Chris Stout and harpist Catriona McKay that picks up momentum like a runaway train and features the poet Liz Lochhead defining this declaration as a statement of \u201cwhat you stand for, and what you will not stand for\u201d. Fraser Fifield\u2019s atmospheric penultimate section features actor David Hayman booming over the PA before some evocative trumpet and flute solos. Then saxophonist Paul Towndrow brings it all home with a brass-heavy, swaggering big-band ending. After the interval, the orchestra revisits some of its persuasive Bennett remixes, including the crowd favourite Blackbird \u2013 an ingenious melding of Latin chanting and traditional folk \u2013 and a thumping rendition of the reliable floor-filler Chanter. As declarations go, it is a compelling one. Compared with the mob-handed Grit Orchestra, US husband-and-wife banjo duo B\u00e9la Fleck and Abigail Washburn offer a more stripped-down experience, interspersing their synchronised playing with slyly timed comic asides. The celebrated veteran Fleck manages to be both virtuosic and impressively laid-back, his fingers flying over his instrument as he blends classical etudes with twangier moonshine workouts. Washburn\u2019s trump card is her singing voice, exquisite on the vintage protest song Come All You Coal Miners and the quavering Take Me to Harlan. For their encore, the pair lead the crowd in an a capella singalong of Keys to the Kingdom while their six-year-old son snaps his fingers and shyly shows off some dance moves. Perhaps Storm has some competition for breakout festival star after all. \u2022 At various venues, Glasgow, until 2 February. *A previous version of the article noted the Sea Goddess statue as being 10-foot.

      "bodyText": "Cameron Norrie does not lack for heart or self-belief but it is difficult to see him getting out of the first round at the Australian Open against the inventive Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert on Monday. As hard as he tried for Great Britain in the inaugural ATP Cup in Sydney last week he struggled when confronted with quality shots coming back at his steady stream of ground strokes. If Herbert has a strength it is the ability to change tack in an instant. A soft-handed doubles specialist with a singles ranking of 64, he is sharp and intelligent anywhere near the net and patient near the baseline. Still, Norrie was in upbeat mood on Sunday when looking back on an indifferent week in Sydney, where he lost to an inspired Nick Kyrgios and the experienced Steve Darcis, and had decent wins over lesser lights, Moldova\u2019s Alexander Cozbinov (810 in the world) and the Bulgarian world No 323, Dimitar Kuzmanov. \u201cI had a great pre-season,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel really fit and strong. I had a tough start to the year in the ATP Cup. Auckland was tough, not being able to defend after making the final last year. That was difficult. I am playing a lot better than I was last year, which is good, I am just not getting the results. Hopefully I can make a run here and we will see.\u201d The run needs starting blocks \u2013 and Herbert will be disinclined to make it easy for Norrie, who remembers him from a qualifying match three years ago in Vienna. \u201cHe\u2019s a tricky player. It will be good ... What style? He is pretty aggressive, likes to come forward, serve and volley a lot. He can be pretty solid from the ground as well. I need to focus on what I can do and go out there and compete.\u201d There is nothing complicated about Norrie\u2019s tennis. He makes a consistent effort to lengthen the exchanges until he is ready to properly go for a winner but it just did not happen for him in Sydney. He took great heart from the experience, especially from his talks with Dan Evans, whose career has shown an encouraging upward graph since he took Roger Federer to two tie-breaks in the second round in Melbourne a year ago. Evans, Britain\u2019s top-ranked player in the continuing and worrying absence of Andy Murray, plays the American Mackenzie McDonald, while Kyle Edmund opens against Dusan Lajovic, so impressive for the winning Serbia team in the ATP Cup. Norrie says of Evans: \u201cHe has always been an unbelievable player and I am happy he has got everything together with the competitiveness, getting to this level. Everybody knew he could play at such a good level. So it\u2019s nice to see him taking that confidence, getting a lot of wins. \u201cHe got a career high the other day, which was sick to see. Hopefully he can push the other Brits along. I practise with him a lot and we always have competitive sets. I spend a lot of time with him on the Tour. I\u2019d pick his brains on certain things. He is pretty knowledgeable about the game. I will use his experience to try to follow after him.\u201d The idea of Evans being a mentor would have been viewed sceptically a few years ago but he is a changed man. He has ridden his rediscovered game intelligently, grinding down opponents with his wicked backhand slice, and is keen to get in behind his serve if it lands well. Those attacking instincts came to the fore in Great Britain\u2019s brief time with Tim Henman, as Norrie acknowledged. \u201cI liked it a lot. There was a lot of noise, a good atmosphere. For me it was difficult to bring my level. There were a lot of distractions to me but I really liked the event, to have the team atmosphere. When I lost a match, the team got me through it.

Footage emerged this weekend of a suspected US government car having to brake sharply while driving on the wrong side of the road close to RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Northamptonshire police also revealed details of a separate incident in which one of their vehicles was struck by a car being driven on the wrong side of the road in October. Speaking on Sunday at a world leaders\u2019 summit in Berlin, Johnson said he would raise with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the driving habits of US staff at RAF Croughton, a communications base for the US Air Force. He told Sky News: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly raising all those issues, about the driving habits of US personnel at the base, and we\u2019re continuing to work for justice for Harry Dunn and for his family.\u201d The UK has been locked in diplomatic stalemate with the US over the case of 19-year-old Dunn, who was killed in a head-on collision near RAF Croughton on 27 August last year.

However, she claimed diplomatic immunity after the collision and fled back to the US. She has since refused to return to face justice despite pleas from Dunn\u2019s family. The Home Office has requested that Sacoolas be sent back to the UK to face trial but the US state department has said the UK extradition request is highly inappropriate. Concerns surrounding the driving of US diplomatic staff at the military base re-emerged this weekend with footage of a blue BMW, bearing what appears to be a US diplomatic registration plate, driving on the wrong side of the road. Nick Adderley, the Northamptonshire police chief constable, has demanded an urgent meeting with the commander of the base and said \u201cthese incidents just cannot keep happening\u201d.

      "body": "<p>I stepped into the glass-walled yoga shala and stared at the impressive rugged valley outside. It took me a second to realise I wasn\u2019t alone. Vonetta Winter, teacher and co-owner of the centre, was sitting on a mat in cross-legged meditation \u2013 and I swear I could see a Ready Brek glow of peace around her. It was the start of a yoga and sleep retreat at Vale de Moses in the mountains of central Portugal, and I relaxed. This place had a good vibe. Maybe this really would be the final chapter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/16/how-i-finally-learned-to-sleep-insomnia\">in my 20-year story of insomnia.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-16T17:33:23.html\" data-alt=\"Portugal map showing capital, Porto and Vale de Moses yoga retreat location.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jan/2020-01-16T17:33:23.html\">Portugal map showing capital, Porto and Vale de Moses yoga retreat location.</a> </figure>  <p>As one of the 30% of people in developed countries grappling with chronic sleeplessness, and having tried endless \u201ccures\u201d, unsuccessfully, I had a breakthrough last year using an online course (<a href=\"https://sleepforlife.com/\" title=\"\">sleepforlife.com</a>). Now, instead of suffering every night, I found myself awake at 4am with an over-active mind only once or twice a week. Would Vale de Moses give me a way of conquering those remaining too-early mornings?</p> <p>The day had started at 7.30am with \u201cmorning silence\u201d followed by a walking meditation. Next was yoga, with Vonetta, now smiling broadly, inviting us into gentle asanas (yoga poses), sensitive to the already evident heat of the day. Two hours later, breakfast included a cauldron of brown rice porridge \u2013 on subsequent days it was quinoa, buckwheat or oats \u2013 and another of fruit salad. There were pots of linseed, wheatgerm and maca to sprinkle on top, and vast jugs of homemade smoothies.</p> <p>Yoga forms the basis of all Vale de Moses retreats, with five two-hour morning classes, then afternoon sessions of either more yoga or themed workshops and time to relax. On the yoga and sleep retreat, Vonetta teams up with Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, a neurophysiologist, former insomniac and author of three books on sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s a common problem for perfectionists,\u201d she told us at the first session. There were 17 of us, mostly European, including six from the UK, and among us were a GP and a fertility doctor. Only two were men.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c1297c9f324bd8d05deaebc6ac5d326c9c975cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1297c9f324bd8d05deaebc6ac5d326c9c975cf1/0_0_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vale de Moses in wooded hills\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vale de Moses has expansive, soul-soothing views</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nerina outlined what I already knew about \u201csleep hygiene\u201d \u2013 getting up at the same time every day, not looking at the clock if you wake \u2013 but I was listening hard for any new bits of advice. She suggested counting breaths, so I tried it that night, but every time I was dropping off my perfectionist brain kicked in to work out what number I\u2019d got to. My accommodation was conducive to a good night\u2019s shut-eye: I was in one of the retreat\u2019s homely single rooms (with amazing views when you\u2019re awake). Most of the others were sharing in open-plan stone cottages with outdoor showers or in bell tents in the forest.</p> <p> Our ability to sleep, said Nerina at the next session, is related to eating well, exercising, and looking after our mental and emotional health. She talked about the need to slow our central nervous system, especially in a switched-on world that overloads our brains. Now I was paying attention \u2013 sometimes I feel I have so much to remember my brain aches.</p> <p>Nerina suggested herbs, homoeopathy, flower remedies and sleep teas, most of which were available at the retreat. (This actually went against the programme that had helped me, which emphasises not using external remedies but building confidence in the body\u2019s natural ability to sleep.) Overstimulation was a fact of modern living, and many people needed help to combat the effects, she added.</p> <p> The programme includes a choice of massage: I opted for aromatherapy, assuming it would be pleasant but too delicate to deal with the knots in my back. So I was surprised to find that this gentle treatment both triggered sadness over the end of a relationship I hadn\u2019t realised I was still mourning \u2013 and that my tears did in fact loosen my back.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c53e5cd3bac29e343f6e4f6de8f1fe7a1b32cf5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c53e5cd3bac29e343f6e4f6de8f1fe7a1b32cf5f/0_0_2736_2736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orange green and yellow salads on plate\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vegan cuisine is inventive and colourful</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Days were punctuated by long, colourful vegan and mostly gluten-free lunches, by chef and <a href=\"http://www.allyouneedisveg.de/\" title=\"\">All You Need is Veg</a> founder, Yuki Jung. Each day was themed on a different world cuisine and included inventive dishes such as aubergine ceviche, \u201clasagne\u201d using layers of courgette, pad thai salad with mango and peanut sauce, chickpea poppadoms and tandoori cauliflower.</p> <p>There was lots of free time to explore the valley, take dips in the plunge pool or swim in one of several natural pools. Further afield, there were walking trails and, if you had a car, cities \u2013 Porto, Lisbon, Tomar (founded by the Knights Templar), or the country\u2019s former capital, Coimbra, all within three hours\u2019 drive. But nobody had the urge to escape. The point was to slow down, immerse ourselves in nature and spend time alone.</p> <p>I left feeling peaceful and nourished but still having woken early on several mornings. Back home, I continued musing over alternative treatments, eventually turning to a cranio-sacral therapist. Crucially, I wasn\u2019t, I decided, seeking something to help me sleep. I was, as Nerina had recommended, \u201csupporting my central nervous system\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"964e7951b8a471dd10fab389bf839441b83492d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/964e7951b8a471dd10fab389bf839441b83492d1/0_322_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Edgley at window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate enjoys the view from her room at Vale de Moses</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Edgley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only a few of us on the retreat had come specifically for the sleep element \u2013 most had picked Vale de Moses for its yoga, stunning setting and the kindness with which it\u2019s run. Helen, a 32-year-old software engineer from New Zealand, who described herself as a \u201cconsistently bad sleeper\u201d because of anxiety and constant travelling, said Nerina\u2019s sessions had made her less anxious about poor sleep: \u201cWhen she told us that you sleep when you feel safe, that was very reassuring. It made me realise I could be a better sleeper \u2013 it gave me faith back.\u201d</p> <p>Faith \u2013 in the body\u2019s innate ability to sleep \u2013 was the very thing I\u2019d fought so hard to gain. Could I now try cranio-sacral therapy without it undermining the belief that I didn\u2019t need anything external in order to sleep? Such mind-bending games are key to both triggering and combating insomnia and so, with Vale de Moses scoring high on the faith count generally, I trusted the advice and took the plunge. Two months later, I found myself in a rhythm of regular seven-hour nights, several of 10 hours and not a single 4am waking.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The trip was provided by <a href=\"https://www.valedemoses.com/yoga-retreats/yoga-sleep-retreat-august-30-2020\" title=\"\">Vale de Moses</a>; the next yoga and sleep retreat runs from 30 August-5 September</em><em>, </em><em>from \u20ac960pp</em><em> in a bell</em><em> tent, \u20ac1,050 for a bed in a shared open-plan </em><em>co</em><em>ttage</em><em> or \u20ac1,380 for a single room in the farmhouse, including all food and drink, classes, one massage </em><em>and transfers </em><em>from Oleiros</em></p> <p><strong>Looking for a holiday with a difference?

      "bodyText": "I stepped into the glass-walled yoga shala and stared at the impressive rugged valley outside. It took me a second to realise I wasn\u2019t alone. Vonetta Winter, teacher and co-owner of the centre, was sitting on a mat in cross-legged meditation \u2013 and I swear I could see a Ready Brek glow of peace around her. It was the start of a yoga and sleep retreat at Vale de Moses in the mountains of central Portugal, and I relaxed. This place had a good vibe. Maybe this really would be the final chapter in my 20-year story of insomnia. As one of the 30% of people in developed countries grappling with chronic sleeplessness, and having tried endless \u201ccures\u201d, unsuccessfully, I had a breakthrough last year using an online course (sleepforlife.com). Now, instead of suffering every night, I found myself awake at 4am with an over-active mind only once or twice a week. Would Vale de Moses give me a way of conquering those remaining too-early mornings? The day had started at 7.30am with \u201cmorning silence\u201d followed by a walking meditation. Next was yoga, with Vonetta, now smiling broadly, inviting us into gentle asanas (yoga poses), sensitive to the already evident heat of the day. Two hours later, breakfast included a cauldron of brown rice porridge \u2013 on subsequent days it was quinoa, buckwheat or oats \u2013 and another of fruit salad. There were pots of linseed, wheatgerm and maca to sprinkle on top, and vast jugs of homemade smoothies. Yoga forms the basis of all Vale de Moses retreats, with five two-hour morning classes, then afternoon sessions of either more yoga or themed workshops and time to relax. On the yoga and sleep retreat, Vonetta teams up with Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, a neurophysiologist, former insomniac and author of three books on sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s a common problem for perfectionists,\u201d she told us at the first session. There were 17 of us, mostly European, including six from the UK, and among us were a GP and a fertility doctor. Only two were men. Nerina outlined what I already knew about \u201csleep hygiene\u201d \u2013 getting up at the same time every day, not looking at the clock if you wake \u2013 but I was listening hard for any new bits of advice. She suggested counting breaths, so I tried it that night, but every time I was dropping off my perfectionist brain kicked in to work out what number I\u2019d got to. My accommodation was conducive to a good night\u2019s shut-eye: I was in one of the retreat\u2019s homely single rooms (with amazing views when you\u2019re awake). Most of the others were sharing in open-plan stone cottages with outdoor showers or in bell tents in the forest. Our ability to sleep, said Nerina at the next session, is related to eating well, exercising, and looking after our mental and emotional health. She talked about the need to slow our central nervous system, especially in a switched-on world that overloads our brains. Now I was paying attention \u2013 sometimes I feel I have so much to remember my brain aches. Nerina suggested herbs, homoeopathy, flower remedies and sleep teas, most of which were available at the retreat. (This actually went against the programme that had helped me, which emphasises not using external remedies but building confidence in the body\u2019s natural ability to sleep.) Overstimulation was a fact of modern living, and many people needed help to combat the effects, she added. The programme includes a choice of massage: I opted for aromatherapy, assuming it would be pleasant but too delicate to deal with the knots in my back. So I was surprised to find that this gentle treatment both triggered sadness over the end of a relationship I hadn\u2019t realised I was still mourning \u2013 and that my tears did in fact loosen my back. Days were punctuated by long, colourful vegan and mostly gluten-free lunches, by chef and All You Need is Veg founder, Yuki Jung. Each day was themed on a different world cuisine and included inventive dishes such as aubergine ceviche, \u201clasagne\u201d using layers of courgette, pad thai salad with mango and peanut sauce, chickpea poppadoms and tandoori cauliflower. There was lots of free time to explore the valley, take dips in the plunge pool or swim in one of several natural pools. Further afield, there were walking trails and, if you had a car, cities \u2013 Porto, Lisbon, Tomar (founded by the Knights Templar), or the country\u2019s former capital, Coimbra, all within three hours\u2019 drive. But nobody had the urge to escape. The point was to slow down, immerse ourselves in nature and spend time alone. I left feeling peaceful and nourished but still having woken early on several mornings. Back home, I continued musing over alternative treatments, eventually turning to a cranio-sacral therapist. Crucially, I wasn\u2019t, I decided, seeking something to help me sleep. I was, as Nerina had recommended, \u201csupporting my central nervous system\u201d. Only a few of us on the retreat had come specifically for the sleep element \u2013 most had picked Vale de Moses for its yoga, stunning setting and the kindness with which it\u2019s run. Helen, a 32-year-old software engineer from New Zealand, who described herself as a \u201cconsistently bad sleeper\u201d because of anxiety and constant travelling, said Nerina\u2019s sessions had made her less anxious about poor sleep: \u201cWhen she told us that you sleep when you feel safe, that was very reassuring. It made me realise I could be a better sleeper \u2013 it gave me faith back.\u201d Faith \u2013 in the body\u2019s innate ability to sleep \u2013 was the very thing I\u2019d fought so hard to gain. Could I now try cranio-sacral therapy without it undermining the belief that I didn\u2019t need anything external in order to sleep? Such mind-bending games are key to both triggering and combating insomnia and so, with Vale de Moses scoring high on the faith count generally, I trusted the advice and took the plunge. Two months later, I found myself in a rhythm of regular seven-hour nights, several of 10 hours and not a single 4am waking. \u2022 The trip was provided by Vale de Moses; the next yoga and sleep retreat runs from 30 August-5 September, from \u20ac960pp in a bell tent, \u20ac1,050 for a bed in a shared open-plan cottage or \u20ac1,380 for a single room in the farmhouse, including all food and drink, classes, one massage and transfers from Oleiros Looking for a holiday with a difference?

Residents in the Yorkshire village of Skipsea were told this week that more than 20 homes were at risk of falling into the North Sea in the next 12 months, with hundreds vulnerable in the coming decades. Parts of the 52-mile east Yorkshire coast are disappearing much faster than forecast. Rising sea levels and more frequent storms brought on by the global climate emergency have accelerated the erosion. Councillors will this week urge ministers to treat coastal erosion as a natural catastrophe like flooding, saying that there is a lack of national guidance and funding to help tackle the issue. Jane Evison, a councillor on East Riding council, said families whose homes were at imminent risk of sliding into the sea were liable to pay the full cost of demolishing their property and for their relocation. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) provides up to \u00a36,000 in retrospective funding towards the cost of demolishing each property, but Evison said the total bill was at least double that. \u201cThe\u2019ve lost their home and the legal responsibility is on them \u2013 they don\u2019t have that sort of money,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment the only funding we have available to us is from Defra [but] it doesn\u2019t cover the cost at all, and then the council is making up the remainder of what it costs.\u201d Evison said ministers should treat coastal erosion like flooding, where significantly larger pots of funding are made available to local authorities, homeowners and businesses to cover the bill for damage.

Dr John Forrest, a New Zealand winemaker who makes a successful range of lower-alcohol wines, stresses the importance of alcohol\u2019s ability \u201cto add a sweetness to the aroma, ripeness to the fruit flavours and weight and \u2018oily\u2019 mouthfeel\u201d.</p> <p>Forrest reckons the very best you can do is drop around 5% abv to the EU minimum level \u2013 as he does in his own The Doctors\u2019 wines \u2013 before you lose that texture and the effects of what he calls the \u201csecondary chemical interactions\u201d of alcohol in wine, from the feel of the tannins to the complexity of its aromas.</p> <p>This helps explain why almost all 0% alcohol \u201cwines\u201d, which have had their alcohol \u2013 I\u2019m tempted to say their \u201csoul\u201d \u2013 removed by a range of not at all gentle techniques, from centrifuges to organic solvents, taste so thin and simple. But it doesn\u2019t quite account for the fact that alcohol-free beers taste so much more convincing, with a genuinely beer-like mouthfeel and depth of flavour.</p> <p>Forrest says that\u2019s a slight illusion. Brewers too have managed to extract 4-5% abv. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re already starting from a position that is much closer to zero. As for the comparably fuller texture, for the most part, Forrest says, a compensating dose of sugar does the mouth-filling work.</p> <p>The Doctors\u2019 wines, by contrast, stand out by maintaining a voluptuous mouthfeel at sub-10% abv without recourse to excessive sugar. This is thanks to intensive work controlling leaf growth in the vineyard.</p> <p>But, if we\u2019re looking to cut down on alcohol but not on wine, we shouldn\u2019t get too hung up on sugar. Indeed, the EU\u2019s exceptions on minimum alcohol include a style of wine that naturally clocks in at as little as 7.5% abv, but, thanks to its steely acidity, carries its sugar without really feeling sweet.

      "bodyText": "Can a wine be a wine without alcohol? Not according to the European Union it can\u2019t. Who knows what will happen to legal definitions in the UK once the definitive break with the continent is finally made, but for now, with one or two exceptions, fermented grape juice must reach at least 8.5% abv if it\u2019s to qualify to have the word wine on the label. But the question isn\u2019t just a legalistic one. For those of us looking to cut down on booze, it\u2019s more urgently about aesthetics: can a wine without alcohol ever really taste, in any meaningful sense, like wine? My own experience suggests not. A wine without alcohol is missing other elements besides the buzz.

The spice is lovely, the texture is nice and crunchy. I\u2019d happily eat a big bowl of that. In fact, I\u2019ve finished it all.<br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Eaten Alive classic spicy kimchi, 375g, \u00a36, eatenalive.co.uk</h2> <p>This is lovely. Big, crunchy chunks.

I would cook with it, with mushrooms and chestnuts in a dumpling filling but I could also just eat it. It\u2019s too thinly cut - but I keep eating it.<br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Daylesford market garden sauerkraut, 650g, \u00a36.99, daylesford.com</h2> <p>I like that it\u2019s really chunky and crunchy.

It\u2019s really thinly sliced - like thin and short, the little shreds at the bottom of the jar. It\u2019s a bit kombucha-y.

Quite thick. The texture is the best thing about it. I definitely like the mouthfeel.<br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Calon Wen organic natural bio-live yogurt, 400g, \u00a31.75, ocado.com</h2> <p>This tastes fresh - nice acidity. The texture is quite light, not overly creamy or thick. It\u2019s fresh, a good breakfast yogurt.<br>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Glenilen Farm natural yogurt, 500g, \u00a31.59, ocado.com</h2> <p>Quite high acidity. It\u2019s nice and creamy \u2026 slightly grainy, but that doesn\u2019t bother me. Flavour-wise, it\u2019s neutral, inoffensive.<br>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Daylesford natural yogurt, 450ml, \u00a32.49, daylesford.com</h2> <p>Looks a bit thin. It has the most homemade taste - it\u2019s like when I try to make yogurt. It would be good blitzed with something.<br>\u2605\u2605</p> <h2><em>Kefir</em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51a91b52e15fce8113e4cf43dd2ee9128ec40ab5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51a91b52e15fce8113e4cf43dd2ee9128ec40ab5/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"kefir\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>The Collective kefir natural cultured milk drink, 500ml \u00a32.50, ocado.com</h2> <p>It has a very slight fizz which I love. This would be perfect for anyone with a hangover - just smash a bottle of that. I love it.<br>\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Nourish organic kefir, 500ml, \u00a32.99, nourishkefir.co.uk</h2> <p>It\u2019s light and fresh and with a slight biting fizziness on my tongue \u2013 I like it.

I\u2019d happily eat a big bowl of that. In fact, I\u2019ve finished it all. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Eaten Alive classic spicy kimchi, 375g, \u00a36, eatenalive.co.uk This is lovely. Big, crunchy chunks. Loads of different veg in it. Really multilayered flavour. Also a good level of spice that doesn\u2019t blow your head off. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tickles\u2019 Pickles fresh kimchi, 200g, \u00a34.30, ocado.com Oooh! This has nice texture and chunks - it\u2019s not too spindly. There\u2019s a spiky chilli in it. All-round good kimchi. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Korean kimchi, 369g, \u00a33.50, souschef.com It\u2019s too soft, too sweet, not spicy enough. Just tastes weird. Almost tastes like a jarred tomato sauce \u2026 Tastes canned? Not great. 0 stars Sourdough Gradz yeast-free white sourdough bread, 500g, \u00a34.53, ocado.com There\u2019s a bit of sourness, but I think the texture is like cardboard. Might be a bit more tolerable when toasted? \u2605 Co-op Irresistible seeded white sourdough bread, 400g, \u00a31.90, coop.co.uk It looks like there has been some fermentation. The texture is horrible. I\u2019m not detecting much sourness. \u2605 Tesco Finest white sliced sourdough, 400g, \u00a31.50, tesco.com Looks grey \u2026 I can see what looks like bits of undissolved flour in the crumb. Really flaccid crust. The flavour is nonexistent, I can\u2019t taste any sourness. 0 stars Waitrose No 1 white sourdough bread, 500g, \u00a32, waitrose.com The texture is closed, it seems like no fermentation has taken place. The crust is strange \u2013 grey-like and tough. The flavour is horrendous. 0 stars Sauerkraut Hengstenberg Bavarian-style sauerkraut chucrut, 680g, \u00a31.68, ocado.com I really like the flavour, it\u2019s sweeter. I would cook with it, with mushrooms and chestnuts in a dumpling filling but I could also just eat it. It\u2019s too thinly cut - but I keep eating it. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Daylesford market garden sauerkraut, 650g, \u00a36.99, daylesford.com I like that it\u2019s really chunky and crunchy. There\u2019s just a tiny bit too much salt. But I would serve it with some apples or a kraut slaw. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Laurie\u2019s raw and organic original sauerkraut, 410g, \u00a35.49, ocado.com This one has a good crispy texture, but again it\u2019s just a little too salty. It\u2019s finely cut, but there\u2019s a weird flavour in it, I can\u2019t figure it out what it is. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Hurly Burly original organic raw sauerkraut, 300g, \u00a32, ocado.com Oooh, weird. It\u2019s really thinly sliced - like thin and short, the little shreds at the bottom of the jar. It\u2019s a bit kombucha-y. The acidity is too much. \u2605\u2605 Yogurt The Collective straight-up unsweetened yogurt, 450g, \u00a32, ocado.com It has the most flavour out of all of them, it has a different dimension to it. Quite thick. The texture is the best thing about it. I definitely like the mouthfeel. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Calon Wen organic natural bio-live yogurt, 400g, \u00a31.75, ocado.com This tastes fresh - nice acidity. The texture is quite light, not overly creamy or thick. It\u2019s fresh, a good breakfast yogurt. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Glenilen Farm natural yogurt, 500g, \u00a31.59, ocado.com Quite high acidity. It\u2019s nice and creamy \u2026 slightly grainy, but that doesn\u2019t bother me. Flavour-wise, it\u2019s neutral, inoffensive. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Daylesford natural yogurt, 450ml, \u00a32.49, daylesford.com Looks a bit thin. It has the most homemade taste - it\u2019s like when I try to make yogurt. It would be good blitzed with something. \u2605\u2605 Kefir The Collective kefir natural cultured milk drink, 500ml \u00a32.50, ocado.com It has a very slight fizz which I love. This would be perfect for anyone with a hangover - just smash a bottle of that. I love it. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Nourish organic kefir, 500ml, \u00a32.99, nourishkefir.co.uk It\u2019s light and fresh and with a slight biting fizziness on my tongue \u2013 I like it. Quite thirst-quenching. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Biotiful organic kefir, 500ml, \u00a32.25, ocado.com This is nice and not too acidic. Missing that fizziness, it almost needs another day or so. But the milkiness is coming through in a pleasant way. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Daylesford organic milk kefir, 500ml, \u00a34.99, ocado.com This one has a lovely sweet, almost rounded flavour. It\u2019s also got a very light, slight fizz. It\u2019s quite flavoursome, not too acidic. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Kombucha Equinox organic kombucha original, 250ml, \u00a31.80, equinoxkombucha.com This has got a nice golden colour \u2026 I wonder what tea they used for it? Good fizz. Nice acidity. It\u2019s flavoursome. I like this one. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Kombucha Kat organic original, 250ml, \u00a31.99, ocado.com Smells nice and sweet. Not overly acidic. Fresh tasting but quite neutral - you can\u2019t really taste the tea. Fermented well. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Jarr original kombucha, 240ml, \u00a32.85, jarrkombucha.com This is good. It has got high acidity but I don\u2019t mind that. The fizz is nice and spiky \u2026 and I like the amount of fizz. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Lo Bros organic kombucha original, 330ml, \u00a32, ocado.com This one tastes under-fermented to me. It\u2019s not as fizzy as I\u2019d like it to be, it\u2019s a bit underwhelming. \u2605\u2605 All products are blind-tested",

      "body": "<p>As the third and last leader of the short-lived Social Democratic party, Robert Maclennan, who has died aged 83, presided over its demise in 1987. An accidental leader, he lacked drive and colour when placed beside his predecessors at the head of the party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jan/06/guardianobituaries.obituaries\" title=\"\">Roy Jenkins</a> and David Owen.</p> <p>In 1981 he was one of 28 Labour MPs who followed Jenkins, Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers in splitting from Labour and forming the SDP. Although not as newsworthy as \u201cthe Gang of Four\u201d, Maclennan designed the structure of the new party, which, supposedly learning the lessons of Labour\u2019s system, excluded the membership from making party policy. Following general elections in 1983 and 1987, when the SDP failed to gain more than a handful of MPs in either contest, a ballot of its members in 1987 agreed that the party should merge with the Liberals.</p> <p>Initially Maclennan was opposed to a merger, as was Owen, who resigned as leader in protest at the prospect. Other key SDP figures, including Rodgers, Jenkins and Williams, favoured a link up with the Liberals, but as they were no longer MPs there was no experienced person in the House of Commons to head the party in merger talks. They were therefore surprised and delighted when Maclennan made a U-turn and declared that he would now back the merger.</p> <p>As the new leader of the SDP he agreed the merger details with the Liberal party leader David Steel and also prepared, with the help of some young aides, what was widely regarded as a disastrous founding policy statement for the Lib Dems \u2013 a document so widely disparaged on all sides that it led, in part, to Steel\u2019s resignation. With <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/22/paddy-lord-ashdown-obituary\" title=\"\">Paddy Ashdown</a> voted in as the new Lib Dem leader in 1988, Maclennan became a frontbench spokesman for the new party and, eventually, their president from 1994-98.</p> <p>Maclennan was born in Glasgow into a medical family. His father, Sir Hector Maclennan, a gynaecologist, was president of the Royal College of Obstetricians, and his mother, Isabel (nee Adam), was a doctor. Educated at the Glasgow Academy, Maclennan then studied history and law at Balliol College, Oxford, and went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, and Columbia University in New York.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"362ffe4e4fcca4f50ae6117dc405af60021643b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/362ffe4e4fcca4f50ae6117dc405af60021643b6/7_0_3422_2053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Maclennan, right, with, from left: Bill Rodgers, Roy Jenkins and David Owen in 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Maclennan, right, with, from left: Bill Rodgers, Roy Jenkins and David Owen in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Called to the bar at Gray\u2019s Inn in 1962, he practised in London as an international lawyer. As a Labour party candidate in 1966 he won the remote Caithness and Sutherland seat from the Liberals with a majority of 64 votes. He held on to it over the next 35 years under three different party labels, Labour, SDP and Lib Dem, often canvassing in his tweed suit with a rolled-up umbrella and steadily increasing his majority by attracting a substantial personal vote.

      "bodyText": "As the third and last leader of the short-lived Social Democratic party, Robert Maclennan, who has died aged 83, presided over its demise in 1987. An accidental leader, he lacked drive and colour when placed beside his predecessors at the head of the party, Roy Jenkins and David Owen. In 1981 he was one of 28 Labour MPs who followed Jenkins, Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers in splitting from Labour and forming the SDP. Although not as newsworthy as \u201cthe Gang of Four\u201d, Maclennan designed the structure of the new party, which, supposedly learning the lessons of Labour\u2019s system, excluded the membership from making party policy. Following general elections in 1983 and 1987, when the SDP failed to gain more than a handful of MPs in either contest, a ballot of its members in 1987 agreed that the party should merge with the Liberals. Initially Maclennan was opposed to a merger, as was Owen, who resigned as leader in protest at the prospect. Other key SDP figures, including Rodgers, Jenkins and Williams, favoured a link up with the Liberals, but as they were no longer MPs there was no experienced person in the House of Commons to head the party in merger talks. They were therefore surprised and delighted when Maclennan made a U-turn and declared that he would now back the merger. As the new leader of the SDP he agreed the merger details with the Liberal party leader David Steel and also prepared, with the help of some young aides, what was widely regarded as a disastrous founding policy statement for the Lib Dems \u2013 a document so widely disparaged on all sides that it led, in part, to Steel\u2019s resignation. With Paddy Ashdown voted in as the new Lib Dem leader in 1988, Maclennan became a frontbench spokesman for the new party and, eventually, their president from 1994-98. Maclennan was born in Glasgow into a medical family. His father, Sir Hector Maclennan, a gynaecologist, was president of the Royal College of Obstetricians, and his mother, Isabel (nee Adam), was a doctor. Educated at the Glasgow Academy, Maclennan then studied history and law at Balliol College, Oxford, and went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, and Columbia University in New York. Called to the bar at Gray\u2019s Inn in 1962, he practised in London as an international lawyer. As a Labour party candidate in 1966 he won the remote Caithness and Sutherland seat from the Liberals with a majority of 64 votes. He held on to it over the next 35 years under three different party labels, Labour, SDP and Lib Dem, often canvassing in his tweed suit with a rolled-up umbrella and steadily increasing his majority by attracting a substantial personal vote. He tried to make his constituency a centre for the arts in Scotland and spoke up for nuclear power (Dounreay, the local nuclear plant, was the largest employer). As a Labour MP he was a \u201cJenkinsite\u201d, a supporter of Jenkins; such MPs, often Oxbridge educated and recently elected, wanted to keep alive the flame of the late Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. Many distrusted Gaitskell\u2019s successor, Harold Wilson, and Maclennan backed one of the first attempts to unseat Wilson in 1968. Along with like-minded MPs such as Rodgers, Williams, David Marquand, John Roper and Roy Hattersley, he also defied the party line in the early 1970s by supporting British accession to the EEC. He was a passionate supporter of the European Union until the end. Maclennan\u2019s one experience in government was as a junior minister in the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, between 1974 and 1979. Given the government\u2019s battle against high inflation, the department was often in the news. He worked well with his two secretaries of state, Williams and then Hattersley, but less so with trade union leaders; he found them abrasive and demanding. Maclennan felt that he deserved promotion, but it never came, and colleagues believed that he failed to make the most of the opportunities to advance himself. More impressive in private than in public, and blessed with intellectual confidence, he was diffident in manner and often hesitant on the platform. After his defection to the SDP and once the creation of the Liberal Democrats had gone through, Maclennan worked with Labour\u2019s Robin Cook on a proposed programme of constitutional change for a future Labour government, perhaps in coalition with the Lib Dems. Labour\u2019s landslide election victory in 1997 stymied hopes of a coalition, but Maclennan\u2019s work helped to pave the way for an ambitious programme of reform carried out by Tony Blair\u2019s government, which included devolution for Scotland and Wales, changes in the House of Lords and a freedom of information bill. In 2001, after deciding to relinquish his seat, he took a life peerage as Lord Maclennan of Rogart (his father had owned a hotel in Rogart, which was in his son\u2019s constituency) and was Liberal Democrat spokesman on Europe, Scotland and Cabinet Office matters.

      "body": "<p>Marianela N\u00fa\u00f1ez is one of the most acclaimed ballerinas in the world. Born in Buenos Aires, she joined the Royal Ballet when she was 16 and became a principal at the age of 20. Now 37, she is in her prime. She excels in the big ballerina roles in the famous 19th-century classics \u2013 she\u2019s just finished performing Aurora in <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em> and will be soon playing Odette/Odile in <em>Swan Lake</em> and Tatiana in <em>Onegin</em>. Known as \u201cNela\u201d, she was married to fellow Royal Ballet principal Thiago Soares for four years. </p> <p><strong>You were performing leading roles with the Teatro Col\u00f3n</strong><strong> in Buenos Aires by the time you were 14. What made you love ballet so much?</strong><br>I don\u2019t know! When I was three, I went to a school where the teacher had her studio in a garage, and she would take the car out and we would do lessons there. But by the time I was five, I said to my mum, this is not for me. I want to do ballet and I want to do it properly. It wasn\u2019t a game, I wanted to take it seriously. That determination was in me from a very young age. I think you are born with a calling. Otherwise you can\u2019t explain it.</p> <p><strong>Why did you want to come to the Royal Ballet?</strong><br>It was the company I loved from watching videos, and all my favourite dancers \u2013 Sylvie Guillem, Darcey Bussell, Viviana Durante, Irek Mukhamedov, Jonathan Cope \u2013 were there. So I auditioned for the then director, Anthony Dowell, when the company was performing in Los Angeles. He was dressed as Carabosse [the wicked fairy godmother] and about to go on stage in <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em> at the time.</p> <p><strong>When you first arrived, having danced all round the world as a rising star, you had to go back to school because you were too young to join the company. Then you joined the corps de ballet and became a soloist. Was it hard to go backwards in that way?</strong><br>It was a big adjustment. Apart from the fact that I was living in a new culture with no English, I was also in a big institution and things slowed down. For someone so young, I didn\u2019t quite understand that, and I wanted things to happen immediately. But now, looking back, I wouldn\u2019t change it, because it gave me such a strong base, so by the time I got to do the main parts I had a better understanding of everything.</p> <p><strong>How does it feel to be returning to Tatiana in </strong><em><strong>Onegin</strong></em><strong>, which you first danced with Royal Ballet in </strong><strong>2015</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It\u2019s one of those ballets where everything is served to you on a golden tray. It\u2019s a masterpiece that always works. I understand it better the more I dance it. We first meet Tatiana as a young girl and then see her as a mature woman. I feel I can understand and live her from both angles and I have such a lot of admiration and respect for her.</p> <p><strong>The last time you danced </strong><strong>it, you performed opposite your then husband Thiago Soares as Onegin. How did that affect you?</strong><br>The last time we performed this was in the middle of our decision to divorce. Nobody knew, but what a ballet to be doing in the middle of all that. It is a ballet that always makes me sob, but those performances were unbelievable, so emotional. My heart went like this [she gestures as if to push her heart out]. But our separation was mutual, so we could manage to do it in a good way and that\u2019s why we ended up being good friends.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqejv_BQ7Zg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qqejv_BQ7Zg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqejv_BQ7Zg\">Watch Marianela Nu\u0148ez dance the role of Aurora in the Royal Ballet\u2019s recent production of The Sleeping Beauty.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>When you have a holiday from the Royal Ballet, you take on guest appearances with your other companies. Do you feel that your time is running out?</strong><br>No, it\u2019s mainly because I love being on stage and I just want to dance. It\u2019s what makes me happy and my body can take it, which is a blessing. I literally love doing everything. The dramatic, the classics, abstract ballets. I am a complete bunhead! When I am not dancing, I am watching dancing. Also, I genuinely feel that ballerinas become more interesting when they become older. When you watch them, it\u2019s not just a body doing incredible stunts, it\u2019s something in their eyes, how they move their hands. There is so much depth there. I want to achieve that and explore it.</p> <p><strong>What would you say to those people who say they don\u2019t think </strong><strong>ballet has much to offer</strong><strong>?</strong><br>It\u2019s our responsibility to make people get it. When I\u2019m dancing, I always think \u2013 even when I am in a fairytale ballet such as <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em> \u2013 that it is real. It touches me and it makes me think of my life; it should have that impact when you\u2019re watching. Some people always say that ballet is elitist and it\u2019s definitely not. It is this beautiful piece of art, unfolding live in front of you, not like something in a museum.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any regrets?</strong><br>I only see my family once or twice a year, and I wonder if at some point I will feel I didn\u2019t spend enough time with them. But even as I say that, I know my parents would tell me not even to think it.

      "bodyText": "Marianela N\u00fa\u00f1ez is one of the most acclaimed ballerinas in the world. Born in Buenos Aires, she joined the Royal Ballet when she was 16 and became a principal at the age of 20. Now 37, she is in her prime. She excels in the big ballerina roles in the famous 19th-century classics \u2013 she\u2019s just finished performing Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty and will be soon playing Odette/Odile in Swan Lake and Tatiana in Onegin. Known as \u201cNela\u201d, she was married to fellow Royal Ballet principal Thiago Soares for four years. You were performing leading roles with the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires by the time you were 14. What made you love ballet so much? I don\u2019t know! When I was three, I went to a school where the teacher had her studio in a garage, and she would take the car out and we would do lessons there. But by the time I was five, I said to my mum, this is not for me. I want to do ballet and I want to do it properly. It wasn\u2019t a game, I wanted to take it seriously. That determination was in me from a very young age. I think you are born with a calling. Otherwise you can\u2019t explain it. Why did you want to come to the Royal Ballet? It was the company I loved from watching videos, and all my favourite dancers \u2013 Sylvie Guillem, Darcey Bussell, Viviana Durante, Irek Mukhamedov, Jonathan Cope \u2013 were there. So I auditioned for the then director, Anthony Dowell, when the company was performing in Los Angeles. He was dressed as Carabosse [the wicked fairy godmother] and about to go on stage in The Sleeping Beauty at the time. When you first arrived, having danced all round the world as a rising star, you had to go back to school because you were too young to join the company. Then you joined the corps de ballet and became a soloist. Was it hard to go backwards in that way? It was a big adjustment. Apart from the fact that I was living in a new culture with no English, I was also in a big institution and things slowed down. For someone so young, I didn\u2019t quite understand that, and I wanted things to happen immediately. But now, looking back, I wouldn\u2019t change it, because it gave me such a strong base, so by the time I got to do the main parts I had a better understanding of everything. How does it feel to be returning to Tatiana in Onegin, which you first danced with Royal Ballet in 2015? It\u2019s one of those ballets where everything is served to you on a golden tray. It\u2019s a masterpiece that always works. I understand it better the more I dance it. We first meet Tatiana as a young girl and then see her as a mature woman. I feel I can understand and live her from both angles and I have such a lot of admiration and respect for her. The last time you danced it, you performed opposite your then husband Thiago Soares as Onegin. How did that affect you? The last time we performed this was in the middle of our decision to divorce. Nobody knew, but what a ballet to be doing in the middle of all that. It is a ballet that always makes me sob, but those performances were unbelievable, so emotional. My heart went like this [she gestures as if to push her heart out]. But our separation was mutual, so we could manage to do it in a good way and that\u2019s why we ended up being good friends. When you have a holiday from the Royal Ballet, you take on guest appearances with your other companies. Do you feel that your time is running out? No, it\u2019s mainly because I love being on stage and I just want to dance. It\u2019s what makes me happy and my body can take it, which is a blessing. I literally love doing everything. The dramatic, the classics, abstract ballets. I am a complete bunhead! When I am not dancing, I am watching dancing. Also, I genuinely feel that ballerinas become more interesting when they become older. When you watch them, it\u2019s not just a body doing incredible stunts, it\u2019s something in their eyes, how they move their hands. There is so much depth there. I want to achieve that and explore it. What would you say to those people who say they don\u2019t think ballet has much to offer? It\u2019s our responsibility to make people get it. When I\u2019m dancing, I always think \u2013 even when I am in a fairytale ballet such as The Sleeping Beauty \u2013 that it is real. It touches me and it makes me think of my life; it should have that impact when you\u2019re watching. Some people always say that ballet is elitist and it\u2019s definitely not. It is this beautiful piece of art, unfolding live in front of you, not like something in a museum. Do you have any regrets? I only see my family once or twice a year, and I wonder if at some point I will feel I didn\u2019t spend enough time with them. But even as I say that, I know my parents would tell me not even to think it. They are so proud of me. You always seem such a happy person. Do you ever get sad? I can be really sad, and I can dance and it\u2019s not a problem. I think when I dance, I can just accept any kind of emotion and just carry on. Dance is always there to hold me. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2020 because an earlier version misspelt the surname of N\u00fa\u00f1ez as Nu\u00f1ez.

The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual talkfest in the snow, is \u201ccommitted to improving the state of the world\u201d but in key respects things look worse today than they did at the start of the 70s.</p> <p>Not in every way, obviously. The percentage of the world\u2019s population living in abject poverty has come down sharply, largely because of rapid growth in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/16/china.india\">China and India</a>. The gap between rich and poor within countries has increased over the past five decades but inequality is not the same as destitution. Living standards have risen, whether measured by incomes per head, life expectancy or technical progress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/19/warm-words-as-the-global-order-unravels-how-50-davos-gatherings-shaped-history\">Warm words in the alps \u2026 Davos prepares for 50th economics shindig</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were no smartphones in 1971 and nor was there an inkling that they would be manufactured in the economic superpower that China has become. Under Mao, China was essentially a peasant economy and the reforms that led to industrialisation and the migration from the country to the cities were still some way off. Nobody had the slightest interest in China\u2019s growth rate or its trade policy. A small group of developed countries \u2013 led by the US \u2013 accounted for the lion\u2019s share of global GDP and called all the shots. That is no longer the case.</p> <p>By the early 70s, the long period of post second world war growth was coming to an end. The Bretton Woods currency system, held together by the link between the US dollar and gold, would collapse in 1971 as a result of the inflationary strains on the American economy caused by the cost of the Vietnam war and higher domestic spending.</p> <p>The mood music does not seem to have changed all that much. The 2020 Davos takes place amid concern that a crisis is looming. It is more than a decade since the end of the financial crisis of 2007-09 but the recovery has been tepid. Wage growth, investment growth and productivity growth have all been poor. Financial markets look dangerously overvalued.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59aa2a1f341e12e877ab1444741ea6f84c3dc3ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59aa2a1f341e12e877ab1444741ea6f84c3dc3ae/12_10_2881_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump is due to visit the World Economic Forum in Davos on 21 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So why is the current state of affairs more troubling than it was in 1971? Well, for a start there seemed a simple \u2013 if harsh \u2013 way out of the economic problems associated with the end of Bretton Woods. Inflation, according to economists such as Milton Friedman, was caused by profligate governments printing too much money to pay for excessive wage settlements and public spending pledges. The answer was to reduce budget deficits, to rein in the power of organised labour and to give control of interest rates to independent central banks.</p> <p>This was broadly the system in place from the mid-1970s to the moment when everything went pear-shaped in 2008. At that point, there was something of a crash rethink. Interest rates were slashed, central banks pumped money into their economies, budget deficits were allowed to balloon. Yet the strong and sustained recovery that was expected has not happened. The main impact of the extraordinary policy stimulus has been seen in asset prices rather than in the real economy. In the event of another crisis, central banks look to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/15/imf-recession-world-growth-forecast-central-banks\">short of conventional weapons</a>.</p> <p>Tentatively, there are signs that fiscal policy \u2013 regulating the economy through tax and public spending \u2013 is making a comeback. In Britain, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/17/javid-sparks-tax-cuts-speculation-with-borrowing-comments\">interest rates are going to stay low for years to come</a>, making it possible to borrow cheaply for long-term infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Clearly, the money could be put to good use. The big, inescapable difference between the 1971 Davos and the one this week is the threat posed by the climate emergency. A flick through Fritz Schumacher\u2019s seminal 1973 green text \u2013 Small is Beautiful \u2013 finds no mention of global heating. It simply was not a political issue back then.</p> <p>Now, of course, it is. Each year the WEF asks a sample of experts and policymakers to list the most likely risks the world will face over the next decade. Unsurprisingly, against a backdrop of droughts, hurricanes, bushfires, melting glaciers and a steady heating of the planet, for the first time the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/climate-crisis-environment-top-five-places-world-economic-forum-risks-report\">top five threats are all environmental</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Klaus Schwab, the founder of Davos and the WEF\u2019s executive chairman, has written to all those attending this year\u2019s event urging them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. An indication of how successful that appeal will be should come on Tuesday when Donald Trump drops by.</p> <p>What Trump should say \u2013 but won\u2019t \u2013 is as follows: the US recognises the existential threat posed by global heating. It accepts that multilateral cooperation is needed if the problem is to be tackled before it it is too late. As a businessman, he is aware that no company could hope to survive if it depleted its own capital in the way that humans are consuming natural resources.</p> <p>To that end, the White House is working on an ambitious plan for the climate change summit due <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/aug/09/uk-chooses-glasgow-host-major-un-climate-change-summit\">to be held in Glasgow at the end of this year</a>. As the world\u2019s biggest economy, the US will commit to stringent emissions targets, commit to renewable energy and bankroll a modern equivalent of the postwar Marshall Plan to help poor countries make the transition to a low-carbon future. Why? Because whereas the threat in 1948 was the spread of communism, now it is the much greater danger that capitalism will eat itself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Richard Nixon was in the White House, Mao Zedong was running China and Ted Heath was the prime minister of the UK when hand-picked members of the global business, academic and policymaking elite were first invited to a get-together in the Swiss resort of Davos in 1971. This year marks the 50th Davos but there is not exactly a party mood. The World Economic Forum, the body that organises the annual talkfest in the snow, is \u201ccommitted to improving the state of the world\u201d but in key respects things look worse today than they did at the start of the 70s. Not in every way, obviously. The percentage of the world\u2019s population living in abject poverty has come down sharply, largely because of rapid growth in China and India. The gap between rich and poor within countries has increased over the past five decades but inequality is not the same as destitution. Living standards have risen, whether measured by incomes per head, life expectancy or technical progress. There were no smartphones in 1971 and nor was there an inkling that they would be manufactured in the economic superpower that China has become. Under Mao, China was essentially a peasant economy and the reforms that led to industrialisation and the migration from the country to the cities were still some way off. Nobody had the slightest interest in China\u2019s growth rate or its trade policy. A small group of developed countries \u2013 led by the US \u2013 accounted for the lion\u2019s share of global GDP and called all the shots. That is no longer the case. By the early 70s, the long period of post second world war growth was coming to an end. The Bretton Woods currency system, held together by the link between the US dollar and gold, would collapse in 1971 as a result of the inflationary strains on the American economy caused by the cost of the Vietnam war and higher domestic spending. The mood music does not seem to have changed all that much. The 2020 Davos takes place amid concern that a crisis is looming. It is more than a decade since the end of the financial crisis of 2007-09 but the recovery has been tepid. Wage growth, investment growth and productivity growth have all been poor. Financial markets look dangerously overvalued. So why is the current state of affairs more troubling than it was in 1971? Well, for a start there seemed a simple \u2013 if harsh \u2013 way out of the economic problems associated with the end of Bretton Woods. Inflation, according to economists such as Milton Friedman, was caused by profligate governments printing too much money to pay for excessive wage settlements and public spending pledges. The answer was to reduce budget deficits, to rein in the power of organised labour and to give control of interest rates to independent central banks. This was broadly the system in place from the mid-1970s to the moment when everything went pear-shaped in 2008. At that point, there was something of a crash rethink. Interest rates were slashed, central banks pumped money into their economies, budget deficits were allowed to balloon. Yet the strong and sustained recovery that was expected has not happened. The main impact of the extraordinary policy stimulus has been seen in asset prices rather than in the real economy. In the event of another crisis, central banks look to be short of conventional weapons. Tentatively, there are signs that fiscal policy \u2013 regulating the economy through tax and public spending \u2013 is making a comeback. In Britain, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, says interest rates are going to stay low for years to come, making it possible to borrow cheaply for long-term infrastructure projects. Clearly, the money could be put to good use. The big, inescapable difference between the 1971 Davos and the one this week is the threat posed by the climate emergency. A flick through Fritz Schumacher\u2019s seminal 1973 green text \u2013 Small is Beautiful \u2013 finds no mention of global heating. It simply was not a political issue back then. Now, of course, it is. Each year the WEF asks a sample of experts and policymakers to list the most likely risks the world will face over the next decade. Unsurprisingly, against a backdrop of droughts, hurricanes, bushfires, melting glaciers and a steady heating of the planet, for the first time the top five threats are all environmental. Klaus Schwab, the founder of Davos and the WEF\u2019s executive chairman, has written to all those attending this year\u2019s event urging them to commit to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. An indication of how successful that appeal will be should come on Tuesday when Donald Trump drops by. What Trump should say \u2013 but won\u2019t \u2013 is as follows: the US recognises the existential threat posed by global heating. It accepts that multilateral cooperation is needed if the problem is to be tackled before it it is too late. As a businessman, he is aware that no company could hope to survive if it depleted its own capital in the way that humans are consuming natural resources. To that end, the White House is working on an ambitious plan for the climate change summit due to be held in Glasgow at the end of this year. As the world\u2019s biggest economy, the US will commit to stringent emissions targets, commit to renewable energy and bankroll a modern equivalent of the postwar Marshall Plan to help poor countries make the transition to a low-carbon future. Why? Because whereas the threat in 1948 was the spread of communism, now it is the much greater danger that capitalism will eat itself.",

We\u2019re meeting, ostensibly, to talk about series three of the chatshow. But, like I said, you don\u2019t interview Narstie.</p> <p><em><strong>Narstie is 34.</strong></em> He grew up poor and, as a teenager, was prone to running wild \u2013 his own admission. The odds were stacked against him. \u201cThe first part of the story is hard work, whoop dee do,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the second part of the story is that, 10 years ago, two guys took me, a ghetto kid, off the street, signed me to their label, and gave me a chance.\u201d The men he\u2019s talking about are Nathan Brown and Obi Kevin Akudike, of record label Dice Recordings, who released Narstie\u2019s first EPs and also put out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta%0A\" title=\"\">Skepta</a>\u2019s early records. \u201cTen years ago, my mum phoned Kevin and Nathan and said: \u2018You need to get him out of Brixton.\u2019 And they moved me here, to Essex. If I\u2019d stayed in Brixton, I\u2019d have been dead or in prison \u2013 a young black kid who had a lot of potential. I always give God thanks for that. Because of that opportunity I ended up owning a third of the TV company that filmed the TV show, that got a Bafta nomination\u2026\u201d</p> <p>His mother still lives in Brixton and remains a powerful influence in his life. Growing up, she supported her four children as an NHS nurse, but things were hard. \u201cShe worked with schizophrenic people,\u201d Narstie says. \u201cI used to eat breakfast at the hospital with a guy who thought he was Rambo, and then I\u2019d jump on the No 322 bus to school.\u201d He dissolves into giggles at the absurdity of the memory. \u201cThat was sick!\u201d</p> <p>I ask him if he\u2019s always been able to see the funny side of the darkness of life. \u201cNah, I grew up quick due to the circumstances.\u201d </p> <p>Is that where his ambition comes from? \u201cIt\u2019s about never going back to the shit-hole that is poverty. To living off \u00a360 a month. Where existence is just survival. Now I\u2019m a free man, I never want to go back.\u201d</p> <p>Narstie doesn\u2019t think he was meant to be famous, and you couldn\u2019t say he\u2019s chased celebrity. His immediate circle is a tight group of old friends. He does not employ a publicist. \u201cThe key to my success is people power,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with the industry. I know that if 200,000 of my fans phone the establishment and say, \u2018Play that fat cunt,\u2019 they have to!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f2abbbb5108448caf5b8a229c3bc6fa451c2bc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f2abbbb5108448caf5b8a229c3bc6fa451c2bc8/75_130_4152_2985/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You are my sunshine: Big Narstie presenting the weather on Good Morning Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You are my sunshine: Big Narstie presenting the weather on Good Morning Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why do his shows strike such a chord? \u201cBecause it\u2019s real-G shit,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s two types of England, innit! There\u2019s the England they want to show to the rest of the world, and there\u2019s the real England, the England that people actually live in.\u201d</p> <p>Talk diverts to\u2026 exercise. Narstie trains four times a week, he says \u2013 mostly martial arts. He hasn\u2019t had a drop of alcohol since he started training two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cTruth be told, I\u2019m a hippie more than a drinker,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m from the Rastafari faith. I believe that weed was found on King Solomon\u2019s grave. Weed is the tree of knowledge. It\u2019s a medicine that heals people. It helps me with my music and thoughts.\u201d</p> <p>The alcohol abstinence seems part of a deeper inner journey. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been training, I got the aggression out my system. Ultimately, love will bring your soul further than fear or aggressive power.\u201d He adds: \u201cPeople say, \u2018You look like you\u2019re enjoying life so much.\u2019 But, like, how do they know? Because I lived on the wild side for so long I don\u2019t take things for granted. I\u2019ve got bare friends in prison, so I\u2019m grateful to be walking around, being free, having the choice to eat Cheetos and my nice Calypso drink.\u201d He points to a plastic bag full of snacks and drinks. \u201cI appreciate everything, because I still remember what it means to have nothing.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Later that evening,</strong></em> Narstie is due to appear on <em>The Rob Rinder Verdict</em> \u2013 \u201cRinderman is a rassclaat G!\u201d \u2013 so we leave the man-cave and drive to the studio. Narstie is wearing Gucci sliders with socks and a Ralph Lauren polo shirt. As we drive he talks about the importance of maximising his opportunities while he has them. \u201cI sell merchandise on my website,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I just bought a gym, which will have a CBD centre with a range of hemp and CBD products. And I\u2019m about to open a music bar and a club in Tenerife, which will be called Base, like my grime crew, Base Defence League. I can hustle anything. I\u2019m also investing in property. I want to be the fat, black Robbie Fowler\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s referring to the ex-Liverpool footballer who became one of Britain\u2019s biggest private landlords after retiring from the game \u2013 \u201cand I got series three of <em>The Big Narstie Show</em> coming up, and we\u2019re filming other projects. Wherever man can fit in, I\u2019m trying. Some might work. Some might not. I just don\u2019t want to be old and upset that I didn\u2019t try stuff. If it works, give God thanks. If it doesn\u2019t, so be it, on to the other one.\u201d</p> <p>Narstie is keen to use his position to help others. \u201cThe little what I\u2019ve got, man is trying to help. I like to give opportunities,\u201d he says. He gives to charity. He is an ambassador for the <a href=\"http://bakedbeancompany.com/\" title=\"\">Baked Bean Company</a>, a south London school for people with learning disabilities, where he also regularly performs. Flamboyantly, he recently invested in a helicopter, which seems over-the-top, but everything counts. The helicopter is emblazoned with the Base Defence League logo. \u201cI want to make BDL air cadets,\u201d Narstie says. He is grinning. \u201cTeach young kids from the ends to fly!\u201d</p> <p>Despite his public persona as a man laughing in the face of life, Narstie has talked openly in the press and at universities across the country about his struggles with mental health and he\u2019s worked with the mental health charity <a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mind</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b62964fc208a730cd226494ab993f395a733adf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b62964fc208a730cd226494ab993f395a733adf0/0_303_6200_7748/800.jpg\" alt=\"Look to the future: \u2018The key to my success is people power.

(On the track Help, from <em>BDL Bipolar</em>, he rapped: \u201cIs it wrong to cry? / Is it wrong to feel to die?\u201d) It is important to him that awareness spreads. \u201cIn the Afro-Caribbean community, talk of mental health is shunned,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone in the family had mental health issues, people would think there\u2019s something wrong with the whole family. I always knew I ticked a few of the boxes of symptoms people talked about. Mood swings. Isolation. Being hyper. Being low. Before, I thought I was just being a rassclaat G. But then I realised there was a term for it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his self-confessed introspection, Narstie is also a shining example of positive body image. \u201cMan is sexual chocolate,\u201d he says of himself, in the car, one of many pearls of self-love. \u201cIn the words of my mate Andy: you can only piss with the cock you\u2019ve got. You\u2019re the biggest advertisement of yourself. I\u2019ve always embraced what I am.\u201d</p> <p>When we arrive at the studio, a bunch of people involved with the Rinder show come out to meet him, but Narstie stays outside to smoke. He prefers not to enter a building until the very last minute, until he really, really has to go in for hair and makeup, so he can smoke for longer. Everyone acquiesces. The show\u2019s other celebrity guests are already inside \u2013 the comedian Katherine Ryan and <em>Made in Chelsea</em>\u2019s Jamie Laing. But Narstie prefers it in the car park. \u201cI need to be high for this shit,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get the best of me on the show.\u201d</p> <p>The producer tells Narstie that the politician Anna Soubry will be a last-minute guest. \u201cI don\u2019t know none of these fuckers,\u201d he says. \u201cI just know they all get paid to talk shit.\u201d</p> <p>Narstie has an uneasy relationship with the television world, he says, despite it catapulting him to fame. \u201cDo you think that five years ago it would have been acceptable for me to be smoking weed in a place like this?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the only black person who\u2019s high on national TV. I have clocked on to the simple fact that I am now relevant enough for them to overlook me smoking weed. I am me. I refuse to be anyone else. Give God thanks. Bit of hard work, a lot of luck, I\u2019ve landed to get to a decent stature. I\u2019m not all the way there. I\u2019m not the captain of the ship, but I\u2019m on the boat, you get me?\u201d</p> <p>Narstie goes inside and plays a game on his phone while he waits. As the show starts, he takes a seat off set and falls asleep. Five minutes later, someone gently nudges him awake and he walks on stage. Narstie promptly delivers everything the producers had invited him on to the show to deliver. Zest. Charm. Chaos. Mischief. Humour. His particular brand of streetwise insight flows.</p> <p>\u201cGiraffe neck man,\u201d he says, halfway through the show, when a photo of Jacob Rees-Mogg is shown. He does not completely recognise him. \u201cThat man looks like he has zero vibes.\u201d Later, when the show is on a break from airing, he shouts, \u201cSnaaacks!\u201d and someone brings him a bowl of crisps. He dissolves into giggles every now and then, and when he does, the other guests do, too. He makes the show come alive. He\u2019s TV gold. A natural. \u201cI treat shows like sex,\u201d he says, midway through the actual show. \u201cIt cannot be forced.\u201d</p> <p><em>Series 3 of The Big Narstie Show starts on Channel 4 on Friday 7</em><em> February at 11pm</em></p>",

We are sitting on a sofa in a nondescript flat in Essex \u2013 the \u201cman-cave,\u201d Narstie calls it. It\u2019s a short walk away from the large, four-bedroom house in which he lives with his partner and two children. The puppy is wearing a rose-gold collar. Narstie is wearing a gigantic diamond pendant that involves an elaborate, custom-made, jewelled portrait of the puppy. \u201cDaddy can\u2019t shine if his boy don\u2019t shine,\u201d he says. A moment ago, I had asked him, I think, about his Bafta-nominated TV programme, The Big Narstie Show, which returns for its third series soon. But this is how it is to be in Narstie\u2019s presence. You don\u2019t interview him. You spend time in his vicinity and listen gratefully as the soundbites spill out of his mouth, one after the other. Here\u2019s Narstie on his songwriting process: \u201cAll my best songs were written on the toilet. I take a cold drink in there. It\u2019s where I flow.\u201d Here he is on his exercise regime: \u201cI\u2019ve been learning some acrobatical stuff for my fat size, cuz.\u201d And here he is on his rise to fame: \u201cI came from fuck all. I\u2019m the epitome of making it from the ground up.\u201d Narstie is a peculiar kind of celebrity. Born Tyrone Lindo to Jamaican parents, he grew up in Brixton and shot to notoriety as a rapper, first as part of the grime crew N-Double-A, and later as a solo artist.

In 2017, Narstie made a guest appearance on Gogglebox, alongside Sheeran, and quickly became a viral sensation. (He may or may not have been high.) The same thing happened when he popped up on the The Great British Bake Off, last year, and when he had a stint presenting the weather on Good Morning Britain, in 2018.

There\u2019s the England they want to show to the rest of the world, and there\u2019s the real England, the England that people actually live in.\u201d Talk diverts to\u2026 exercise. Narstie trains four times a week, he says \u2013 mostly martial arts. He hasn\u2019t had a drop of alcohol since he started training two years ago. \u201cTruth be told, I\u2019m a hippie more than a drinker,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m from the Rastafari faith. I believe that weed was found on King Solomon\u2019s grave. Weed is the tree of knowledge. It\u2019s a medicine that heals people. It helps me with my music and thoughts.\u201d The alcohol abstinence seems part of a deeper inner journey. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been training, I got the aggression out my system. Ultimately, love will bring your soul further than fear or aggressive power.\u201d He adds: \u201cPeople say, \u2018You look like you\u2019re enjoying life so much.\u2019 But, like, how do they know? Because I lived on the wild side for so long I don\u2019t take things for granted. I\u2019ve got bare friends in prison, so I\u2019m grateful to be walking around, being free, having the choice to eat Cheetos and my nice Calypso drink.\u201d He points to a plastic bag full of snacks and drinks. \u201cI appreciate everything, because I still remember what it means to have nothing.\u201d Later that evening, Narstie is due to appear on The Rob Rinder Verdict \u2013 \u201cRinderman is a rassclaat G!\u201d \u2013 so we leave the man-cave and drive to the studio. Narstie is wearing Gucci sliders with socks and a Ralph Lauren polo shirt. As we drive he talks about the importance of maximising his opportunities while he has them. \u201cI sell merchandise on my website,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I just bought a gym, which will have a CBD centre with a range of hemp and CBD products. And I\u2019m about to open a music bar and a club in Tenerife, which will be called Base, like my grime crew, Base Defence League. I can hustle anything. I\u2019m also investing in property. I want to be the fat, black Robbie Fowler\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s referring to the ex-Liverpool footballer who became one of Britain\u2019s biggest private landlords after retiring from the game \u2013 \u201cand I got series three of The Big Narstie Show coming up, and we\u2019re filming other projects. Wherever man can fit in, I\u2019m trying. Some might work. Some might not. I just don\u2019t want to be old and upset that I didn\u2019t try stuff. If it works, give God thanks. If it doesn\u2019t, so be it, on to the other one.\u201d Narstie is keen to use his position to help others. \u201cThe little what I\u2019ve got, man is trying to help. I like to give opportunities,\u201d he says. He gives to charity. He is an ambassador for the Baked Bean Company, a south London school for people with learning disabilities, where he also regularly performs. Flamboyantly, he recently invested in a helicopter, which seems over-the-top, but everything counts. The helicopter is emblazoned with the Base Defence League logo. \u201cI want to make BDL air cadets,\u201d Narstie says. He is grinning. \u201cTeach young kids from the ends to fly!\u201d Despite his public persona as a man laughing in the face of life, Narstie has talked openly in the press and at universities across the country about his struggles with mental health and he\u2019s worked with the mental health charity Mind. He raps about mental health on his album, which is a curious subject for a grime artist to broach. (On the track Help, from BDL Bipolar, he rapped: \u201cIs it wrong to cry? / Is it wrong to feel to die?\u201d) It is important to him that awareness spreads. \u201cIn the Afro-Caribbean community, talk of mental health is shunned,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone in the family had mental health issues, people would think there\u2019s something wrong with the whole family. I always knew I ticked a few of the boxes of symptoms people talked about. Mood swings. Isolation. Being hyper. Being low. Before, I thought I was just being a rassclaat G. But then I realised there was a term for it.\u201d Despite his self-confessed introspection, Narstie is also a shining example of positive body image. \u201cMan is sexual chocolate,\u201d he says of himself, in the car, one of many pearls of self-love. \u201cIn the words of my mate Andy: you can only piss with the cock you\u2019ve got. You\u2019re the biggest advertisement of yourself. I\u2019ve always embraced what I am.\u201d When we arrive at the studio, a bunch of people involved with the Rinder show come out to meet him, but Narstie stays outside to smoke. He prefers not to enter a building until the very last minute, until he really, really has to go in for hair and makeup, so he can smoke for longer. Everyone acquiesces. The show\u2019s other celebrity guests are already inside \u2013 the comedian Katherine Ryan and Made in Chelsea\u2019s Jamie Laing. But Narstie prefers it in the car park. \u201cI need to be high for this shit,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get the best of me on the show.\u201d The producer tells Narstie that the politician Anna Soubry will be a last-minute guest. \u201cI don\u2019t know none of these fuckers,\u201d he says. \u201cI just know they all get paid to talk shit.\u201d Narstie has an uneasy relationship with the television world, he says, despite it catapulting him to fame. \u201cDo you think that five years ago it would have been acceptable for me to be smoking weed in a place like this?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the only black person who\u2019s high on national TV. I have clocked on to the simple fact that I am now relevant enough for them to overlook me smoking weed. I am me. I refuse to be anyone else. Give God thanks. Bit of hard work, a lot of luck, I\u2019ve landed to get to a decent stature. I\u2019m not all the way there. I\u2019m not the captain of the ship, but I\u2019m on the boat, you get me?\u201d Narstie goes inside and plays a game on his phone while he waits. As the show starts, he takes a seat off set and falls asleep. Five minutes later, someone gently nudges him awake and he walks on stage. Narstie promptly delivers everything the producers had invited him on to the show to deliver. Zest. Charm. Chaos. Mischief. Humour. His particular brand of streetwise insight flows. \u201cGiraffe neck man,\u201d he says, halfway through the show, when a photo of Jacob Rees-Mogg is shown. He does not completely recognise him. \u201cThat man looks like he has zero vibes.\u201d Later, when the show is on a break from airing, he shouts, \u201cSnaaacks!\u201d and someone brings him a bowl of crisps. He dissolves into giggles every now and then, and when he does, the other guests do, too. He makes the show come alive. He\u2019s TV gold. A natural. \u201cI treat shows like sex,\u201d he says, midway through the actual show. \u201cIt cannot be forced.\u201d Series 3 of The Big Narstie Show starts on Channel 4 on Friday 7 February at 11pm",

      "bodyText": "Andy Murray has been backed by Bob Bryan, who underwent the same surgery, to \u201cplay for many more years, winning\u201d. The American doubles expert, who made a successful return after his hip operation, has said the setback that has prevented Murray from playing in this Australian Open \u2013 bruising to his thigh bone \u2013 was unrelated to the \u201cBirmingham method\u201d operation he had last January to fix long-term pain and degradation in his right hip. \u201cI talked to him last week,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cHe\u2019s got something unrelated to the hip injury. His hip feels great. All his numbers are off the charts. He\u2019s right back where he was when he was world No 1, which is incredible. That\u2019s good to hear.\u201d Bryan said the 32-year-old Murray has \u201csome question marks over this recent injury. He hopes to be back as soon as he can but he\u2019s still working on it\u201d. Bryan said Murray\u2019s \u201cresurfacing\u201d surgery will require a lot of post-operation work. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do a little extra work, recovery. But it\u2019s a good surgery. It\u2019s come a long way since a lot of our friends got it done 15, 20 years ago. Then, it spelled the end of your career. I think this has given hope to a lot of people.\u201d The 41-year-old said he was encouraged to believe Murray could make a full recovery after watching the recent film, Resurfacing, which documents his long road back from injury and surgery. \u201cIf anyone saw the documentary, you\u2019ll know how crazy he is with the work.

It could sound like something written by a prophet in stone: Eat No Meat Before Sundown. But Safran Foer, in his brilliant book,<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/06/jonathan-safran-foer-we-are-the-weather-saving-planet-begins-breakfast-review\" title=\"\"> We Are the Weather</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/06/jonathan-safran-foer-we-are-the-weather-saving-planet-begins-breakfast-review\" title=\"\">,</a> insists on couching it in far more conversational terms: we need to make a \u201ccollective act to eat differently\u201d, he says, and one straightforward way is to aim to eat no animal products before dinner.</p> <p>This idea for a roughly two-third shift in animal consumption comes armed with unarguable statistics about its positive effect in reversing climate trends, including the killer pay-off: \u201cIf cows were a country they would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions, after China and the United States.\u201d</p> <p>I meet Safran Foer in London in the autumn, while Extinction Rebellion are glueing themselves to corporate buildings. He has chosen to eat at <a href=\"https://ottolenghi.co.uk/restaurants\" title=\"\">Nopi</a>, Ottolenghi\u2019s brasserie outpost off London\u2019s Regent Street, not least because in Safran Foer\u2019s decade of campaigning against factory farming (his 2009 book <em>Eating Animals</em> was the starting point) the chef has become a good friend and ally.</p> <p>We order sharing plates including cauliflower and green bean fritters, hispi cabbage and tofu mayonnaise, chickpeas with sumac feta and \u2013 ignoring any potential for caricature \u2013 talk first about the protests and their effect. There has, Safran Foer says, been nothing remotely like them in the US, but he is not convinced they are effective. \u201cI saw a protester asked on the news, \u2018What is the point?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe reply was the obvious one: \u2018We wouldn\u2019t be talking about it now, if this were not happening.\u2019 But is that exactly a point? You can imagine ways in which it could be a bad thing if it becomes too divisive, or is seen as just a liberal concern.\u201d</p> <p>One theme of his book is that human beings cannot hold potential apocalypse in their minds for very long: \u201cWe are good at things like calculating the path of a hurricane,\u201d he writes, \u201cand bad at things like deciding to get out of its way.\u201d He uses at one point the analogy of his grandmother\u2019s family in 1930s Poland to examine human reaction to the psychology of existential threat. His grandmother heard what was happening in Germany and \u2013 partly through luck and circumstance \u2013 decided to emigrate. All her relations heard the same news and were paralysed by it, or had other concerns. He fears that is the effect of a lot of well-intentioned hand-wringing about the planet, the virtue-signalling threats of doom. The scale overwhelms us, and we do nothing.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why the Extinction movement isn\u2019t concretising. Why it isn\u2019t issuing specific ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are awfully vague and unrealistic. Why not say: \u2018Here\u2019s a thing we can all do to help this month?\u2019 And do that every month. I feel then that an awful lot of people would start to give it a shot.\u201d</p> <p>His informed suggestion about daytime veganism is a case in point. But even then, and in his book, he cautions against being too shrill. One of the most persuasive adopters of his plan in the US has been the chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/20/how-to-cook-like-a-pro-listen-to-your-food-samin-nosrat-chez-panisse-chef-alice-waters\" title=\"\">Samin Nosrat</a>, bestselling author of <em>Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat</em>. \u201cThe way Samin talks about it is climate leadership, for me,\u201d Safran Foer says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ask anyone else to do it. She says: \u2018I might not be consistent with it, it is going to be a big change. But knowing what I know, this is what I feel I should do.\u2019 When people lecture me on their own ethical accomplishment, I find that extremely annoying and certainly not inspiring. But if somebody says, \u2018I want to try this, I fear I might fail,\u2019 people start to think, \u2018Well, you know, I could try that too.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The goal is not to perfect a virtuous identity for yourself. The goal is to reduce the carbon in the atmosphere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Safran Foer is upfront about his own lapses in the book. He confesses even to one or two fast-food burger moments when tired or emotional or lazy. That seemed to me quite a brave thing to do, but also a persuasive one.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt like an embarrassing thing to write,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I have definitely had meat. And I have often wanted it. These days I find cooking vegetarian quite easy. But veganism is much more difficult. I mean I wrote the book, so I had to do it. But it was still like, \u2018Oh shit, this is difficult.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He thinks that above all we need to get away from thinking in binary terms. \u201cIf someone says to me, you know, I couldn\u2019t give up chicken, or cheese, or burrata, that\u2019s fine, just eat much less of it, or only eat it for dinner. The goal is not to perfect a virtuous identity for yourself. The goal is to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.\u201d</p> <p>Safran Foer first found a global audience as a wunderkind novelist. His book <em>Everything is Illuminated</em>, a fictional personal journey into Holocaust history, earned him an eye-watering publisher\u2019s advance and universal critical acclaim. It came out when he was only 25. He followed it with another chunky bestseller, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/29/fiction.features\" title=\"\">Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</a></em>, which offered a child\u2019s eye view on the 9/11 attacks, and became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/16/extremely-loud-incredibly-close-review\" title=\"\">a film starring Tom Hanks</a>. In his two polemical books, he uses a pared-down version of that hyper-intelligent novelist\u2019s voice, but retains a genius for a compelling story and a telling detail.</p> <p>He understands that the best of the latter are often the most simple. One thing that struck him when he started to share a platform with distinguished climate scientists was that they were all, to a woman and man, vegetarian. \u201cThey just took that as read,\u201d he says, \u201cin the same way they would never drive an SUV. The funny thing was that it was too obvious to them almost to mention.\u201d</p> <p>Another telling revelation, he says, struck him when <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/28/eating-animals-jonathan-safran-foer\" title=\"\">Eating Animals</a></em> came out. He imagined it would likely be loved by animal rights protesters and hated by farmers. In fact, he had the opposite experience. \u201cFarmers I spoke to welcomed the book. They despise factory farming more than anyone. The whole model of industrial agriculture obviously seeks to remove farmers from the process. Sustainable farming offers them a future.\u201d The protesters, meanwhile, found plenty to protest about in Safran Foer\u2019s human and realistic tone, because that is what they do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"959ee01b0531c705d3e0be9568cddd824e1d0aa3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/959ee01b0531c705d3e0be9568cddd824e1d0aa3/0_614_3744_4268/877.jpg\" alt=\"NOPI dishes\" width=\"877\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">They shared <em>Roasted aubergine, tamarind yogurt, preserved lemon, cashews, \u00a310.80; chickpeas, butternut squash, sundried tomatoes, mint, sumac feta, \u00a39.80; cauliflower and green bean fritters, amba, coconut tahini, \u00a312; chargrilled hispi cabbage, tofu mayonnaise, pickled cucumber, sea purslane, \u00a311.50; Valde\u00f3n cheesecake, pickled beetroot, thyme honey, almonds, \u00a312.80. </em>NOPI<strong> </strong><em>21-22 Warwick St, London W1B 5NE.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We dig into our sharing plates, Safran Foer doing his best to avoid the rule-breaking components of our order, yogurt and feta. \u201cThis is part of my difficulty right here,\u201d he says, of a slightly awkward interaction with the waiter when he suggested he would rather not have dairy. \u201cI still don\u2019t quite know how to have the conversation about these things.

I\u2019m a massive fan of their Xinjiang style of Chinese cooking and they do many unusual things that you don\u2019t normally see in Chinese restaurants in this country. I associate kebabs with Turkish or Greek food, but here they do lamb skewers which they cover in delicious Asian spices and chargrill really quickly. Their dumplings are on point as well. In fact, everything is packed full of flavour, but nicely balanced. The restaurant is very minimalistic, drinks are BYO and the food is very affordable \u2013 spend \u00a320 and you\u2019re full.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/15/inver-strathlachlan-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\" title=\"\">Inver</a>, Strathlachan, Argyll</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by James Lowe, chef and co-founder, <a href=\"https://www.lyleslondon.com/\">Lyle\u2019s </a>and Flor</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b066f1e8606118f4044ae26375e0861df286953e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b066f1e8606118f4044ae26375e0861df286953e/0_142_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Inver restaurant at Strachur, Argyll, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Inver is on a beautiful part of the west coast of Scotland, a couple of hours\u2019 drive from Glasgow. It\u2019s not over the top like some destination restaurants; there\u2019s no desire to create theatrics. The dinner is fantastic, and it\u2019s worth staying so you can have breakfast and its more casual lunch. We went for new year and stayed in a bothy by the water. For dinner, we had seaweed ice-cream with caviar, which was stunning, and an amazing langoustine dish with carrot. Pam Brunton and Rob Latimer run the place: she\u2019s in the kitchen, he runs front of house. I\u2019ve got a lot of admiration for them, because running a restaurant in a remote area is really difficult and they\u2019ve made it work.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.thedawnayatnewton.co.uk/pub/\" title=\"\">The Dawnay Arms</a>, Newton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Tommy Banks, </em><em>head chef, <a href=\"https://www.blackswanoldstead.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Black Swan</a></em></p> <p>I quite like fine dining, but I think what everybody really wants is an awesome Sunday roast and so often it\u2019s disappointing. The Dawnay Arms is incredible. If I haven\u2019t any got any plans for Sunday, I will be there. I\u2019ve gone four weekends in a row before. I like to sit in the front bar because I can take my dog; first we go for a walk by the river, then call into the pub and have a roast. The Smiths run it: Martel is in the kitchen and Kerry runs the front of house. Obviously, we\u2019re blessed up here with good produce, but they use all the best stuff. They don\u2019t charge enough for what they do. I kind of wish I owned it myself \u2013 but then I wouldn\u2019t want to eat there, so I suppose it\u2019s best.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f063e8dd4f4be5f130e83a4a506b59fc52dec298\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f063e8dd4f4be5f130e83a4a506b59fc52dec298/110_28_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Radish, Wimbledon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Radish, Wimbledon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.blackradishsw19.com/\" title=\"\">Black Radish</a>, London SW19</strong></h2> <p><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Phil Howard, chef</em><em> and co-owner, <a href=\"https://www.elystanstreet.com\" title=\"\">Elystan Street</a></em></p> <p>Whatever I eat, I want it to be good. A burger, a curry, truffle langoustine \u2013 I just like delicious food. It\u2019s so often disappointing; inventive-sounding menus that make you think it\u2019s going to be more ego-driven, cheffy rubbish. Here it\u2019s delicious. The chef-owner, Toby Cartwright, is young but full of passion. His cooking is creative, underpinned with understanding, seasonality and, in the most part, classical flavours. It\u2019s a very straightforward space with pleasant decor, and it\u2019s a very happy place to be. And it\u2019s just so nice to be in that kind of environment.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Coffee-Shop/St-Kew-Farm-Shop-Cafe-1638076656244037/\" title=\"\">St Kew Cafe</a>, Bodmin, Cornwall</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Paul Ainsworth, chef-owner, <a href=\"https://www.paul-ainsworth.co.uk/number6/\">Paul Ainsworth at No 6</a></em></p> <p>Not far from where I live, near the St Kew highway, is a farm shop with a cafe. My wife Emma and I go there as much as we can, and every time, to our amazement, there\u2019s a table available. It\u2019s probably only a matter of time before more people find out about it and it becomes impossible to find a seat. It\u2019s so welcoming \u2013 the chef will always look up and give you a wave \u2013 and the food is so consistent, even if it\u2019s just a bacon sandwich or a full English. The ethos is to showcase everything Cornish and it uses proper sourdough bread, nice butter, great bacon. Whether avocado with poached eggs on toast or a ham sandwich, the food is brilliant every single time. I can\u2019t believe this is just up the road. It\u2019s fantastic.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eatnative.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Native</a>, London SE1</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Ramael Scully, head chef and co-owner, <a href=\"https://www.scullyrestaurant.com/\" title=\"\">Scully St James\u2019s</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9a84605f0b191cb976e797c8660ccf2525f35f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9a84605f0b191cb976e797c8660ccf2525f35f2/0_98_4137_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woodruff, Kentish raspberry, basil and English chia seed at Native, London SE1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woodruff, Kentish raspberry, basil and English chia seed at Native, London SE1</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a big space, all wood inside, run by a bunch of young people. Ivan Tisdall-Downes is an up-and-coming chef who\u2019s really interested in foraging, and his business partner, Imogen Davis, trained hawks, so they have a nice story. I\u2019d say Ivan\u2019s style is modern British. I had a dish with roasted bone marrow and white chocolate that I thought sounded wack, but when I started eating it, I realised it really worked; and he made a nice beef tartare with pickled snails. Great food, great cocktails, great staff, a bit of loud music \u2013 it was really relaxing.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://thediningroomabersoch.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Dining Room</a>, Abersoch, Gwynedd</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/16/how-to-crowdfund-a-restaurant-empire\">Gary Usher,</a> chef-owner, Sticky Walnut</em><em> and Hispi</em></p> <p>This restaurant on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula is so underrated. The guy who runs it, Si Toft, is a one-man band \u2013 it\u2019s just him in the kitchen, working around the clock \u2013 and he\u2019s a phenomenal chef. His menus are just beautiful. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s never had any kind of national acclaim. His food takes influences from everywhere, though he does highlight Welsh ingredients. He\u2019s big on fish, because of where he is, and he has things like laverbread on the menu. The lamb tongue dish is amazing \u2013 he does it as a terrine, and deep-fried as well. He has a leek and potato Welsh cake with smoked fish and hollandaise as a starter, and that\u2019s so good. It is genuinely the kind of place you\u2019d want in your area.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Taste-of-Pakistan/238489156283876\" title=\"\">Taste of Pakistan</a>, Hounslow</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Asma Khan, chef-founder, <a href=\"https://www.darjeeling-express.com\" title=\"\">Darjeeling Express</a></em></p> <p>A Pakistani friend of mine told me this was the most authentic food you can get outside Pakistan. If you go in the evening, you must book. It\u2019s a casual restaurant, but so busy, with big tables of people sharing. A large naan arrives on a hook and would serve four or six. The chaapli kebab is the best I\u2019ve had. The owner insisted we have the lamb charsi karahi, and it was the star dish. He and most of the people working there are Pashtun, and the food is similar to Afghan. You can really taste it in the pilau \u2013 it\u2019s very fragrant, with raisins and strips of carrot. The Pashtun have nomadic tribal heritage, and eating on communal tables, in rainy Hounslow, I could imagine myself in the mountains, breaking bread \u2013 it is that kind of food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"6a187fa3d5f4510cd2f7b0f5d5f3e082e8ead145\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a187fa3d5f4510cd2f7b0f5d5f3e082e8ead145/0_44_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lina Stores Soho\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lina Stores Soho</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.linastores.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lina Stores</a>, London W1</strong></h2> <p><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/23/zoe-adjonyoh-ghana-kitchen-ruby-tandoh\">Zoe Adjonyoh</a>, chef-owner, Zoe\u2019s Ghana Kitchen</em></p> <p>My wife Sara and I went to <a href=\"https://www.linastores.co.uk/\">Lina Stores</a> for a rare midweek evening out during the summer and we loved it. The pasta, which is made fresh on site every day, is the best I\u2019ve eaten in London for many years. We loved the ravioli with minted courgette, parmesan cream and salted ricotta. And the ricotta and herb gnudi with sage and brown butter, which transported Sara back to her Italian grandmother\u2019s cooking in New York. This place has flair, modesty and a focus on nuanced flavours and excellent service. It\u2019s not so much for leisurely dining, but for a great meal served quickly before you head out somewhere, it\u2019s ideal.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://artshopandgallery.co.uk/kitchen-at-the-chapel/\" title=\"\">Kitchen at the Chapel</a>, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/17/chefs-guide-to-life-how-to-stay-in-love-sarit-packer-itamar-srulovich-honey-and-co\">Sarit Packer,</a> chef and co-owner, Honey &amp; Co</em></p> <p>We love this quirky place in Abergavenny, an art gallery cafe inside an old chapel that does really delicious food. We\u2019ve spent whole afternoons there escaping the crowds at the Abergavenny food festival. Chef Rosie Sykes helped set it up, which is a great sign. One dish that stood out for me was smoked anchovies and egg mayonnaise on toasted rye bread, served with a beautiful green leaf salad, which they get from a special grower who doesn\u2019t supply to London. I know, because I\u2019ve been trying to steal them. It\u2019s honest food, not fancy at all, in a buzzy, bohemian setting. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sambalshiok.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sambal Shiok</a>, London N7</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/22/chantelle-nicholson-vegan-vegetarian-recipes-peanut-butter-pudding-chocolate-sorbet-tempura-romesco-aquafaba\">Chantelle Nicholson</a>, chef-owner, Tredwells</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0018b7a4bf2e08bb53fcc90ff290c1d6d7623c4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0018b7a4bf2e08bb53fcc90ff290c1d6d7623c4d/0_94_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sambal Shiok Restaurant, Holloway Road, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sambal Shiok Restaurant, Holloway Road, London</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This Malaysian restaurant on the Holloway Road is unassuming but with an amazing energy. It\u2019s always packed. There are no bells or whistles, but you can feel the love the chef-owner, Mandy Yin, puts into everything. She\u2019s famous for her laksa, a spicy, creamy, very comforting soup with noodles, but she also makes delicious curries and amazing fried chicken. The flavour combinations are incredibly vibrant. It\u2019s not a place for a quiet conversation, but the buzz is terrific and I love the food.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SingburiThaiCaf\" title=\"\">Singburi</a>, London E11</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Erchen Chang, co-founder, <a href=\"https://baolondon.com/story/\">Bao and Xu</a></em></p> <p>This is a neighbourhood Thai restaurant that\u2019s cheap and fun and refreshing, and the food is just pure tasty. It\u2019s run by a mother and son. I went a couple of months ago with a big group and we ordered the whole blackboard menu. My favourite dishes were the clam with garlic, chilli and basil, which was simple and classic; the jungle curry crab, which was really dirty and hard to eat (you have to suck on the crab); and boat noodle soup which had that really good medicinal taste from dried roots that\u2019s hard to find in London. The interior is bare. They have some very sensual fruit posters from the 80s on the wall, and photos of customers from years and years ago eating in the restaurant. There\u2019s not much other decoration, but I think that makes the food stand out. I\u2019m moving quite close to Singburi, so it\u2019s going to be my local. I can\u2019t wait.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a827e0595b6f507384dc0f701be2b60a7a193c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a827e0595b6f507384dc0f701be2b60a7a193c2a/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chocolate, scotch bonnet, fermented passion fruit at The Walled Garden, Manchester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chocolate, scotch bonnet, fermented passion fruit at The Walled Garden, Manchester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.veggiechef.co.uk/styled-6/index.html\" title=\"\">The Walled Gardens</a>, Manchester</strong></h2> <p><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Mary-Ellen McTague, chef and co-founder, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/08/the-creameries-manchester-seriously-good-thoughtful-food-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">The Creameries</a></em></p> <p>Eddie Shepherd is a vegetarian chef who runs an underground restaurant from his home in Whalley Range, cooking for eight people per night. (It\u2019s open Friday to Monday, three weekends per month.) He makes multi-course menus that are really technical, with a touch of molecular gastronomy, but fun and delicious as well. He uses his home to really good effect; at one point you\u2019re instructed to go into the living room and one of your courses \u2013 tofu, dandelion, pickled apple \u2013 is hanging from the ceiling in a bauble. He does this amazing thing with mushrooms, which are dried, rehydrated in stock, set into a block with an enzyme, then cooked, smoked and finally marinated again \u2013 they have a flavour closer to charcuterie. He uses a lot of techniques, but my big takeaway is just that it\u2019s really enjoyable and delicious and fun.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.lescargotbleu.co.uk/\" title=\"\">L\u2019Escargot Bleu</a>, Edinburgh</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/14/tom-kitchins-recipe-for-peppered-fillet-steaks\"> Tom Kitchin</a>, chef-</em><em>owner, the Kitchin, the Scran &amp; Scallie</em><em> and the Bonnie Badge<strong>r</strong></em></p> <p>Although it\u2019s been around since 2009, I don\u2019t quite know how much longer L\u2019Escargot Bleu will be slipping under the radar, but it\u2019s one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. Founded by Fred Berkmiller, a Frenchman who has lived and worked in Scotland for many years, the restaurant symbolises everything that\u2019s great about the \u201cAuld Alliance\u201d. When you enter, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve walked into a bistro in the backstreets of Paris, and all of the food is cooked with classic French techniques using Scottish ingredients. They serve a fantastic cassoulet with Scottish meat, as well as a perfect pat\u00e9 de campagne.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tata_eatery/\" title=\"\">T\u00e1 T\u00e1 Eatery at Tay\u0113r/Elementary</a>, London EC1</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Jeremy Chan, head chef and co-owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/ikoyi-london-sw1-restaurant-review\">Ikoyi</a></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c040af31f6a7e1be3741862dcd3f0eba54fc4970\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c040af31f6a7e1be3741862dcd3f0eba54fc4970/204_794_8326_4995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"T\u00e1 T\u00e1 Eatery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">T\u00e1 T\u00e1 Eatery at Tay\u0113r/Elementary, London EC1</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernard Zeija</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>T\u00e1 T\u00e1 Eatery is Zijun Meng and his partner Ana Gon\u00e7alves. If you took the food out of the context, which is very casual, and put it in a fine dining setting, it would stand out above everything else. Meng uses British produce with his Chinese heritage and some of Ana\u2019s Portuguese flavour profiles in beautiful, intricate plates. I really like the way he\u2019ll serve you pork that\u2019s been aged 100 days, and you\u2019re eating something he\u2019s thought about 100 days earlier. It\u2019s the same deep thinking you\u2019d get in the best restaurants but he\u2019s doing it in a cocktail bar, at a four-seater counter. They do the bar food and also a tasting menu. It\u2019s him and a small induction hob, making these beautiful plates of food in a hectic space. It\u2019s a bit rowdy, and it\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s almost showing you how hard London is as a city for entrepreneurial creative chefs like them to survive.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.ultracomida.co.uk\" title=\"\">Ultracomida</a>, Narberth, Pembrokeshire</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Stephen Terry, chef-owner, <a href=\"https://www.thehardwick.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Hardwick</a></em></p> <p>This amazing cheesemonger might seem a bit out of place for Narberth but it sells it all; people travel from miles around.

Quite classic, but modern \u2013 it might have provencal beef shin. The blackboard menu has about four sharing dishes on it and they go much further than it says, which makes it great value.

The thing I like about it is that I don\u2019t have to think too hard. The food is consistent, humble but always delicious. It\u2019s pub classics, very British food: fish pies, hotpots, amazing meat or fish platters, good braising dishes. The menu doesn\u2019t change that often but the special boards change all the time. There are roaring log fires. It\u2019s a relaxed environment, so my young son enjoys going there too, and everybody who comes through is lovely \u2013 walkers, people who have been on a shoot, and dogs are welcome. The big draw is that you can have a walk round the Whitewell, then go and have something good to eat and a nice glass of wine.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://chestersbytheriver.co.uk/index.html\" title=\"\">Chesters by the River</a>, Ambleside, Cumbria</strong><em><strong><br></strong>Chosen by Simon Rogan, chef-owner, <a href=\"https://www.lenclume.co.uk\" title=\"\">L\u2019Enclume</a></em></p> <p>On a day off, I like to go for lunch to this riverside cafe. I sit outside, relax and eat really tasty vegan and vegetarian food. The food has all sorts of influences \u2013 a bit of Moroccan, through to Chinese, biryanis, flame-grilled pizzas \u2013 but the main stars are the vegetables. It\u2019s not doing it justice calling it a cafe, but that\u2019s what it is. You can take away, and there\u2019s a shop associated with it. The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is nice and the quality is great. My staff were always telling me how amazing it was, and it took me a while to get there. Now I can see why they love it.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2020 because an earlier version gave the incorrectly location in Manchester for The Walled Gardens.

      "bodyText": "Silk Road, London SE5 Chosen by James Cochran, chef-owner, Restaurant 1251 I\u2019ve lived in south London for 15 years and the neighbourhood restaurant that stands out is Silk Road in Camberwell. I\u2019m a massive fan of their Xinjiang style of Chinese cooking and they do many unusual things that you don\u2019t normally see in Chinese restaurants in this country. I associate kebabs with Turkish or Greek food, but here they do lamb skewers which they cover in delicious Asian spices and chargrill really quickly. Their dumplings are on point as well. In fact, everything is packed full of flavour, but nicely balanced. The restaurant is very minimalistic, drinks are BYO and the food is very affordable \u2013 spend \u00a320 and you\u2019re full. Inver, Strathlachan, Argyll Chosen by James Lowe, chef and co-founder, Lyle\u2019s and Flor Inver is on a beautiful part of the west coast of Scotland, a couple of hours\u2019 drive from Glasgow. It\u2019s not over the top like some destination restaurants; there\u2019s no desire to create theatrics. The dinner is fantastic, and it\u2019s worth staying so you can have breakfast and its more casual lunch. We went for new year and stayed in a bothy by the water. For dinner, we had seaweed ice-cream with caviar, which was stunning, and an amazing langoustine dish with carrot. Pam Brunton and Rob Latimer run the place: she\u2019s in the kitchen, he runs front of house. I\u2019ve got a lot of admiration for them, because running a restaurant in a remote area is really difficult and they\u2019ve made it work. The Dawnay Arms, Newton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire Chosen by Tommy Banks, head chef, Black Swan I quite like fine dining, but I think what everybody really wants is an awesome Sunday roast and so often it\u2019s disappointing. The Dawnay Arms is incredible. If I haven\u2019t any got any plans for Sunday, I will be there. I\u2019ve gone four weekends in a row before. I like to sit in the front bar because I can take my dog; first we go for a walk by the river, then call into the pub and have a roast. The Smiths run it: Martel is in the kitchen and Kerry runs the front of house. Obviously, we\u2019re blessed up here with good produce, but they use all the best stuff. They don\u2019t charge enough for what they do. I kind of wish I owned it myself \u2013 but then I wouldn\u2019t want to eat there, so I suppose it\u2019s best. Black Radish, London SW19 Chosen by Phil Howard, chef and co-owner, Elystan Street Whatever I eat, I want it to be good. A burger, a curry, truffle langoustine \u2013 I just like delicious food. It\u2019s so often disappointing; inventive-sounding menus that make you think it\u2019s going to be more ego-driven, cheffy rubbish. Here it\u2019s delicious. The chef-owner, Toby Cartwright, is young but full of passion. His cooking is creative, underpinned with understanding, seasonality and, in the most part, classical flavours. It\u2019s a very straightforward space with pleasant decor, and it\u2019s a very happy place to be. And it\u2019s just so nice to be in that kind of environment. St Kew Cafe, Bodmin, Cornwall Chosen by Paul Ainsworth, chef-owner, Paul Ainsworth at No 6 Not far from where I live, near the St Kew highway, is a farm shop with a cafe. My wife Emma and I go there as much as we can, and every time, to our amazement, there\u2019s a table available. It\u2019s probably only a matter of time before more people find out about it and it becomes impossible to find a seat. It\u2019s so welcoming \u2013 the chef will always look up and give you a wave \u2013 and the food is so consistent, even if it\u2019s just a bacon sandwich or a full English. The ethos is to showcase everything Cornish and it uses proper sourdough bread, nice butter, great bacon. Whether avocado with poached eggs on toast or a ham sandwich, the food is brilliant every single time. I can\u2019t believe this is just up the road. It\u2019s fantastic. Native, London SE1 Chosen by Ramael Scully, head chef and co-owner, Scully St James\u2019s It\u2019s a big space, all wood inside, run by a bunch of young people. Ivan Tisdall-Downes is an up-and-coming chef who\u2019s really interested in foraging, and his business partner, Imogen Davis, trained hawks, so they have a nice story. I\u2019d say Ivan\u2019s style is modern British. I had a dish with roasted bone marrow and white chocolate that I thought sounded wack, but when I started eating it, I realised it really worked; and he made a nice beef tartare with pickled snails. Great food, great cocktails, great staff, a bit of loud music \u2013 it was really relaxing. The Dining Room, Abersoch, Gwynedd Chosen by Gary Usher, chef-owner, Sticky Walnut and Hispi This restaurant on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula is so underrated. The guy who runs it, Si Toft, is a one-man band \u2013 it\u2019s just him in the kitchen, working around the clock \u2013 and he\u2019s a phenomenal chef. His menus are just beautiful. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s never had any kind of national acclaim. His food takes influences from everywhere, though he does highlight Welsh ingredients. He\u2019s big on fish, because of where he is, and he has things like laverbread on the menu. The lamb tongue dish is amazing \u2013 he does it as a terrine, and deep-fried as well. He has a leek and potato Welsh cake with smoked fish and hollandaise as a starter, and that\u2019s so good. It is genuinely the kind of place you\u2019d want in your area. Taste of Pakistan, Hounslow Chosen by Asma Khan, chef-founder, Darjeeling Express A Pakistani friend of mine told me this was the most authentic food you can get outside Pakistan. If you go in the evening, you must book. It\u2019s a casual restaurant, but so busy, with big tables of people sharing. A large naan arrives on a hook and would serve four or six. The chaapli kebab is the best I\u2019ve had. The owner insisted we have the lamb charsi karahi, and it was the star dish. He and most of the people working there are Pashtun, and the food is similar to Afghan. You can really taste it in the pilau \u2013 it\u2019s very fragrant, with raisins and strips of carrot. The Pashtun have nomadic tribal heritage, and eating on communal tables, in rainy Hounslow, I could imagine myself in the mountains, breaking bread \u2013 it is that kind of food. Lina Stores, London W1 Chosen by Zoe Adjonyoh, chef-owner, Zoe\u2019s Ghana Kitchen My wife Sara and I went to Lina Stores for a rare midweek evening out during the summer and we loved it. The pasta, which is made fresh on site every day, is the best I\u2019ve eaten in London for many years. We loved the ravioli with minted courgette, parmesan cream and salted ricotta. And the ricotta and herb gnudi with sage and brown butter, which transported Sara back to her Italian grandmother\u2019s cooking in New York. This place has flair, modesty and a focus on nuanced flavours and excellent service. It\u2019s not so much for leisurely dining, but for a great meal served quickly before you head out somewhere, it\u2019s ideal. Kitchen at the Chapel, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire Chosen by Sarit Packer, chef and co-owner, Honey &amp; Co We love this quirky place in Abergavenny, an art gallery cafe inside an old chapel that does really delicious food. We\u2019ve spent whole afternoons there escaping the crowds at the Abergavenny food festival. Chef Rosie Sykes helped set it up, which is a great sign. One dish that stood out for me was smoked anchovies and egg mayonnaise on toasted rye bread, served with a beautiful green leaf salad, which they get from a special grower who doesn\u2019t supply to London. I know, because I\u2019ve been trying to steal them. It\u2019s honest food, not fancy at all, in a buzzy, bohemian setting. Sambal Shiok, London N7 Chosen by Chantelle Nicholson, chef-owner, Tredwells This Malaysian restaurant on the Holloway Road is unassuming but with an amazing energy. It\u2019s always packed. There are no bells or whistles, but you can feel the love the chef-owner, Mandy Yin, puts into everything. She\u2019s famous for her laksa, a spicy, creamy, very comforting soup with noodles, but she also makes delicious curries and amazing fried chicken. The flavour combinations are incredibly vibrant. It\u2019s not a place for a quiet conversation, but the buzz is terrific and I love the food. Singburi, London E11 Chosen by Erchen Chang, co-founder, Bao and Xu This is a neighbourhood Thai restaurant that\u2019s cheap and fun and refreshing, and the food is just pure tasty. It\u2019s run by a mother and son. I went a couple of months ago with a big group and we ordered the whole blackboard menu. My favourite dishes were the clam with garlic, chilli and basil, which was simple and classic; the jungle curry crab, which was really dirty and hard to eat (you have to suck on the crab); and boat noodle soup which had that really good medicinal taste from dried roots that\u2019s hard to find in London. The interior is bare. They have some very sensual fruit posters from the 80s on the wall, and photos of customers from years and years ago eating in the restaurant. There\u2019s not much other decoration, but I think that makes the food stand out. I\u2019m moving quite close to Singburi, so it\u2019s going to be my local. I can\u2019t wait. The Walled Gardens, Manchester Chosen by Mary-Ellen McTague, chef and co-founder, The Creameries Eddie Shepherd is a vegetarian chef who runs an underground restaurant from his home in Whalley Range, cooking for eight people per night. (It\u2019s open Friday to Monday, three weekends per month.) He makes multi-course menus that are really technical, with a touch of molecular gastronomy, but fun and delicious as well. He uses his home to really good effect; at one point you\u2019re instructed to go into the living room and one of your courses \u2013 tofu, dandelion, pickled apple \u2013 is hanging from the ceiling in a bauble. He does this amazing thing with mushrooms, which are dried, rehydrated in stock, set into a block with an enzyme, then cooked, smoked and finally marinated again \u2013 they have a flavour closer to charcuterie. He uses a lot of techniques, but my big takeaway is just that it\u2019s really enjoyable and delicious and fun. L\u2019Escargot Bleu, Edinburgh Chosen by Tom Kitchin, chef-owner, the Kitchin, the Scran &amp; Scallie and the Bonnie Badger Although it\u2019s been around since 2009, I don\u2019t quite know how much longer L\u2019Escargot Bleu will be slipping under the radar, but it\u2019s one of my favourite restaurants in Edinburgh. Founded by Fred Berkmiller, a Frenchman who has lived and worked in Scotland for many years, the restaurant symbolises everything that\u2019s great about the \u201cAuld Alliance\u201d. When you enter, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve walked into a bistro in the backstreets of Paris, and all of the food is cooked with classic French techniques using Scottish ingredients. They serve a fantastic cassoulet with Scottish meat, as well as a perfect pat\u00e9 de campagne. T\u00e1 T\u00e1 Eatery at Tay\u0113r/Elementary, London EC1 Chosen by Jeremy Chan, head chef and co-owner, Ikoyi T\u00e1 T\u00e1 Eatery is Zijun Meng and his partner Ana Gon\u00e7alves. If you took the food out of the context, which is very casual, and put it in a fine dining setting, it would stand out above everything else. Meng uses British produce with his Chinese heritage and some of Ana\u2019s Portuguese flavour profiles in beautiful, intricate plates. I really like the way he\u2019ll serve you pork that\u2019s been aged 100 days, and you\u2019re eating something he\u2019s thought about 100 days earlier. It\u2019s the same deep thinking you\u2019d get in the best restaurants but he\u2019s doing it in a cocktail bar, at a four-seater counter. They do the bar food and also a tasting menu. It\u2019s him and a small induction hob, making these beautiful plates of food in a hectic space. It\u2019s a bit rowdy, and it\u2019s fun. But it\u2019s almost showing you how hard London is as a city for entrepreneurial creative chefs like them to survive. Ultracomida, Narberth, Pembrokeshire Chosen by Stephen Terry, chef-owner, the Hardwick This amazing cheesemonger might seem a bit out of place for Narberth but it sells it all; people travel from miles around. And it has a cafe with communal seating \u2013 everyone sits along these two big tables and a counter. It does nice simple things \u2013 great meatballs! \u2013 with Welsh and Spanish ingredients and it serves the wine it imports, which you can also buy in the deli along with Spanish items and local stuff. Just really nice people. Perilla, London N16 Chosen by Selin Kiazim, chef-director, Oklava There\u2019s some amazing cooking going on in this warm, buzzy dining room. Ben Marks is a very talented chef and plates up the most beautiful dishes. The influences are more on the European side, but it\u2019s quite an eclectic mix. Last time I went I had a canape-sized mouthful of yesterday\u2019s bread soaked in a moules mariniere sauce \u2013 the best bit right there \u2013 and battered hake fried in beef fat with chip-shop curry sauce. It has a neighbourhood vibe, but is also a great place for an occasion: big windows that wrap around; beautiful plants everywhere. There\u2019s a small bar area too, which is where I ate, looking through to Ben plating up. The Canton Arms, London SW8 Chosen by Margot Henderson, chef and co-owner, Rochelle Canteen This is my local, and has everything I enjoy about a pub: it\u2019s friendly, warm and not too flashy. It\u2019s familiar, and perfect on a rainy day. On top of that, it has great drinks and superb food. The dining room is cosy, with the most delicious menu \u2013 I always love the way it reads. Quite classic, but modern \u2013 it might have provencal beef shin. The blackboard menu has about four sharing dishes on it and they go much further than it says, which makes it great value. It\u2019s gentle food for families and friends, served in big Le Creuset dishes, with a generous spirit. The Inn at Whitewell, near Clitheroe, Lancs Chosen by Lisa Goodwin-Allen, executive chef, Northcote We go to this pub in the Ribble Valley a lot, a beautiful part of the world. The thing I like about it is that I don\u2019t have to think too hard. The food is consistent, humble but always delicious. It\u2019s pub classics, very British food: fish pies, hotpots, amazing meat or fish platters, good braising dishes. The menu doesn\u2019t change that often but the special boards change all the time. There are roaring log fires. It\u2019s a relaxed environment, so my young son enjoys going there too, and everybody who comes through is lovely \u2013 walkers, people who have been on a shoot, and dogs are welcome. The big draw is that you can have a walk round the Whitewell, then go and have something good to eat and a nice glass of wine. Chesters by the River, Ambleside, Cumbria Chosen by Simon Rogan, chef-owner, L\u2019Enclume On a day off, I like to go for lunch to this riverside cafe. I sit outside, relax and eat really tasty vegan and vegetarian food. The food has all sorts of influences \u2013 a bit of Moroccan, through to Chinese, biryanis, flame-grilled pizzas \u2013 but the main stars are the vegetables.

      "body": "<p>There has never been a better time to be a screenwriter. This is what playwright and screenwriter Lucy Prebble describes as \u201ca golden age of television\u201d. Alongside established channels, new streaming services such as Apple and Disney jostle competitively with Amazon and Netflix for viewers and hits. \u201cThey\u2019re approaching everybody, going: work for us, work for us, work for us,\u201d Prebble says (in her case, this is no surprise as, with HBO\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em>, she is, as writer and co-executive producer, the hottest of properties).</p> <p>And yet, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/may/23/women-in-british-film-tv-writers-guild-inequality\" title=\"\">report</a> from May 2018 on gender inequality, which gathered data for more than 10 years, revealed that only 28% of all UK TV episodes were written by women (a dire statistic that has begun to shift with more top female screenwriters \u2013 among them Phoebe Waller-Bridge, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/michaela-coel\" title=\"\">Michaela Coel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sharonhorgan\" title=\"\">Sharon Horgan</a> \u2013 making headlines). A 2018 open letter from female TV writers to drama commissioners noted, too, that \u201cour BAME colleagues are consistently conspicuous by their absence.\u201d Film director Steve McQueen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/12/steve-mcqueen-baftas-lack-of-diversity\" title=\"\">recent outburst</a> against the controversially non-diverse Bafta film awards could equally have been lobbed at television commissioners. The industry remains claustrophobically elitist. It is depressing to hear Paul Abbott and his mentor describing script editors at the BBC as predominantly Oxbridge, even if Abbott concedes that this is starting to change.</p> <p>How do you identify screenwriters who will truthfully reflect contemporary UK society on TV? And once you\u2019ve found the talent, how can new writers be helped? For let\u2019s not be fooled: despite the demand for screenplays, it remains hard for newcomers to break in. This is where a new TV bursary scheme, funded by the industry body <a href=\"https://www.screenskills.com/\" title=\"\">ScreenSkills</a> with the UK-based production company <a href=\"http://www.dancingledgeproductions.co.uk/home/\" title=\"\">Dancing Ledge</a>, comes in. The proactive idea of the ScreenSkills New Writers Programme has been to invite a selection of Britain\u2019s top screenwriters to mentor a writer of their choice.</p> <p>The scheme was not set up just to help with developing scripts. It is about industry introductions and \u2013 \u201cthe biggest hurdle\u201d \u2013 getting commissions. ScreenSkills\u2019 Kaye Elliott explains that because of the huge sums of money involved in producing prime-time TV, producers are nervous about the gamble of investing in new talent. Jack Thorne who, like Prebble, is not about to be out of a job, urges the industry to commission more \u201centry-level dramas built around new voices\u201d. And Paul Abbott makes the point that \u201c\u2018commercially ready\u2019 should not a be dirty phrase. You need to teach writers to be ready to sell.\u201d Laurence Bowen CEO of Dancing Ledge emphasises that the \u201cgenius\u201d of the scheme is the \u201cnurturing, cherishing and support.\u201d</p> <p>I met a selection from the remarkable group of mentors and mentees at a London hotel: Paul Abbott mentoring Yero Timi-Biu; Jed Mercurio mentoring Daniel Brierley; Lucy Prebble mentoring Temi Wilkey; Jimmy McGovern mentoring Tony Schumacher; Jack Thorne mentoring Sharma Walfall, Levi David Addai mentoring Nic\u00f4le Lecky; Amanda Coe mentoring Rose Cartwright; Kay Mellor mentoring Grace Night, Sally Wainwright mentoring Scott Mather.</p> <p>Brilliant young, female writers (some of them interviewed )below \u2013 hearteningly \u2013 abounded. There was also 52-year-old Liverpudlian original Tony Schumacher, new to scriptwriting, who made me laugh, telling me how Jimmy McGovern , first over a pint and then after several days in McGovern\u2019s kitchen (\u201cJimmy\u2019s a great listener which is what makes him a great writer\u201d), encouraged him to write a screenplay about his life. Schumacher is an ex-copper who had a breakdown, became homeless, and went on to become a salesman all over the world \u2013\u201cunderpants in the Caribbean, trucks in the UK, jewellery\u2026\u201d \u2013 before becoming a writer. I was also fascinated by the fearless articulacy and courage of Rose Cartwright, author of the C4 series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/30/pure-o-ocd-review-brave-brilliant-miracle-mental-health-sex\" title=\"\">Pure</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/30/pure-o-ocd-review-brave-brilliant-miracle-mental-health-sex\" title=\"\"> </a>about a form of OCD that involves not being able to suppress inappropriate sexual thoughts and now exploring a new subject.

And is what they choose to write about exciting? If you have both things, you\u2019re a real writer. Temi can do both.\u201d And that is not all she can do. When Prebble first met her, it was after watching her act in a <a href=\"https://www.thecoronettheatre.com/whats-on/act-and-terminal-3/\" title=\"\">Lars </a><a href=\"https://www.thecoronettheatre.com/whats-on/act-and-terminal-3/\" title=\"\">Nor\u00e9n double bill</a> at west London\u2019s Coronet theatre, directed by Anthony Nielson (Prebble\u2019s partner). Prebble could see that, as an actor, she was \u201ccompelling yet vulnerable\u201d.</p> <p>Wilkey is a Cambridge University English graduate who trained with the National Youth Theatre\u2019s rep company, has acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company and at the National Theatre and founded <a href=\"https://www.pecsdragkings.com/\" title=\"\">Pecs</a>, a drag king theatre company that explores gender and sexuality in sellout shows.</p> <p>As the two women chatted in the Coronet bar that night, Wilkey had no clue who she was talking to until the conversation turned to <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em>, the HBO series (which has won Bafta, Golden Globe and Emmy awards) on which Prebble is co-executive producer and writer. \u201cYou\u2019re Lucy <em>Prebble</em>?\u201d Wilkey gasped. Prebble, meanwhile, had noted Wilkey\u2019s \u201cstrong take on contemporary issues\u201d and found her very funny. \u201cI really liked her. She had a lot to say about things not talked about enough \u2013 to do with her generation and sexuality and politics.\u201d</p> <p>For Prebble, this is key. To write a good play you need to identify \u201ca gap between what you see in the world and what is being truthfully represented on stage\u201d and \u201crush to fill it\u201d. That is what she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/05/lucy-prebble-playwright-interview-enron\" title=\"\">achieved so brilliantly with </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/jul/05/lucy-prebble-playwright-interview-enron\" title=\"\">Enron</a></em> (2009), <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/nov/14/the-effect-lucy-prebble-review\" title=\"\">The Effect</a></em> (2012) and, most recently, with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/15/theatre-a-very-expensive-poison-a-dolls-house-lyric-hammersmith-hedda-tesman-review\" title=\"\">A Very Expensive Poison</a></em>, based on the assassination of the Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. She has also written and co-created with her friend Billie Piper <em>I Hate Suzie</em> for Sky Atlantic, which will air later this year. It is important, she believes, to be obsessed with your subject and not to make the mistake of committing yourself to a project if your heart is not in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21857d5037f6bd7eff857470e7a29a833a442c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21857d5037f6bd7eff857470e7a29a833a442c33/0_337_5196_3118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Succession\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy Prebble is a writer and co-executive producer on HBO\u2019s Succession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is a saying,\u201d Prebble continues, \u201cthat you can do a new thing in an old way or an old thing in a new way. Occasionally, you can do a new thing in a new way \u2013 and that\u2019s what Temi has been brave enough to do.\u201d <em>The High Table</em> is about a lesbian marriage that the Nigerian parents of one of the women refuse to attend. It is only when the ancestors get involved that the tables \u2013 high or not \u2013 have a chance of being turned.</p> <p>Wilkey, 27, has a radiantly intelligent presence. She grew up in the suburbs of north London, the daughter of Nigerian parents. As a child, she was always \u201cscribbling poems \u2013 which, because I grew up as a Christian, were probably a bit elegiac.\u201d Prebble laughs: \u201cI wrote terrible poetry too \u2013 really angsty.\u201d It was at Cambridge that Wilkey\u2019s thinking about religion changed and she discovered her bisexuality. And it was through Pecs \u2013 although she appreciates the collaborative pleasures of devising \u2013 that she developed a hunger to find a \u201csingular voice\u201d. In 2017, she got on to the Royal Court playwriting course: \u201cIt was brilliant and felt like group therapy \u2013 because I never thought I\u2019d finish a play.\u201d</p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.screenskills.com/\" title=\"\">ScreenSkills</a> scheme, she is writing a script about an assassin\u2019s assistant who is only in it for the money. Prebble has made \u201camazing suggestions\u201d including reading graphic novels for inspiration and offering ways to make the script more realistic and original. But she is not, Prebble insists, telling Wilkey how to write. She sees a mentor\u2019s aim as enabling a voice to become more like itself, to help writers say what they want to say.</p> <p>Prebble regrets never having had a mentor herself. Her protectiveness towards Wilkey is sympathetic. She talks about the importance of emotional support as well as practical help and suggests that female writers can be taken for a ride when they do not understand the industry. \u201cAs an experienced and mature artist and woman, I look back at things that have happened to me and think: \u2018That was not normal.\u2019 I wish I\u2019d had someone to ask at the time: \u2018Is it normal? Is it all right\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>She talks about the need for a thick skin in a cut-throat industry: \u201cUnfortunately, it is the inevitable battering that brings about a thick skin. That\u2019s why it matters so much to find people who care that you are OK.\u201d Wilkey\u2019s level-headed rejoinder is that as an actor she has been trained to expect rejection.</p> <p>Prebble got the taste for playwriting while she was studying English at Sheffield University. Some students who she considered more glamorous and cool than she was, commissioned her to write a play. \u201cI wanted to impress them but had never shown anyone anything I\u2019d written. Writing was very private \u2013 shoebox-under-the-bed.\u201d The play was called <em>Liquid</em> \u2013 and \u201cquite bad\u201d. Then, in 2002, her first professional play, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/oct/21/theatre\" title=\"\">The Sugar Syndrome</a></em>, about paedophile chat rooms, was produced at the Royal Court and won several awards.</p> <p>In Temi Wilkey\u2019s life, everything is happening at once: the acting work, <em>High Table</em>, hosting a podcast with the Bush theatre, and she has recently been in a writers room for Series 3 of Netflix\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/sex-education-season-two\" title=\"\">Sex Education</a></em> which helped teach her \u201cnot to be afraid of my own ideas\u201d. You might think there\u2019d be no time left to work on a new script but my bet is that the more Wilkey does, the more she will do. She is exceptionally focused and, as she later explains in an email, motivated by \u201cthe importance of human connection, the way telling stories brings people together, helps people empathise with people they would not ordinarily understand and the belief that generally \u2013 deep down \u2013 people are essentially good, trying to do their best\u201d. <strong>KK</strong></p> <h2>Levi David Addai &amp; Nic\u00f4le Lecky: \u2018You can always feel that her characters are rooted in something powerful\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed76fac5566d567187ee283d5829438d64741b38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed76fac5566d567187ee283d5829438d64741b38/0_55_5514_4054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"mentor Levi David Addai with Nic\u00f4le Lecky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s so much talent out there that isn\u2019t getting a platform\u2019: mentor Levi David Addai with Nic\u00f4le Lecky.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Best known for </strong><em><strong>Damilola, Our Loved Boy</strong></em><strong>, Levi David Addai first met Nic\u00f4le Lecky a decade ago</strong></p> <p>When one of Nic\u00f4le Lecky\u2019s family members moved house not long ago, they presented her with a box they had found of her early writing. It contained reams and reams of stories, songs, poems and illustrations she had written as a child, as well as a newspaper called <em>Lecky of the World</em>. \u201cLiterally, this big 40-page newspaper,\u201d she recalls, laughing. \u201cI\u2019d written all these fake news articles \u2013 what was I doing? Very bored child. Didn\u2019t have phones then.\u201d</p> <p>Now 29, Lecky continues to create stories, albeit on a slightly larger scale. Last year she performed her first play, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/05/superhoe-review-royal-court-london-nicole-lecky\" title=\"\">Superhoe</a></em>, a nuanced one-woman show about sex work, empowerment and exploitation, to great acclaim at the Royal Court. She has written for the BBC3 <em>East</em><em>Enders </em>spin-off, <em>E20</em>, and a short film, <em>The Moor Girl</em>, which she also directed. Her acting credits include <em>Death in Paradise</em>, <em>Fresh Meat</em> and the Wachowskis\u2019 <em>Sense8</em>. Over the past year, she has been mentored by the playwright and screenwriter Levi David Addai, whose work includes Bafta-winning television film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/07/our-loved-boy-damilola-taylor-murder-bbc\" title=\"\">Damilola</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/07/our-loved-boy-damilola-taylor-murder-bbc\" title=\"\">, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/07/our-loved-boy-damilola-taylor-murder-bbc\" title=\"\">Our Loved Boy</a></em>, E4 comedy drama <em>Youngers</em>, and most recently BBC One\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/01/dark-review-a-classy-knotty-time-travelling-whodunnit-for-tv\" title=\"\">Dark Money</a></em>, a fictional account of a minor abused by a Hollywood film producer, written before the #MeToo scandal broke.</p> <p>Addai and Lecky first met a decade ago, when she did a reading for one of his plays. At the time, she still didn\u2019t consider herself a writer. \u201cI was dabbling: I\u2019d written a little bit, but I was saying \u2018I\u2019m an actress\u2019, and writing in private.\u201d It took years for her to admit even to herself that she was a writer. \u201cMaybe it didn\u2019t feel like a realistic career. Where I\u2019m from, which is Stratford [in east London], no one said to me: \u2018You should write for television or film.\u2019 If you\u2019re good at drama, people go: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re an actress.\u2019\u201d Although she could see people on the television, she couldn\u2019t see behind the screen at who was writing and how they were making a living out of it.</p> <p>The idea of being a writer began its \u201cslow trickle\u201d into her brain when she saw a play by Bola Agbaje at the Royal Court theatre, London, when she was a teenager. Eventually, it dawned on her that writing could be a realistic proposition: \u201cIt was just: I know I\u2019m a writer \u2013 I keep on writing, and I really enjoy it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26da708e05779e37ad22aea795c1968dda9d5350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26da708e05779e37ad22aea795c1968dda9d5350/0_79_4300_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Levi David Addai wrote the screenplay for the 2016 BBC drama Our Loved Boy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Levi David Addai wrote the screenplay for the 2016 BBC drama Damilola, Our Loved Boy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Minnow Films/Joe Albas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Originally enrolled for war studies at King\u2019s College London, she switched to drama at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in south London. Encountering students who could rely on their parents for finances and connections was a culture shock, but her own parents \u2013 a nurse and a DJ \u2013\u201cinstilled a kind of confidence in me that has made me feel enabled to walk into certain rooms and go: \u2018Actually I don\u2019t care where I\u2019m from, or what you might think of me. I\u2019m here and this is what I want to do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Addai says he chose Lecky as his mentee because she is \u201cone of the most talented young writers, actresses, singer-songwriters in the country right now\u201d. He responds to her work because \u201cshe writes from characters first \u2013 there\u2019s a real strength within them. Whether they\u2019re minor characters or whether it\u2019s the lead, you can always feel that they\u2019re rooted in something powerful, which, to be honest, I don\u2019t really see that often.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAnd it helps that she\u2019s a decent human being as well.\u201d</p> <p>There is a palpable sense of affection and respect between the two. When Addai talks about the limitations of mentorship \u2013 that he is able to offer guidance but not give young writers a show \u2013 Lecky interrupts with mock outrage: \u201cWhat? What am I doing here if I\u2019m not getting a show?\u201d The two go way back: when <em>Youngers </em>started in 2013, Lecky enjoyed it so much that she wrote an episode of it \u201cfor fun\u201d, and sent it to Addai saying: \u201cI\u2019ve written a fake episode of your show.\u201d (She was then brought in for a young writers scheme; she has a writing credit for a 2014 episode.)</p> <p>Going to events with Addai, Lecky noticed that he is often approached by young writers for advice and that he \u201cgives people time \u2013 every time\u201d. \u201cI remember what that was like,\u201d he says, \u201ccoming into the industry as a young black professional. There\u2019s so much talent out there that isn\u2019t getting a platform. So now that I\u2019ve got a little bit of influence I have the opportunity to say: \u2018Can we try this person?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Addai clearly has an eye for talent: over the years, he has worked with then unknown performers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/27/arinze-kene-interview-misty-death-of-a-salesman\" title=\"\">Arinz\u00e9 Kene</a> (best known for his stage show <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/mar/26/misty-review-vivid-vision-of-the-virus-infecting-city-life\" title=\"\">Misty</a></em>), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/daniel-kaluuya\" title=\"\">Daniel Kaluuya</a> (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/get-out-review-jordan-peele-racism-america\" title=\"\">Get Out</a></em>) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/john-boyega\" title=\"\">John Boyega</a> (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/starwars\" title=\"\">Star Wars</a></em>). What does it mean to him to see them go on to do so well?</p> <p>\u201cOh, everything,\u201d he beams. \u201cYou\u2019re pointing people out and saying \u2018I think they can do something big\u2019, and at this point they haven\u2019t really got a CV or something for people to be: \u2018Yeah, I believe that too.\u2019 With a writer like Nic\u00f4le, it\u2019s like: \u2018She\u2019s the real deal. Trust me.\u2019 And it\u2019s not because she\u2019s won thousands of awards or done a thousand bits of work. It\u2019s an instinct and a feeling. I feel really proud, giving Nic\u00f4le the opportunity, but now it\u2019s up to her to run with it.\u201d He wags his finger at her, pretend-serious. \u201cDon\u2019t bring my name to disrepute \u2013 behave yourself out there.\u201d</p> <p>But he doesn\u2019t look worried. Both he and Lecky have a number of projects in the works for theatre and television, which they can\u2019t quite go into detail about yet. Lecky smiles. \u201cWatch this space.

He was introduced to Yero Timi-Biu\u2019s work by a colleague</strong></p> <p>On the face of it, the odds were against Paul Abbott becoming one of the UK\u2019s leading TV screenwriters. A working-class boy from Burnley, he and his nine siblings were abandoned by their parents before he had even hit his teens. Now, about to turn 60, he is in a sense still fending for himself with a restless, mischievous articulacy, as though mindful that, in the television industry, there is no point at which it is safe to stop singing for your supper. He has worked in TV for more than 30 years, making his name on <em>Coronation Street</em> and with<em> </em><em>Cracker</em>, <em>State of Play </em>and more recently <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/24/state-of-play-boxset-review\" title=\"\">No Offence</a></em>, but is best known as the genius behind <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shameless\" title=\"\">Shameless</a></em> \u2013 about the comic and dysfunctional Gallagher family. Standing beside him, 27-year-old Yero Timi-Biu comes across as a smiling, anchored, unskittish presence \u2013 as though, were you to blink, the mentor/mentee roles might almost be reversed.</p> <p>It is not how Yero Timi-Biu sees herself. She admits to having \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d, and it is troubling how often this phrase came up among the young screenwriters I interviewed. She was born in east London, daughter of \u201camazing\u201d parents who worked in the public and voluntary sectors, tackling hate crime and community regeneration. She lives in Margate now (when not in Los Angeles). She admits with a laugh: \u201cI hate going to meetings where you have to sell yourself to production companies. I always get dehydrated and feel really weak afterwards but as a writer, you are also like a personal brand \u2013 your ideas are your currency.\u201d</p> <p>Timi-Biu\u2019s ideas involve characters at one remove from society because of mental health or other issues. \u201cI am motivated to tell the stories of the everyday horrors of life to make them accessible,\u201d she says. As a schoolgirl, she had ME so severely she was asked to leave school and sit her GCSEs at home. She spent a lot of time reading and watching television: a useful immersion for a writer. She started writing at 20 and in 2018 she won the BFI Future Film festival new talent award for her ICA London/Channel 4 comedy drama <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suh4I6pi4yc\" title=\"\">Beneath the Surface</a></em>, for which she was writer, director and producer, which led to another Channel 4 short film, <em><a href=\"https://randomacts.channel4.com/post/168184173261/two-minutes-adebanji-alade-and-yero\" title=\"\">Two Minutes</a></em>, in collaboration with the illustrator Adebanji Alade.

It is about a teenager left in charge of her senile grandfather and seven-year-old sister. It has a touching humanity and confirms a point she makes herself: \u201cThe best thing about dialogue in TV is what\u2019s left unsaid.\u201d</p> <p>Timi-Biu is currently working on an ambitious series about the fashion industry. At 16, she got a place on a BBC documentary, <em>Your Label</em> (an early sign of her ability to compete), in which teenagers from around the UK made their own fashion label. She went on to study at the London School of Fashion but then decided she\u2019d taken wrong turn: \u201cWhen you get into interning \u2013 running around central London with thousands of pounds worth of clothes from designer stores, you realise: what am I doing to change the world?\u201d</p> <p>Everything is grist to a writer\u2019s mill. Things that go wrong in life sometimes go right in writing. She told herself: \u201cThis life experience might make a really funny script one day.\u201d After graduating, in 2013, \u201cI ended up going to New York because I found a writing course that cost \u00a3420, can you believe it? And I had an amazing time there. It was great to be outside my comfort zone. I was 21 and everyone in my class was a bestselling author. I\u2019d just Googled the course.\u201d</p> <p>Abbott immediately saw her potential: \u201cYero has an authenticity, an extra twang of talent that made us [she was picked out initially by Abbott\u2019s colleague Henry Swindell] leap on her because, ultimately, a twang of talent translates to millions of pounds down the line.\u201d And on the subject of money, he says that it\u2019s essential to educate young writers about the industry\u2019s commercial side. He explains that the jump from working on a script to seeing it in production is challenging: \u201cKnowing what to do when you get a green light on something is quite shocking to some people. They can\u2019t cope with it.\u201d He recalls his own vertiginous pride on realising that 200 people were being employed because of what he had written and that \u201ceven the butty trolley\u201d was down to him. Abbott will make sure Yero knows which side her butty is buttered.</p> <p>He also has tips on the writing process \u2013 mainly emphasising that it is a process.</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing you teach anybody is that good writing is rewriting.\u201d Many young writers fail to see their first draft is precisely that. Overwriting is common: \u201cThere used to be a phrase we used on <em>Coronation Street</em>: \u2018Buying the milk to make the tea.\u2019 You\u2019d see Mavis Riley buying the milk in the shop in the morning saying: \u2018Derek is due home at lunchtime, we\u2019ve not seen each other for three weeks blah blah blah.\u2019 Then you\u2019d get a tea-making scene where Derek comes home and then the scene in the pub afterwards where she says: \u2018Derek came home this afternoon, it\u2019s been such a long time.\u2019 And you\u2019d think: will you shut the fuck up?!\u201d Fortunately, Timi-Biu knows how to make the metaphorical tea without fuss: she worked as assistant editor on <em>Holby</em> <em>City</em> (another hugely competitive BBC scheme).</p> <p>But the importance of this mentoring programme for her is, most of all, about the power of a name. And Abbott knows all about this from his own experience. His career was launched in 1982 with a <em>Radio Times</em> drama competition where an endorsement from a writer in the industry was an entry requirement. Abbott wrote to Alan Bennett, asking him to read his script, and Bennett replied telling Abbott his play was \u201cnot the masterpiece you think it is\u201d but said that he would be happy to put his name to it. Today, Timi-Biu is hopeful because she has not only Paul Abbott\u2019s name but his production company, behind her (AbbottVision is Cheshire-based and with a writers studio attached). The company will help sell her series: \u201cI have some broadcasters in mind and have had some interest \u2013 but it is all top secret.\u201d <strong>KK</strong></p> <h2>Jack Thorne &amp; Sharma Walfall: \u2018I\u2019m driven to tell stories that you don\u2019t often see depicted on TV\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13021a311c02cdedc559a0f0a70772013a7405c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13021a311c02cdedc559a0f0a70772013a7405c3/0_212_6020_4039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018When I pitched my idea to Jack, he really made me feel at ease\u2019: Sharma Walfall with her mentor, Jack Thorne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"671\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I pitched my idea to Jack, he really made me feel at ease\u2019: Sharma Walfall with her mentor, Jack Thorne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Jack Thorne\u2019s prolific output includes </strong><em><strong>This Is England</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>National Treasure </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>His Dark Materials</strong></em><strong>. He first heard of Walfall via his agent</strong></p> <p>The first time Sharma Walfall saw the name of her mentor \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/jack-thorne\" title=\"\">Jack Thorne</a> \u2013 pop up on her mobile phone, she felt \u201creally nervous\u201d but she needn\u2019t have worried. For Thorne, who has recently been described as the \u201cbard of Britain\u2026 to modern British TV what Charles Dickens was to the Victorian novel\u201d (the <em>Economist</em>) and who has won five Baftas (so far), is chronically modest. It is part of what makes him likable. He has also been described as the hardest-working stage and screenwriter in Britain. And at 6ft 5in, he is one of the tallest, with a foldaway look as though he hoped to disappear. His most recent work is typically miscellaneous: the stage play<em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child\" title=\"\">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></em> (which won a Tony award), a forthcoming film of <em>The Secret Garden</em> with Colin Firth, the screenplay for the BBC/HBO television version of Philip Pullman\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/10/his-dark-materials-review-britannia-dublin-murders-arena-british-guide-to-end-of-the-world-fing\" title=\"\">His Dark Materials</a></em>. At any one time, he is usually working on at least three projects. Mentors do not come more laden with laurels.</p> <p>Sharma Walfall is an actor/writer with a Mancunian sense of humour, a direct style and bags of flair. She was brought up in a single-parent household (her mother was a teaching assistant) in Longsight, Manchester \u201cwith my little brother and just around the corner from my grandparents, where I spent most of my time\u201d. She is developing a number of original series ideas including <em>Out of Bounds </em>and <em>Ruby</em>, a drama with Red Planet pictures. She also worked for three months on <em>Emmerdale</em>. But it was winning a <a href=\"http://northernwritersawards.com/winners/profile/sharma-walfall/\" title=\"\">Northern Writers award in 2015</a>, and then going on to be commissioned to write an episode of <em>Hollyoaks</em> \u2013 her first TV credit \u2013 that launched her.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I pitched my idea to Jack, he really made me feel at ease,\u201d she tells me. The idea was for a series \u2013 <em>The Pru</em>: \u201cI\u2019ve worked as a teaching assistant in a pupil referral unit (PRU) and my drama is around that.\u201d According to Thorne \u2013 who came across Walfall via a recommendation from his agent\u2019s colleague \u2013 her recreation of that world is brilliant and she has an instinctive talent for dialogue: \u201cSharma describes the complication of these kids. We live in this broken and embittered country and this is about broken and embittered kids. It tells the truth of how difficult these places are and how hard it is for kids to get back on their feet. Yet there are glimmers of hope and humanity \u2013 it\u2019s also a celebration.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436fedbca35ef980c7827d131eb326965d68f1e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436fedbca35ef980c7827d131eb326965d68f1e8/127_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"His Dark Materials\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Thorne wrote the screenplay for the BBC/HBO adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Bad Wolf/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People have fixed ideas about the children in these institutions, Walfall says: \u201cI went in with a high level of respect. That\u2019s why the kids treated me differently. Young people in a bad situation make light of it with banter. They try to put their best foot forward.\u201d Thorne underlines Walfall\u2019s advantage over writers from posher backgrounds, imagining worlds they have not experienced, convinced that misery alone brings their stories to life.</p> <p>Initially, Walfall envisaged a \u201cdark comedy\u201d but Thorne asked: \u201cHave you done comedy before?\u201d and advised her to stick to what she knew. He understands how experience lends authority: while at Cambridge University studying politics, he became bedbound with a rare disabling skin condition and it was talking about this experience that helped sell his film <em>Wonder</em>, about a boy who has Treacher Collins syndrome, to Hollywood.</p> <p>Thorne got into screenwriting after his work was spotted by Brian Elsley, \u201ca beyond brilliant mentor\u201d and executive producer of the C4 series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/skins\" title=\"\">Skins</a></em>, who came to see his play <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/nov/22/theatre\" title=\"\">When You Cure Me</a></em> at the Bush theatre. \u201cBrian taught me that writing for the screen is much simpler than for the stage because you have more means to tell your story.\u201d He learned about \u201ccamera path\u201d and not overwriting: \u201cHitchcock said dialogue is the words actors say while their eyes tell the story. Take Mrs Coulter talking to Lyra in <em>His Dark Materials</em> \u2013 if you have Ruth Wilson\u2019s eyes available in close up \u2013 all you need is to pan in.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, it was her aunt who inspired Walfall: \u201cMy auntie is called Karline Smith and she\u2019s a novelist. I loved her stories and looked up to her. I still do. She gave me my first computer and encouraged me to follow my dreams.\u201d She continues: \u201cI\u2019m driven by the desire to tell stories from my world that you don\u2019t often see depicted on TV. I want to entertain, move, change minds. I\u2019m driven by people such as Jack Thorne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shonda-rhimes\" title=\"\">Shonda Rhimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/issa-rae\" title=\"\">Issa Rae</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/11/michaela-coel-trying-to-be-someone-else-failing\" title=\"\">Michaela </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/11/michaela-coel-trying-to-be-someone-else-failing\" title=\"\">Coel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/phoebe-waller-bridge\" title=\"\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sally-wainwright\" title=\"\">Sally Wainwright</a>.\u201d And she says: \u201cCan I add something? This scheme is amazing because I\u2019ve never had money behind me and I\u2019ve struggled. It\u2019s really hard to do a 12-hour shift, then come home and try to write.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne and Walfall agree hard work is essential to success, even if Thorne sets a potentially ruinous example: \u201cI spent my 20s working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, then got married, which changed my schedule slightly. Then I had a child \u2013 and that really got in the way!\u201d But work makes more sense to him than networking: \u201cI can\u2019t do small talk. Any industry party I\u2019ve ever been to, I\u2019ve left very quickly. What\u2019s most important is to have a voice that\u2019s recognised and supported. And we all need luck, though I\u2019ve no magic formula to acquiring it.\u201d Thorne\u2019s endorsement should work its own magic: \u201cThe great thing is Sharma has already sent the script out and people are meeting her and want to be in the Sharma business.\u201d <strong>KK</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "There has never been a better time to be a screenwriter. This is what playwright and screenwriter Lucy Prebble describes as \u201ca golden age of television\u201d. Alongside established channels, new streaming services such as Apple and Disney jostle competitively with Amazon and Netflix for viewers and hits. \u201cThey\u2019re approaching everybody, going: work for us, work for us, work for us,\u201d Prebble says (in her case, this is no surprise as, with HBO\u2019s Succession, she is, as writer and co-executive producer, the hottest of properties). And yet, a report from May 2018 on gender inequality, which gathered data for more than 10 years, revealed that only 28% of all UK TV episodes were written by women (a dire statistic that has begun to shift with more top female screenwriters \u2013 among them Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Michaela Coel and Sharon Horgan \u2013 making headlines). A 2018 open letter from female TV writers to drama commissioners noted, too, that \u201cour BAME colleagues are consistently conspicuous by their absence.\u201d Film director Steve McQueen\u2019s recent outburst against the controversially non-diverse Bafta film awards could equally have been lobbed at television commissioners. The industry remains claustrophobically elitist. It is depressing to hear Paul Abbott and his mentor describing script editors at the BBC as predominantly Oxbridge, even if Abbott concedes that this is starting to change. How do you identify screenwriters who will truthfully reflect contemporary UK society on TV? And once you\u2019ve found the talent, how can new writers be helped? For let\u2019s not be fooled: despite the demand for screenplays, it remains hard for newcomers to break in. This is where a new TV bursary scheme, funded by the industry body ScreenSkills with the UK-based production company Dancing Ledge, comes in. The proactive idea of the ScreenSkills New Writers Programme has been to invite a selection of Britain\u2019s top screenwriters to mentor a writer of their choice. The scheme was not set up just to help with developing scripts. It is about industry introductions and \u2013 \u201cthe biggest hurdle\u201d \u2013 getting commissions. ScreenSkills\u2019 Kaye Elliott explains that because of the huge sums of money involved in producing prime-time TV, producers are nervous about the gamble of investing in new talent. Jack Thorne who, like Prebble, is not about to be out of a job, urges the industry to commission more \u201centry-level dramas built around new voices\u201d. And Paul Abbott makes the point that \u201c\u2018commercially ready\u2019 should not a be dirty phrase. You need to teach writers to be ready to sell.\u201d Laurence Bowen CEO of Dancing Ledge emphasises that the \u201cgenius\u201d of the scheme is the \u201cnurturing, cherishing and support.\u201d I met a selection from the remarkable group of mentors and mentees at a London hotel: Paul Abbott mentoring Yero Timi-Biu; Jed Mercurio mentoring Daniel Brierley; Lucy Prebble mentoring Temi Wilkey; Jimmy McGovern mentoring Tony Schumacher; Jack Thorne mentoring Sharma Walfall, Levi David Addai mentoring Nic\u00f4le Lecky; Amanda Coe mentoring Rose Cartwright; Kay Mellor mentoring Grace Night, Sally Wainwright mentoring Scott Mather. Brilliant young, female writers (some of them interviewed )below \u2013 hearteningly \u2013 abounded. There was also 52-year-old Liverpudlian original Tony Schumacher, new to scriptwriting, who made me laugh, telling me how Jimmy McGovern , first over a pint and then after several days in McGovern\u2019s kitchen (\u201cJimmy\u2019s a great listener which is what makes him a great writer\u201d), encouraged him to write a screenplay about his life. Schumacher is an ex-copper who had a breakdown, became homeless, and went on to become a salesman all over the world \u2013\u201cunderpants in the Caribbean, trucks in the UK, jewellery\u2026\u201d \u2013 before becoming a writer. I was also fascinated by the fearless articulacy and courage of Rose Cartwright, author of the C4 series Pure about a form of OCD that involves not being able to suppress inappropriate sexual thoughts and now exploring a new subject. I was impressed, too, by the poise of Daniel Brierley who has written a script about the Metropolitan police bomb squad and had to cordon off my questions because a broadcaster is already interested in his work. Lucy Prebble &amp; Temi Wilkey: \u2018Temi has been brave enough to do a new thing in a new way\u2019 Co-executive producer and writer on Succession, Lucy Prebble first met Temi Wilkey when Wilkey was performing on stage in west London \u2018There are two things I look for in a young writer,\u201d says Lucy Prebble as we wait for Temi Wilkey (she has been held up at the first day of rehearsals for her debut play, The High Table, opening at the Bush theatre, London, next month). \u201cDo they write good line-by-line dialogue? And is what they choose to write about exciting? If you have both things, you\u2019re a real writer. Temi can do both.\u201d And that is not all she can do. When Prebble first met her, it was after watching her act in a Lars Nor\u00e9n double bill at west London\u2019s Coronet theatre, directed by Anthony Nielson (Prebble\u2019s partner). Prebble could see that, as an actor, she was \u201ccompelling yet vulnerable\u201d. Wilkey is a Cambridge University English graduate who trained with the National Youth Theatre\u2019s rep company, has acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company and at the National Theatre and founded Pecs, a drag king theatre company that explores gender and sexuality in sellout shows. As the two women chatted in the Coronet bar that night, Wilkey had no clue who she was talking to until the conversation turned to Succession, the HBO series (which has won Bafta, Golden Globe and Emmy awards) on which Prebble is co-executive producer and writer. \u201cYou\u2019re Lucy Prebble?\u201d Wilkey gasped. Prebble, meanwhile, had noted Wilkey\u2019s \u201cstrong take on contemporary issues\u201d and found her very funny. \u201cI really liked her. She had a lot to say about things not talked about enough \u2013 to do with her generation and sexuality and politics.\u201d For Prebble, this is key. To write a good play you need to identify \u201ca gap between what you see in the world and what is being truthfully represented on stage\u201d and \u201crush to fill it\u201d. That is what she achieved so brilliantly with Enron (2009), The Effect (2012) and, most recently, with A Very Expensive Poison, based on the assassination of the Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. She has also written and co-created with her friend Billie Piper I Hate Suzie for Sky Atlantic, which will air later this year. It is important, she believes, to be obsessed with your subject and not to make the mistake of committing yourself to a project if your heart is not in it. \u201cThere is a saying,\u201d Prebble continues, \u201cthat you can do a new thing in an old way or an old thing in a new way. Occasionally, you can do a new thing in a new way \u2013 and that\u2019s what Temi has been brave enough to do.\u201d The High Table is about a lesbian marriage that the Nigerian parents of one of the women refuse to attend. It is only when the ancestors get involved that the tables \u2013 high or not \u2013 have a chance of being turned. Wilkey, 27, has a radiantly intelligent presence. She grew up in the suburbs of north London, the daughter of Nigerian parents. As a child, she was always \u201cscribbling poems \u2013 which, because I grew up as a Christian, were probably a bit elegiac.\u201d Prebble laughs: \u201cI wrote terrible poetry too \u2013 really angsty.\u201d It was at Cambridge that Wilkey\u2019s thinking about religion changed and she discovered her bisexuality. And it was through Pecs \u2013 although she appreciates the collaborative pleasures of devising \u2013 that she developed a hunger to find a \u201csingular voice\u201d. In 2017, she got on to the Royal Court playwriting course: \u201cIt was brilliant and felt like group therapy \u2013 because I never thought I\u2019d finish a play.\u201d For the ScreenSkills scheme, she is writing a script about an assassin\u2019s assistant who is only in it for the money. Prebble has made \u201camazing suggestions\u201d including reading graphic novels for inspiration and offering ways to make the script more realistic and original. But she is not, Prebble insists, telling Wilkey how to write. She sees a mentor\u2019s aim as enabling a voice to become more like itself, to help writers say what they want to say. Prebble regrets never having had a mentor herself. Her protectiveness towards Wilkey is sympathetic. She talks about the importance of emotional support as well as practical help and suggests that female writers can be taken for a ride when they do not understand the industry. \u201cAs an experienced and mature artist and woman, I look back at things that have happened to me and think: \u2018That was not normal.\u2019 I wish I\u2019d had someone to ask at the time: \u2018Is it normal? Is it all right\u2019?\u201d She talks about the need for a thick skin in a cut-throat industry: \u201cUnfortunately, it is the inevitable battering that brings about a thick skin. That\u2019s why it matters so much to find people who care that you are OK.\u201d Wilkey\u2019s level-headed rejoinder is that as an actor she has been trained to expect rejection. Prebble got the taste for playwriting while she was studying English at Sheffield University. Some students who she considered more glamorous and cool than she was, commissioned her to write a play. \u201cI wanted to impress them but had never shown anyone anything I\u2019d written. Writing was very private \u2013 shoebox-under-the-bed.\u201d The play was called Liquid \u2013 and \u201cquite bad\u201d. Then, in 2002, her first professional play, The Sugar Syndrome, about paedophile chat rooms, was produced at the Royal Court and won several awards. In Temi Wilkey\u2019s life, everything is happening at once: the acting work, High Table, hosting a podcast with the Bush theatre, and she has recently been in a writers room for Series 3 of Netflix\u2019s Sex Education which helped teach her \u201cnot to be afraid of my own ideas\u201d. You might think there\u2019d be no time left to work on a new script but my bet is that the more Wilkey does, the more she will do. She is exceptionally focused and, as she later explains in an email, motivated by \u201cthe importance of human connection, the way telling stories brings people together, helps people empathise with people they would not ordinarily understand and the belief that generally \u2013 deep down \u2013 people are essentially good, trying to do their best\u201d. KK Levi David Addai &amp; Nic\u00f4le Lecky: \u2018You can always feel that her characters are rooted in something powerful\u2019 Best known for Damilola, Our Loved Boy, Levi David Addai first met Nic\u00f4le Lecky a decade ago When one of Nic\u00f4le Lecky\u2019s family members moved house not long ago, they presented her with a box they had found of her early writing. It contained reams and reams of stories, songs, poems and illustrations she had written as a child, as well as a newspaper called Lecky of the World. \u201cLiterally, this big 40-page newspaper,\u201d she recalls, laughing. \u201cI\u2019d written all these fake news articles \u2013 what was I doing? Very bored child. Didn\u2019t have phones then.\u201d Now 29, Lecky continues to create stories, albeit on a slightly larger scale. Last year she performed her first play, Superhoe, a nuanced one-woman show about sex work, empowerment and exploitation, to great acclaim at the Royal Court. She has written for the BBC3 EastEnders spin-off, E20, and a short film, The Moor Girl, which she also directed. Her acting credits include Death in Paradise, Fresh Meat and the Wachowskis\u2019 Sense8. Over the past year, she has been mentored by the playwright and screenwriter Levi David Addai, whose work includes Bafta-winning television film Damilola, Our Loved Boy, E4 comedy drama Youngers, and most recently BBC One\u2019s Dark Money, a fictional account of a minor abused by a Hollywood film producer, written before the #MeToo scandal broke. Addai and Lecky first met a decade ago, when she did a reading for one of his plays. At the time, she still didn\u2019t consider herself a writer. \u201cI was dabbling: I\u2019d written a little bit, but I was saying \u2018I\u2019m an actress\u2019, and writing in private.\u201d It took years for her to admit even to herself that she was a writer. \u201cMaybe it didn\u2019t feel like a realistic career. Where I\u2019m from, which is Stratford [in east London], no one said to me: \u2018You should write for television or film.\u2019 If you\u2019re good at drama, people go: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re an actress.\u2019\u201d Although she could see people on the television, she couldn\u2019t see behind the screen at who was writing and how they were making a living out of it. The idea of being a writer began its \u201cslow trickle\u201d into her brain when she saw a play by Bola Agbaje at the Royal Court theatre, London, when she was a teenager. Eventually, it dawned on her that writing could be a realistic proposition: \u201cIt was just: I know I\u2019m a writer \u2013 I keep on writing, and I really enjoy it.\u201d Originally enrolled for war studies at King\u2019s College London, she switched to drama at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in south London. Encountering students who could rely on their parents for finances and connections was a culture shock, but her own parents \u2013 a nurse and a DJ \u2013\u201cinstilled a kind of confidence in me that has made me feel enabled to walk into certain rooms and go: \u2018Actually I don\u2019t care where I\u2019m from, or what you might think of me. I\u2019m here and this is what I want to do.\u2019\u201d Addai says he chose Lecky as his mentee because she is \u201cone of the most talented young writers, actresses, singer-songwriters in the country right now\u201d. He responds to her work because \u201cshe writes from characters first \u2013 there\u2019s a real strength within them. Whether they\u2019re minor characters or whether it\u2019s the lead, you can always feel that they\u2019re rooted in something powerful, which, to be honest, I don\u2019t really see that often.\u201d He smiles. \u201cAnd it helps that she\u2019s a decent human being as well.\u201d There is a palpable sense of affection and respect between the two. When Addai talks about the limitations of mentorship \u2013 that he is able to offer guidance but not give young writers a show \u2013 Lecky interrupts with mock outrage: \u201cWhat? What am I doing here if I\u2019m not getting a show?\u201d The two go way back: when Youngers started in 2013, Lecky enjoyed it so much that she wrote an episode of it \u201cfor fun\u201d, and sent it to Addai saying: \u201cI\u2019ve written a fake episode of your show.\u201d (She was then brought in for a young writers scheme; she has a writing credit for a 2014 episode.) Going to events with Addai, Lecky noticed that he is often approached by young writers for advice and that he \u201cgives people time \u2013 every time\u201d. \u201cI remember what that was like,\u201d he says, \u201ccoming into the industry as a young black professional. There\u2019s so much talent out there that isn\u2019t getting a platform. So now that I\u2019ve got a little bit of influence I have the opportunity to say: \u2018Can we try this person?\u2019\u201d Addai clearly has an eye for talent: over the years, he has worked with then unknown performers such as Arinz\u00e9 Kene (best known for his stage show Misty), Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) and John Boyega (Star Wars). What does it mean to him to see them go on to do so well? \u201cOh, everything,\u201d he beams. \u201cYou\u2019re pointing people out and saying \u2018I think they can do something big\u2019, and at this point they haven\u2019t really got a CV or something for people to be: \u2018Yeah, I believe that too.\u2019 With a writer like Nic\u00f4le, it\u2019s like: \u2018She\u2019s the real deal. Trust me.\u2019 And it\u2019s not because she\u2019s won thousands of awards or done a thousand bits of work. It\u2019s an instinct and a feeling. I feel really proud, giving Nic\u00f4le the opportunity, but now it\u2019s up to her to run with it.\u201d He wags his finger at her, pretend-serious. \u201cDon\u2019t bring my name to disrepute \u2013 behave yourself out there.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t look worried. Both he and Lecky have a number of projects in the works for theatre and television, which they can\u2019t quite go into detail about yet. Lecky smiles. \u201cWatch this space. It\u2019s gonna be a busy year.\u201d Kathryn Bromwich Paul Abbott &amp; Yero Timi-Biu: \u2018Yero has an authenticity, an extra twang of talent that made us leap\u2019 Paul Abbott\u2019s greatest hits include Cracker, State of Play and Shameless. He was introduced to Yero Timi-Biu\u2019s work by a colleague On the face of it, the odds were against Paul Abbott becoming one of the UK\u2019s leading TV screenwriters. A working-class boy from Burnley, he and his nine siblings were abandoned by their parents before he had even hit his teens. Now, about to turn 60, he is in a sense still fending for himself with a restless, mischievous articulacy, as though mindful that, in the television industry, there is no point at which it is safe to stop singing for your supper. He has worked in TV for more than 30 years, making his name on Coronation Street and with Cracker, State of Play and more recently No Offence, but is best known as the genius behind Shameless \u2013 about the comic and dysfunctional Gallagher family. Standing beside him, 27-year-old Yero Timi-Biu comes across as a smiling, anchored, unskittish presence \u2013 as though, were you to blink, the mentor/mentee roles might almost be reversed. It is not how Yero Timi-Biu sees herself. She admits to having \u201cimpostor syndrome\u201d, and it is troubling how often this phrase came up among the young screenwriters I interviewed. She was born in east London, daughter of \u201camazing\u201d parents who worked in the public and voluntary sectors, tackling hate crime and community regeneration. She lives in Margate now (when not in Los Angeles). She admits with a laugh: \u201cI hate going to meetings where you have to sell yourself to production companies. I always get dehydrated and feel really weak afterwards but as a writer, you are also like a personal brand \u2013 your ideas are your currency.\u201d Timi-Biu\u2019s ideas involve characters at one remove from society because of mental health or other issues. \u201cI am motivated to tell the stories of the everyday horrors of life to make them accessible,\u201d she says. As a schoolgirl, she had ME so severely she was asked to leave school and sit her GCSEs at home. She spent a lot of time reading and watching television: a useful immersion for a writer. She started writing at 20 and in 2018 she won the BFI Future Film festival new talent award for her ICA London/Channel 4 comedy drama Beneath the Surface, for which she was writer, director and producer, which led to another Channel 4 short film, Two Minutes, in collaboration with the illustrator Adebanji Alade. Both films were broadcast online and on TV. When I meet her, she and Abbott are talking about Signs (a short film she wrote and directed for the BFI, now in development for TV). It is about a teenager left in charge of her senile grandfather and seven-year-old sister. It has a touching humanity and confirms a point she makes herself: \u201cThe best thing about dialogue in TV is what\u2019s left unsaid.\u201d Timi-Biu is currently working on an ambitious series about the fashion industry. At 16, she got a place on a BBC documentary, Your Label (an early sign of her ability to compete), in which teenagers from around the UK made their own fashion label. She went on to study at the London School of Fashion but then decided she\u2019d taken wrong turn: \u201cWhen you get into interning \u2013 running around central London with thousands of pounds worth of clothes from designer stores, you realise: what am I doing to change the world?\u201d Everything is grist to a writer\u2019s mill. Things that go wrong in life sometimes go right in writing. She told herself: \u201cThis life experience might make a really funny script one day.\u201d After graduating, in 2013, \u201cI ended up going to New York because I found a writing course that cost \u00a3420, can you believe it? And I had an amazing time there. It was great to be outside my comfort zone. I was 21 and everyone in my class was a bestselling author. I\u2019d just Googled the course.\u201d Abbott immediately saw her potential: \u201cYero has an authenticity, an extra twang of talent that made us [she was picked out initially by Abbott\u2019s colleague Henry Swindell] leap on her because, ultimately, a twang of talent translates to millions of pounds down the line.\u201d And on the subject of money, he says that it\u2019s essential to educate young writers about the industry\u2019s commercial side. He explains that the jump from working on a script to seeing it in production is challenging: \u201cKnowing what to do when you get a green light on something is quite shocking to some people. They can\u2019t cope with it.\u201d He recalls his own vertiginous pride on realising that 200 people were being employed because of what he had written and that \u201ceven the butty trolley\u201d was down to him. Abbott will make sure Yero knows which side her butty is buttered. He also has tips on the writing process \u2013 mainly emphasising that it is a process. \u201cThe first thing you teach anybody is that good writing is rewriting.\u201d Many young writers fail to see their first draft is precisely that. Overwriting is common: \u201cThere used to be a phrase we used on Coronation Street: \u2018Buying the milk to make the tea.\u2019 You\u2019d see Mavis Riley buying the milk in the shop in the morning saying: \u2018Derek is due home at lunchtime, we\u2019ve not seen each other for three weeks blah blah blah.\u2019 Then you\u2019d get a tea-making scene where Derek comes home and then the scene in the pub afterwards where she says: \u2018Derek came home this afternoon, it\u2019s been such a long time.\u2019 And you\u2019d think: will you shut the fuck up?!\u201d Fortunately, Timi-Biu knows how to make the metaphorical tea without fuss: she worked as assistant editor on Holby City (another hugely competitive BBC scheme). But the importance of this mentoring programme for her is, most of all, about the power of a name. And Abbott knows all about this from his own experience. His career was launched in 1982 with a Radio Times drama competition where an endorsement from a writer in the industry was an entry requirement. Abbott wrote to Alan Bennett, asking him to read his script, and Bennett replied telling Abbott his play was \u201cnot the masterpiece you think it is\u201d but said that he would be happy to put his name to it. Today, Timi-Biu is hopeful because she has not only Paul Abbott\u2019s name but his production company, behind her (AbbottVision is Cheshire-based and with a writers studio attached). The company will help sell her series: \u201cI have some broadcasters in mind and have had some interest \u2013 but it is all top secret.\u201d KK Jack Thorne &amp; Sharma Walfall: \u2018I\u2019m driven to tell stories that you don\u2019t often see depicted on TV\u2019 Jack Thorne\u2019s prolific output includes This Is England, National Treasure and His Dark Materials. He first heard of Walfall via his agent The first time Sharma Walfall saw the name of her mentor \u2013 Jack Thorne \u2013 pop up on her mobile phone, she felt \u201creally nervous\u201d but she needn\u2019t have worried. For Thorne, who has recently been described as the \u201cbard of Britain\u2026 to modern British TV what Charles Dickens was to the Victorian novel\u201d (the Economist) and who has won five Baftas (so far), is chronically modest. It is part of what makes him likable. He has also been described as the hardest-working stage and screenwriter in Britain. And at 6ft 5in, he is one of the tallest, with a foldaway look as though he hoped to disappear. His most recent work is typically miscellaneous: the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (which won a Tony award), a forthcoming film of The Secret Garden with Colin Firth, the screenplay for the BBC/HBO television version of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials. At any one time, he is usually working on at least three projects. Mentors do not come more laden with laurels. Sharma Walfall is an actor/writer with a Mancunian sense of humour, a direct style and bags of flair. She was brought up in a single-parent household (her mother was a teaching assistant) in Longsight, Manchester \u201cwith my little brother and just around the corner from my grandparents, where I spent most of my time\u201d. She is developing a number of original series ideas including Out of Bounds and Ruby, a drama with Red Planet pictures. She also worked for three months on Emmerdale. But it was winning a Northern Writers award in 2015, and then going on to be commissioned to write an episode of Hollyoaks \u2013 her first TV credit \u2013 that launched her. \u201cWhen I pitched my idea to Jack, he really made me feel at ease,\u201d she tells me. The idea was for a series \u2013 The Pru: \u201cI\u2019ve worked as a teaching assistant in a pupil referral unit (PRU) and my drama is around that.\u201d According to Thorne \u2013 who came across Walfall via a recommendation from his agent\u2019s colleague \u2013 her recreation of that world is brilliant and she has an instinctive talent for dialogue: \u201cSharma describes the complication of these kids. We live in this broken and embittered country and this is about broken and embittered kids. It tells the truth of how difficult these places are and how hard it is for kids to get back on their feet. Yet there are glimmers of hope and humanity \u2013 it\u2019s also a celebration.\u201d People have fixed ideas about the children in these institutions, Walfall says: \u201cI went in with a high level of respect. That\u2019s why the kids treated me differently. Young people in a bad situation make light of it with banter. They try to put their best foot forward.\u201d Thorne underlines Walfall\u2019s advantage over writers from posher backgrounds, imagining worlds they have not experienced, convinced that misery alone brings their stories to life. Initially, Walfall envisaged a \u201cdark comedy\u201d but Thorne asked: \u201cHave you done comedy before?\u201d and advised her to stick to what she knew. He understands how experience lends authority: while at Cambridge University studying politics, he became bedbound with a rare disabling skin condition and it was talking about this experience that helped sell his film Wonder, about a boy who has Treacher Collins syndrome, to Hollywood. Thorne got into screenwriting after his work was spotted by Brian Elsley, \u201ca beyond brilliant mentor\u201d and executive producer of the C4 series Skins, who came to see his play When You Cure Me at the Bush theatre. \u201cBrian taught me that writing for the screen is much simpler than for the stage because you have more means to tell your story.\u201d He learned about \u201ccamera path\u201d and not overwriting: \u201cHitchcock said dialogue is the words actors say while their eyes tell the story. Take Mrs Coulter talking to Lyra in His Dark Materials \u2013 if you have Ruth Wilson\u2019s eyes available in close up \u2013 all you need is to pan in.\u201d Growing up, it was her aunt who inspired Walfall: \u201cMy auntie is called Karline Smith and she\u2019s a novelist. I loved her stories and looked up to her. I still do. She gave me my first computer and encouraged me to follow my dreams.\u201d She continues: \u201cI\u2019m driven by the desire to tell stories from my world that you don\u2019t often see depicted on TV. I want to entertain, move, change minds. I\u2019m driven by people such as Jack Thorne, Shonda Rhimes, Issa Rae, Michaela Coel, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Sally Wainwright.\u201d And she says: \u201cCan I add something? This scheme is amazing because I\u2019ve never had money behind me and I\u2019ve struggled. It\u2019s really hard to do a 12-hour shift, then come home and try to write.\u201d Thorne and Walfall agree hard work is essential to success, even if Thorne sets a potentially ruinous example: \u201cI spent my 20s working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, then got married, which changed my schedule slightly. Then I had a child \u2013 and that really got in the way!\u201d But work makes more sense to him than networking: \u201cI can\u2019t do small talk. Any industry party I\u2019ve ever been to, I\u2019ve left very quickly. What\u2019s most important is to have a voice that\u2019s recognised and supported. And we all need luck, though I\u2019ve no magic formula to acquiring it.\u201d Thorne\u2019s endorsement should work its own magic: \u201cThe great thing is Sharma has already sent the script out and people are meeting her and want to be in the Sharma business.\u201d KK",

A report that year by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\">Shami Chakrabarti</a>&nbsp;exonerated the party of widespread antisemitism but reported an 'occasionally toxic atmosphere'.</p>\n    <p>Matters escalated in 2018 when it became evident that the party was receiving more and more complaints, to the extent that there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/jewish-labour-group-accuses-failing-act-antisemitism\">backlog of disciplinary cases</a>. Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/corbyn-sorry-for-hurt-inflicted-on-jewish-people-by-antisemitism-row-labour\">apologised that April</a>&nbsp;for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the process and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.</p>\n    <p>But the party was also mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\">ended up ultimately approving</a>. Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>. Then Chris Williamson, a Labour MP and ally of Corbyn, caused an outcry for saying that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/27/chris-williamson-says-labour-has-been-too-apologetic-about-antisemitism-video\">&nbsp;the party had been 'too apologetic' about antisemitism complaints</a>. However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated. Then came the announcement that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission was placing the party&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under formal investigation</a>&nbsp;over antisemitism.</p>\n    <p>In November 2019 the chief rabbi,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/25/labour-has-let-poison-of-antisemitism-take-root-says-chief-rabbi\">Ephraim Mirvis, said Jews are justifiably anxious</a>&nbsp;about the idea of Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister, saying a \u201cpoison sanctioned from the top\u201d has taken root in Labour.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What allegations were made in the BBC Panorama documentary?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In a July 2019 programme, eight whistleblowers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">spoke to a BBC Panorama documentary</a>, with some saying they felt there was political meddling from Corbyn\u2019s office in the process for handling antisemitism complaints. Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\">who was eventually expelled from the party</a>.<br></p>\n    <p>Labour&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">strongly denied the allegations</a>&nbsp;of political interference, and came out on the offensive, accusing the BBC of bias and calling for the documentary to be pulled. A Labour spokesman said the party had fully answered \u201ca number of questions\u201d put to it by the programme, and had also sent 50 pages of documents in response. The complaints to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a>&nbsp;had been made \u201cat various levels, including the director general\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Has Corbyn himself been criticised over antisemitism?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes, particularly his record when he was a backbencher. For example, Corbyn has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/04/jeremy-corbyn-says-he-regrets-calling-hamas-and-hezbollah-friends\">said he regrets</a>&nbsp;calling members of Hamas and Hezbollah \u201cfriends\u201d at a meeting in parliament in 2009. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/23/corbyn-criticised-after-backing-artist-behind-antisemitic-mural\">He accepted he had made a mistake</a>&nbsp;by supporting a graffiti artist after his work, featuring several known antisemitic tropes, was removed from a wall in east London after complaints. The UK\u2019s three most prominent Jewish newspapers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/25/jewish-newspapers-claim-corbyn-poses-existential-threat\">published a joint editorial</a>&nbsp;saying a government led by Corbyn would pose an existential threat to Jewish life in the UK.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How has Labour dealt with candidates accused of antisemitism?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour insists the a figure of 130 outstanding cases of antisemitism is inaccurate, and says it is \u201ctaking robust action\u201d, including quick suspensions, a process for rapid expulsions and an education programme. However, it has not yet provided its own up-to-date figure.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some prospective candidates have been accused of antisemitism during the campaign. Gideon Bull stepped down in Clacton after denying he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/08/gideon-bull-labour-candidate-pulls-out-of-election-over-shylock-remarks\">used the term \u201cShylock\u201d</a>&nbsp;in front of a Jewish councillor, while Kate Ramsden, who had been standing for Gordon, in Aberdeenshire, withdrew after it emerged she was being re-interviewed by Labour over posts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/labour-candidate-kate-ramsden-steps-down-israel-comparison\">comparing Israel to \u201can abused child who becomes an abusive adult\u201d</a>. However, other candidates criticised for antisemitism have remained in place, including Apsana Begum, who shared a post referring to \u201cZionist masters\u201d. She later distanced herself from the post saying she did not share those views.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\"><b>Rowena Mason</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JewishLabour/status/1218656411879706627?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">Jewish Labour Movement issued a statement</a> after the news of Murphy\u2019s nomination emerged, saying it had written to the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which scrutinises candidates, \u201cwith concerns relating to Karie Murphy, among others\u201d.</p> \n<p>It said the nomination was \u201cdeeply inappropriate and must be rescinded immediately\u201d, and warned that \u201cJeremy Corbyn is using his final weeks in office to reward failure\u201d.</p> \n<p>The EHRC is expected to report in the coming months, and its recommendations will be mandatory.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has been criticised for nominating his former chief of staff Karie Murphy for a peerage while the party is still being investigated over its handling of antisemitism. Murphy\u2019s name emerged in the Sunday Times as one of several put forward by Corbyn \u2013 together with those of his former deputy, Tom Watson, and the outgoing Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. Rosena Allin-Khan, who is running to be Labour\u2019s deputy leader, questioned the timing of the nomination, given the continuing investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into the handling of antisemitism in Labour, in which Murphy\u2019s role is expected to be scrutinised. \u201cI personally don\u2019t know Karie Murphy well at all. What I do know is that she\u2019s currently being investigated by the EHRC. And I made clear yesterday that as deputy leader I would take onboard every single recommendation by the EHRC.

So I do think that needs to be taken seriously,\u201d she said. The Jewish Labour Movement issued a statement after the news of Murphy\u2019s nomination emerged, saying it had written to the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which scrutinises candidates, \u201cwith concerns relating to Karie Murphy, among others\u201d. It said the nomination was \u201cdeeply inappropriate and must be rescinded immediately\u201d, and warned that \u201cJeremy Corbyn is using his final weeks in office to reward failure\u201d. The EHRC is expected to report in the coming months, and its recommendations will be mandatory.

She went on to play a key role overseeing the party\u2019s general election campaign. The Guardian understands the shadow cabinet was not consulted about the nominations, and some members were infuriated by the news after the party\u2019s terrible showing on 12 December. One member of the shadow cabinet said: \u201cEven though he knew that Karie was hugely unpopular towards the end, Jeremy Corbyn has been unable to shake off her spell.

Bercow\u2019s role in the parliamentary battles over Brexit was regarded by many Conservatives as disproportionately favouring remainers \u2013 and he has also faced allegations of bullying. Watson\u2019s peerage follows his decision to step down as deputy leader and not run again as an MP in his West Bromwich East seat, which subsequently fell to the Conservatives. His elevation to the upper house had been rumoured at Westminster ever since the notably warm exchange of letters between him and the Labour leader when he resigned. There had been frequent tensions between the pair, not least over Brexit, during Corbyn\u2019s tumultuous leadership \u2013 but as Watson departed parliament, the Labour leader wished him luck growing the horseradish plants he had given him. Murphy once worked in Watson\u2019s office, and he quit as the party\u2019s general election coordinator in 2013 over alleged attempts by the Unite union to install her as the Labour candidate for Falkirk.

The Labour party lost millions of voters because they failed to listen.\u201d</p> <p>The crumbling Palace of Westminster is due to be vacated for several years from 2025, under plans for restoring the historic buildings by the Thames.</p> <p>Shifting the Lords to northern England during that period, and potentially permanently, would be a symbol of Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to \u201clevel up\u201d the rest of the UK with the capital. The decision is expected to be made as part of a constitutional review, to be launched in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The Conservatives have already said they will open an additional campaign headquarters outside London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5514ccab9ed839de756ab9f865cf17aaf6dccbfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5514ccab9ed839de756ab9f865cf17aaf6dccbfb/0_81_1635_981/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Cleverly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Cleverly: \u2018We\u2019re looking at ways of connecting people, in places where we won representation for the first time in decades.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cleverly told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: \u201cWhen the prime minister stood up the day after the general election and said this is going to be a people\u2019s government, he meant it. And that meant connecting people with government and politics.</p> <p>\u201cBecause the referendum in 2016 wasn\u2019t just about our relationship with the EU, it was about millions of people and their relationship with politics as a whole. So we\u2019re looking at a whole range of ways of connecting people, in the kind of places where we won representation for the first time in decades.\u201d</p> <p>The potential move to York move was welcomed by many of the city\u2019s political leaders. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, described the idea as \u201cincredible\u201d and said she would write to Johnson to back the move.<br><br>She added: \u201cWe would get infrastructure improvements, particularly for transport. It would create hundreds, thousands of jobs, good quality jobs.\u201d<br><br>Keith Aspden, the Liberal Democrat leader of City of York council, also cautiously welcomed the proposal.

      "bodyText": "The government is considering moving the House of Lords outside London \u2013 potentially to York \u2013 as one of a range of options to \u201creconnect\u201d politics with the public, the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, has confirmed. Asked about the plan, which was reported in the Sunday Times, Cleverly said: \u201cIt\u2019s one of a range of things that we are looking into. \u201cIt\u2019s about demonstrating to people that we are going to do things differently. The Labour party lost millions of voters because they failed to listen.\u201d The crumbling Palace of Westminster is due to be vacated for several years from 2025, under plans for restoring the historic buildings by the Thames. Shifting the Lords to northern England during that period, and potentially permanently, would be a symbol of Boris Johnson\u2019s determination to \u201clevel up\u201d the rest of the UK with the capital. The decision is expected to be made as part of a constitutional review, to be launched in the coming weeks. The Conservatives have already said they will open an additional campaign headquarters outside London. Cleverly told Sophy Ridge on Sky News: \u201cWhen the prime minister stood up the day after the general election and said this is going to be a people\u2019s government, he meant it. And that meant connecting people with government and politics. \u201cBecause the referendum in 2016 wasn\u2019t just about our relationship with the EU, it was about millions of people and their relationship with politics as a whole. So we\u2019re looking at a whole range of ways of connecting people, in the kind of places where we won representation for the first time in decades.\u201d The potential move to York move was welcomed by many of the city\u2019s political leaders. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, described the idea as \u201cincredible\u201d and said she would write to Johnson to back the move. She added: \u201cWe would get infrastructure improvements, particularly for transport. It would create hundreds, thousands of jobs, good quality jobs.\u201d Keith Aspden, the Liberal Democrat leader of City of York council, also cautiously welcomed the proposal. He said: \u201cIt is about time that the government lived up to its promises to York and the north, particularly with transport and infrastructure investment.\u201d He said the proposed site, next to York rail station, was among the best in the north of England and would attract \u201chigh-quality occupiers\u201d. \u201cWe welcome any conversations and genuine attempts to decentralise the country,\u201d Aspden added. However, there was a more mixed reception among members of the public. One person said it could take York back to \u201cthe prestige it had in the Viking period\u201d, while another said: \u201cPlease spare us. Additional demands on the health services and hundreds more blue badge holders cruising round the city centre and abandoning their vehicles wherever they feel like it.\u201d Commenting on a story in the local newspaper about the plans, one man said: \u201cSend the sleeping chamber to the sleepy city.\u201d Cleverly was also asked about the controversy over whether Big Ben would \u201cbong\u201d to mark Brexit \u2013 at 11pm (midnight, Brussels time) on 31 January \u2013 but sought to play it down. After House of Commons authorities said it would cost \u00a3500,000 to sound the bell, which has been silenced during renovations to the Elizabeth Tower in which it hangs, Johnson said his government was \u201cworking up a plan so people can bung a bob for a Big Ben bong\u201d. It subsequently emerged there was no such plan \u2013 and it is unclear what will happen to the money raised by crowdfunders for the project. Instead, the government will project a countdown clock on to the wall of 10 Downing Street on the evening of 31 January. Cleverly said: \u201cThe PM made a light-hearted statement about Big Ben.

      "bodyText": "Well, I\u2019m glad I stuck round for the second innings of that. That was incredible sporting action. And a reminder for kids everywhere - even when it looks 100% over, it\u2019s not over. Renegades were dead, buried and cremated. But they rose from the crypt. What a delight for their fans who have had slim pickings to celebrate this season. Big news from the A-League as well, where it\u2019s been reported that Markus Babbel is facing the sack - not even after his side lost at home to Perth Glory, but reportedly with the decision having already been made pre-game, and the news emerging ahead of full-time. A dramatic conclusion to a day that started with a dramatic return to UFC for Connor McGregor. Feel free to scroll back through the below to relive any of the action you missed. Cheerio! This is a one of a kind. It\u2019s a dog with five legs, it\u2019s a meteor into the sun. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a game like this. From 0/86 to all out for 120. Get on the phone to Greg Norman, tell Nick Faldo he\u2019s off the hook. We have a new worthy recipient for the title of The Big Choke - and it\u2019s the Brisbane Heat. How in the name of anything have they contrived to throw away two competition points here?! Melbourne Renegades were 1-9 on the competition ladder. They were getting battered from pillar to post during the opening powerplay. Bowlers look like they didn\u2019t want the ball thrown to them. Chris Lynn looked like a Roman amphitheatre gladiator with an insatiable lust for blood. But from nowhere, the Renegades have turned the contest. Credit Dan Christian, credit Cameron Boyce. And all of a sudden, they\u2019re two wins in two. Incredible stuff. Incredible scenes. The fans in Brisbane are utterly shell-shocked. They thought they were seeing their side march up the table. They should have leapt into the top four and been knocking at second. My. Word. Big Bash - Wicket! Heat 7/118 (13.4), Cutting 5 This is an incredible half an hour. Welcome to the short form of the game, huh? They were 0/84. Now they\u2019ve added 7/34. It looks a tough decision, mind. The umpire has sent Cutting for lbw, but was their an inside edge; and was it sliding down legside anyway?! He\u2019s fuming the big all-rounder. Not just because he knows he has to go into a dressing room to face Joe Burns who he just ran out! It\u2019s down to the bowlers. Pattinson and Lalor are the men to try and see it home. But Lalor goes first ball! It\u2019s a nothing shot, and it clips into the wicketkeeper\u2019s gloves. This is madness from the Heat! They\u2019ve lost five for five. Big Bash - Wicket! Heat 6/114 (13), Burns 14 Oh my - this is an incredible turnaround! They\u2019ve lost 6/30, the Heat. From being in utter control of this match, suddenly the home side are in freefall. Credit the captaincy of Dan Christian - he made the call to put Boyce on against de Villiers, and since then they\u2019ve really tightened the screws. Joe Burns has left the ground, absolutely fuming. He knocked it into space and scampered, but the new man Ben Cutting has sent him back, and he\u2019s found well short of his ground; run out. Big Bash - Wicket! Heat 4/114 (12.3), Heazlett 56 HELLO. They were absolutely flying, the Heat. And even after that flurry of big wickets, you still thought these two could settle. But Burns has looked scratchy, the runs starting slowing, and they went half an hour without a boundary. And then the tension told - the set man goes, a feather nick off the spinner, and Patel gets the breakthrough! And would you believe this - it\u2019s another hattrick opportunity - Patel\u2019s picked up Jimmy Pierson first ball! Cutting to face strike. But he survives! Big Bash - Heat 3/103 (10), Burns 8*, Heazlett 52* So at the halfway point, it\u2019s still the Heat well and truly in control, despite that run of wickets, first from Fekete with Lynn holing out in the deep, and then Boyce\u2019s stunning over taking care of De Villiers and Renshaw. It\u2019s been calmer stuff since then, with these two tucking their heads a little, and just focusing on picking up the ones and twos. And staying with cricket, an update from Bangalore where, unfortunately for Australian fans, there\u2019s been a flurry of wickets as well. At almost the same moment in time, at two different grounds, two near hattricks - has that ever happened in global cricket before? I\u2019m calling mystic energy. Getting into tarot/astrology areas I reckon. Big Bash - Wicket! Heat 2/86 (6.2), De Villiers Oh wow! It\u2019s the first tactical battle they\u2019ve won of this innings - the Renegades have sent out the leg spinner Cameron Boyce to face the fabled South African, and two balls in, he\u2019s got him! De Villiers opens the shoulders, but he doesn\u2019t pick it, and Boyce has him cleaned bowled! And next ball - he\u2019s picked up Matthew Renshaw!! Dan Christian brings in the slip, and Marsh grabs at the edge. Joe Burns comes in and survives the hattrick ball. Hasn\u2019t the match just swung around dramatically. Heat call for the timeout at the end of the over to reassess. Big Bash - Wicket! Heat 1/84 (6), Lynn 41 (15) They\u2019ve got him - but the horse is out of the stables, the gate has been thoroughly kicked in, and that\u2019s little more than mercy for the Renegades at this stage, because who\u2019s just walked out.. AB de Villiers. Oh my. Chris Lynn has just battered the Renegades, and the Heat skipper departs with the chase already reduced to a run-a-ball and we\u2019ve 14 overs to run. Big Bash - Heat 0/75 (5), Lynn 37*, Heazlett 38* 13, 13, 10, 24, 13. And we haven\u2019t even seen AB de Villiers. That\u2019s one heck of a powerplay, and this is the kind of batting that bowlers lie awake in terror at night. And finally, Heazlett misjudges one - and Wildermuth scrambles after it.. but he puts it down. Nothing is falling their way; they\u2019re a team bereft of confidence right now. Big Bash - Heat 0/60 (4), Lynn 37*, Heazlett 23* Goodness gracious. I said he was playing second fiddle. Not for long. That was one of the most brutal overs of T20 cricket you\u2019ll ever see - Chris Lynn has just put Mohammad Nabi 110m back over his head. THREE sixes off that over - and that\u2019s 24 off the over. This is a bloodbath. Stop the fight. Big Bash - Heat 0/26 (2), Heazlett 21*, Lynn 4* So, the home side are out to start their run chase, and they do not look like they plan on sticking round. We\u2019re used to seeing Chris Lynn dismember opposition attacks single-handedly, but he\u2019s second fiddle so far - five boundaries off two overs for Sam Heazlett. 13 from the first, 13 from the second. Still, a long way to go in this one. There\u2019s a lot flying round, I\u2019ll be honest. Internet reports are saying Markus Babbel is already sacked from the Wanderers, but he\u2019s just fronted for an interview on Fox Sports and didn\u2019t give the air of somebody who know\u2019s they\u2019ve been handed their redundancy. If true, it\u2019s baffling the club would already make the decision ahead of this game - you either sack the manager, or you give him one last chance; you don\u2019t send a dead man out to coach a side. Big Bash - End of Innings: Renegades 6/164 (20) Well, for all that talk of the innings drifting, how\u2019s T20: it\u2019s a blockbuster last over or two for the Melbourne side with Nabi and Patel throwing the willow late on. 23 off 10 and 22 off 15 great end of innings cameos, and suddenly it\u2019s the magic mark of 160 that\u2019s been reached. Will it be enough? You\u2019d never say yes with a batting line up that contains Chris Lynn and AB de Villiers. 90 + 8 min: Fornaroli uses his experience and puts his body on the line, and Schwegler goes straight through him. Some frustration from the Swiss, you\u2019d imagine. There\u2019s the whistle - and it\u2019s a rueful shake of the head to the fourth official from Babbel - who in fairness, if this result has sealed his fate, you can\u2019t blame the coach for the inexplicable error from an experienced defender, followed by a double ricochet goal. An absolute sucker punch, but it\u2019s six straight wins for Perth Glory who keep the heat on Sydney FC and Melbourne City. A-League - 88 min: Very little time to run for the Wanderers to turn this around, but thanks to those numerous VAR stops, word has just filtered through that we have EIGHT minutes of stoppage time. Can they get it done deep into Fergie time, Western Sydney? Big Bash - Renegades 5/127 (17), Nabi 14*, Christian 1* And once again, it\u2019s another close-but-not-quite as Webster goes for 36 - a second c&amp;b of the innings, this time for Cutting. They just needed somebody to stay the course and guide this innings home. That said, if they can put a decent final three over together here they may be fashion a competitive total, the Renegades. A-League - 80 min: And some very ominous news filtering round the interweb spheres - ESPN has tweeted that \u201csources\u201d around WSW have already confirmed Babbel\u2019s departure from the club inside the next 24 hours. If true, that\u2019s a bit deflating. If false, incredibly disrespectful. There have been allegations of staff members white anting the German, if that\u2019s true, and any of those are the same-said \u201csources\u201d then there\u2019s something very rotten indeed happening at Western Sydney right now. A-League - Goal disallowed! Western Sydney 0-1 Perth 76 min: Cripes, it\u2019s a third disallowed goal of the contest, and it\u2019s Chianese again denied! That\u2019s been perhaps the most marginal of the three, the computer-generated line suggests he was a shoelace ahead of the last line of defence, but to the naked eye it looked okay. The Perth flyer is denied a fourth of the season - and the Wanderers hang on! A-League - 71 min: It\u2019s just drifted a little back towards Perth, these past 5-10 minutes. The Wanderers are enjoying 60% of possession, and passing at over 84% accuracy, but they\u2019re finding it hard to create too many clear cut opportunities. Of their 13 shots at goal, only two have found the target. A fair argument for the arrival of Irish international Cox, signed midweek you\u2019d have to say. Big Bash - Renegades 4/96 (13.4), Sutherland 20 For all their \u201cname\u201d batsmen it\u2019s the less heralded duo again looking promising for the Renegades. Two massive sixes from Will Sutherland - one smashes straight through a Bunnings chair on the sideline: lucky nobody was on it! And he and Webster are building nicely here. And would you believe it, no sooner than I\u2019ve typed that, and Sutherland\u2019s gone again - but this time, not found the rope. It\u2019s Laughlin again with the breakthrough, that\u2019s a key blow for the Renegades. A-League - 65 min: A promising attack on the counter from the home side, but the cross just evades the intended teammate. At the other end Meredith picks out Castro free in the box, but Jurman is across well to cover, at the expense of a corner. A-League - 59 min: In fairness, this has been the best patch of the game, for the Wanderers. Similar to their second half against the Phoenix last weekend, where having gone behind they made all the running. Ominously though for their fans, on that occasion they were unable to find the equaliser. A thought for Popovic\u2019s thinking - his normally unflappable side are looking a little ropey here. There could yet be some late twists in this one. A-League: Goal disallowed! Western Sydney 0-1 Perth 55 min: Oh my. Would you believe it - our referee has had a wink and a nod from upstairs and he\u2019s been invited to the sideline. No definitive replays, but it does appear that Yeboah had used the arm, and not the chest, to bundle that one home! Boos, and bottles from the crowd. They\u2019re not happy - but on balance you\u2019d have to say it was probably the correct decision. A-League: Goal! Western Sydney 1-1 Perth Glory (Yeboah) 52 min: Ziegler and Muller look to combine, this is a good little patch for the Wanderers. And minutes later they do appear to have the equaliser! It\u2019s a drilled shot from the far post from Georgievski and it\u2019s bundled home from Yeboah. A lifeline for Markus Babbel! Big Bash - Renegades 3/63 (10), Webster 7*, Sutherland 0* Harper joins his opening pair back in the sheds as he took on Cutting, but lost out - gone for 21. It\u2019s the story of the Renegades\u2019 season, really - starts but not too many big knocks. At the halfway mark of the innings therefore it\u2019s the Heat who\u2019d be liking what they see. Run rate at around a run-a-ball, and three men gone, no batsmen set. A-League - Second half! 45 min: We\u2019re back - and what can the Wanderers muster in Parramatta? They\u2019re fast out of the blocks, and the German, Ziegler, has gone to ground in the box and is screaming for a penalty. Replays suggest a dive for simulation may have been a better likelihood. Big Bash: Renegades 2/49 (7.2), Marsh 27 And just as they were building a little momentum, the Renegades have lost their other experienced man! It\u2019s another start, but not quite for Marsh, who is deceived by the pace of Laughlin he catches the splice of the bat - and its flown almost further than the shot did! Ball flies high in the air, and it\u2019s gratefully accepted as a catch. Big opportunity for Beau Webster, as he joins Harper in the centre. A-League: Western Sydney 0-1 Perth Glory - half time Not a lot to inspire the faithful, alas, in Parramatta - it\u2019s the now familiar Popovic-constrictor job as Perth slowly squeeze the life out of their hosts following that early gift from Wanderers\u2019 experienced defender Dylan McGowan. Big challenges for the Wanderers to find a way back into this contest - a fine strike from Nicolai Muller aside, there wasn\u2019t much to celebrate. Still, as legs tire more opportunities may emerge. Big Bash: Wicket! Renegades 1/18 (3.3), Harris 6 Oh my. It\u2019s not been a great season for Marcus Harris - who attempts a cheeky flick over the head of the \u2018keeper but can only watch as it flies straight into the mitts of Peirson. It\u2019s Pattinson with the breakthrough - the extra pace catching the batsman a little late in the stroke perhaps, and it\u2019s another non-confident start from the team that\u2019s sitting 1-9 on the ladder. A-League - 36 min: More concern on the Wanderers home bench as Yeboah stays down after a nasty collision. He sees a few minutes of medical attention, but does appear to be right to re-join the play. Now, it\u2019s Kamau down after another heavy collision with a possible concussion scare. When you\u2019re down on fortune it really does come like London buses. A-League: Goal - disallowed! Western Sydney 1-0 Perth Glory 30 min: And have Perth doubled their lead? No, says the linesman - and replays suggest, correctly. Chianese in an offside position, but isn\u2019t he in some form, the former Sydney FC flyer. A relief for Babbel. Can that reprieve give his side a mini morale boost? Big Bash: Renegades 0/1 (1), Marsh 1*, Harris 0* It\u2019s the visitors who are sent in to bat first after the Heat won the toss. A very tame opening from the two experienced batsmen - no Aaron Finch of course, who\u2019s over in India with the Australian team who have their own limited overs match going on. You can follow that one here: 27 min: And that said, it\u2019s a terrific strike from Muller - and an even better save from the ever-green Liam Reddy in Perth\u2019s goal! They say beer is his preference, but he really is a fine wine, Reddy. How is he still so reliable - twenty seasons on since his days in the NSL?! 24 min: There\u2019s a fascinating ebb-and-flow to this one already, as Perth break swiftly with Castro alert, as ever. It\u2019s a hugely tricky situation for Babbel now - sides coached by Tony Popovic, as we\u2019ve seen over the history of the A-League, are terrific front runners. With the experience inside this Perth side and the confidence in the camp right now, you can\u2019t imagine them ceding their advantage anytime soon. 18 min: Freekick for Western Sydney as Wuthrich bundles over Duke with a \u201crobust\u201d shoulder-to-shoulder. A handy area, and Pirmin Schwegler is over the ball. Can he conjure something special, the Swiss midfielder? He thumps it into the wall, and it strikes the arm of a defender, but you wouldn\u2019t imagine VAR would get involved. Or would you? 11 min: What a horrific start for the home side, and in all fairness to Babbel - how do you coach for play like that - from a vastly experienced A-League defender? That was shambolic from McGowan. Let\u2019s see what kind of response this prompts from his ten colleagues in red and black. Goal! Western Sydney 0-1 Perth Glory (Fornaroli) 6 min: A very early yellow card for visiting striker, Bruno Fornaroli for a high foot in the face of Patrick Ziegler. But his fortune turns very quickly. It\u2019s a poor pass out of defence from Dylan McGowan that is picked off by Jake Brimmer, who feeds the Uruguayan who benefits from a double riccochet of first McGowan, then the body of the keeper Lopar! A-League: Kick off! 1 min: And we\u2019re away in Parramatta! It has been said, at length, but it\u2019s worth re-iterating: a big, BIG, match for the Wanderers, whose leadership will be well and truly appraising the entire Babbel project on results like today. He is very much on borrowed time, the German, as pointed out in our A-League column from a few weeks back. They did have Simon Cox, the new star striker signed from England\u2019s League One midweek, in the house, so that\u2019s at least a bright spot on the horizon for Wanderers\u2019 fans, and a sign perhaps that the German might yet have a little more breathing room. We\u2019re not a million miles away from first ball in the BBL Heat v Renegades clash. Technically it\u2019s 6 v 8; but there\u2019s a lot on the line given how import the two competition points could prove for Brisbane\u2019s finals hopes. More from the Gabba shortly, but first to the A-League. A quick look at line ups for Wanderer\u2019s key home clash against Perth: The home side. And the in-form visitors. A team that\u2019s lost seven of it\u2019s last nine plays a team that\u2019s won five straight. But, as we\u2019ve seen in the A-League, anyone can beat anyone if they\u2019re on the money. Nau mai, haere mai to all and sundry, from wherever you\u2019re reading our blog around the world tonight! Are you a Wanderers fan backpacking through Budapest; a Heat fan in Honduras? Drop us a line and join the conversation tonight, as always via email or twitter. We\u2019ve got one last game of A-League for the round and then a bit of BBL action as well. Thoughts, predictions, musings? We\u2019ve already seen two coaching sackings in the A-League in recent weeks. Could a bad result in Western Sydney prompt a third? Find out here, on Sportwatch. Right, that\u2019s enough from me for one day. Over to Richard Parkin to take you through the night. Cheerio! The Wanderers keep the pressure on Melbourne City at the top of the W-League after leading for almost the entirety of the match to down Perth Glory. Glory remain winless. No further goals in the second-half as Western United consolidate their status in the top-six and the Mariners remain second from bottom. David Miller kept them in with a sniff right until the final over but it\u2019s another poor day at the office for the Hurricanes who extend their dismal run of form. Adelaide\u2019s stars, like Rashid Khan, didn\u2019t fire, but the explosive hitting of Travis Head and the death bowling of Peter Siddle proved enough to see the Strikers move up to second on the BBL ladder. 20th over: Hurricanes 176-6 (Miller 90, Rogers 2) Nothing Miller can to with yet another superb yorker, this time accepting the single. Rogers can only inside-edge for another single as Siddle\u2019s death over clinic continues. Miller finally gets hold of one, the last ball of the day, a low full toss, but it\u2019s a pyrrhic six with the Strikers already assured of victory. 19.3 over: Hurricanes 168-6 (Miller 81, Rogers 1) Dot ball - slapped to cow corner but fielded and the single declined. The Hurricanes have to deal in sixes now. 19.2 over: Hurricanes 168-6 (Miller 83, Rogers 1) Siddle to Miller - dot - nutmegging the batsman with a leg-side yorker. Two from ball two, another perfectly executed yorker, this time outside off stump. 19th over: Hurricanes 166-6 (Miller 81, Rogers 1) The tempo drops when Miller can only cut Neser for one and Rogers can only bunt an attempted ramp for a single into the leg-side. The final ball of the over is also a single, after some excellent work on the square-leg fence from Rashid Khan. 21 required from the final over. Miller on strike. 18.3 over: Hurricanes 163-6 (Miller 79, Rogers 0) Miller follows up his six with a two then another six! Straight and clean and pure, drilled like a sweet six-iron. We have a game! 18.1 over: Hurricanes 155-6 (Miller 71, Rogers 0) Neser\u2019s first ball is swung by Miller in a pure arc for six out of the ground over square-leg. 96m hit. Pure and massive. New ball required. 32 from 11; they couldn\u2019t, could they? 18th over: Hurricanes 149-6 (Miller 65) Miller took the strike following Bailey\u2019s dismissal and he launches Agar miles over backward square-leg for six to recharge the run chase. Rose joins in the fun, lofting elegantly for four over mid-off, then he steps back and cuts hard towards third-man where Siddle runs around and takes the catch! Nothing going Hobart\u2019s way this afternoon. an improbable 38 from two overs is the task facing the Hurricanes. Miller on strike. 17.2 overs: Hurricanes 138-5 (Miller 59) Miller is holding his end up, but the rest of the Hurricanes are failing to match their overseas star. Bailey is the latest to perish, edging Agar for two then flapping him tamely to square-leg for a six-ball five. 17th over: Hurricanes 136-4 (Miller 59, Bailey 3) This is all about David Miller now, can he do it off his own bat? He starts the 17th over as if he can, slogging Rashid Khan for four, but he can only muscle a single from ball two. Bailey clips neatly for a couple but then he\u2019s beaten by a skidding leggy and can only force a single into the off-side from ball five. Miller has to find the rope to end the over - and he does - slapping a four between the midwicket and long-on boundary riders. 51 from 18 required. 16th over: Hurricanes 124-4 (Miller 50, Bailey 0) Siddle\u2019s back, but Miller is into his work now, bringing up his first 50 of the season from just 33 balls with a lovely late cut for four. McDermott tries to keep the momentum flowing Hobart\u2019s way, but all he can do is pick out Salt at mid-on to fall for a 17-ball 31. 15th over: Hurricanes 116-3 (Miller 45, McDermott 28) O\u2019Connor has looked the weakest link in Adelaide\u2019s attack so far and Miller likes what he sees, sweeping the leggy for four, then driving for a couple. A single brings McDermott on strike and he rocks back and launches the ball way over cow corner, making a fool out of Channel Seven\u2019s Jim Wilson in the dugout. 14 from the over. Five more overs like that and we have a game. 14th over: Hurricanes 102-3 (Miller 38, McDermott 21) If Hobart were starting to fancy their chances, the return of Michael Neser has just put them back in their place. Just six from the over and the required rate is now up to 14. 13th over: Hurricanes 96-3 (Miller 34, McDermott 19) Rashid\u2019s back into the attack, but this is not the return from the superstar we\u2019ve expected so far in BBL09. He goes for fours through midwicket and down to fine-leg despite showing an impressive variety of skills. W-League: 57 mins: Western Sydney Wanderers 2-1 Perth Glory - Wanderers didn\u2019t hang around restoring their lead. 12th over: Hurricanes 84-3 (Miller 23, McDermott 18) Bosh! McDermott lofts Agar into the sight-screen for six! Could that be the spark Hobart require? They get a life soon afterwards when Miller\u2019s pull to midwicket is grassed by Wells coming in from the boundary. 12 from the over, which is par, for the time being. W-League: 54 mins: Western Sydney Wanderers 1-1 Perth Glory - It didn\u2019t take long for that triple-substitution to pay off! Glory are back level in Sydney. 11th over: Hurricanes 72-3 (Miller 22, McDermott 7) The required run-rate is now the best part of 13rpo as O\u2019Connor keeps Hobart to seven from his latest over over leg-spin. A-League / W-League: We\u2019re underway in the second-halves of the two domestic football matches of the day. In the A-League Western United hold a 3-0 advantage on Central Coast Mariners, while in the W-League Western Sydney are a goal to the good against Perth Glory. Glory\u2019s coach, Bobby Despotovski, hasn\u2019t hung around a half-time, making three subs! 10th over: Hurricanes 65-3 (Miller 21, McDermott 1) That\u2019s ended any doubt over the player of the match award - what a catch from Travis Head, leaping high to his right at cover to end Jake Doran\u2019s blossoming knock at 28. Head\u2019s athleticism earns Wes Agar his second scalp. Ten overs left for Hobart to save their season. Just the 12rpo to worry about. UFC: Here\u2019s your report form Conor McGregor\u2019s stunning return to the octagon. 9th over: Hurricanes 62-2 (Doran 26, Miller 21) The Hurricanes are starting to up the scoring rate, allowing only one dot ball from overs eight and nine, with the final delivery of Liam O\u2019Connor\u2019s over just evading the diving Siddle at backward point and running away for four. 7th over: Hurricanes 46-2 (Doran 17, Miller 14) Travis Head\u2019s turn to chuck down some nudies from around the wicket to the left-handers, and it almost works when Doran flails at a sweep that loops off the top edge but into a gap at midwicket. Miller goes for the same shot with the final ball of the over and connects much better, striking Hobart\u2019s first six of the day. 6th over: Hurricanes 36-2 (Doran 15, Miller 6) If Hobart are looking for a break they don\u2019t get one when the Strikers turn to Rashid Khan, arguably the best T20 bowler in the world right now. Miller starts promisingly against him though, driving straight down the ground in controlled fashion for four. A few dot balls up the pressure but Doran releases it with a very well executed sweep for another boundary. 5th over: Hurricanes 27-2 (Doran 11, Miller 1) Agar\u2019s excellent opening over ends with a neatly cut boundary from Doran, but the Hurricanes are way behind the game with 15-overs left to muster another 160 runs. 4.2 over: Hurricanes 21-2 (Doran 6) Wes Agar gets a bowl and he\u2019s on the money ball one, forcing Jewell to unleash some frustration ball two but he can\u2019t time his assault and sends a lofted drive miles in the air which is pouched safely by Neser walking in from mid-off. Hobart are showing why they\u2019re at the wrong end of the ladder today. 4th over: Hurricanes 21-1 (Jewell 10, Doran 6) Siddle is bowling superbly and he\u2019s unlucky to see a Jewell inside edge fly away for four instead of ending in a play-on or edge behind. Both bowlers are finding unexpected bounce on a length that is too lively for the Hurricanes with plays and misses and outside edges aplenty. 3rd over: Hurricanes 15-1 (Jewell 5, Doran 5) Another tight over from Neser who Hobart can\u2019t get away despite plenty of attempted innovation. 2nd over: Hurricanes 8-1 (Jewell 2, Doran 1) Peter Siddle is bang on the money, hitting classical lines and lengths, angling the ball across the pair of left-handers. It almost ends with a wicket but Doran\u2019s uncontrolled pull lands safely after skewing off the top edge. Hobart up against it. 1st over: Hurricanes 6-1 (Jewell 1) Back in Launceston the Hurricanes have started their chase of Adelaide\u2019s 187 in dreadful fashion. Michael Neser\u2019s opening over was probing and it ends with the wicket of Hobart skipper Matthew Wade, caught at first slip for five after edging an attempted drive. UFC: - Ok, so that didn\u2019t last long. From the liveblog: Conor McGregor wins by first-round TKO! McGregor explodes from his corner at the bell and throws a massive left hand that just misses the target. Now McGregor hammers Cerrone with a couple of shoulder strikes out of the clinch and Cerrone is already bleeding from his nose. Cerrone is in big trouble early, his nose perhaps broken. McGregor drops him with a kick to the head and opens up with the ground and pound. Oh boy. Only a matter of time now ... and the referee has stopped it! McGregor has won in roughly 45 seconds to announce his return with style! A-League: 21 mins: Western United 3-0 Central Coast Mariners - Make that 3-0! Western United running riot at Kardinia Park! Besart Berisha with his second of the afternoon. A-League: 18 mins: Western United 2-0 Central Coast Mariners - The Mariners don\u2019t like to do things the easy way. They are 2-0 down now courtesy of another Kye Rowles own goal. UFC: The much anticipated return to the octagon for Conor McGregor is about to get underway right here: W-League: 8 mins: Western Sydney Wanderers 1-0 Perth Glory - And an early goal too in the W-League. A-League: 6 mins: Western United 1-0 Central Coast Mariners - There\u2019s an early goal in the day\u2019s first A-League contest with ace marksman Besart Berisha adding to his ridiculous goals to games ratio for Western United. The highest BBL score on this ground then from the visitors after being sent in. Their total is thanks largely to Travis Head\u2019s power hitting. His 79 from 40 balls took the game away from Hobart after they had started promisingly. Around him the running was purposeful and the bad balls were put away. A massive task for the Hurricanes in the chase, but it\u2019s one they can\u2019t afford to fall short in if they want to remain alive in BBL09. Scott Boland was the pick of the bowlers and about the only one not to be punished severely by Head\u2019s onslaught. His changes of pace revealed the pitch to be two-paced with something on offer for the quicks who can hit the deck hard but also grip for the change-ups. 20th over: Strikers 186-5 (Wells 45, Short 33) Ellis with the final over of the innings and three blockhole deliveries keep things tight before he offers width to Short who throws his hands at the ball and squirts a boundary through point. He perishes next ball though, top-edging a massive drive straight into the sky within easy reach of McDermott\u2019s gloves. An enterprising 20-ball 33 from the No 6. 19th over: Strikers 179-4 (Wells 43, Short 28) Adelaide have run aggressively all afternoon, taking every single on offer and turning ones into twos, so even modest overs have kept the Strikers moving. That was on display again during Rogers\u2019s final over, with a Short mow through cow corner for four gilding the lily. Rogers ends with 0/40. 18th over: Strikers 165-4 (Wells 38, Short 19) Ellis comes back for his third over and Adelaide milk eight from it, three of which arriving from an impudent Wells ramp to a slower ball that was hit so late and fine it practically went straight past the keeper. 17th over: Strikers 157-4 (Wells 33, Short 16) Some pretty ungainly hitting from Adelaide in these closing stages but it\u2019s effective enough with a series of inside-edges and mistimed hoicks taking eight runs from Boland\u2019s final over. The pick of Hobart\u2019s attack ends with 2/26. 16th over: Strikers 149-4 (Wells 31, Short 10) Qais ends with 0/36 from his four over spell. It was on track to be much tidier but his last delivery is slog-swept over midwicket for six by Short. A nice little boost for the Strikers are a decent run from the Hurricanes. Adelaide still on course for a powerful score. 15th over: Strikers 138-4 (Wells 27, Short 3) Decent end to Rose\u2019s spell, avoiding the concession of any boundaries to finish with 1/45 from his four overs. 14th over: Strikers 132-4 (Wells 22, Short 1) With Head no longer around to worry about Qais returns and a tight over eventually pays dividends when the becalmed Nielsen races off for a suicidal single, only be turned back (wisely) by Wells. Qais has an age to collect the ball mid-pitch and throw down the stumps from point-blank range. 13th over: Strikers 126-3 (Wells 19, Nielsen 4) Harry Nielsen is off the mark with a boundary as Adelaide continue to power towards a huge total courtesy of the platform laid by Travis Head. 12.4 over: Strikers 121-3 (Wells 19) Hobart go back to Clive Rose, which is a massive risk in the circumstances, and Travis Head shows why, slog-sweeping the first ball of the over for yet another six, this one a massive floaty top edge over midwicket. There\u2019s nothing floaty about his second maximum of the over that fizzes over midwicket like a scud missile. BUT THEN HE\u2019S OUT! It looked like another six off the bat but his latest thwack to leg is plucked out of the sky by Jewell with his hands above his head inches from the rope. 79 magnificent, game-changing runs from Travis Head, from only 40 balls. 12th over: Strikers 107-2 (Head 65, Wells 19) Another over, another Travis Head six, this time getting under a Rogers low full toss and sending it back where it came from - with interest. He throws the kitchen sink at the follow up and gets a flukey outside edge that loops through the vacant first slip region and away for four. David Miller\u2019s drop is getting worse by the minute. 11th over: Strikers 91-2 (Head 50, Wells 18) Head is absolutely flying. Another six, this time walloping Ellis 90m over midwicket, requires a new ball! And a single soon after sends him racing to a 31-ball 50. 10th over: Strikers 83-2 (Head 43, Wells 17) This partnership is motoring now. Head welcomes Qais to the crease for his second over by slog-sweeping him for six over midwicket. Qais responds by inducing the third near play-on of Head\u2019s innings but once again the Test batsman survives with plenty of good fortune. Nothing fortunate about his follow-up, slog-sweeping for six for the second time in three balls! 9th over: Strikers 68-2 (Head 29, Wells 14) Nathan ellis gets a bowl, and he\u2019s an up-and-comer I like very much. Excellent hustle, stacks of variety. But after drawing some false strokes and beating Head\u2019s outside edge with some extra bounce he\u2019s hoicked to cow corner for four and a promising over ends up going for ten. 8th over: Strikers 58-2 (Head 22, Wells 13) Time for some Qais Ahmad mystery and he ties Head in knots from his opening ball, spinning it back into the left-hander who is lucky not to play-on for a second time. Head is even luckier two deliveries later when Miller drops a sitter coming in from the midwicket fence. 7th over: Strikers 54-2 (Head 19, Wells 12) Boland continues - and why wouldn\u2019t he, with figures of two overs 2/9. Oof! That\u2019s why he might be reconsidering - Wells taking a couple of steps and absolutely marmalising him straight back over his head for six. What a beautiful-sounding shot that was, a note-perfect zing off the bat. Belatedly, the Strikers are getting into their work. 6th over: Strikers 45-2 (Head 16, Wells 6) Rose returns but again he\u2019s too short and Head this time cuts him for four with the minimum of fuss. Wells also collects four as the Strikers enjoy their best over of the powerplay. 5th over: Strikers 32-2 (Head 10, Wells 2) Jono Wells survives the hat-trick delivery and rotates the strike, allowing Head to bunt a lofted four through the covers. Adelaide are really struggling to ride the bounce and hit through the line of the ball securely so far. 4.1 overs: Strikers 24-2 (Head 5) Boland has his second! And it\u2019s another catch in front of the wicket courtesy of a mistimed stroke, this time Boland himself taking a superb return catch to dismiss Weatherald. Boland is on a hat-trick! 4th over: Strikers 24-1 (Weatherald 5, Head 5) Hobart are continuing to justify their decision to bowl first, keeping the Strikers on a tight rein during the powerplay. Rogers is again unlucky not to pick up a wicket when Travis Head inside-edges past his stumps. 3rd over: Strikers 17-1 (Weatherald 4) Excellent first over from Scott Boland ends with a wicket, Phil Salt getting a leading edge to a length delivery and picking out the point fielder. Boland mixed up his pace superbly from the off, exploiting a pitch that is just holding up a fraction making it tough for batsmen to time their strokes. 2nd over: Strikers 15-0 (Weatherald 3, Salt 12) Big let-off for Adelaide. Weatherald didn\u2019t get enough onto a pull shot after Rogers sent down a heavier than expected ball but Jewell makes a horrible mess of a catch above his head at wide mid-on, fumbling the effort to the turf. 1st over: Strikers 11-0 (Weatherald 2, Salt 9) The bespectacled Clive Rose opens the bowling for Hobart with his left-arm orthodox but he drops short to Phil Salt twice who crunches through the covers off the back foot then pulls hard through midwicket to get the Strikers on their way. Alongside that a couple of very tight singles indicate Adelaide\u2019s intent. BBL: It\u2019s warm, overcast, but dry in Launceston, and the teams are making their way out onto the field. It\u2019s a pretty sparse crowd it has to be said. Cricket Australia have some questions to answer about scheduling with matchday attendances heading in the wrong direction despite continuing to deliver a solid product on and off field. BBL: No Tassie devils in the Launceston deck. BBL - The Hurricanes have won the bat flip and elected to bowl. U19 Cricket World Cup: The news wasn\u2019t so good for Australia\u2019s youngsters in the U19 Cricket World Cup as they went down to the West Indies in their opening match. Olyroos: Australia\u2019s men\u2019s football team is just one win away from the Tokyo Olympics after a dramatic 1-0 quarter-final win over Syria at the AFC U-23 Championship in Thailand. Al Hassan Toure broke the deadlock in the 101st minute at Bangkok\u2019s Rajamangala Stadium on Saturday night to help push Australia into their first ever semi-final at the tournament, in which the top three will qualify for the Olympics in July. The Adelaide United striker, who\u2019s in his first season of professional football in Adelaide, took the field in the 65th minute and with both sides remaining goalless at fulltime, the match went into two halves of extra time. Then there was a moment of magic as Olyroos midfielder Aiden O\u2019Neill threaded an exquisite through ball from just past the halfway line to find Toure sprinting into the box. The Australia forward poked at it with the outside of his right foot, pushing the ball through onrushing Syria keeper Mohammed Yazan Ourabi\u2019s legs and into an open goal, sending the crowd into raptures. It was Toure\u2019s second goal for the Olyroos since he scored on debut in a friendly with China in November. In the semi-finals, Australia will face the winner of Sunday\u2019s quarter-final between South Korea and Jordan. Saudia Arabia beat hosts Thailand 1-0 in the other quarter-final and they will line up against either the United Arab Emirates or Uzbekistan in the semi-finals. Australian Associated Press Australian Open: There\u2019s also a couple of pre-tournament features you might have missed, like Russell Jackson\u2019s scorching column on Nick Kyrgios. And my experience of the first day of qualifying, an eerie smoke-filled afternoon that turned a celebration into something macabre. Australian Open: The big names are all now in town and fulfilling their pre-tournament media duties. As this is the first major event of the year you often get more out of the superstars than at other events, so they can be worth dipping in and out of. Australian Open: Let\u2019s start with some tennis before we focus on the cricket, because the next fortnight is going to be all about Melbourne Park. And nobody will be under more scrutiny than home favourite Ash Barty, as Simon Cambers reports. In a country that loves its sporting heroes like no other, Barty is as popular as any of them, if not more so. Down to earth, humble and gutsy, she epitomises all Australians recognise in a true sporting icon. But what has the country and the city even more excited is that in two weeks\u2019 time, if things go her way, the world No 1 could make another piece of personal history by lifting the women\u2019s title at the Australian Open. Hello everybody and welcome to another busy Sunday Sportwatch. Leading off today we have Big Bash League action with the struggling Hurricanes welcoming the high-flying Strikers to Hobart. That one gets underway at 2.45pm. While we\u2019re keeping a close eye on the cricket there will be a separate liveblog launching around 4pm to take in the spectacle that is Conor McGregor\u2019s return to the octagon. At the same time the day\u2019s football kicks off with Western United v Central Coast Mariners in the A-League and Western Sydney Wanderers v Perth Glory in the W-League. As we move into the evening\u2019s action another liveblog will commence around 6.30pm to see you through the deciding ODI of the series between India and Australia from Bengaluru. Prichard Parkin will slip into the hot-seat over here and he will have the pleasure of narrating a crucial A-League encounter between the Wanderers and Glory (also 6.30pm start). That is a match under-fire Wanderers coach Markus Babbel dare not lose. Alongside that from 7.10pm there\u2019s more BBL action with the Heat hosting the cellar-dwelling Renegades. If that wasn\u2019t enough, throughout the day there\u2019ll be tennis news filtering through from the Australian Open, the finale of the Women\u2019s Tour Down Under, and the resumption of play in the third Test between South Africa and England.

In the fading light there\u2019s still an air of fantasy about the place; a low black craggy line appears ahead of us, fir trees are ringed in mist and a ruined castle in the bay \u2013 Castle Tioram \u2013 is outlined in the dusk.</p> <p>When Barrie spent a summer here in 1920, working on the screenplay of the silent film adaptation of his play-then-novel, he knew he\u2019d found the perfect location for his children\u2019s classic.

If only. After an hour\u2019s delay we finally leave Euston at 11pm, changing in Edinburgh around 3am. It\u2019s amazing, though, how a change in scenery can lift your spirits. We enjoy free croissants and coffee in the first-class buffet car (by way of apology for the delayed journey), watch the darkness melt away and the sun rise over the epic sweeps of the West Highlands. We reach Fort William by 11am and from there it\u2019s a 50-minute taxi ride to the ferry point where we meet our boat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07454eace87711b21884fdd5543799ec58dc0466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07454eace87711b21884fdd5543799ec58dc0466/0_50_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lake water in the foreground, trees on the island in the distance\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The approach: arriving on Loch Moidart.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Conde Nast Traveller/James Bedford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been a week of feverish planning at the prospect of four days cut off from the world with no car, no roads, no local shop and, more worrying, no pub. Anxious WhatsApp messages are exchanged with the rest of our party, two families in Manchester. Where can we shop before we leave civilisation? (I recommend an amply stocked <a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/MSResStoreFinderGlobalBaseCmd?storeId=10151&amp;langId=-24&amp;SAPStoreId=2097&amp;extid=local\" title=\"\">M&amp;S at Fort William</a>.) How on earth will we transport enough alcohol to last a party of eight for four nights on a small speed boat? (All that walking makes you thirsty.) Will we need an extra vessel for liquid provisions? I follow my brother\u2019s advice: \u201cStick to spirits, forget beer \u2013 think high alcohol, least volume.\u201d</p> <p>We needn\u2019t have worried. We are met at the ferry point by the two island managers, who swiftly load our provisions into the hull of two speed boats before whisking us across the water.</p> <p>As we\u2019re a large-ish party \u2013 three couples and assorted offspring: one 20-something, two teens and a nine-year-old \u2013 we\u2019re lucky enough to stay in the main house. Originally owned by seafarer Captain Swinburne, it started out as a hunting lodge in the 19th century. Obsessed with the many different types of pines he saw on his travels, he grew the most diverse pine plantation in Europe here on the island.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a32bce3c7b9268054f5a269bf92022012cf3ea02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a32bce3c7b9268054f5a269bf92022012cf3ea02/0_101_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Comfy seating around a lit wood burner in the sitting room with white wood-panelled walls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home and dry: the cosy sitting room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Bedford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Expanded over the years, the house now has 12 bedrooms replete with four-poster beds and claw-foot baths, a kitchen with two pantries, a snooker room lined with Grayson Perry prints, and a decent dartboard, too. At first we keep bumping into each other in the rambling corridors: \u201cCan you remember where that marbled bathroom is? I\u2019m sure it was around here somewhere. How do you get to the kitchen again?\u201d</p> <p>The house is shabby chic, eclectic, a mix of old and new, with brightly coloured walls and murals, antique rugs, conceptual art and oddities everywhere you look. There\u2019s even a walk-in closet of dressing-up clothes if you fancy connecting with your inner Peter Pan.</p> <p>When we stay, the main house is still self-catering, but from this month, all meals are cooked for you and served in the dining room that seats 20 \u2013 which means prices are higher. Yet for such a small island, there are plenty of other options. Scattered around are a string of simple whitewashed cottages, as well as a converted schoolhouse and bothy. Stylish and comfortably restored inside and out, they have great views and are remote enough to feel like you have the island to yourself.</p> <p>There are plenty of activities to keep you occupied. We spend a morning kayaking in the shallows of the bay and swimming, or rather floating on the water, in wetsuits. In the summer, there is mountain biking and cycling, and more recently there have been writing retreats run by established authors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e2796f90b49514bc439ec1ab9c3a043fa9d24fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e2796f90b49514bc439ec1ab9c3a043fa9d24fd/0_306_5495_3297/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the Old Schoolhouse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remote control: the Old Schoolhouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alistair Edwards</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Staying at the main house is a reminder of how privilege is sewn into the history of Eilean Shona. Back in the 1930s, it was a wedding gift to Lady Howard De Walden from her husband-to-be.

      "bodyText": "As we skim across Loch Moidart in our speedboat to reach Eilean Shona, it\u2019s easy to see why this remote island was the inspiration for JM Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan. In the fading light there\u2019s still an air of fantasy about the place; a low black craggy line appears ahead of us, fir trees are ringed in mist and a ruined castle in the bay \u2013 Castle Tioram \u2013 is outlined in the dusk. When Barrie spent a summer here in 1920, working on the screenplay of the silent film adaptation of his play-then-novel, he knew he\u2019d found the perfect location for his children\u2019s classic. Nothing has changed and first impressions aren\u2019t a million miles from Wendy\u2019s in the Disney version when she first spies Neverland through the clouds, lush and green with translucent waters and pale sand. Thanks to teething problems on the new Caledonian Sleeper service, our journey isn\u2019t quite as dreamy as Peter Pan\u2019s (\u201csecond star to the right and straight on \u2019til morning\u201d). If only. After an hour\u2019s delay we finally leave Euston at 11pm, changing in Edinburgh around 3am. It\u2019s amazing, though, how a change in scenery can lift your spirits. We enjoy free croissants and coffee in the first-class buffet car (by way of apology for the delayed journey), watch the darkness melt away and the sun rise over the epic sweeps of the West Highlands. We reach Fort William by 11am and from there it\u2019s a 50-minute taxi ride to the ferry point where we meet our boat. There has been a week of feverish planning at the prospect of four days cut off from the world with no car, no roads, no local shop and, more worrying, no pub. Anxious WhatsApp messages are exchanged with the rest of our party, two families in Manchester. Where can we shop before we leave civilisation? (I recommend an amply stocked M&amp;S at Fort William.) How on earth will we transport enough alcohol to last a party of eight for four nights on a small speed boat? (All that walking makes you thirsty.) Will we need an extra vessel for liquid provisions? I follow my brother\u2019s advice: \u201cStick to spirits, forget beer \u2013 think high alcohol, least volume.\u201d We needn\u2019t have worried. We are met at the ferry point by the two island managers, who swiftly load our provisions into the hull of two speed boats before whisking us across the water. As we\u2019re a large-ish party \u2013 three couples and assorted offspring: one 20-something, two teens and a nine-year-old \u2013 we\u2019re lucky enough to stay in the main house. Originally owned by seafarer Captain Swinburne, it started out as a hunting lodge in the 19th century. Obsessed with the many different types of pines he saw on his travels, he grew the most diverse pine plantation in Europe here on the island. Expanded over the years, the house now has 12 bedrooms replete with four-poster beds and claw-foot baths, a kitchen with two pantries, a snooker room lined with Grayson Perry prints, and a decent dartboard, too. At first we keep bumping into each other in the rambling corridors: \u201cCan you remember where that marbled bathroom is? I\u2019m sure it was around here somewhere. How do you get to the kitchen again?\u201d The house is shabby chic, eclectic, a mix of old and new, with brightly coloured walls and murals, antique rugs, conceptual art and oddities everywhere you look. There\u2019s even a walk-in closet of dressing-up clothes if you fancy connecting with your inner Peter Pan. When we stay, the main house is still self-catering, but from this month, all meals are cooked for you and served in the dining room that seats 20 \u2013 which means prices are higher. Yet for such a small island, there are plenty of other options. Scattered around are a string of simple whitewashed cottages, as well as a converted schoolhouse and bothy. Stylish and comfortably restored inside and out, they have great views and are remote enough to feel like you have the island to yourself. There are plenty of activities to keep you occupied. We spend a morning kayaking in the shallows of the bay and swimming, or rather floating on the water, in wetsuits. In the summer, there is mountain biking and cycling, and more recently there have been writing retreats run by established authors. Staying at the main house is a reminder of how privilege is sewn into the history of Eilean Shona. Back in the 1930s, it was a wedding gift to Lady Howard De Walden from her husband-to-be. Since the mid-90s, Vanessa Branson (Richard\u2019s sister) has owned it, renovating each of the eight properties and developing the island as a nature reserve \u2013 car- and pollution-free. In the elegant drawing room, with a grand piano, marble fireplace and creamy swagged curtains, a photo album reveals Princess Eugenie has been a guest.

I Googled \u201ccheap gyms\u201d in my local town near the Yorkshire Dales and found a youth club that appeared to have a gym open to the public. I went along one October night in 2013, expecting svelte people in Lycra, deep carpets and fancy coffee machines, but things turned out to be so much better: I had stumbled on a traditional boxing gym, running youth and adult boxing sessions for a mere \u00a32.</p> <p>Crucially, allcomers were welcome. On that first night the Scouse coach, whom I\u2019ll call Gerard, asked: \u201cHow fit d\u2019yer think yer are, love?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot bad for my age,\u201d I lied.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll ask yer again in six weeks,\u201d came the swift reply. I joined the adult sessions for a punishing three-times-a-week regimen of hopping, skipping, jumping and punching the boxing bags and focus pads. Our small group of boxers was accompanied by Gerard\u2019s faithful and excitable dog, who ran around the gym with us.</p> <p>The first six weeks were very tough indeed. I discovered what it was like to really hurt after training, as I tried and failed to execute even the simplest manoeuvres. Nothing happened quickly, but over that short period I fell in love with the sport. I found that I was a serial grafter, determinedly in for the long haul, even though I had the grace of a sack of potatoes. I would never give up even when it was sensible to do so \u2013 a generous trait inherited from both sides of my family.</p> <p>The training was tiring, but also exhilarating. I took the advice of a physiotherapist and did a couple of yoga and Pilates sessions per week (and still do) to build and maintain inner strength and flexibility. It was a joy to discover that in the gym no one cared how you looked, what clothes you wore, where you came from or even who you were, just as long as you gave it your all, were interested in boxing and were never late. It was that simple. I was hooked.</p> <p>I found the ethos surprisingly non-macho and inclusive. Boxers were nice, self-effacing, thoughtful and dedicated. Occasionally macho men passed through our gym. We put up with their bluff and bluster but had heard it all before. They usually claimed that they had boxed for Britain and that some external force had cut short their burgeoning careers. Some expected to learn to box or skip from zero in eight weeks flat and were severely disappointed when they couldn\u2019t. Radio 3 listeners and professors were generally the worst \u2013 they had a sense of entitlement and could never box, making them impossible opponents. They gave unwanted advice about how you could improve your jab. Most of them had no discipline whatsoever and melted away as we funnelled down to a determined core of regular grafters.</p> <p>Appearances could be deceptive: there were largish men and women who could move like the wind round the ring; there were boxers who were willowy and light who could throw immensely powerful punches conjured out of nowhere; there were those with paunches who claimed never to have boxed, but had lightning-quick reactions; and some, like me, had reasonable fitness and power but moved like a slug. However, there were definite improvements. After six months I found I could skip quite well and do a few fancy rope tricks. After a year, I could throw a decent jab and right-hand punch.</p> <p>We then came under the tutelage of a Welsh ex-army championship boxer and football referee, whom I\u2019ll call Dai. Dai was our own local hero \u2013 an extremely reliable and disciplined coach who turned up week after week, year in, year out, without any remuneration, to put us through our paces. Dai\u2019s speciality was the boxers\u2019 brutal fitness circuit known as \u201cthe Board of Death\u201d which, like a bitter medicine, we came to both love and hate. After 18 months of training I gained enough confidence to try some simple sparring in the boxing ring. I took the precaution of having some basic medical checks before getting in the ring, something I strongly advise, whether it is a club rule or not. I also bought my own good quality headgear and gum-shield.</p> <p>It was an odd feeling getting into the ring for the first time, a bit like going to war, when someone starts shooting at you from over the parapet. I would not recommend it to anyone without a reasonable level of fitness, as the rates of energy burn defy description. There were few women in my club, so I was nearly always boxing men. However, as my fitness increased, I found I could tire them out, by throwing my strong jab and making them \u2013 not me \u2013 run around the ring.</p> <p>Being punched in the head is a very bad idea and so I did everything possible to avoid it, learning some basic defences before attempting to spar. Mostly I didn\u2019t do too well, but thoroughly enjoyed myself. Over the years, I got a couple of black eyes and broke a tooth, but my injuries were not serious and few and far between.</p> <p>Success for me was defined as defending myself over three two-minute rounds and getting a few sweet shots through. Boxing is never about uncontrolled aggression or anger, only about outwitting your opponent \u2013 and therein lay the satisfaction. I think that certain friends and family members found this hard to grasp, as they could only visualise boxing as a 12-round professional bout with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/08/joe-frazier\" title=\"\">Joe Frazier</a>. Consequently, they saw my lurch towards the sport as odd and slightly dangerous. My brother-in-law blamed it on a mid-life crisis that would surely pass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/dec/03/why-do-people-think-41-is-too-old-to-exercise-its-a-perfect-time-to-start\">Why do people think 41 is too old to exercise? It\u2019s a perfect time to start</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Others questioned how I managed to shoehorn two or three sessions of training into a busy week. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but with a reasonably long commute and antisocial working hours, a degree of discipline was required. Even with my small commitment, getting enough rest was important and sometimes problematic. I am certain that this would have been virtually impossible had I been a parent or carer. Along the way, I came across too many who longed for the opportunity to take up regular sport, but were too exhausted, lacking in time, money or support to do so: this has to change.</p> <p>Boxing is described by many as both a science and an art. When executed well, it feels like a dance with many challenging technical aspects. It is also very sociable. Participating means joining a global brotherhood or sisterhood melded by years of discipline. At the amateur, non-competitive level it is relatively safe, if properly supervised by trained coaches. It also feels like a natural activity \u2013 something missing from life that has been restored. Evolutionary biology bears this out, as those with proportionately shorter legs (like me) are supposedly adapted for fighting as they have a low centre of gravity.</p> <p>I am still boxing at 56 and it is a challenge I am not ready to give up. I recently crashed and wrote off my car. Thankfully no one was seriously injured, but I nursed badly bruised ribs for about a month. The very worst thing was missing 10 training sessions. But it was all that core strength that saved me from being properly broken.</p> <p><em>The Boxing Diaries (\u00a39.99) by Marion Dunn is published by Saraband on 23 January.

Mostly I didn\u2019t do too well, but thoroughly enjoyed myself. Over the years, I got a couple of black eyes and broke a tooth, but my injuries were not serious and few and far between. Success for me was defined as defending myself over three two-minute rounds and getting a few sweet shots through. Boxing is never about uncontrolled aggression or anger, only about outwitting your opponent \u2013 and therein lay the satisfaction. I think that certain friends and family members found this hard to grasp, as they could only visualise boxing as a 12-round professional bout with Joe Frazier. Consequently, they saw my lurch towards the sport as odd and slightly dangerous. My brother-in-law blamed it on a mid-life crisis that would surely pass. Others questioned how I managed to shoehorn two or three sessions of training into a busy week. It doesn\u2019t sound like much, but with a reasonably long commute and antisocial working hours, a degree of discipline was required. Even with my small commitment, getting enough rest was important and sometimes problematic. I am certain that this would have been virtually impossible had I been a parent or carer. Along the way, I came across too many who longed for the opportunity to take up regular sport, but were too exhausted, lacking in time, money or support to do so: this has to change. Boxing is described by many as both a science and an art. When executed well, it feels like a dance with many challenging technical aspects. It is also very sociable. Participating means joining a global brotherhood or sisterhood melded by years of discipline. At the amateur, non-competitive level it is relatively safe, if properly supervised by trained coaches. It also feels like a natural activity \u2013 something missing from life that has been restored. Evolutionary biology bears this out, as those with proportionately shorter legs (like me) are supposedly adapted for fighting as they have a low centre of gravity. I am still boxing at 56 and it is a challenge I am not ready to give up. I recently crashed and wrote off my car. Thankfully no one was seriously injured, but I nursed badly bruised ribs for about a month. The very worst thing was missing 10 training sessions. But it was all that core strength that saved me from being properly broken. The Boxing Diaries (\u00a39.99) by Marion Dunn is published by Saraband on 23 January.

Laureys, who has spent more than two decades exploring the boundaries of human consciousness, prefers the term \u201cunresponsive wakefulness\u201d to describe people who are unconscious but show signs of being awake, such as opening their eyes or moving. These patients are often <a href=\"https://healthtalk.org/family-experiences-vegetative-and-minimally-conscious-states/what-is-a-coma-and-what-is-a-vegetative-state\">wrongly described as being in a coma</a>, a condition that only lasts a few weeks, in which people are completely unresponsive.</p> <p>\u201cThe old view was to consider consciousness, which was one of the biggest mysteries for science to solve, as all or nothing,\u201d he told the Guardian, shortly after he was awarded the Generet prize by Belgium\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/03/king-baudouin-foundation-award-adisco-hope-burundi-political-turmoil\">King Baudouin Foundation</a> this week. He said that a third of patients he treats at the Li\u00e8ge coma centre had been wrongly diagnosed as being in a vegetative state, despite signs of consciousness.</p> <p>As a young doctor in the 1990s he was frustrated by the questions that torture the families of coma survivors: can their loved ones see or hear them? Can they feel anything, including pain?</p> <p>Laureys and his 30-strong team of engineers and clinicians have shown that some of those with a \u201cvegetative state\u201d diagnosis are minimally conscious, showing signs of awareness such as responding to commands with their eyes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/31/experience-i-woke-from-coma-speaking-french\">Experience: I woke up from a coma speaking French</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using MRI and PET scanners, the Li\u00e8ge team have sought more precise information about the consciousness of coma survivors. Radioactive glucose, injected into a patient\u2019s veins and then consumed by the brain, helps the scanners reveal activity.</p> <p>\u201cSome [patients] are in that state, minimally conscious. [Some] will recover further. Others will not. So the only way forward is to increase our efforts to better document their efforts.\u201d</p> <p>Every year in Belgium, 50 people awake from a coma into a state of unresponsive wakefulness, while 100 have minimal consciousness. The BBC found in 2016 that the NHS was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38383338\">caring for 105 patients in \u201cprolonged disorders of consciousness\u201d</a>, although that figure is almost certainly a large underestimate as only a quarter of health trusts completed the survey.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a silent epidemic: there are hundreds of patients, sometimes in terrible conditions in nursing homes with the elderly,\u201d Laureys said. \u201cThey are young patients with traumatic brain injury [who] did not receive the proper chance.\u201d</p> <p>For some patients, a clearer diagnosis could help their families make painful decisions. \u201cThat would help them to accept \u2018OK, we lost the battle\u2019 and make very difficult decisions about end of life.\u201d</p> <p>But others are being written off by clinicians, when the brain might heal with the right care. \u201cThere is a fear to give false hope, but in reality there is also the risk of false despair.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Broeckx knows this medical attitude well. He was told his son Stig would spend the rest of his life in a nursing home after a catastrophic cycling accident.</p> <p>Stig Broeckx, a champion cyclist, was competing in the Tour of Belgium in May 2016 when two motorcyclists careened into the peloton, which was racing downhill at top speed. Thrown off his bike, Stig suffered terrible injuries. His heart stopped beating. A team of three doctors spent more than an hour bringing him back to life. Now walking with a stick, he says, smiling: \u201cI was dead for two hours.\u201d</p> <p>It could have been different. After two months in intensive care, Stig\u2019s family were told he had no hope. \u201cThey declared him as vegetative. That was it,\u201d his father recalls. But the Broecxk family were convinced Stig was conscious. They could see his eyes moving. Medical staff didn\u2019t believe them. \u201cWe pushed and pushed and pushed to bring him to the coma centre [in Li\u00e8ge]. And after that, the miracle happened in that coma centre.\u201d</p> <p>The Laureys team found signs of consciousness and began to work on more intensive treatment. The road to recovery is long. Stig had to Google himself to find out who he was. He still has no memory of the five years before the accident. He hopes now to return to a normal life and use his public renown in cycling-mad Belgium to raise awareness of treatment and support for coma survivors.</p> <p>He recently began cycling again \u2013 not racing, but riding his bike under a blue sky, captured on a phone video by his father. Was he not afraid? \u201cI was already dead, so why [be afraid] now?\u201d</p> <p>Recovery depends on the nature of the brain injury and varies from one person to another.</p> <p>B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Jullien was 35 when she suffered a rare stroke that left her completely paralysed. The mother of two, a former teacher who loved to travel and had spent time in South America and Ireland, now lives with \u201clocked-in\u201d syndrome, meaning she can not speak and can barely move, although her mind remains as alert as it always was.</p> <p>She communicates with the help of a computer that reads her eye movements: \u201cI live in the present, and if one day there is an advance [in medicine], even better,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>Jullien wants the general public to stop treating people in her condition like idiots \u2013 a message she relays to the 22,000 followers of her Facebook page. \u201cCertainly there is a little fear, but this doesn\u2019t excuse, at all, people who say hello to my husband and not to me, who talk about me in the third person when I am there, or start a discussion and turn their backs on me \u2026 society treats you like an imbecile, when you are sound in mind.\u201d</p> <p>She and her husband raised \u20ac350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign, to build an adapted house for her and her family.</p> <p>Laureys will use a portion of the prize funds to provide support to families and patients in adapting to such life-changing accidents and illnesses.</p> <p>Some of the funds will be spent on clinical trials of new treatments, in particular apomorphine, a substance that is injected under the skin and stimulates chemical processes in the brain in some patients. Preliminary results are encouraging, says Laureys, but \u201cit is way too early\u201d to draw bigger conclusions.</p> <p>The Generet fund, named after its Belgian benefactor, was launched in 2018 to fund research into rare diseases, where treatments are unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies and unaffordable for university departments.</p> <p>Beyond the prize, the neurologist urges people to make living wills and appoint someone to act in their interests, in case of a life-changing brain injury. A brain trauma \u2013 whether through accident or illness \u2013 is something that could happen to anyone, he said. \u201cIt could happen to me today, tomorrow, next week, to my spouse, my child, my parents. And it\u2019s only when it happens that the families start to think about what we do now.\u201d</p> <p>Only then can doctors treat people according to their wishes, he says: \u201cIt is not for me as a neurologist and a medical doctor to decide whether this is a life worth living, and [that] prognosis is a life not worth living.\u201d</p>",

He said that a third of patients he treats at the Li\u00e8ge coma centre had been wrongly diagnosed as being in a vegetative state, despite signs of consciousness. As a young doctor in the 1990s he was frustrated by the questions that torture the families of coma survivors: can their loved ones see or hear them? Can they feel anything, including pain? Laureys and his 30-strong team of engineers and clinicians have shown that some of those with a \u201cvegetative state\u201d diagnosis are minimally conscious, showing signs of awareness such as responding to commands with their eyes. Using MRI and PET scanners, the Li\u00e8ge team have sought more precise information about the consciousness of coma survivors. Radioactive glucose, injected into a patient\u2019s veins and then consumed by the brain, helps the scanners reveal activity. \u201cSome [patients] are in that state, minimally conscious. [Some] will recover further. Others will not. So the only way forward is to increase our efforts to better document their efforts.\u201d Every year in Belgium, 50 people awake from a coma into a state of unresponsive wakefulness, while 100 have minimal consciousness. The BBC found in 2016 that the NHS was caring for 105 patients in \u201cprolonged disorders of consciousness\u201d, although that figure is almost certainly a large underestimate as only a quarter of health trusts completed the survey. \u201cIt is a silent epidemic: there are hundreds of patients, sometimes in terrible conditions in nursing homes with the elderly,\u201d Laureys said. \u201cThey are young patients with traumatic brain injury [who] did not receive the proper chance.\u201d For some patients, a clearer diagnosis could help their families make painful decisions. \u201cThat would help them to accept \u2018OK, we lost the battle\u2019 and make very difficult decisions about end of life.\u201d But others are being written off by clinicians, when the brain might heal with the right care. \u201cThere is a fear to give false hope, but in reality there is also the risk of false despair.\u201d Peter Broeckx knows this medical attitude well. He was told his son Stig would spend the rest of his life in a nursing home after a catastrophic cycling accident. Stig Broeckx, a champion cyclist, was competing in the Tour of Belgium in May 2016 when two motorcyclists careened into the peloton, which was racing downhill at top speed. Thrown off his bike, Stig suffered terrible injuries. His heart stopped beating. A team of three doctors spent more than an hour bringing him back to life. Now walking with a stick, he says, smiling: \u201cI was dead for two hours.\u201d It could have been different. After two months in intensive care, Stig\u2019s family were told he had no hope. \u201cThey declared him as vegetative. That was it,\u201d his father recalls. But the Broecxk family were convinced Stig was conscious. They could see his eyes moving. Medical staff didn\u2019t believe them. \u201cWe pushed and pushed and pushed to bring him to the coma centre [in Li\u00e8ge]. And after that, the miracle happened in that coma centre.\u201d The Laureys team found signs of consciousness and began to work on more intensive treatment. The road to recovery is long. Stig had to Google himself to find out who he was. He still has no memory of the five years before the accident. He hopes now to return to a normal life and use his public renown in cycling-mad Belgium to raise awareness of treatment and support for coma survivors. He recently began cycling again \u2013 not racing, but riding his bike under a blue sky, captured on a phone video by his father. Was he not afraid? \u201cI was already dead, so why [be afraid] now?\u201d Recovery depends on the nature of the brain injury and varies from one person to another. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Jullien was 35 when she suffered a rare stroke that left her completely paralysed. The mother of two, a former teacher who loved to travel and had spent time in South America and Ireland, now lives with \u201clocked-in\u201d syndrome, meaning she can not speak and can barely move, although her mind remains as alert as it always was. She communicates with the help of a computer that reads her eye movements: \u201cI live in the present, and if one day there is an advance [in medicine], even better,\u201d she told the Guardian. Jullien wants the general public to stop treating people in her condition like idiots \u2013 a message she relays to the 22,000 followers of her Facebook page. \u201cCertainly there is a little fear, but this doesn\u2019t excuse, at all, people who say hello to my husband and not to me, who talk about me in the third person when I am there, or start a discussion and turn their backs on me \u2026 society treats you like an imbecile, when you are sound in mind.\u201d She and her husband raised \u20ac350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign, to build an adapted house for her and her family. Laureys will use a portion of the prize funds to provide support to families and patients in adapting to such life-changing accidents and illnesses. Some of the funds will be spent on clinical trials of new treatments, in particular apomorphine, a substance that is injected under the skin and stimulates chemical processes in the brain in some patients. Preliminary results are encouraging, says Laureys, but \u201cit is way too early\u201d to draw bigger conclusions. The Generet fund, named after its Belgian benefactor, was launched in 2018 to fund research into rare diseases, where treatments are unprofitable for pharmaceutical companies and unaffordable for university departments. Beyond the prize, the neurologist urges people to make living wills and appoint someone to act in their interests, in case of a life-changing brain injury. A brain trauma \u2013 whether through accident or illness \u2013 is something that could happen to anyone, he said. \u201cIt could happen to me today, tomorrow, next week, to my spouse, my child, my parents. And it\u2019s only when it happens that the families start to think about what we do now.\u201d Only then can doctors treat people according to their wishes, he says: \u201cIt is not for me as a neurologist and a medical doctor to decide whether this is a life worth living, and [that] prognosis is a life not worth living.\u201d",

That in itself would not have caused a stir. But the timing of the book\u2019s release, as Pope Francis considers allowing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/26/amazon-bishops-call-on-pope-for-ordination-of-married-men-as-priests\" title=\"\">ordination of married men</a> in remote areas of the Amazon in order to overcome a shortage of priests, led many to accuse Benedict, who still lives within the walls of Vatican City and continues to wear a white cassock, of breaching his vow of silence and undermining his successor\u2019s authority.</p> <p>In a bizarre twist, after extracts of <em>From the Depths of </em><em>Our Hearts</em> were published in France\u2019s <em>Le Figaro</em> newspaper last Sunday, the former pontiff demanded that his name be dropped as co-author. His personal secretary, Georg G\u00e4nswein, said that while Benedict knew that Cardinal Sarah, who has clashed with Pope Francis in the past, was preparing a book, and had sent him an essay on the priesthood, he had not approved a co-authored project and had neither seen nor authorised the book\u2019s cover.</p> <p>Sarah denied allegations that he had misled Benedict, providing proof of the text that had been given to him and claiming that Benedict was aware that the project would take the form of a book.</p> <p>The French publisher, Fayard, went ahead and published the book as planned, but in future editions Benedict will be named as a contributor rather than co-author. Meanwhile, the US publisher, Ignatius, refused to relent, saying in a statement that the English version would retain Benedict as co-author.</p> <p>Amid the fallout over the book, Vatican commentators picked over its origins, with some saying \u201cthe two popes\u201d were the victims of exploitation by the warring conservative and liberal factions within the Catholic church. Throughout his life Benedict has been a prolific writer, but others questioned his capacity to construct such a detailed essay at the age of 92. A Vatican journalist for the rightwing Italian press claimed that it was a furious Pope Francis who ordered that Benedict\u2019s name be removed.</p> <p>Benedict has come forward on a variety of issues over the past seven years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/11/ex-pope-benedict-xvi-blames-sexual-abuse-on-swinging-sixties\" title=\"\">most controversially writing</a> last year that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and \u201chomosexual cliques\u201d among priests were to blame for the church\u2019s paedophile-priest scandals. The opinion came two months after an unprecedented Vatican summit on tackling clerical sexual abuse, and sharply contrasted with that of Francis, who blamed the scandals on a clerical culture that elevates priests above the laity. Benedict also wrote a letter complimenting Cardinal Joachim Meisner \u2013 a fierce critic of Francis who spoke out against the pontiff allowing remarried divorcees to receive holy communion \u2013 who died in 2017.</p> <p>But this is the first time he has intervened, whether knowingly or not, in a matter that the Pope is actively considering. Francis is weeks away from publishing his decision on the Amazon after a document approved by bishops at a synod in October noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have \u201cenormous difficulties\u201d in receiving communion and seeing a priest. If Francis supports the request to ordain married men, it would apply only to those already serving as deacons. The pontiff himself has consistently said that he would never change the centuries-old requirement for celibacy, but critics fear that the Amazon could set a precedent.</p> <p>\u201cIn all the times that Benedict has intervened, what he has written is coherent with what he thinks, so this doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d said Iacopo Scaramuzzi, a Vatican journalist and author of the book <em>Tango Vaticano.

      "bodyText": "The pilgrims filing into the papal audience hall last Wednesday were mostly oblivious to the saga enveloping the Vatican over an explosive new book that pits the retired Pope Benedict XVI against the reigning Pope Francis. But they were clear on who their favourite is. \u201cI would not have come all this way for Benedict,\u201d said Marisol Dur\u00e1n Vergora, a first-time visitor to the Vatican from Spain. \u201cHe is an extremist, whereas Francis is more human and closer to the people.\u201d Another pilgrim, who wished to remain anonymous, speculated after being briefed on the goings-on: \u201cBenedict decided to abdicate and should keep his promise of staying silent.\u201d The ex-pontiff, who chose to be called Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI after his abdication in 2013, instead of reverting to Joseph Ratzinger, is at the centre of a drama that has been more entertaining than the Oscar-nominated film, The Two Popes. It started with a book written with the outspoken conservative cardinal Robert Sarah defending priestly celibacy. That in itself would not have caused a stir. But the timing of the book\u2019s release, as Pope Francis considers allowing the ordination of married men in remote areas of the Amazon in order to overcome a shortage of priests, led many to accuse Benedict, who still lives within the walls of Vatican City and continues to wear a white cassock, of breaching his vow of silence and undermining his successor\u2019s authority. In a bizarre twist, after extracts of From the Depths of Our Hearts were published in France\u2019s Le Figaro newspaper last Sunday, the former pontiff demanded that his name be dropped as co-author. His personal secretary, Georg G\u00e4nswein, said that while Benedict knew that Cardinal Sarah, who has clashed with Pope Francis in the past, was preparing a book, and had sent him an essay on the priesthood, he had not approved a co-authored project and had neither seen nor authorised the book\u2019s cover. Sarah denied allegations that he had misled Benedict, providing proof of the text that had been given to him and claiming that Benedict was aware that the project would take the form of a book. The French publisher, Fayard, went ahead and published the book as planned, but in future editions Benedict will be named as a contributor rather than co-author. Meanwhile, the US publisher, Ignatius, refused to relent, saying in a statement that the English version would retain Benedict as co-author. Amid the fallout over the book, Vatican commentators picked over its origins, with some saying \u201cthe two popes\u201d were the victims of exploitation by the warring conservative and liberal factions within the Catholic church. Throughout his life Benedict has been a prolific writer, but others questioned his capacity to construct such a detailed essay at the age of 92. A Vatican journalist for the rightwing Italian press claimed that it was a furious Pope Francis who ordered that Benedict\u2019s name be removed. Benedict has come forward on a variety of issues over the past seven years, most controversially writing last year that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and \u201chomosexual cliques\u201d among priests were to blame for the church\u2019s paedophile-priest scandals. The opinion came two months after an unprecedented Vatican summit on tackling clerical sexual abuse, and sharply contrasted with that of Francis, who blamed the scandals on a clerical culture that elevates priests above the laity. Benedict also wrote a letter complimenting Cardinal Joachim Meisner \u2013 a fierce critic of Francis who spoke out against the pontiff allowing remarried divorcees to receive holy communion \u2013 who died in 2017. But this is the first time he has intervened, whether knowingly or not, in a matter that the Pope is actively considering. Francis is weeks away from publishing his decision on the Amazon after a document approved by bishops at a synod in October noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have \u201cenormous difficulties\u201d in receiving communion and seeing a priest. If Francis supports the request to ordain married men, it would apply only to those already serving as deacons. The pontiff himself has consistently said that he would never change the centuries-old requirement for celibacy, but critics fear that the Amazon could set a precedent. \u201cIn all the times that Benedict has intervened, what he has written is coherent with what he thinks, so this doesn\u2019t surprise me,\u201d said Iacopo Scaramuzzi, a Vatican journalist and author of the book Tango Vaticano. La Chiesa al Tempo di Francesco (\u2018Vatican Tango. The Church in the Time of Francis\u2019). \u201cThey say he may have been manipulated by his entourage, but he was the one who chose his entourage.\u201d The person at the centre of his inner circle is G\u00e4nswein, a German archbishop whose dashing looks have earned him the nickname Gorgeous Georg. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that in all of this drama G\u00e4nswein had a role,\u201d added Scaramuzzi. \u201cHe is also very conservative and is among the Pope\u2019s opponents.\u201d Robert Mickens, the Rome-based editor of the English-language edition of the Catholic newspaper La Croix, said that Benedict had never dissociated himself from \u201cthe minions\u201d who use him. \u201cFrom the beginning, supporters of the more traditional wing of the church who were not happy that he resigned have tugged at him to keep his voice in the game,\u201d added Mickens. \u201cAnd he has worryingly gone along with this. We\u2019re in this situation because he did not keep his promise to be quiet.\u201d The Two Popes is a fictionalised depiction of a bromance between Benedict and Francis despite their different ideas, with, in the final scene of the film, the pair eating pizza and drinking beer as they watch Germany play Argentina in the World Cup final. In real life, it is unlikely the two are so chummy, but most experts agree that the relationship, at least until now, has been cordial, with Francis acting graciously in the face of opposition. \u201cThey have always tried to have good relations in order not to present a great split at the top of the church,\u201d said Marco Politi, a Vatican journalist and author of Joseph Ratzinger, Crisis of a Papacy. \u201cBut this is the first time the retired pope has [explicitly] taken sides, and this is really serious.\u201d Joshua McElwee, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said Benedict\u2019s comments on celibacy could scupper the potential move in the Amazon and leave many questions unanswered, especially over how the role of Pope Emeritus would continue. Among those in the queue for a papal audience was Alex Flood, a protestant minister from the US who was in Rome to do research on Catholicism. \u201cI know very little about the politics of the Catholic church but from our perspective, celibacy should be a choice and not beholden to tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I speak to Catholics they recognise this, but it\u2019s such an old tradition that the change is uncomfortable.\u201d Flood described the scandal over the book as a \u201cdog-and-pony show that is missing the needs of people\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s akin to watching American politics,\u201d he said.",

From a diversity perspective it\u2019s a powerful story that almost all cultures have had a foothold in.\u201d The team at Olson Kundig brought in a group of children aged six to 12 to see how they interracted with the flood story. Each was asked to build a house for a family of four, which was then placed in tub filled with water. \u201cSome sank, some broke, a few floated,\u201d says Maskin. \u201cWhat was exciting was that the kids regrouped to improve their models.

The first floor was originally a doctor\u2019s home, while the ground floor was divided into several shops, their glass facades facing the wide, tree-lined street. After the second world war, it served as a meeting place for the city\u2019s Japanese community; then, from the 1960s, Lisbon diners flocked to its marble entrance when it became a fashionable restaurant. By the 1990s a financial company had put paid to that, redecorating the rooms in global-business beige.</p> <p>Ten years ago, Ant\u00f3nio Falc\u00e3o Costa Lopes and his brother Alexandre moved the Lisbon outpost of their architecture firm here (their main office is in Angola) and the building\u2019s fortunes took an upward turn. It is still owned by the family who had it built in the early 1900s, but under the Costa Lopes\u2019 expert eye, various repairs were gently suggested and carried out and the building began to regain a cohesive character. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66e5fa442135a8c1b9d26208564df130f00356c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66e5fa442135a8c1b9d26208564df130f00356c8/0_2080_6239_6239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Filipa and Ant\u00f3nio in reception against the Jupiter 10 wallpaper.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Filipa and Ant\u00f3nio in reception against the Jupiter 10 wallpaper.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBasically, whatever Ant\u00f3nio asked to do, the owner said yes because he knew the property was in good hands,\u201d says Filipa Fortunato. Filipa is Ant\u00f3nio\u2019s wife and also trained as an architect before opting to work in education. In 2016, the brothers decided to relocate their office across town \u2013 but Ant\u00f3nio and Filipa didn\u2019t want to give up the building.</p> <p>\u201cWe had talked about opening a hotel for a while, but as something to do once our children had left home,\u201d Filipa explains. \u201cBut this place was too incredible to let go. We gave up our old Lisbon home and moved in.\u201d</p> <p>The couple and their children, J\u00falia, 17, Jaquim, 15, Merc\u00eas, 12, and Sofia, five, now all live \u201cabove the shop\u201d at Casa Fortunato. There are nine guest suites and the family\u2019s bedrooms are on a newly converted attic floor, where the style is more minimalist, taking its cue from the black beams, white walls and big views of the sky. But they spend plenty of time downstairs, sharing their living spaces with hotel guests.</p> <p>There is a library, which is a good place for doing homework. The reception area, with its mirror-glass coffee table, <a href=\"https://www.vitra.com/en-gb/corporation/designer/details/jean-prouve\">Jean Prouv\u00e9</a> desks and Zanotti sofa, is where friends drop by for coffee and a chat. And the hub of the house is the living room. Cacau, the family\u2019s languorous labrador, likes to hang out there, keeping a watchful eye on all the comings and goings. At weekends, the family has breakfast downstairs at the long, gleaming rosewood table. Sofia, their youngest daughter, arrives first and heads for the homemade chocolate spread and pancakes; Julia and Jaquim emerge later, operating on teenage time. For the family this isn\u2019t just about having the pick of the breakfast bar. \u201cThe idea is that we are sharing our food, along with our style and knowledge of the city,\u201d says Filipa. The menu at Casa Fortunato is macrobiotic, but there is no evangelising. \u201cWe explain it in advance, so no one turns up expecting eggs, bacon and hash browns,\u201d says Ant\u00f3nio. </p> <p>Hotel owners living on site is not a revolutionary idea.

      "body": "<p>Hard Up (BBC Three) is a little documentary series that punches far above its weight. Over three short episodes, each barely reaching 20 minutes, it tells the stories of young people living in north Devon. \u201cPeople think Devon\u2019s all beaches and farms,\u201d says the charismatic Titch, although she is not particularly enamoured with the biscuit-tin beauty sold to tourists and second-homers. Nor are directors Aodh Breathnach and Maya Amin-Smith, who take an insightful look beyond the picturesque countryside to find out what impact the seasonal economy is having on the county\u2019s youth.</p> <p>They approach their subjects with kindness and humanity, dividing the series into three topics \u2013 housing, work and crime \u2013 all of which are tangled up in the region\u2019s dependence on tourism. North Devon has one of the highest rates of youth homelessness in the country, and Kaye, an outreach worker for rough sleepers, explains the difficulties tourism brings for people who live in the region year-round. Six-month tenancies are common, because properties can be rented out all summer for more money; at the end of six months, as the season kicks off, people are turfed out, unable to afford the inflated rents. Second homes are left unoccupied much of the year. Kaye tries to find a bed in a B&amp;B for a vulnerable man sleeping beneath an old train carriage, but the school holidays are about to begin and nothing is available. She visits a woman sleeping rough in a cemetery, who knocks back a bottle of vodka as they chat. \u201cShe\u2019s so young,\u201d Kaye says afterwards, exasperated by the fact that, in this moment, there is nothing she can do. \u201cIt\u2019s times like this when I would really like to livestream direct to the House of bloody Commons.\u201d</p> <p>The problems extend to work, too. Over the past 30 years, half a million young people have left coastal towns, presumably in search of a more regular and reliable income. The second episode, Hustling for Work, is the standout, and focuses mainly on Titch, a 20-year-old firecracker who has ambitions of becoming a photographer. Her life story is told beautifully and teased out slowly; she had a serious illness as a young girl, then experienced bullying and was kicked out of home at 18. She now lives in a shared house and is friends mostly with the homeless people in her home town who, she says, would be there for her in a second if ever she needed them. Titch has been taking their photographs, documenting what she calls life on the outside. She is funny, sharp and has a greater understanding of people than most others twice her age.</p> <p>Finally, we meet Joshua, a 29-year-old boxer who is trying to get back in the ring after a punch-up on a night out led him away from a promising boxing career and into a two-year prison sentence. Joshua\u2019s story, too, is laid out empathetically. His mother, now dead, was an addict, but \u201cthere were times she was amazing\u201d, he says, sweetly. When he started school in Devon, he experienced racist abuse on his first day; he didn\u2019t even know what the word he was called meant, but when he understood it he broke the boy\u2019s nose. His partner, April, says, touchingly, that the boxing ring is the only place that never let him down.</p> <p>Hard Up crams a lot in, but it does so with a light touch.

      "bodyText": "Hard Up (BBC Three) is a little documentary series that punches far above its weight. Over three short episodes, each barely reaching 20 minutes, it tells the stories of young people living in north Devon. \u201cPeople think Devon\u2019s all beaches and farms,\u201d says the charismatic Titch, although she is not particularly enamoured with the biscuit-tin beauty sold to tourists and second-homers. Nor are directors Aodh Breathnach and Maya Amin-Smith, who take an insightful look beyond the picturesque countryside to find out what impact the seasonal economy is having on the county\u2019s youth. They approach their subjects with kindness and humanity, dividing the series into three topics \u2013 housing, work and crime \u2013 all of which are tangled up in the region\u2019s dependence on tourism. North Devon has one of the highest rates of youth homelessness in the country, and Kaye, an outreach worker for rough sleepers, explains the difficulties tourism brings for people who live in the region year-round. Six-month tenancies are common, because properties can be rented out all summer for more money; at the end of six months, as the season kicks off, people are turfed out, unable to afford the inflated rents. Second homes are left unoccupied much of the year. Kaye tries to find a bed in a B&amp;B for a vulnerable man sleeping beneath an old train carriage, but the school holidays are about to begin and nothing is available. She visits a woman sleeping rough in a cemetery, who knocks back a bottle of vodka as they chat. \u201cShe\u2019s so young,\u201d Kaye says afterwards, exasperated by the fact that, in this moment, there is nothing she can do. \u201cIt\u2019s times like this when I would really like to livestream direct to the House of bloody Commons.\u201d The problems extend to work, too. Over the past 30 years, half a million young people have left coastal towns, presumably in search of a more regular and reliable income. The second episode, Hustling for Work, is the standout, and focuses mainly on Titch, a 20-year-old firecracker who has ambitions of becoming a photographer. Her life story is told beautifully and teased out slowly; she had a serious illness as a young girl, then experienced bullying and was kicked out of home at 18. She now lives in a shared house and is friends mostly with the homeless people in her home town who, she says, would be there for her in a second if ever she needed them. Titch has been taking their photographs, documenting what she calls life on the outside. She is funny, sharp and has a greater understanding of people than most others twice her age. Finally, we meet Joshua, a 29-year-old boxer who is trying to get back in the ring after a punch-up on a night out led him away from a promising boxing career and into a two-year prison sentence. Joshua\u2019s story, too, is laid out empathetically. His mother, now dead, was an addict, but \u201cthere were times she was amazing\u201d, he says, sweetly. When he started school in Devon, he experienced racist abuse on his first day; he didn\u2019t even know what the word he was called meant, but when he understood it he broke the boy\u2019s nose. His partner, April, says, touchingly, that the boxing ring is the only place that never let him down. Hard Up crams a lot in, but it does so with a light touch. There are a couple of moments when the narrative feels a little forced \u2013 Titch is working up to an exhibition of her pictures, Joshua is preparing to get back in the ring \u2013 and, although it doesn\u2019t suffer from this structure, it doesn\u2019t need it. These are human stories, handled carefully, told well. It is funny \u2013 the man growing cannabis in his rented house has to pack his equipment down for a property inspection, and shoves it into a box marked \u201cgarden stuff\u201d \u2013 and respectful of the complexities of human beings, particularly those at the mercy of an inconsistent economy. When Griggy, a boxing trainer in Bideford, talks about the young men who come through his gym, he knows most of them have been in some sort of trouble. \u201cWe don\u2019t judge none of \u2019em,\u201d he says. Hard Up has taken this to heart. It made me think of the unmourned age of \u201cpoverty porn\u201d TV, when reality-adjacent shows such as Benefits Street and Skint stirred up trouble to look at or, more accurately, to look down at poor communities. Like The Mighty Redcar before it, Hard Up suggests that gawping has been replaced by humour and compassion. Hopefully the people who need to hear these stories, perhaps someone from the House of bloody Commons, will, through a programme such as this, find them harder to ignore.",

It was the debut in 1988 of an exhilarating, in-your-face artist, slotted between the soft seasonal balms of Freiheit\u2019s Keeping the Dream Alive and Kylie and Jason\u2019s Especially for You. She was 24, visibly pregnant, dancing in a gold bra, gold jacket and huge medallion, and doing something else that felt revolutionary: rapping.</p> <p>The next day, our school playground filled with little girls delivering words into one another\u2019s faces that they didn\u2019t quite understand, trying to get the rhythms right. It didn\u2019t matter: Neneh Cherry\u2019s Buffalo Stance, and its attitude, had entered our world. Cherry was by no means the first female rapper with a distinctly British style \u2013 there had been several female duos and groups before her \u2013 but that uncompromising, joyous, performance can be seen now as the moment mainstream pop opened up to artists like her, and laid the groundwork for the next three decades of solo female MCs.</p> <p><em>Raw Like Sushi</em>, Cherry\u2019s debut album, went platinum the following summer; a long-overdue glossy reissue arrives this month to mark, belatedly, its 30th anniversary. \u201cRap was freedom,\u201d Cherry says today. You could find your own way within it, your own form of expression, and that felt like a big thing as a woman. There\u2019s something very powerful within rap, anyway. You\u2019re not dependent on the words working with the melody. You can just pour out what you really want to say in an unrestricted way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cfd1070746a3c5b1c27fb6cd3cba33d1854f43d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfd1070746a3c5b1c27fb6cd3cba33d1854f43d0/0_495_4492_5616/800.jpg\" alt=\"Neneh Cherry.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It felt natural that girls were part of the early rap culture\u2019: Neneh Cherry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clare Shilland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To discover where British rap began, it\u2019s useful to first take a trip to America: specifically to Long Island, New York, in the late 1970s, where the teenage Neneh was living in a loft with her artist mother, Moki, and her adoptive father, jazz trumpeter Don. Cherry had a boyfriend who lived nearby, in the Queensbridge Houses public housing development, where the early roots of hip-hop were stirring. \u201cHe was a DJ, but there were also guys whose job was to announce the DJs, and it quickly became about these people introducing themselves, too. Saying: \u2018This is my name, my street, where I come from.\u2019 This was long before freestyling, but it was interesting even then: it became about talking about who you were.\u201d</p> <p>Cherry left that scene behind (\u201cme and my boyfriend broke up, and I got into punk\u201d) but then in 1980, she heard a record that made her \u201csee the light\u201d. This was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfEQOKaDT9c\" title=\"\">Vicious Rap</a> by Sweet Tee \u2013 New Yorker Tanya Winley, whose father, Paul, ran a label that had formerly released doo-wop, but now released Malcolm X speeches (these were later sampled by Public Enemy). \u201cAs a record, it was raw \u2013 it felt like she had delivered her words in two takes, on fire. It had a quality like Aretha Franklin had, or Patti Smith had. Sweet Tee had power and independence: total ownership of the space she was in as she was doing it.\u201d</p> <p>When Cherry moved to Britain a few years later (she was in Rip, Rig + Panic, and also had a daughter, Naima, with her first husband, the Pop Group\u2019s Bruce Smith), the directness of rap remained a big part of how she wanted to present herself as a woman. \u201cBecause there\u2019s something in the speaking of words that helps change the conversation, you know? You see it in the power to record history and social commentary that came from artists during the civil rights movement \u2013 in people like the Last Poets, and performance poets like Jayne Cortez. You can track it back to the culture of west African griots [storytellers], the keepers of history and oral traditions in their tribes.\u201d She met a griot in Sierra Leone when she was younger, she adds, from the nomadic tribe that her late birth father, the musician Ahmadu Jah, comes from.</p> <p>\u201cBut when you hear those words and delivery from a woman, it\u2019s something else. A male voice can prompt many feelings, sure: love, longing, even anger sometimes, when you\u2019re female. But when a woman hears a woman like that\u2026\u201d She exhales. \u201cIt\u2019s a ticket to somewhere else. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1980s music industry, it felt to her that women needed to change the conversation. Cherry had always noticed powerful, creative women in music, but saw that other stereotypes persisted, like the over-sexualised girl, or the \u201cnice girl writing sweet lyrics about how life is bitter and painful, longing for babies and love. I felt all the same stuff, but I loved how rap took those lyrical ideas in a different direction. It was less about \u2018I\u2019m sitting here waiting for you, where are you?\u2019 It was more: \u2018I\u2019m here. This is how it is. What the fuck?\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsRz3TJDEY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JWsRz3TJDEY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsRz3TJDEY\">Watch the video for Buffalo Stance by Neneh Cherry.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Buffalo Stance took this attitude and ran with it. It began life as a B-side and alternative version to pop duo Morgan McVey\u2019s single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJH_cbFm_0\" title=\"\">Looking Good Diving</a> (Cameron McVey has been Cherry\u2019s partner since then, and is father to her two daughters: Tyson, the baby in the Buffalo Stance bump, born in 1989; and pop star Mabel, born in 1996). Its genesis is sweetly ordinary. Cherry wrote the line \u201cwho\u2019s that gigolo on the street?\u201d walking out of a corner shop near Earl\u2019s Court. Its famous middle-eight line \u201cWhat\u2019s he like? What\u2019s he like, anyway?\u201d is Cherry doing an impression of Fat Tony, the main DJ at London\u2019s underground Wag Club.</p> <p>\u201cThey was a playfulness there: it was totally from the heart, and totally from my life,\u201d Cherry says, \u201cbut it was also from this fearless space.\u201d The other rap tracks on <em>Raw Like Sushi</em> were similarly bold. So Here I Come slams a first kiss \u201chit and miss/He wasn\u2019t impressed \u2019cos I wouldn\u2019t get undressed\u201d. The Next Generation asks men \u201cto love us/ Through thick and thin with your heart and your soul/ not the size of your dick\u201d. My Bitch\u2019s berating of a man for wanting to make a girl could also be British female rap\u2019s manifesto. \u201cI ain\u2019t playing; I\u2019m to be taken seriously/ You know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p> <p>Rap records featuring women had started to break out in Britain before Cherry, however. Sheryl Garratt, a journalist for the <em>Face</em> before becoming editor in 1989, saw first-hand how rap was influenced by reggae soundsystems in cities like her native Birmingham. There, toasting (lyrical chanting over reggae rhythms) was an obvious, close relative to rap. \u201cThis also meant people were rapping in their own accents from the start. It was about people trying to stand out from each other in their own peer groups. Hearing something half in Jamaican patois, half in pure Brummie, where I was from, felt very natural.\u201d Cherry herself got involved in soundsystems when she moved to the UK, being a regular at Bali Hai in Streatham, and meeting the Wild Bunch in Bristol, who she mentions on Buffalo Stance: they later morphed into Massive Attack.</p> <p>Women were a visible, welcoming presence in the US early rap scene too, Garratt adds. She recalls going to New York, aged 18, to interview Sugar Hill Records\u2019 CEO and Rapper Delight\u2019s producer Sylvia Robinson (\u201cshe was good fun, really friendly\u201d). Hip-hop gigs at Manhattan\u2019s Roxy Roller Rink were also full of young women, and many performed, like Angie Stone\u2019s early rap group, the Sequence, Roxanne Shante and MC Sha Rock of the Funky 4+1. \u201cBeing at a roller-skating rink, of course, that world was full of girls. It felt natural that they were part of the early rap culture.\u201d</p> <p>An equivalent culture was building in Britain. In Clapham, south London, in 1983, schoolgirls Debbie \u201cCookie\u201d Pryce and Suzie Banfield formed an all-girl gang with friends and cousins called the Warm Milk and Cookie Crew (they eventually became Cookie Crew, stripped back to the original pair). \u201cAccess to black music was limited for us [in the mainstream],\u201d Pryce says today (she\u2019s now a senior label manager for the Orchard, a subsidiary of Sony Music). \u201cPirate radio stations were mainly how we were able to access the music we loved.\u201d</p> <p>They rapped over electro and hip-hop, practised in their bedrooms, front rooms, and for free at the Battersea Arts Centre, and slowly became aware of other hip-hop communities in London; they\u2019d join other rappers and breakdancers for jams in Covent Garden, which became a crucial meeting point for the culture. Women were always at these jams as crowd members, but not as participants, Pryce remembers. \u201cBeing the only female on a line-up was the norm to us, but we loved the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>Tim Westwood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p048j32k/open-space-bad-meaning-good\" title=\"\">1987 documentary </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p048j32k/open-space-bad-meaning-good\" title=\"\">Bad Meaning Good </a></em>chronicles this scene, interviewing Cookie Crew and another female duo, the Wee Papa Girl Rappers; a year later, both had top five hits (Cookie Crew\u2019s was Rok Da House with the Beatmasters). Pryce says she was constantly asked if they were as good at rapping as men. \u201cWe never understood why \u2013 we would often end up turning the interview on the journalist and asked them what they thought.\u201d This antagonism played a pivotal role, though, she says, in the growing confidence of female rappers. \u201cThese experiences only inspired us to be better and stronger.\u201d</p> <p>Other British women emerged, like the She Rockers, featuring a young Betty Boo (raw footage exists online of them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PSbg7ynGqM\" title=\"\">rapping with Public Enemy in a London McDonald\u2019s</a>), and Monie Love, who eventually had a global smash, It\u2019s A Shame (My Sister). After them, the 90s was a quiet time for women, with movements like daisy age hip-hop being superseded by gangster rap in the mainstream. Garratt noticed bikini-wearing or halter-necked women increasingly used as window-dressing in videos for men: \u201cIn the 90s, rap started to turn into a business.\u201d The British music industry was also more interested in post-rave dance music and Britpop as profitable genres.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qimg_q7LbQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8Qimg_q7LbQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qimg_q7LbQ\">Watch the video for Ladies First by Monie Love and Queen Latifah.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The mechanics of touring \u2013 which helped embed and sustain a longer career \u2013was not set up to help women starting to have families either, Garratt says (\u201calthough that\u2019s not a rap issue, it\u2019s just a music industry issue\u201d). Cherry\u2019s career continued because she had a supportive family and management team around her; Garratt remembers interviewing Cherry for The Face in 1996, when both women had babies. \u201cWe were breastfeeding them in a hotel garden in the South of France while we spoke \u2013 it was amazing. But that rarely happens. It usually takes a village, a soundsystem culture or a family, to help a woman keep going with their career when they\u2019ve had kids.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d88043aacee50d8a2cf76ba08386bd463801e74b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d88043aacee50d8a2cf76ba08386bd463801e74b/5_163_5116_3071/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debbie Pryce and Suzie Banfield of Cookie Crew in 1989.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debbie Pryce and Suzie Banfield of Cookie Crew in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David O\u2019Neil/ANL/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 2000s saw British female rappers return to the charts, but having short-lived bursts of mainstream success. The most prominent, Ms Dynamite, first attracted attention for her quickfire patois-heavy style on two huge 2001 garage hits \u2013 DJ Sticky\u2019s Booo! and So Solid Crew\u2019s Envy \u2013 but she\u2019d ditched rapping entirely on her Mercury prize-winning debut album, <em>A Little Deeper</em>, for palatable soul. She also had a son, Shavaar, in 2003, and her mainstream career died down. Interestingly, she returned to her original love after that, rapping on Katy B\u2019s 2010 single, Lights On, and a solo single, 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUcWkjLTDSU\" title=\"\">Neva Soft</a>; she continues rapping in the underground today, with a huge fanbase.</p> <p>Estelle also hit big with her single 1980, in 2004, before becoming part of a wave of British female rappers criticising the industry for a lack of support. \u201cThe record labels just don\u2019t know where to go with us,\u201d she told the <em>Guardian\u2019s</em> Alex Macpherson in 2008, after she\u2019d decamped, successfully, to America. 2009 Mercury winner Speech Debelle also highlighted a lack of openness to different styles within rap, after releasing <em>Speech Therapy</em>, full of woodwind-soaked narratives about her experiences with homelessness and an absent father, more in line with the 2010s spoken-word world of Kate Tempest. \u201cI\u2019m not black enough for certain black radio stations,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Grime perhaps provided the better launchpad for female MCs, and still does. One of the first to emerge from this scene was Shystie in 2004, who was taught to rap by male friends in Tottenham\u2019s Broadwater Farm Community Centre. Being female helped in her early days, she believes. \u201cIt helped me get more focus and attention because I was different, and I grabbed it. I couldn\u2019t believe I was this little black girl from Hackney, controlling the audience.\u201d</p> <p>Her debut single, One Wish, was a pirate radio hit, and the No 1 video on satellite urban music TV channel Channel U, but mainstream radio had other ideas \u2013 as Estelle\u2019s 1980 was also being released at the time. \u201cI was told several times that there was only one space for a woman. It was disheartening and upsetting, but there was nothing else I could do: my mainstream career was dependent on the few gatekeepers who decided the playlists.\u201d One Wish got to No 40; Shystie\u2019s career went back to the underground.</p> <p>But a few years later, something happened that changed the rules of success. \u201cSocial media meant that British female rappers suddenly weren\u2019t dependent on anyone any more. Everything\u2019s there at the girl\u2019s hands through YouTube, Twitter and Instagram: creativity, an instant platform, people that could help you, and an audience.\u201d Shystie herself has a project being announced later this month that couldn\u2019t have happened without it; the last decade of British female rappers also shows women defying the industry, unapologetically saying what they want to say, running their own worlds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fceb684c7b509b7c97923bac01c66113afb83656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fceb684c7b509b7c97923bac01c66113afb83656/0_38_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Leshurr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lady Leshurr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>British female rap is arguably in ruder health now than it has ever been, though much of it still operates outside the mainstream. Take Birmingham\u2019s Lady Leshurr, who turned down a deal with Atlantic Records in 2013, after they offered her $250,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/01/lady-leshurr-they-wanted-to-pit-me-against-nicki-minaj-i-wasnt-feeling-that\" title=\"\">to start a feud with Nicky Minaj</a>: she produced and edited seven <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyodeHtVvkA\" title=\"\">brilliant </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyodeHtVvkA\" title=\"\">Queen\u2019s Speeches</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyodeHtVvkA\" title=\"\"> on YouTube</a> instead, full of quick-witted, Brummie-inflected freestyles about relationships and society. There\u2019s Ms Banks, who supported US rap megastar Cardi B while still unsigned, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/23/on-my-radar-little-simz-cultural-highlights\" title=\"\">Little Simz</a>, who released her third album, the Mercury-nominated <em>Grey Area</em>, on Age 101, a label that helps distribute artists\u2019 music, without them giving up ownership. On 2015\u2019s Persons, she\u2019d rapped about how people would say: \u201cThe industry will break you, Simbi\u201d. On Grey Area\u2019s Venom, she was more direct: \u201cFuck those who don\u2019t believe/They would never wanna admit I\u2019m the best here/From the mere fact that I\u2019ve got ovaries.\u201d</p> <p>A broader range of experiences are being expressed by this new generation of British of women, too. Take Peckham\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/23/flohio-on-tearing-up-hip-hops-rulebook-rap-isnt-about-weed-and-lipstick\" title=\"\">Flohio</a>, rapping about Grenfell against heavier, darker electronics, or Poetic Pilgrimage, using rap to explore their Muslim beliefs. Or Lioness, back rapping after taking six years working a normal job in London, finding her voice again. The brilliant Ffsytho, who raps (and tweets, often hilariously) about her identity as a gay woman and the world around her, also finds rap a useful tool (she spent her teens learning rap, she explains, enthusiastically, by playing DJ Sticky and Ms Dynamite\u2019s Booo! on repeat). \u201cI suffer with my mental health, so I put a lot of my rage into my lyrics. It feels like a weight has been lifted every time I spit venom.\u201d Ffsytho\u2019s been told she reminds people of Neneh Cherry too. \u201cShe\u2019s proper legendary, like the British Queen Latifah. I love her old school flow, a bit like storytelling. I want to work on something like her style, and bring that old school to the new school.\u201d</p> <p>In 2020, it feels like rap for British women is about confidence in one\u2019s own identity above anything else. They are proudly visible and audible \u2013 and will be even more so if the music business supports them as it should. When Cassie Rytz, the 17-year-old star of recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0799bx3\" title=\"\">BBC3 grime documentary </a><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0799bx3\" title=\"\">Galdem Sugar</a></em>, describes the rush of experiencing rap, for example, she does so with the same joy that Neneh Cherry felt 40 years ago. \u201cI get an adrenaline rush whenever I start spitting. It\u2019s being opinionated with a beat behind me. My story gets told to an audience, and it gets taken more seriously.\u201d She\u2019s seen things changing in her short time in the business too, she says, with stations like Rinse FM having much more gender equality in programmes and line-ups. \u201cMore people are beginning to wake up and become more aware of the barriers females face within this industry.\u201d</p> <p>Neneh Cherry, turning 56 in March and still making brilliant music, remains excited as well: \u201cThere are so many women today doing beautiful things and beautiful work. And what excites me most, to be honest, is women realising that being strong is not about being aggressive for the sake of it. It\u2019s about expressing yourself boldly and with humour, but also showing your vulnerabilities, and asking for help, without overexposing yourself.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m 10 again, watching Cherry on TV in her gold medallion, giving birth to a new feeling, helping us girls all become something else. \u201cThat is strength. That is power. That\u2019s being a woman.\u201d</p> <p><em>Raw Like Sushi: 30th Anniversary Edition is released on UMC/Virgin on 30 January</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "One of BBC Four\u2019s recent Top of the Pops reruns from the late 1980s features a performance that many of us who were young girls at the time vividly remember. It was the debut in 1988 of an exhilarating, in-your-face artist, slotted between the soft seasonal balms of Freiheit\u2019s Keeping the Dream Alive and Kylie and Jason\u2019s Especially for You. She was 24, visibly pregnant, dancing in a gold bra, gold jacket and huge medallion, and doing something else that felt revolutionary: rapping. The next day, our school playground filled with little girls delivering words into one another\u2019s faces that they didn\u2019t quite understand, trying to get the rhythms right. It didn\u2019t matter: Neneh Cherry\u2019s Buffalo Stance, and its attitude, had entered our world. Cherry was by no means the first female rapper with a distinctly British style \u2013 there had been several female duos and groups before her \u2013 but that uncompromising, joyous, performance can be seen now as the moment mainstream pop opened up to artists like her, and laid the groundwork for the next three decades of solo female MCs. Raw Like Sushi, Cherry\u2019s debut album, went platinum the following summer; a long-overdue glossy reissue arrives this month to mark, belatedly, its 30th anniversary. \u201cRap was freedom,\u201d Cherry says today. You could find your own way within it, your own form of expression, and that felt like a big thing as a woman. There\u2019s something very powerful within rap, anyway. You\u2019re not dependent on the words working with the melody. You can just pour out what you really want to say in an unrestricted way.\u201d To discover where British rap began, it\u2019s useful to first take a trip to America: specifically to Long Island, New York, in the late 1970s, where the teenage Neneh was living in a loft with her artist mother, Moki, and her adoptive father, jazz trumpeter Don. Cherry had a boyfriend who lived nearby, in the Queensbridge Houses public housing development, where the early roots of hip-hop were stirring. \u201cHe was a DJ, but there were also guys whose job was to announce the DJs, and it quickly became about these people introducing themselves, too. Saying: \u2018This is my name, my street, where I come from.\u2019 This was long before freestyling, but it was interesting even then: it became about talking about who you were.\u201d Cherry left that scene behind (\u201cme and my boyfriend broke up, and I got into punk\u201d) but then in 1980, she heard a record that made her \u201csee the light\u201d. This was Vicious Rap by Sweet Tee \u2013 New Yorker Tanya Winley, whose father, Paul, ran a label that had formerly released doo-wop, but now released Malcolm X speeches (these were later sampled by Public Enemy). \u201cAs a record, it was raw \u2013 it felt like she had delivered her words in two takes, on fire. It had a quality like Aretha Franklin had, or Patti Smith had. Sweet Tee had power and independence: total ownership of the space she was in as she was doing it.\u201d When Cherry moved to Britain a few years later (she was in Rip, Rig + Panic, and also had a daughter, Naima, with her first husband, the Pop Group\u2019s Bruce Smith), the directness of rap remained a big part of how she wanted to present herself as a woman. \u201cBecause there\u2019s something in the speaking of words that helps change the conversation, you know? You see it in the power to record history and social commentary that came from artists during the civil rights movement \u2013 in people like the Last Poets, and performance poets like Jayne Cortez. You can track it back to the culture of west African griots [storytellers], the keepers of history and oral traditions in their tribes.\u201d She met a griot in Sierra Leone when she was younger, she adds, from the nomadic tribe that her late birth father, the musician Ahmadu Jah, comes from. \u201cBut when you hear those words and delivery from a woman, it\u2019s something else. A male voice can prompt many feelings, sure: love, longing, even anger sometimes, when you\u2019re female. But when a woman hears a woman like that\u2026\u201d She exhales. \u201cIt\u2019s a ticket to somewhere else. It\u2019s an experience.\u201d In the 1980s music industry, it felt to her that women needed to change the conversation. Cherry had always noticed powerful, creative women in music, but saw that other stereotypes persisted, like the over-sexualised girl, or the \u201cnice girl writing sweet lyrics about how life is bitter and painful, longing for babies and love. I felt all the same stuff, but I loved how rap took those lyrical ideas in a different direction. It was less about \u2018I\u2019m sitting here waiting for you, where are you?\u2019 It was more: \u2018I\u2019m here. This is how it is. What the fuck?\u2019\u201d Buffalo Stance took this attitude and ran with it. It began life as a B-side and alternative version to pop duo Morgan McVey\u2019s single Looking Good Diving (Cameron McVey has been Cherry\u2019s partner since then, and is father to her two daughters: Tyson, the baby in the Buffalo Stance bump, born in 1989; and pop star Mabel, born in 1996). Its genesis is sweetly ordinary. Cherry wrote the line \u201cwho\u2019s that gigolo on the street?\u201d walking out of a corner shop near Earl\u2019s Court. Its famous middle-eight line \u201cWhat\u2019s he like? What\u2019s he like, anyway?\u201d is Cherry doing an impression of Fat Tony, the main DJ at London\u2019s underground Wag Club. \u201cThey was a playfulness there: it was totally from the heart, and totally from my life,\u201d Cherry says, \u201cbut it was also from this fearless space.\u201d The other rap tracks on Raw Like Sushi were similarly bold. So Here I Come slams a first kiss \u201chit and miss/He wasn\u2019t impressed \u2019cos I wouldn\u2019t get undressed\u201d. The Next Generation asks men \u201cto love us/ Through thick and thin with your heart and your soul/ not the size of your dick\u201d. My Bitch\u2019s berating of a man for wanting to make a girl could also be British female rap\u2019s manifesto. \u201cI ain\u2019t playing; I\u2019m to be taken seriously/ You know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d Rap records featuring women had started to break out in Britain before Cherry, however. Sheryl Garratt, a journalist for the Face before becoming editor in 1989, saw first-hand how rap was influenced by reggae soundsystems in cities like her native Birmingham. There, toasting (lyrical chanting over reggae rhythms) was an obvious, close relative to rap. \u201cThis also meant people were rapping in their own accents from the start. It was about people trying to stand out from each other in their own peer groups. Hearing something half in Jamaican patois, half in pure Brummie, where I was from, felt very natural.\u201d Cherry herself got involved in soundsystems when she moved to the UK, being a regular at Bali Hai in Streatham, and meeting the Wild Bunch in Bristol, who she mentions on Buffalo Stance: they later morphed into Massive Attack. Women were a visible, welcoming presence in the US early rap scene too, Garratt adds. She recalls going to New York, aged 18, to interview Sugar Hill Records\u2019 CEO and Rapper Delight\u2019s producer Sylvia Robinson (\u201cshe was good fun, really friendly\u201d). Hip-hop gigs at Manhattan\u2019s Roxy Roller Rink were also full of young women, and many performed, like Angie Stone\u2019s early rap group, the Sequence, Roxanne Shante and MC Sha Rock of the Funky 4+1. \u201cBeing at a roller-skating rink, of course, that world was full of girls. It felt natural that they were part of the early rap culture.\u201d An equivalent culture was building in Britain. In Clapham, south London, in 1983, schoolgirls Debbie \u201cCookie\u201d Pryce and Suzie Banfield formed an all-girl gang with friends and cousins called the Warm Milk and Cookie Crew (they eventually became Cookie Crew, stripped back to the original pair). \u201cAccess to black music was limited for us [in the mainstream],\u201d Pryce says today (she\u2019s now a senior label manager for the Orchard, a subsidiary of Sony Music). \u201cPirate radio stations were mainly how we were able to access the music we loved.\u201d They rapped over electro and hip-hop, practised in their bedrooms, front rooms, and for free at the Battersea Arts Centre, and slowly became aware of other hip-hop communities in London; they\u2019d join other rappers and breakdancers for jams in Covent Garden, which became a crucial meeting point for the culture. Women were always at these jams as crowd members, but not as participants, Pryce remembers. \u201cBeing the only female on a line-up was the norm to us, but we loved the challenge.\u201d Tim Westwood\u2019s 1987 documentary Bad Meaning Good chronicles this scene, interviewing Cookie Crew and another female duo, the Wee Papa Girl Rappers; a year later, both had top five hits (Cookie Crew\u2019s was Rok Da House with the Beatmasters). Pryce says she was constantly asked if they were as good at rapping as men. \u201cWe never understood why \u2013 we would often end up turning the interview on the journalist and asked them what they thought.\u201d This antagonism played a pivotal role, though, she says, in the growing confidence of female rappers. \u201cThese experiences only inspired us to be better and stronger.\u201d Other British women emerged, like the She Rockers, featuring a young Betty Boo (raw footage exists online of them rapping with Public Enemy in a London McDonald\u2019s), and Monie Love, who eventually had a global smash, It\u2019s A Shame (My Sister). After them, the 90s was a quiet time for women, with movements like daisy age hip-hop being superseded by gangster rap in the mainstream. Garratt noticed bikini-wearing or halter-necked women increasingly used as window-dressing in videos for men: \u201cIn the 90s, rap started to turn into a business.\u201d The British music industry was also more interested in post-rave dance music and Britpop as profitable genres. The mechanics of touring \u2013 which helped embed and sustain a longer career \u2013was not set up to help women starting to have families either, Garratt says (\u201calthough that\u2019s not a rap issue, it\u2019s just a music industry issue\u201d). Cherry\u2019s career continued because she had a supportive family and management team around her; Garratt remembers interviewing Cherry for The Face in 1996, when both women had babies. \u201cWe were breastfeeding them in a hotel garden in the South of France while we spoke \u2013 it was amazing. But that rarely happens. It usually takes a village, a soundsystem culture or a family, to help a woman keep going with their career when they\u2019ve had kids.\u201d The 2000s saw British female rappers return to the charts, but having short-lived bursts of mainstream success. The most prominent, Ms Dynamite, first attracted attention for her quickfire patois-heavy style on two huge 2001 garage hits \u2013 DJ Sticky\u2019s Booo! and So Solid Crew\u2019s Envy \u2013 but she\u2019d ditched rapping entirely on her Mercury prize-winning debut album, A Little Deeper, for palatable soul. She also had a son, Shavaar, in 2003, and her mainstream career died down. Interestingly, she returned to her original love after that, rapping on Katy B\u2019s 2010 single, Lights On, and a solo single, 2011\u2019s Neva Soft; she continues rapping in the underground today, with a huge fanbase. Estelle also hit big with her single 1980, in 2004, before becoming part of a wave of British female rappers criticising the industry for a lack of support. \u201cThe record labels just don\u2019t know where to go with us,\u201d she told the Guardian\u2019s Alex Macpherson in 2008, after she\u2019d decamped, successfully, to America. 2009 Mercury winner Speech Debelle also highlighted a lack of openness to different styles within rap, after releasing Speech Therapy, full of woodwind-soaked narratives about her experiences with homelessness and an absent father, more in line with the 2010s spoken-word world of Kate Tempest. \u201cI\u2019m not black enough for certain black radio stations,\u201d she said. Grime perhaps provided the better launchpad for female MCs, and still does. One of the first to emerge from this scene was Shystie in 2004, who was taught to rap by male friends in Tottenham\u2019s Broadwater Farm Community Centre. Being female helped in her early days, she believes. \u201cIt helped me get more focus and attention because I was different, and I grabbed it. I couldn\u2019t believe I was this little black girl from Hackney, controlling the audience.\u201d Her debut single, One Wish, was a pirate radio hit, and the No 1 video on satellite urban music TV channel Channel U, but mainstream radio had other ideas \u2013 as Estelle\u2019s 1980 was also being released at the time. \u201cI was told several times that there was only one space for a woman. It was disheartening and upsetting, but there was nothing else I could do: my mainstream career was dependent on the few gatekeepers who decided the playlists.\u201d One Wish got to No 40; Shystie\u2019s career went back to the underground. But a few years later, something happened that changed the rules of success. \u201cSocial media meant that British female rappers suddenly weren\u2019t dependent on anyone any more. Everything\u2019s there at the girl\u2019s hands through YouTube, Twitter and Instagram: creativity, an instant platform, people that could help you, and an audience.\u201d Shystie herself has a project being announced later this month that couldn\u2019t have happened without it; the last decade of British female rappers also shows women defying the industry, unapologetically saying what they want to say, running their own worlds. British female rap is arguably in ruder health now than it has ever been, though much of it still operates outside the mainstream. Take Birmingham\u2019s Lady Leshurr, who turned down a deal with Atlantic Records in 2013, after they offered her $250,000 to start a feud with Nicky Minaj: she produced and edited seven brilliant Queen\u2019s Speeches on YouTube instead, full of quick-witted, Brummie-inflected freestyles about relationships and society. There\u2019s Ms Banks, who supported US rap megastar Cardi B while still unsigned, and Little Simz, who released her third album, the Mercury-nominated Grey Area, on Age 101, a label that helps distribute artists\u2019 music, without them giving up ownership. On 2015\u2019s Persons, she\u2019d rapped about how people would say: \u201cThe industry will break you, Simbi\u201d. On Grey Area\u2019s Venom, she was more direct: \u201cFuck those who don\u2019t believe/They would never wanna admit I\u2019m the best here/From the mere fact that I\u2019ve got ovaries.\u201d A broader range of experiences are being expressed by this new generation of British of women, too. Take Peckham\u2019s Flohio, rapping about Grenfell against heavier, darker electronics, or Poetic Pilgrimage, using rap to explore their Muslim beliefs. Or Lioness, back rapping after taking six years working a normal job in London, finding her voice again. The brilliant Ffsytho, who raps (and tweets, often hilariously) about her identity as a gay woman and the world around her, also finds rap a useful tool (she spent her teens learning rap, she explains, enthusiastically, by playing DJ Sticky and Ms Dynamite\u2019s Booo! on repeat). \u201cI suffer with my mental health, so I put a lot of my rage into my lyrics. It feels like a weight has been lifted every time I spit venom.\u201d Ffsytho\u2019s been told she reminds people of Neneh Cherry too. \u201cShe\u2019s proper legendary, like the British Queen Latifah. I love her old school flow, a bit like storytelling. I want to work on something like her style, and bring that old school to the new school.\u201d In 2020, it feels like rap for British women is about confidence in one\u2019s own identity above anything else. They are proudly visible and audible \u2013 and will be even more so if the music business supports them as it should. When Cassie Rytz, the 17-year-old star of recent BBC3 grime documentary Galdem Sugar, describes the rush of experiencing rap, for example, she does so with the same joy that Neneh Cherry felt 40 years ago. \u201cI get an adrenaline rush whenever I start spitting. It\u2019s being opinionated with a beat behind me. My story gets told to an audience, and it gets taken more seriously.\u201d She\u2019s seen things changing in her short time in the business too, she says, with stations like Rinse FM having much more gender equality in programmes and line-ups. \u201cMore people are beginning to wake up and become more aware of the barriers females face within this industry.\u201d Neneh Cherry, turning 56 in March and still making brilliant music, remains excited as well: \u201cThere are so many women today doing beautiful things and beautiful work. And what excites me most, to be honest, is women realising that being strong is not about being aggressive for the sake of it. It\u2019s about expressing yourself boldly and with humour, but also showing your vulnerabilities, and asking for help, without overexposing yourself.\u201d I\u2019m 10 again, watching Cherry on TV in her gold medallion, giving birth to a new feeling, helping us girls all become something else. \u201cThat is strength. That is power. That\u2019s being a woman.\u201d Raw Like Sushi: 30th Anniversary Edition is released on UMC/Virgin on 30 January",

The state, in turn, was an important part of the electoral college puzzle that put him in the White House.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s slim victory makes Michigan an important target for the Democrats this year along with other states that flipped to the Republican four years ago. This week, and at various stages in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is returning to three counties in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-voters-who-swung-to-trump\">swung from Obama to Trump </a>to ask which way they will go in November. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/general_election/\">Opinion polls suggest</a> that any of the leading Democratic candidates would beat Trump in Michigan although, 10 months before the election, they provide inspiration more than expectation to many Democrats fearful that the wrong candidate \u2013 too centrist or too liberal \u2013 could let Trump back in.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018He\u2019ll win again because the economy seems to be doing good\u2019</strong></h2> <p>While Trump commands the unwavering loyalty of a hardcore of voters, his victory was secured by people like Padot whose support is much softer. But, so far at least, many of them are still willing to back the president even though they have plenty of doubts. Trump has the <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-the-most-unpopular-president-since-ford-to-run-for-reelection\">lowest approval ratings</a> at this stage of the campaign of any incumbent running for re-election since the 1970s. </p> <p>Like so many other swing voters, Padot voted for Trump to shake up the system.

Monroe county has jobs but the steady well-paid work relied on by thousands of people for decades disappeared with factory closures. In 2008, the local Ford car plant shut, taking with it 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit. The knock-on effect of lost wages was felt by local stores and other businesses in downtown Monroe city, the county capital, dotted with ghost shops. A largely abandoned shopping mall sits on the edge of town.</p> <p>Monroe Democrats, still reeling from Trump\u2019s victory, are split on how to respond. Bill LaVoy, who held the local seat in the state legislature until he was swept out by the 2016 political whirlwind, backs the former vice-president Joe Biden as a safe candidate who can appeal to Democrats who defected to Trump.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018The Democrats think the only way they win is by </strong><strong>appealing to those Trump voters on Trump\u2019s terms</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On the other hand, a younger generation thinks the leadership is running scared when it focuses on trying to win back voters like Padot instead of offering a more radical alternative.</p> <p>\u201cThey lost to Trump and they\u2019re just so scared it\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d said Christopher Slat, a 31-year-old Democratic campaign activist. \u201cThey think the only way they can do it is by trying to appeal to those Trump voters on Trump\u2019s terms.

But a big question remains over how many will actually turn out to vote.</p> <p>Still, Slat is not writing off swing voters. He thinks some can be won back by focusing on what drove them to vote for Trump in the first place, and tying their disillusionment with the system to corporate corruption of politics. He said healthcare is a path into that because the high cost of insurance and treatment can be linked the medical industry\u2019s influence in blocking reforms that might reduce profits.</p> <p>\u201cYou tie it to the anti-corporate message because everybody understands the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics, especially people who vote for Trump.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s not that James Padot hugely admires Donald Trump or his values. After all, Padot spent more than four decades as a pipe fitter, a skilled trade that provided a good living but relied on the power of his labour union for work and to ensure he was decently paid. He worked on grand projects around the midwest including construction of the nuclear power plant in his hometown of Monroe, Michigan. So Padot is a fan of organised labour and feels a pull to vote Democrat. But after twice supporting Barack Obama in presidential elections, he cast his ballot for Trump in 2016. Nearly four years later, he has yet to be presented with a reason not to do so again. \u201cI\u2019d like to vote Democratic. But I watched the people they have and some of what they\u2019re talking about and some of it\u2019s just crazy,\u201d he said. So, as things stand, Padot will once more vote for Trump in a county that saw one of the largest swings in the country from the first African American president to a divisive leader denounced by his opponents as racist, corrupt and unfit for office. Obama twice took Monroe county, just south of Detroit. But in 2016 Trump trounced Hillary Clinton there, winning by more than 16,000 votes. Those votes alone delivered Michigan to Trump by the narrowest margin of victory \u2013 just 10,704 votes \u2013 in the history of presidential elections. The state, in turn, was an important part of the electoral college puzzle that put him in the White House. Trump\u2019s slim victory makes Michigan an important target for the Democrats this year along with other states that flipped to the Republican four years ago. This week, and at various stages in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is returning to three counties in Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa that swung from Obama to Trump to ask which way they will go in November. Opinion polls suggest that any of the leading Democratic candidates would beat Trump in Michigan although, 10 months before the election, they provide inspiration more than expectation to many Democrats fearful that the wrong candidate \u2013 too centrist or too liberal \u2013 could let Trump back in. \u2018He\u2019ll win again because the economy seems to be doing good\u2019 While Trump commands the unwavering loyalty of a hardcore of voters, his victory was secured by people like Padot whose support is much softer. But, so far at least, many of them are still willing to back the president even though they have plenty of doubts. Trump has the lowest approval ratings at this stage of the campaign of any incumbent running for re-election since the 1970s. Like so many other swing voters, Padot voted for Trump to shake up the system. As things stand, he thinks the president will win again in Monroe county and nationally. \u201cEverybody knew he\u2019s a huckster but they were so mad at the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll win again because the economy seems to be doing good.They might say there are these other things but once the curtain closes and they have to vote, then it\u2019s the economy. I just think that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d In places, the definition of the economy doing well is not an indication of prosperity but, rather, a lack of unemployment. Monroe county has jobs but the steady well-paid work relied on by thousands of people for decades disappeared with factory closures. In 2008, the local Ford car plant shut, taking with it 3,200 jobs just as the recession hit. The knock-on effect of lost wages was felt by local stores and other businesses in downtown Monroe city, the county capital, dotted with ghost shops. A largely abandoned shopping mall sits on the edge of town. Monroe Democrats, still reeling from Trump\u2019s victory, are split on how to respond. Bill LaVoy, who held the local seat in the state legislature until he was swept out by the 2016 political whirlwind, backs the former vice-president Joe Biden as a safe candidate who can appeal to Democrats who defected to Trump. \u2018The Democrats think the only way they win is by appealing to those Trump voters on Trump\u2019s terms\u2019 On the other hand, a younger generation thinks the leadership is running scared when it focuses on trying to win back voters like Padot instead of offering a more radical alternative. \u201cThey lost to Trump and they\u2019re just so scared it\u2019s going to happen again,\u201d said Christopher Slat, a 31-year-old Democratic campaign activist. \u201cThey think the only way they can do it is by trying to appeal to those Trump voters on Trump\u2019s terms. If the Democrats don\u2019t have a compelling policy answer to address people\u2019s actual problems, then they\u2019re just going to keep being resentful and keep voting for the most spiteful rightwing people.\u201d Slat, who recently declared a run for the state legislature seat lost by LaVoy, backs Bernie Sanders because he said the senator has policies the party can sell to mobilise new voters. \u201cI\u2019m not overly concerned with winning Trump voters back as much as I am activating people who don\u2019t always vote or activating the new populations of young people who are coming into the electorate,\u201d he said. Slat sees young first-time voters as having been dragged into becoming more politically engaged by issues such as the climate crisis and school shootings. Trump is more unpopular among young people than any other age group with polls showing that through most of his presidency twice as many 18- to 29-year-olds disapprove of his leadership as approve. In important swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, where Trump won with such slim margins, young first-time voters could decide the outcome in November and the Democrats are working hard to mobilise them in major cities. But a big question remains over how many will actually turn out to vote. Still, Slat is not writing off swing voters. He thinks some can be won back by focusing on what drove them to vote for Trump in the first place, and tying their disillusionment with the system to corporate corruption of politics. He said healthcare is a path into that because the high cost of insurance and treatment can be linked the medical industry\u2019s influence in blocking reforms that might reduce profits. \u201cYou tie it to the anti-corporate message because everybody understands the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics, especially people who vote for Trump. They understand that the system is corrupt and rigged,\u201d said Slat. \u2018Sanders seems sharp but he\u2019s too socialist \u2013 him and Warren\u2019 Padot is among those Trump voters who would like to see reform of the health system but he doesn\u2019t have any more confidence in the Democrats than the Republicans to do it. \u201cWhat\u2019s really stupid is that there are countries all around the world that have healthcare for everybody. One of those has to be the best. So just copy that. How hard is that? But no, this is America. We\u2019ve gotta reinvent the wheel and it\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d he said. But then Padot is not impressed by any of the Democratic candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of them are like Obama. That guy, he came out of nowhere. The guy could talk. He\u2019s very charismatic. I don\u2019t see that on any of these people,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe Biden, I think his time has gone. Bernie [Sanders] seems sharp but he\u2019s too socialist \u2013 him and Warren. Their ideas won\u2019t play well in Michigan or Nebraska or Iowa.\u201d Opinion polls show all the main Democratic contenders beating Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin but losing to him in Iowa. . Across the city, at the Oaks of Righteousness Christian Ministries homeless shelter in one of the poorest districts of Monroe, Rob Burgess is equally disparaging not only about the Democratic candidates but all politicians. The former soldier who went on to work for a cable company before deciding to reorder his life by working at a homeless shelter, doesn\u2019t vote because he doesn\u2019t trust any politicians and doesn\u2019t think it will make much difference to Monroe who is president. \u201cI never voted.

But, Pearson, who is the executive director of the Architecture Centre Devon and Cornwall, said: \u201cResidents have got the opposite.\u201d</p> <p>The original plans for Palmerston Heights included a gently sloping diagonal street, but permission was later sought for it to be replaced with steep steps. \u201cIt would be impossible for disabled people or people with prams to navigate,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople that were less mobile are virtually trapped in their homes.\u201d</p> <p>Persimmon, claimed Pearson, created the overlooking problems by giving over too much space to parking and opting for conventional two storey homes rather than the split-level homes mentioned in the design code. \u201cIt would have been a way of integrating the slope into the built form rather than just making platforms to stick conventional houses on,\u201d he said.The streets are laid out with parking spaces in front of most houses and no storage for wheelie bins. \u201cYou have got to navigate around a bin or car before you get to the doorbell. It looks shabby. It doesn\u2019t instil pride in a place, which is an essential ingredient in making a community,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Pearson argues that big developers are putting profit before good design. \u201cIt is immoral. It is the systemic whittling away of design quality in order to increase the profits going to shareholders and paid out in bonuses.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes said: \u201cPalmerston Heights has been developed according to plans that have been approved by the local authority following extensive consultation. This process is the same for every developer nationwide.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, the housebuilder completed 15,855 homes and made an annual profit of \u00a31.09bn \u2013 the biggest ever reported by a UK housebuilder.</p> <p>Local planning departments don\u2019t always have the resources to challenge the worst schemes and are under constant pressure to approve new homes. \u201cCouncils are really reliant on big schemes to boost housing numbers,\u201d said Carmona. \u201cThey try to tweak their plans but often they don\u2019t have the capacity to even get the basics right.\u201d</p> <p>Almost half of local planning authorities have no dedicated in-house design capacity at all according to UCL research by Urban Design Group charity in 2017. Carmona wants the government to make it clear that badly designed schemes should not be getting through the planning system, while reducing our dependence on private developers to deliver new homes. \u201cThe national planning policy framework states poor quality design should be refused. But substandard development is getting through because housing numbers trump other concerns,\u201d he said.</p>",

It feels really claustrophobic.\u201d Local architect Mark Pearson, who assessed the estate for the UCL report, which was backed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said it was one of the worst estates he had visited in the south-west. \u201cThe cumulative effect of all the design flaws and the isolation of the estate make it a miserable place to try to exist,\u201d he said. The design code for the development, which will eventually see 873 homes built across 32 hectares, specifies distinctive architecture and a high-quality, accessible environment. But, Pearson, who is the executive director of the Architecture Centre Devon and Cornwall, said: \u201cResidents have got the opposite.\u201d The original plans for Palmerston Heights included a gently sloping diagonal street, but permission was later sought for it to be replaced with steep steps. \u201cIt would be impossible for disabled people or people with prams to navigate,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople that were less mobile are virtually trapped in their homes.\u201d Persimmon, claimed Pearson, created the overlooking problems by giving over too much space to parking and opting for conventional two storey homes rather than the split-level homes mentioned in the design code. \u201cIt would have been a way of integrating the slope into the built form rather than just making platforms to stick conventional houses on,\u201d he said.The streets are laid out with parking spaces in front of most houses and no storage for wheelie bins. \u201cYou have got to navigate around a bin or car before you get to the doorbell. It looks shabby. It doesn\u2019t instil pride in a place, which is an essential ingredient in making a community,\u201d he said. Pearson argues that big developers are putting profit before good design. \u201cIt is immoral. It is the systemic whittling away of design quality in order to increase the profits going to shareholders and paid out in bonuses.\u201d A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes said: \u201cPalmerston Heights has been developed according to plans that have been approved by the local authority following extensive consultation. This process is the same for every developer nationwide.\u201d Last year, the housebuilder completed 15,855 homes and made an annual profit of \u00a31.09bn \u2013 the biggest ever reported by a UK housebuilder. Local planning departments don\u2019t always have the resources to challenge the worst schemes and are under constant pressure to approve new homes. \u201cCouncils are really reliant on big schemes to boost housing numbers,\u201d said Carmona. \u201cThey try to tweak their plans but often they don\u2019t have the capacity to even get the basics right.\u201d Almost half of local planning authorities have no dedicated in-house design capacity at all according to UCL research by Urban Design Group charity in 2017. Carmona wants the government to make it clear that badly designed schemes should not be getting through the planning system, while reducing our dependence on private developers to deliver new homes. \u201cThe national planning policy framework states poor quality design should be refused. But substandard development is getting through because housing numbers trump other concerns,\u201d he said.",

Once, it had a population of more than 800 but many were driven out, their homes set alight by brutal landowners who replaced them with more economically sound sheep.</p> <p>The process of reversing decline began with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/01/we-are-in-love-the-scottish-islanders-rebuilding-a-community\" title=\"\">community buy-out of the island in 2018</a> from its then owner.

There has to be a communion between humans, animals and nature.\u201d</p> <p>These creatures include hen harriers,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2016/jun/16/sea-eagle-reintroduced-to-isle-of-mull-scottish-natural-heritage-rspb-photo-essay\" title=\"\"> sea eagles </a>and golden eagles, and multitudes of insect species. Next week, a fold of 30 Highland cattle will begin to graze. It will be the first step in natural land management. Soon, work will start on refurbishing and repurposing existing cottages and redundant agricultural dwellings. Later, a few plots of land will be sold and families invited to build homes on them.</p> <p>Reid says: \u201cWe had more than 500 notes of interest, from 26 different countries.\u201d But, she adds, interest from further afield needs to be balanced against local need. \u201cOur vision is to attract people who can make something of this place and bring the skills and talents required to build the community, but also to be stewards of the land and protectors of other species. We\u2019ve had ecological surveys made to help us identify the habitats of these creatures and to ensure that future land management complements them. We want to co-exist, not conquer.\u201d</p> <p>If collectivism could ever happily cohabit with the free market then it might look like this, where families are invited to build homes and create businesses. They would make enough money to subsist and live comfortably but pay something back to the community that provided the opportunity. Ulva had 7,000 visitors last year and the repurposing of the former laird\u2019s \u201cBig House\u201d, the shooting lodge and the old church manse will bring more. The process will provide new work for old skills on neighbouring Mull and help to sustain the local economy.</p> <p>Recent surveys indicate that Scotland\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/07/are-scotland-islands-on-road-to-recovery\" title=\"\">island population is declining </a>at an alarming rate. Economic stress and feelings of social dislocation drive young people to the mainland, rarely to return. Of Scotland\u2019s 790 islands, only 94 have a resident population. Many on these islands and in the Scottish government are watching developments on Ulva with an eye to the future.

Right now, it\u2019s relatively easy to achieve consensus because there are so few of us. This may become less so as numbers increase.</p> <p>\u201cHuman nature has a habit of breenging in and wrecking good intentions. Well, so be it. This is real life and it will be up to the people who come here to sustain these ideals. You can\u2019t force a system on people; you can only provide an opportunity to build something better.\u201d</p> <p>The Boathouse restaurant is rapidly gaining a reputation for its fresh seafood. Rebecca Munro, resident and co-owner, said: \u201cI love living on Ulva. Our children have freedoms denied to most others. They play outside when the weather is dry, and in the summer they swim in the sea after school.

      "bodyText": "At Scotland\u2019s western edge, made jagged by ancient elements, a new model for living is taking shape. Ulva, a small island in the Inner Hebrides, off the west coast of Mull, is beginning to reverse decades of population decline. The island\u2019s current population is six but before another generation has passed it\u2019s expected to grow tenfold. Once, it had a population of more than 800 but many were driven out, their homes set alight by brutal landowners who replaced them with more economically sound sheep. The process of reversing decline began with a community buy-out of the island in 2018 from its then owner. At its heart was a strategy to bring about the \u201csocial and economic development\u201d of Ulva for the benefit of the larger community and for future generations. Wendy Reid, Ulva\u2019s development manager, says the long-term goal goes well beyond bringing people back to the island. \u201cWe need to do this in a way that\u2019s mindful of the other creatures that live in this place. There has to be a communion between humans, animals and nature.\u201d These creatures include hen harriers, sea eagles and golden eagles, and multitudes of insect species. Next week, a fold of 30 Highland cattle will begin to graze. It will be the first step in natural land management. Soon, work will start on refurbishing and repurposing existing cottages and redundant agricultural dwellings. Later, a few plots of land will be sold and families invited to build homes on them. Reid says: \u201cWe had more than 500 notes of interest, from 26 different countries.\u201d But, she adds, interest from further afield needs to be balanced against local need. \u201cOur vision is to attract people who can make something of this place and bring the skills and talents required to build the community, but also to be stewards of the land and protectors of other species. We\u2019ve had ecological surveys made to help us identify the habitats of these creatures and to ensure that future land management complements them. We want to co-exist, not conquer.\u201d If collectivism could ever happily cohabit with the free market then it might look like this, where families are invited to build homes and create businesses. They would make enough money to subsist and live comfortably but pay something back to the community that provided the opportunity. Ulva had 7,000 visitors last year and the repurposing of the former laird\u2019s \u201cBig House\u201d, the shooting lodge and the old church manse will bring more. The process will provide new work for old skills on neighbouring Mull and help to sustain the local economy. Recent surveys indicate that Scotland\u2019s island population is declining at an alarming rate. Economic stress and feelings of social dislocation drive young people to the mainland, rarely to return. Of Scotland\u2019s 790 islands, only 94 have a resident population. Many on these islands and in the Scottish government are watching developments on Ulva with an eye to the future. In time, they may provide some answers to shortages in affordable housing. No one will get rich on Ulva but no one will go without, either. \u201cWe want to attract people from all backgrounds,\u201d says Reid, but also keeping one goal in common: to contribute to the wellbeing of the community with their skills and talents. \u201cI know this all sounds utopian but Utopia doesn\u2019t exist. Right now, it\u2019s relatively easy to achieve consensus because there are so few of us. This may become less so as numbers increase. \u201cHuman nature has a habit of breenging in and wrecking good intentions. Well, so be it. This is real life and it will be up to the people who come here to sustain these ideals. You can\u2019t force a system on people; you can only provide an opportunity to build something better.\u201d The Boathouse restaurant is rapidly gaining a reputation for its fresh seafood. Rebecca Munro, resident and co-owner, said: \u201cI love living on Ulva. Our children have freedoms denied to most others. They play outside when the weather is dry, and in the summer they swim in the sea after school. Ulva primary school, just across the water on Mull, provides an excellent education and I am thankful that their world is not dominated by technology. They would rather be outside playing in an imaginary world or walking in the woods. Living here offers them a connection [to] and awareness of the environment around them. Once there are more children, it really will be the perfect place to bring up a family.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cBella, I know it\u2019s not the point, but where is your jumper from?\u201d This was a reply to a post I put up on Instagram about the horrors of antidepressant withdrawal. I respond with the details, mildly flattered, but slightly despairing. After decades of not talking about my mental health issues, I started an Instagram account (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mackie_bella/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@mackie_bella</a>) hoping to talk more honestly about them, but maybe when everyone has their own struggles they don\u2019t want to be burdened with yours. Why would you want to watch someone else moan on the morning commute when you could gaze at a lovely fluffy jumper to cheer yourself up? I would choose the jumper myself most days.</p> <p>I have become somewhat well followed on Instagram at a time when the platform is being hugely criticised. Social media influencers are widely scorned for showing off unattainable lifestyles, promoting irresponsible products, such as slimming teas, and being disingenuous about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s staged for effect. Websites have sprung up where those who are fed up with the polished images can call them out, sometimes brutally.</p> <p>Like everyone else who uses social media, I have a complicated relationship with it. It\u2019s become common to complain about our online spaces, we all try to articulate the myriad ways in which we find it draining, toxic and unnatural. We scroll and swipe and get angry with ourselves for wasting time staring down at our phones when we could be doing something worthwhile. But, equally, social media is now one of the main ways people communicate with each other in the modern world. To ignore it is to miss out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b8138d03578afcccaac56df49178a2ff17fbf44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b8138d03578afcccaac56df49178a2ff17fbf44/0_0_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four-legged friends: \u2018At first my husband Greg (who is very funny online) directed people to my sparse new account.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four-legged friends: \u2018At first my husband Greg (who is very funny online) directed people to my sparse new account.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @bellamackie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most will vaguely recognise the term \u201cinfluencer\u201d, which, roughly, describes a person who uses social media to promote a lifestyle or aesthetic. In other words, someone who tells others what stuff they should buy. Like a lot of people, I\u2019ve felt uneasy about this growing phenomenon. Impossibly pretty (and usually white) women giving you a tiny glimpse of their carefully curated lives while simultaneously offering you 15% off the boots they\u2019re wearing. It\u2019s an exercise in aspiration \u2013 buy these boots and be happy like me.</p> <p>Despite my unease, I have acquired 130,000 followers on Instagram, so now I\u2019m trying to walk a line between flogging teeth-whitening kits and using the platform solely to preach about mental health. Can you be an influencer and not become a bit of a monster? The line between the two seems fairly direct.</p> <p>I really love Instagram. I loved it from the moment I signed up \u2013 a place to show off photos that meant something to me. A gallery of my life, but with strictly controlled privacy settings. After a rough experience with a stalker, I didn\u2019t understand those who felt comfortable showing off their lives to strangers.</p> <p>All of that changed when my first book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/02/women-jogging-how-dare-they-tell-us-not-to-run-alone\" title=\"\">Jog On</a></em>, a memoir about mental illness, was about to be published. It was suggested that I create an account to share book news, so I duly did, thinking it would be a temporary space to throw promo into the world before retreating back to my private account.</p> <p>Except, and I should have known this, you have no idea what will happen on social media. My husband <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/30/greg-james-interview-i-do-a-lot-of-my-life-admin-on-the-toilet\" title=\"\">Greg James</a> (a presenter on Radio 1) directed people to my sparse new account. Suddenly I had a few thousand followers \u2013 and the book wasn\u2019t even out for another fortnight. Those numbers have continued to rise over the past year and I\u2019ve come to realise how Instagram could become a full time occupation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21fbd5f17ceff8ba34439d059bc255c16708b09f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21fbd5f17ceff8ba34439d059bc255c16708b09f/0_0_1080_648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mirror, mirror: \u2018I constantly wonder how authentic I\u2019m being.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mirror, mirror: \u2018I constantly wonder how authentic I\u2019m being.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @bellamackie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People make millions from influencing. It\u2019s a job now; you can\u2019t hold back that tide. But while there are a million posts to roll your eyes at, I\u2019ve learned that there are wonderful communities, too. So many people use social media to promote specific causes or to grow their interests. Politicians bypass traditional media and go to Instagram to speak directly to their supporters \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\" title=\"\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example,</a> has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ocasio2018/?hl=en\" title=\"\">4m followers</a>.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t using social media to run for office. Neither was I part of Gen Z, who\u2019ve grown up online, and are savvy about the worth of their \u201cpersonal brand\u201d. I fell into this by accident, which might well be the best way to do it. Along the way, here\u2019s a few things I\u2019ve learned.</p> <h2>It will envelop you unless you\u2019re careful</h2> <p>Spend too much time on social media and you enter a weird realm where you\u2019re speaking to strangers more than your actual friends. Within a week of the book coming out, thousands of people had got in touch to talk to me about their own experiences. They wanted to tell me their own stories of panic, sexual assault, grief and pain. I responded to every one, trying to show sympathy and support. I felt an enormous weight of responsibility when a new message pinged up on my screen. How could I ignore a person sharing their biggest problems? And this made my own mental health plummet. Instead of celebrating the book\u2019s release, I spent most of my time crying, trying to push back against an onslaught of intrusive thoughts and a looming sense of doom.</p> <p>But it\u2019s no use having a public Instagram account and choosing not to engage with the people who follow you. The internet has demolished any lingering notion that you can create something, release it into the world and walk away. The trick is knowing where to draw the line, so that you can maintain your own equilibrium.</p> <p>Boundaries on social media don\u2019t exist. I will talk to as many people as possible about mental health (it\u2019s usually hundreds a week). But I can\u2019t answer people who need relationship advice, and won\u2019t answer those who ask me whether I\u2019m going to have children. I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you where to find the perfect profiterole when Google exists. It might all be coming from a good place, but the internet makes people feel entitled to ask the most personal of questions, and it can get overwhelming.</p> <h2>It always comes back to numbers</h2> <p>Instagram has always been ruled by the number of likes a photo amasses. I\u2019ve learned that I cannot control what people want to look at. My plan was to post mental health information only. But I once posted a photo of myself clad in bright colours, explaining that, when in a hole, I try to dress in a hopeful way. It was an attempt at conveying that I was feeling very anxious and was worried about appearing vain or vapid. And indeed one person told me off for using my account in the \u201cwrong\u201d way and promptly unfollowed me. But otherwise, the reaction was fairly positive.</p> <p>I described my approach to dressing as \u201calways be jazzy\u201d, and added the abbreviation ABJ. Things take on a life of their own on social media. I now get sent photos from women who have bought leopard print shoes or sequinned headbands, asking me if they\u2019re ABJ enough. It\u2019s ludicrous. But the idea that I might have made a few people feel more confident is a lovely thing. Even if it means that posts about my clothes will always trump anything I put up about politics.

      "bodyText": "\u201cBella, I know it\u2019s not the point, but where is your jumper from?\u201d This was a reply to a post I put up on Instagram about the horrors of antidepressant withdrawal. I respond with the details, mildly flattered, but slightly despairing. After decades of not talking about my mental health issues, I started an Instagram account (@mackie_bella) hoping to talk more honestly about them, but maybe when everyone has their own struggles they don\u2019t want to be burdened with yours. Why would you want to watch someone else moan on the morning commute when you could gaze at a lovely fluffy jumper to cheer yourself up? I would choose the jumper myself most days. I have become somewhat well followed on Instagram at a time when the platform is being hugely criticised. Social media influencers are widely scorned for showing off unattainable lifestyles, promoting irresponsible products, such as slimming teas, and being disingenuous about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s staged for effect. Websites have sprung up where those who are fed up with the polished images can call them out, sometimes brutally. Like everyone else who uses social media, I have a complicated relationship with it. It\u2019s become common to complain about our online spaces, we all try to articulate the myriad ways in which we find it draining, toxic and unnatural. We scroll and swipe and get angry with ourselves for wasting time staring down at our phones when we could be doing something worthwhile. But, equally, social media is now one of the main ways people communicate with each other in the modern world. To ignore it is to miss out. Most will vaguely recognise the term \u201cinfluencer\u201d, which, roughly, describes a person who uses social media to promote a lifestyle or aesthetic. In other words, someone who tells others what stuff they should buy. Like a lot of people, I\u2019ve felt uneasy about this growing phenomenon. Impossibly pretty (and usually white) women giving you a tiny glimpse of their carefully curated lives while simultaneously offering you 15% off the boots they\u2019re wearing. It\u2019s an exercise in aspiration \u2013 buy these boots and be happy like me. Despite my unease, I have acquired 130,000 followers on Instagram, so now I\u2019m trying to walk a line between flogging teeth-whitening kits and using the platform solely to preach about mental health. Can you be an influencer and not become a bit of a monster? The line between the two seems fairly direct. I really love Instagram. I loved it from the moment I signed up \u2013 a place to show off photos that meant something to me. A gallery of my life, but with strictly controlled privacy settings. After a rough experience with a stalker, I didn\u2019t understand those who felt comfortable showing off their lives to strangers. All of that changed when my first book, Jog On, a memoir about mental illness, was about to be published. It was suggested that I create an account to share book news, so I duly did, thinking it would be a temporary space to throw promo into the world before retreating back to my private account. Except, and I should have known this, you have no idea what will happen on social media. My husband Greg James (a presenter on Radio 1) directed people to my sparse new account. Suddenly I had a few thousand followers \u2013 and the book wasn\u2019t even out for another fortnight. Those numbers have continued to rise over the past year and I\u2019ve come to realise how Instagram could become a full time occupation. People make millions from influencing. It\u2019s a job now; you can\u2019t hold back that tide. But while there are a million posts to roll your eyes at, I\u2019ve learned that there are wonderful communities, too. So many people use social media to promote specific causes or to grow their interests. Politicians bypass traditional media and go to Instagram to speak directly to their supporters \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, has 4m followers. I wasn\u2019t using social media to run for office. Neither was I part of Gen Z, who\u2019ve grown up online, and are savvy about the worth of their \u201cpersonal brand\u201d. I fell into this by accident, which might well be the best way to do it. Along the way, here\u2019s a few things I\u2019ve learned. It will envelop you unless you\u2019re careful Spend too much time on social media and you enter a weird realm where you\u2019re speaking to strangers more than your actual friends. Within a week of the book coming out, thousands of people had got in touch to talk to me about their own experiences. They wanted to tell me their own stories of panic, sexual assault, grief and pain. I responded to every one, trying to show sympathy and support. I felt an enormous weight of responsibility when a new message pinged up on my screen. How could I ignore a person sharing their biggest problems? And this made my own mental health plummet. Instead of celebrating the book\u2019s release, I spent most of my time crying, trying to push back against an onslaught of intrusive thoughts and a looming sense of doom. But it\u2019s no use having a public Instagram account and choosing not to engage with the people who follow you. The internet has demolished any lingering notion that you can create something, release it into the world and walk away. The trick is knowing where to draw the line, so that you can maintain your own equilibrium. Boundaries on social media don\u2019t exist. I will talk to as many people as possible about mental health (it\u2019s usually hundreds a week). But I can\u2019t answer people who need relationship advice, and won\u2019t answer those who ask me whether I\u2019m going to have children. I shouldn\u2019t have to tell you where to find the perfect profiterole when Google exists. It might all be coming from a good place, but the internet makes people feel entitled to ask the most personal of questions, and it can get overwhelming. It always comes back to numbers Instagram has always been ruled by the number of likes a photo amasses. I\u2019ve learned that I cannot control what people want to look at. My plan was to post mental health information only. But I once posted a photo of myself clad in bright colours, explaining that, when in a hole, I try to dress in a hopeful way. It was an attempt at conveying that I was feeling very anxious and was worried about appearing vain or vapid. And indeed one person told me off for using my account in the \u201cwrong\u201d way and promptly unfollowed me. But otherwise, the reaction was fairly positive. I described my approach to dressing as \u201calways be jazzy\u201d, and added the abbreviation ABJ. Things take on a life of their own on social media. I now get sent photos from women who have bought leopard print shoes or sequinned headbands, asking me if they\u2019re ABJ enough. It\u2019s ludicrous. But the idea that I might have made a few people feel more confident is a lovely thing. Even if it means that posts about my clothes will always trump anything I put up about politics. Like I said, sometimes you just want to see a fluffy jumper. You can build a community around anything When I started my account I made the decision not to follow anyone who might make me feel bad about myself. So I followed runners, farmers, mental health experts and book obsessives. I muted all suggestions on the homepage for accounts that showed off impossibly perfect people or lifestyles. And in that spirit, I think hard about whether I\u2019m being too glossy myself.

The best they might have managed is that it lay up north in that mysterious and unknown area of the country that they had mentally marked: \u201cHere Be Dragons\u201d. Now a Conservative MP sits for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/theyre-getting-their-just-desserts-how-traditional-voters-ditched-labour\" title=\"\">Northumbrian constituency,</a> which has never previously been represented by the Tories. Ian Levy\u2019s victory was perhaps the most sensational, and certainly among the most symbolic, of the dramatic gains that the Conservatives made at the expense of Labour.</p> <p>The December election sent <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/16/boris-johnson-poses-hundreds-newly-elected-tory-mps-11917408/\" title=\"\">more than 100</a> new Tory MPs to parliament. It is a striking fact that they of Conservative MPs account for half of the backbenchers sitting behind Boris Johnson. His new friends from the north speak in different accents to their more southerly colleagues. They often think differently as well. And they represent areas of the country with needs and concerns that have been alien to the Tory party over many decades. <a href=\"https://www.harboroughmail.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-neil-obrien-re-elected-harborough-1340200\" title=\"\">Neil O\u2019Brien</a>, the Conservative MP for Harborough, points out that Tories represented just 14 seats in the most deprived half of England in 2001.

This could give them a lot of clout if they get organised. There are signs that they are. More than 120 Tory MPs have signed up to the Blue Collar Conservatism caucus that will have its first meeting tomorrow evening.</p> <p>Mr Johnson says that he understands these seats are only \u201con loan\u201d to the Tories. Also correctly, he has observed that the Conservative party will have to change if it is to convince those who voted for it for the first time that they made the right decision. To use the sort of metaphor he will readily understand, his relationship with these new Tory voters is not necessarily for the long term. Many of them jumped into bed with him on 12 December because they wanted Brexit and loathed Jeremy Corbyn, not from any great love of either the Tory leader or his party. Mr Corbyn will definitely not be a factor at the next election; Brexit may or may not be a factor depending on what it does to the economy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/18/boris-johnson-warns-cabinet-shape-up-or-be-sacked\">Our Opinium poll today </a>finds the public evenly split on whether the Conservatives will deliver for voters in the seats that they took from Labour.</p> <p>Talking to allies of the prime minister, I find that they privately acknowledge that one of their stiffest challenges is delivering palpable progress in the \u201cleft behind\u201d areas of the country that they now represent. I also often hear a ready acceptance that they are far from being at the point where they can say confidently that they have worked out how to do it. The suggestion that Conservative campaign headquarters <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2020/01/exclusive-no-10-says-that-cchq-will-move-out-of-matthew-parker-street-and-into-the-midlands-or-north-it-wants-your-ideas-about-a-venue.html\" title=\"\">might be relocated</a> somewhere north is a wheeze designed more to serve the interests of the Tory party than anyone else. The occasional cabinet meeting convened outside London (not a new stunt; David Cameron did that as well) isn\u2019t going to solve deep-rooted, multigenerational problems. Talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d the north, the rhetorical trope that has become highly fashionable among ministers since the election, is no more than blather until we see the colour of the money. It is not a bad idea to recast the Treasury\u2019s rules to help regional projects to secure more approvals, but it will only be a winning formula if productive ideas result. Beaten-up high streets will not be reinvigorated easily or overnight. Higher skills and better employment opportunities cannot be magicked up with a wave of Whitehall\u2019s wand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d3680e3a71779c4fae455b441518400dd5c19be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3680e3a71779c4fae455b441518400dd5c19be/106_0_3394_2036/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid in Manchester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid in Manchester: his budget in March will feature many plans to improve the physical fabric in the regions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been much conjecture that we are going to see a fresh kind of Toryism, a version less laissez-faire and more activist. Last summer, Tory ministers behaved exactly as we would expect Tory ministers to act when they allowed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/22/thomas-cook-in-last-ditch-talks-to-avoid-collapse\" title=\"\">Thomas Cook to go bust</a> on the grounds that it is not the role of government to salvage failing holiday companies. In an inversion of that doctrine, ministers have just intervened to prop up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/flybe-saved-after-successful-last-ditch-talks\" title=\"\">ailing airline Flybe</a>, much to the consternation of its competitors, which are crying foul and threatening legal action.

      "bodyText": "Until election night, I very much doubt that the typical Tory member in the home counties, or the average Conservative MP from the southern shires, could have found Blyth Valley on a map. The best they might have managed is that it lay up north in that mysterious and unknown area of the country that they had mentally marked: \u201cHere Be Dragons\u201d. Now a Conservative MP sits for the Northumbrian constituency, which has never previously been represented by the Tories. Ian Levy\u2019s victory was perhaps the most sensational, and certainly among the most symbolic, of the dramatic gains that the Conservatives made at the expense of Labour. The December election sent more than 100 new Tory MPs to parliament. It is a striking fact that they of Conservative MPs account for half of the backbenchers sitting behind Boris Johnson. His new friends from the north speak in different accents to their more southerly colleagues. They often think differently as well. And they represent areas of the country with needs and concerns that have been alien to the Tory party over many decades. Neil O\u2019Brien, the Conservative MP for Harborough, points out that Tories represented just 14 seats in the most deprived half of England in 2001. Now Conservative MPs sit for 116 of them. This could give them a lot of clout if they get organised. There are signs that they are. More than 120 Tory MPs have signed up to the Blue Collar Conservatism caucus that will have its first meeting tomorrow evening. Mr Johnson says that he understands these seats are only \u201con loan\u201d to the Tories. Also correctly, he has observed that the Conservative party will have to change if it is to convince those who voted for it for the first time that they made the right decision. To use the sort of metaphor he will readily understand, his relationship with these new Tory voters is not necessarily for the long term. Many of them jumped into bed with him on 12 December because they wanted Brexit and loathed Jeremy Corbyn, not from any great love of either the Tory leader or his party. Mr Corbyn will definitely not be a factor at the next election; Brexit may or may not be a factor depending on what it does to the economy. Our Opinium poll today finds the public evenly split on whether the Conservatives will deliver for voters in the seats that they took from Labour. Talking to allies of the prime minister, I find that they privately acknowledge that one of their stiffest challenges is delivering palpable progress in the \u201cleft behind\u201d areas of the country that they now represent. I also often hear a ready acceptance that they are far from being at the point where they can say confidently that they have worked out how to do it. The suggestion that Conservative campaign headquarters might be relocated somewhere north is a wheeze designed more to serve the interests of the Tory party than anyone else. The occasional cabinet meeting convened outside London (not a new stunt; David Cameron did that as well) isn\u2019t going to solve deep-rooted, multigenerational problems. Talk of \u201clevelling up\u201d the north, the rhetorical trope that has become highly fashionable among ministers since the election, is no more than blather until we see the colour of the money. It is not a bad idea to recast the Treasury\u2019s rules to help regional projects to secure more approvals, but it will only be a winning formula if productive ideas result. Beaten-up high streets will not be reinvigorated easily or overnight. Higher skills and better employment opportunities cannot be magicked up with a wave of Whitehall\u2019s wand. There has been much conjecture that we are going to see a fresh kind of Toryism, a version less laissez-faire and more activist. Last summer, Tory ministers behaved exactly as we would expect Tory ministers to act when they allowed Thomas Cook to go bust on the grounds that it is not the role of government to salvage failing holiday companies. In an inversion of that doctrine, ministers have just intervened to prop up the ailing airline Flybe, much to the consternation of its competitors, which are crying foul and threatening legal action. The reason ministers did so is because Flybe operates a selection of often unprofitable routes that connect regional airports. Is this an early hint that the Johnson government will be a lot more interventionist? It is much too premature to be sure of that. This may just be a sign that he did not want to aggravate some of his new Tory voters and his new MPs so soon after they put him back in Number 10. What is instructive is the grumbling response of Thatcherite Tories, complaining on the evidence of this one intervention that Conservative economic policy is already turning too pink for their liking. There is a substantial wing of the Tory party, a faction that has heavy representation around the cabinet table, which remains viscerally hostile to an active state. A manifestation of that is the ongoing battle within government over the high-speed rail link. There is fierce lobbying to scrap or downgrade the project, even though billions have been spent and construction is under way. Andy Street, the Tory mayor of the West Midlands, and other regional civic leaders will respond to cancellation with fury.

Her work comes as a complete surprise, and not only because she has never been shown in this country before. Everything Asawa made was so original, and fashioned mainly out of wire \u2013 an art of pure visual joy.</p> <p>Born in rural California, Asawa\u2019s first exposure to art teaching came when her family and other Japanese-Americans were detained in internment camps during the second world war. After hostilities ended, she studied art at the famously experimental and non-hierarchical Black Mountain College in North Carolina. She began with ink drawing, both figurative and abstract. But in 1947, a Mexican craftsman taught Asawa how to weave baskets out of wire, and this knowledge inspired her own unique structures.</p> <p>The sculptures are exquisite, aerial, suspended from the ceiling. Enter the <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/line-can-go-anywhere\" title=\"\">David Zwirner gallery</a>, and before you hover all sorts of new forms. Some have a kinship with lanterns, spherical domes, or intricately latticed windows. Others have more affinity with flight, fanning into wings, airborne seeds or shivering tendrils. They are so diaphanous that a passing breeze can set them revolving in motion.</p> <p>A winter tree hangs in space, its branches like splintering black lines. The analogy with drawing is evident, and poetic, but this wire form just keeps on proliferating. Asawa ties wire to wire to wire, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/woodlouse/4671373948/\" title=\"\">twisting them into 360 degrees</a>, so that her sculpture becomes a thicket of smaller trees, growing both over and under the ground, as it seems. A tree and a world of trees: a planet of forests.</p> <p>The corners of a Japanese helmet lift to the skies. A pinecone grows into a spiky leaf, which in turn becomes a miniature fir. One basket seems to nestle inside another \u2013 oval inside sphere, like an egg newly laid in a nest, yet all of it is radiantly transparent. The wire is knotted, twisted, or turned like crochet; it loops like knitting; or it meshes like the warp and weft of loose weaving. Every sculpture openly shows its own workings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f06baf6ae3ecfb735342dc35537dc96df41d519\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f06baf6ae3ecfb735342dc35537dc96df41d519/0_0_2362_3000/787.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Asawa at work.\" width=\"787\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruth Asawa at work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Estate of Ruth Asawa;  Courtesy David Zwirner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marvellous photographs by her friend and contemporary, the great Imogen Cunningham, show Asawa at work in the studio with bales of wire, and quite often some of her six children (as if to imply this might be child\u2019s play, which it emphatically is not). For her technical dexterity remains almost beyond belief, especially in the larger works. An ethereal concatenation of interconnected spheres, containing smaller orbs, descends from the ceiling to the floor. <a href=\"http://www.ruthasawa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hm-slide-01.jpg\" title=\"\">Mesh through mesh</a>, reprised, creates an effect of twinkling light. And you peer in, as if to discover a butterfly unfolding within its chrysalis.</p> <p>A sphere may gather associations of all sorts into its shining shape \u2013 a hot air balloon, a Christmas decoration and a deep-sea urchin, all jauntily combined. One work, flat to the wall but in three dimensions, resembles a whole hawthorn hedge twisted into<a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/277\" title=\"\"> a snowflake-cum-star</a>. Asawa\u2019s tied-wire sculptures have a special extra frisson, each of the knot formations bristling like a burr.</p> <p>Her sculptures, the artist wrote, sometimes came from simply being in her own garden observing \u201cthe spiral shell of a snail, seeing light through insect wings, watching spiders repair their webs in the early morning\u201d.</p> <p>But they also emerge from the drawings \u2013 and vice versa. It would be hard to think of another sculptor, except perhaps Giacometti or Alexander Calder, whose works had so much interconnection with their graphic work.</p> <p>Asawa\u2019s drawings are stunning, the precise clarity of the line mimicking the tensile wires from which her sculptures are worked. She takes your eye deep into the centripetal <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;id=9C4C48F4D69191376EF013511265E7BBC6DF811D&amp;thid=OIP.b5AtXNVAtpGH60LJjMbZAgAAAA&amp;mediaurl=http%3A%2F%2F78.media.tumblr.com%2F9341cf28163902a50737c2840f47516f%2Ftumblr_nlq45eUGKl1s0got1o1_500.png&amp;exph=720&amp;expw=455&amp;q=RUTH+ASAWA+CHRYSANTHEMUM&amp;selectedindex=1&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;vt=0&amp;eim=0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10\" title=\"\">complexity of a chrysanthemum</a>, turning this humdrum plant into a maze of delicate forms. The mysterious structure of an iris is investigated in a black ink drawing that celebrates each of its origami folds. Irises are so often described in paint, mainly in terms of blurred colour, but who needs colour when a monochrome drawing can convey such light and hue. As with sculpture, Asawa made drawing her own.</p> <p>She relishes the fine prickles on a stem, like a modern D\u00fcrer. But her drawings also have the poise and virtuosity of the sculptures. In one image, dots of pollen that seem to have escaped from the centre of a flower gather, like pinprick starlings, into the buzz of an insect \u2013 the bee that will help produce the next blossom. There is such wit in her art.</p> <p>Another undervalued artist \u2013 the Indian modernist <strong><a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/news/benode-behari-mukherjee-after-sight\" title=\"\">Benode Behari Mukherjee</a> </strong>(1904-80) \u2013 is presented alongside Asawa at David Zwirner. His collages are lithe and curious, quizzical cats and human figures in a jubilant pageant of colour and Matissean form, which maintain an extraordinary sense of balance. Mukherjee was blind by the time most of these were made: his celebratory intellect is apparent in the extraordinary touch of his fingertips.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b182a095ff69b61deeaf4b233680e46b29a5a5ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b182a095ff69b61deeaf4b233680e46b29a5a5ed/0_0_2787_2250/1000.png\" alt=\"Reclining Man, 1957 by Benode Behari Mukherjee.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"807\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reclining Man, 1957 by Benode Behari Mukherjee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Zwirner and Vadehra Art Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is good to see this radical art retrieved from the past, brought to light in a new era. In the case of Asawa, who dedicated much of her life to educating others, and whose modesty is so beautifully apparent in the subtle grace of her works, it seems entirely possible that her method ran against her. For so long, anything associated with domestic craftsmanship, from stitching to weaving to basketry, led to marginalisation. But as with the weaver Anni Albers, Asawa is finally getting her due. The public arts high school she opened in San Francisco in 1982 has finally been named after her. Another exhibition of her work opens at <a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/event/citizen-of-the-universe/\" title=\"\">Modern Art Oxford in May</a>, travelling to Norway later this year.

Some have a kinship with lanterns, spherical domes, or intricately latticed windows. Others have more affinity with flight, fanning into wings, airborne seeds or shivering tendrils. They are so diaphanous that a passing breeze can set them revolving in motion. A winter tree hangs in space, its branches like splintering black lines. The analogy with drawing is evident, and poetic, but this wire form just keeps on proliferating. Asawa ties wire to wire to wire, twisting them into 360 degrees, so that her sculpture becomes a thicket of smaller trees, growing both over and under the ground, as it seems. A tree and a world of trees: a planet of forests. The corners of a Japanese helmet lift to the skies. A pinecone grows into a spiky leaf, which in turn becomes a miniature fir. One basket seems to nestle inside another \u2013 oval inside sphere, like an egg newly laid in a nest, yet all of it is radiantly transparent. The wire is knotted, twisted, or turned like crochet; it loops like knitting; or it meshes like the warp and weft of loose weaving. Every sculpture openly shows its own workings. Marvellous photographs by her friend and contemporary, the great Imogen Cunningham, show Asawa at work in the studio with bales of wire, and quite often some of her six children (as if to imply this might be child\u2019s play, which it emphatically is not). For her technical dexterity remains almost beyond belief, especially in the larger works. An ethereal concatenation of interconnected spheres, containing smaller orbs, descends from the ceiling to the floor. Mesh through mesh, reprised, creates an effect of twinkling light. And you peer in, as if to discover a butterfly unfolding within its chrysalis. A sphere may gather associations of all sorts into its shining shape \u2013 a hot air balloon, a Christmas decoration and a deep-sea urchin, all jauntily combined. One work, flat to the wall but in three dimensions, resembles a whole hawthorn hedge twisted into a snowflake-cum-star. Asawa\u2019s tied-wire sculptures have a special extra frisson, each of the knot formations bristling like a burr. Her sculptures, the artist wrote, sometimes came from simply being in her own garden observing \u201cthe spiral shell of a snail, seeing light through insect wings, watching spiders repair their webs in the early morning\u201d. But they also emerge from the drawings \u2013 and vice versa. It would be hard to think of another sculptor, except perhaps Giacometti or Alexander Calder, whose works had so much interconnection with their graphic work. Asawa\u2019s drawings are stunning, the precise clarity of the line mimicking the tensile wires from which her sculptures are worked. She takes your eye deep into the centripetal complexity of a chrysanthemum, turning this humdrum plant into a maze of delicate forms. The mysterious structure of an iris is investigated in a black ink drawing that celebrates each of its origami folds. Irises are so often described in paint, mainly in terms of blurred colour, but who needs colour when a monochrome drawing can convey such light and hue. As with sculpture, Asawa made drawing her own. She relishes the fine prickles on a stem, like a modern D\u00fcrer. But her drawings also have the poise and virtuosity of the sculptures. In one image, dots of pollen that seem to have escaped from the centre of a flower gather, like pinprick starlings, into the buzz of an insect \u2013 the bee that will help produce the next blossom. There is such wit in her art. Another undervalued artist \u2013 the Indian modernist Benode Behari Mukherjee (1904-80) \u2013 is presented alongside Asawa at David Zwirner. His collages are lithe and curious, quizzical cats and human figures in a jubilant pageant of colour and Matissean form, which maintain an extraordinary sense of balance. Mukherjee was blind by the time most of these were made: his celebratory intellect is apparent in the extraordinary touch of his fingertips. It is good to see this radical art retrieved from the past, brought to light in a new era. In the case of Asawa, who dedicated much of her life to educating others, and whose modesty is so beautifully apparent in the subtle grace of her works, it seems entirely possible that her method ran against her. For so long, anything associated with domestic craftsmanship, from stitching to weaving to basketry, led to marginalisation. But as with the weaver Anni Albers, Asawa is finally getting her due. The public arts high school she opened in San Francisco in 1982 has finally been named after her. Another exhibition of her work opens at Modern Art Oxford in May, travelling to Norway later this year. But for now, this superb show takes flight in the mind \u2013 once seen, never forgotten. Star ratings (out of five) Ruth Asawa: A Line Can Go Anywhere \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Benode Behari Mukherjee: After Sight \u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2022 Ruth Asawa and Benode Behari Mukherjee are both at David Zwirner, London, until 22 February",

Maybe Flybe will be in a position to pitch, maybe it won\u2019t be; but the chances of somebody fulfilling the role will clearly be greater if the company survives.</p> <p>It is also reasonable for the government to fiddle with APD, which is badly designed as a per-passenger charge. A better approach would be to tax emissions. The timing of Javid\u2019s review is not coincidental \u2013 no quibble on that score.

The north\u2019s transport links are far inferior to the south\u2019s. The government is supposedly levelling up the regions, listening to its freshly minted northern supporters, and redirecting cash to worthier causes, such as a high-speed trans-Pennine link from Manchester to Leeds.</p> <p>Some close to the prime minister reportedly believe the network is a white elephant; but to lop off its lower leg would create an even more curious beast.</p> <p>Phase one from London to Birmingham is already passed in law, painstakingly designed, with the groundwork prepared at critical junctures of the route. It has taken a decade to get even this far \u2013 a genuine alternative will not be conjured more quickly. Memories are short, but the proffered fast trans-Pennine links were in development before Boris Johnson; he would not be giving, merely taking away.</p> <p>Leaders and planners in the north know that HS2 underpins schemes to link up northern cities, and that connectivity to London is vital \u2013 and will be vastly improved to all regions north even when only the first phase to Birmingham is built.

Sitting beside me, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshtetrick\" title=\"\">the company\u2019s CEO Josh Tetrick</a> tries to put my moral dilemma into perspective. \u201cYou\u2019re not my target market,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s people who are eating meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\u201d</p> <p>The product in the fryer is a JUST prototype chicken nugget, which costs about $50 to make. It is manufactured from what the industry calls cultured, cell-based or cultivated meat (though the outside world knows it more commonly as lab-grown meat). Not to be confused with \u201cmeat\u201d that is plant derived, it is produced directly from animal cells with little need to raise and no need to slaughter actual animals. It is a technology with the potential to fundamentally change the world \u2013 significantly replacing the way meat is produced now with a kinder and less environmentally damaging alternative.</p> <p>Cultured meat is a \u201ccolossal\u201d market opportunity says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BruceGFriedrich\" title=\"\">Bruce Friedrich</a>, co-founder and executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.gfi.org/\" title=\"\">Good Food Institute</a> (GFI), a nonprofit organisation that promotes cultured meat and plant-based meat. Even a tiny bite of the $1.4tn annual global meat market would be a lot.</p> <p>No cultured meat products are on the market yet and nor has it been approved in any country \u2013 but they are expected to begin trickling into high-end restaurants over the next couple of years. A plethora of companies are at various stages of scaling up production and several have done public and private tasting of various prototypes. They are working on everything from chicken to beef to fish and have both humans and pets in their sights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b50fb1d23c738c1be62f3185a12c707f720d517\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b50fb1d23c738c1be62f3185a12c707f720d517/178_0_5275_3167/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a plate of just, inc\u2019s cultured chicken nuggets\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plate of JUST, Inc\u2019s cultured chicken nuggets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of JU.ST</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The GFI estimates that since San Francisco Bay Area-based <a href=\"https://www.memphismeats.com/\" title=\"\">Memphis Meats</a> \u2013 the first startup \u2013 was founded in 2015, a total of 60 enterprises now make up the market with cultured meat as their sole business focus; collectively they have raised nearly $140m in disclosed funding. That comes mostly from venture capitalists but also from agriculture multinationals such as Tyson and Cargill.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Should cultured meat be allowed to be called meat at all\u00a0if it hasn\u2019t been harvested from a whole animal?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>JUST, which isn\u2019t included in the GFI\u2019s figures because it also makes vegan egg and mayonnaise, announced it was pursuing cultured meat in mid-2017, though it does not disclose what proportion of the $220m-plus it has raised in funding it is directing to its cultured meat endeavours. Meanwhile regulators are working on the approvals process and labelling requirements. Tetrick says JUST is ready to release its chicken nuggets in some high-end restaurants in an Asian country as soon as it has the thumbs up from the country\u2019s regulator, with whom it is in dialogue. Chicken is considered easier in part because the vaccine industry has been using avian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/stem-cells\" title=\"\">stem cells</a> to produce vaccines for years: there is existing knowledge to draw on.</p> <p>Establishing this industry isn\u2019t easy, however. While companies work out technicalities, voices raising concerns about the technology and its implications are coalescing. It is also clear there is no agreed position on whether the material itself even counts as meat. \u201cCultured meat is in a process of becoming,\u201d sums up Neil Stephens, a sociologist at Brunel University, London, who has been studying the area for over a decade and co-founded the group <a href=\"https://www.cultivate-uk.org/\" title=\"\">Cultivate</a> to help build discussion of the technology. \u201cIt might become a stable category as meat, but it\u2019s not there yet.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2> <p>To a certain extent, the science of culturing meat is relatively well understood. The process begins when a cell is taken from an animal and grown up in a lab to permanently establish a culture (called a cell line). The cells can come from a range of sources: biopsies of living animals, pieces of fresh meat, cell banks and even the roots of feathers, which JUST has been experimenting with. Cell lines can either be based on primary cells \u2013 for example muscle or fat cells \u2013 or on stem cells. Stem cells have the advantage that with different nutrients, or genetic modifications, they are able to mature into any cell type. There is also no limit to how long stem-cell lines can live, so it is possible to use them indefinitely to produce a product. Once a good cell line \u2013 for example, one that grows fast and is tasty \u2013 has been selected, a sample is introduced into a bioreactor, a vat of culture medium where the cells proliferate exponentially and can be harvested. The resulting meat cell mush can be formed into a plethora of unstructured items, from patties to sausages \u2013 with or without other ingredients added for texture. Conventional meat has a variety of cell types from which it derives its flavour, including both muscle and fat, and the companies are trying to broadly replicate that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"324b76c6202d104c253e86692c73f399bf04b6d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/324b76c6202d104c253e86692c73f399bf04b6d7/0_0_2190_3285/667.jpg\" alt=\"just inc chef nate grills a piece of cultured chicken at their offices in san francisco\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JUST chef Nate grills a piece of cultured chicken.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of JU.ST</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>JUST isn\u2019t specifying how the cell source for the particular nugget I am about to try was obtained \u2013 it gets its cells in many ways \u2013 but I am assured the process didn\u2019t involve any slaughter, which is why I think I am on safe ground eating it. For most people, notes Tetrick, it won\u2019t matter how the cell is obtained. It is also not disclosing whether it was grown from a primary cell or a stem-cell line (which it doesn\u2019t genetically modify). And I don\u2019t know the exact type of chicken cells in the final product.</p> <p>When I do bite into the nugget \u2013 which I am told is about 70% chicken, on a par with a premium chicken nugget \u2013 it has a dense texture and a mild, somewhat creamy flavour that reminds me of a pressed chicken sandwich I once bit into by accident. It also contains an amount of JUST\u2019s own mung bean protein isolate for texture along with water, oil, salt, pepper and, this being a nugget, breading.</p> <p>Yet while establishing cell lines is one thing, scaling them up for mass production at a competitive price is another. The problem is that the culture medium \u2013 needed for the cells to grow \u2013 is expensive and animal cells can take time to proliferate. And there is no guarantee that a small operation will work at large scale.</p> <p>Compounding the challenge is the need to develop good alternatives to foetal bovine serum (FBS). Derived from the blood of cow foetuses, it is often added to culture media where the growth factors it contains work their magic. But its use is a nonstarter for an industry trying to take animals out of the equation and many companies are hard at work producing their own alternatives. \u201cAll of the companies have pledged that they will not sell products that involve FBS in the production,\u201d notes Friedrich.</p> <p>A further aspiration of the companies is moving beyond mush. Technologies such as 3D printing and edible scaffolds may enable this and there have been early demos. But producing, say, a fillet is much more difficult than ground meat. </p> <p>There is also the challenge of getting consumers over the \u201cyuck\u201d factor. Stephens notes that the people prepared to try it tend to be educated, male and young \u2013 and that it is they who could help normalise it. Tetrick thinks the answer will ultimately come down to making products that are tasty and affordable \u2013 and, in the early days at least, educating people about the process and the benefits, which he notes would also extend to safer products because faecal contamination would be eliminated, as would antibiotics (sterile conditions would stop bacteria and viruses taking hold, and if they did, any contaminated batches could be discarded).</p> <h2><strong>Resistance</strong></h2> <p>For a technology with such far-reaching implications for everything from rural livelihoods to human identity, critical public discussion and debate to date have been relatively limited. But that may be changing.</p> <p>The website <a href=\"https://www.cleanmeat-hoax.com\" title=\"\">Clean Meat Hoax</a> was launched last year by an informal group of 16 animal rights scholars and activists.

So far, laws have been passed in 12 states. Under Louisiana\u2019s new law, which takes effect later this year, \u201cmeat\u201d would specifically exclude anything that was a \u201ccell-cultured food product grown in a laboratory from animal cells\u201d. While state laws will be superseded when federal labelling rules for cultured meat come in, it doubtless sends a strong message to regulators as they decide.</p> <p>Yet, notes Friedrich, whose GFI is challenging various pieces of state legislation in court, the outcomes could be \u201creally bizarre\u201d if cultivated meat cannot be called meat. \u201cSome people have meat allergies\u2026 It\u2019s a consumer safety issue,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If meat were to removed from the name, it would be a blow to an industry that believes that being recognised as meat is the most likely way to change the world.

      "bodyText": "I am sitting at a kitchen worktop in the airy offices of San Francisco food startup Eat JUST. As a vegetarian, I\u2019m in angst about what is being gently turned over for me in the fryer by one of the chefs. Sitting beside me, the company\u2019s CEO Josh Tetrick tries to put my moral dilemma into perspective. \u201cYou\u2019re not my target market,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s people who are eating meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\u201d The product in the fryer is a JUST prototype chicken nugget, which costs about $50 to make. It is manufactured from what the industry calls cultured, cell-based or cultivated meat (though the outside world knows it more commonly as lab-grown meat). Not to be confused with \u201cmeat\u201d that is plant derived, it is produced directly from animal cells with little need to raise and no need to slaughter actual animals. It is a technology with the potential to fundamentally change the world \u2013 significantly replacing the way meat is produced now with a kinder and less environmentally damaging alternative. Cultured meat is a \u201ccolossal\u201d market opportunity says Bruce Friedrich, co-founder and executive director of the Good Food Institute (GFI), a nonprofit organisation that promotes cultured meat and plant-based meat. Even a tiny bite of the $1.4tn annual global meat market would be a lot. No cultured meat products are on the market yet and nor has it been approved in any country \u2013 but they are expected to begin trickling into high-end restaurants over the next couple of years. A plethora of companies are at various stages of scaling up production and several have done public and private tasting of various prototypes. They are working on everything from chicken to beef to fish and have both humans and pets in their sights. The GFI estimates that since San Francisco Bay Area-based Memphis Meats \u2013 the first startup \u2013 was founded in 2015, a total of 60 enterprises now make up the market with cultured meat as their sole business focus; collectively they have raised nearly $140m in disclosed funding. That comes mostly from venture capitalists but also from agriculture multinationals such as Tyson and Cargill. JUST, which isn\u2019t included in the GFI\u2019s figures because it also makes vegan egg and mayonnaise, announced it was pursuing cultured meat in mid-2017, though it does not disclose what proportion of the $220m-plus it has raised in funding it is directing to its cultured meat endeavours. Meanwhile regulators are working on the approvals process and labelling requirements. Tetrick says JUST is ready to release its chicken nuggets in some high-end restaurants in an Asian country as soon as it has the thumbs up from the country\u2019s regulator, with whom it is in dialogue. Chicken is considered easier in part because the vaccine industry has been using avian stem cells to produce vaccines for years: there is existing knowledge to draw on. Establishing this industry isn\u2019t easy, however. While companies work out technicalities, voices raising concerns about the technology and its implications are coalescing. It is also clear there is no agreed position on whether the material itself even counts as meat. \u201cCultured meat is in a process of becoming,\u201d sums up Neil Stephens, a sociologist at Brunel University, London, who has been studying the area for over a decade and co-founded the group Cultivate to help build discussion of the technology. \u201cIt might become a stable category as meat, but it\u2019s not there yet.\u201d Background To a certain extent, the science of culturing meat is relatively well understood. The process begins when a cell is taken from an animal and grown up in a lab to permanently establish a culture (called a cell line). The cells can come from a range of sources: biopsies of living animals, pieces of fresh meat, cell banks and even the roots of feathers, which JUST has been experimenting with. Cell lines can either be based on primary cells \u2013 for example muscle or fat cells \u2013 or on stem cells. Stem cells have the advantage that with different nutrients, or genetic modifications, they are able to mature into any cell type. There is also no limit to how long stem-cell lines can live, so it is possible to use them indefinitely to produce a product. Once a good cell line \u2013 for example, one that grows fast and is tasty \u2013 has been selected, a sample is introduced into a bioreactor, a vat of culture medium where the cells proliferate exponentially and can be harvested. The resulting meat cell mush can be formed into a plethora of unstructured items, from patties to sausages \u2013 with or without other ingredients added for texture. Conventional meat has a variety of cell types from which it derives its flavour, including both muscle and fat, and the companies are trying to broadly replicate that. JUST isn\u2019t specifying how the cell source for the particular nugget I am about to try was obtained \u2013 it gets its cells in many ways \u2013 but I am assured the process didn\u2019t involve any slaughter, which is why I think I am on safe ground eating it. For most people, notes Tetrick, it won\u2019t matter how the cell is obtained. It is also not disclosing whether it was grown from a primary cell or a stem-cell line (which it doesn\u2019t genetically modify). And I don\u2019t know the exact type of chicken cells in the final product. When I do bite into the nugget \u2013 which I am told is about 70% chicken, on a par with a premium chicken nugget \u2013 it has a dense texture and a mild, somewhat creamy flavour that reminds me of a pressed chicken sandwich I once bit into by accident. It also contains an amount of JUST\u2019s own mung bean protein isolate for texture along with water, oil, salt, pepper and, this being a nugget, breading. Yet while establishing cell lines is one thing, scaling them up for mass production at a competitive price is another. The problem is that the culture medium \u2013 needed for the cells to grow \u2013 is expensive and animal cells can take time to proliferate. And there is no guarantee that a small operation will work at large scale. Compounding the challenge is the need to develop good alternatives to foetal bovine serum (FBS). Derived from the blood of cow foetuses, it is often added to culture media where the growth factors it contains work their magic. But its use is a nonstarter for an industry trying to take animals out of the equation and many companies are hard at work producing their own alternatives. \u201cAll of the companies have pledged that they will not sell products that involve FBS in the production,\u201d notes Friedrich. A further aspiration of the companies is moving beyond mush. Technologies such as 3D printing and edible scaffolds may enable this and there have been early demos. But producing, say, a fillet is much more difficult than ground meat. There is also the challenge of getting consumers over the \u201cyuck\u201d factor. Stephens notes that the people prepared to try it tend to be educated, male and young \u2013 and that it is they who could help normalise it. Tetrick thinks the answer will ultimately come down to making products that are tasty and affordable \u2013 and, in the early days at least, educating people about the process and the benefits, which he notes would also extend to safer products because faecal contamination would be eliminated, as would antibiotics (sterile conditions would stop bacteria and viruses taking hold, and if they did, any contaminated batches could be discarded). Resistance For a technology with such far-reaching implications for everything from rural livelihoods to human identity, critical public discussion and debate to date have been relatively limited. But that may be changing. The website Clean Meat Hoax was launched last year by an informal group of 16 animal rights scholars and activists. It rails against cultured meat on the grounds that it still suggests that meat is desirable, and that animals are a resource people can draw on. It contrasts with the more pragmatic position other animal rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) have taken in favour of the technology on the grounds that animals\u2019 lives will be saved. \u201cWhat is incredible to me is how uncritically this technology is being celebrated and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident \u2013 we don\u2019t want to consider the possibility that we can stop eating animals,\u201d says site founder John Sanbonmatsu, a philosopher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Meanwhile an advertisement in Brussels metro stations designed to undermine cultured meat contrasts a barn of cows surrounded by greenery to a \u201cmeat lab\u201d surrounded by transmission towers. It is the work of the European Livestock Voice campaign \u2013 set up last year by a number of European farming industry groups to stress the potential social impacts of upending the meat industry. Other voices, meanwhile, don\u2019t reject the technology wholesale but have concerns over certain aspects. Michael Hansen is a senior scientist in the advocacy division of the nonprofit organisation Consumer Reports, which compares consumer products. He worries about the potential for bioreactor contamination but also wants more transparency from the companies on their science. How, for example, are they dealing with cells that spontaneously mutate? And what are the implications of the fact that immortal cell lines could, with their uncontrolled growth, be defined as cancer cell lines? He would also like to see data on how end products compare compositionally and nutritionally with the conventional versions. \u201cYou would think they would put samples out for somebody to test\u2026 but all we have are assertions,\u201d he says. The environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth (FoE), meanwhile, is \u201ckeeping an open mind\u201d but stresses that the technology must not distract from existing, proven solutions to helping the planet, such as reducing reliance on animal feed produced on cleared ecoregions, cutting down food waste and supporting healthier diets. It also notes that it is \u201cextremely energy intensive\u201d to produce cultured meat and that the sustainability claims made by the companies will also need \u201cproper assessment\u201d. (JUST\u2019s facilities are currently powered by electricity from the grid, but it plans to be more energy efficient in the future). Labelling Perhaps more significantly for the companies, there remains the question of whether cultivated meat should be allowed to be called meat at all if it hasn\u2019t been harvested from a whole animal. The United States announced last year that cell-cultured livestock and poultry products would be regulated jointly by the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture but further detailed requirements along with labelling rules are awaited. So far, the industry has done a good job of arguing that its products are meat. While debate continues within the cultured meat industry about exactly what adjective to put in front (\u201cclean meat\u201d was dropped because funders in the conventional meat industry didn\u2019t like the \u201cdirty\u201d connotation it gave conventional meat), the \u201cmeat\u201d is a constant \u2013 which asserts its claim to be either a subcategory of meat or just meat. \u201cI actually think the word \u2018meat\u2019 does more work [than any of the adjectives],\u201d says Stephens. And if Tetrick has his way, using any sort of prefix won\u2019t be necessary for long. Phones were only called Smartphones at the beginning, he points out. \u201cAs something normalises you drop it. At the end of the day this thing is going to be called meat.\u201d But others don\u2019t want it to be called meat at all. Steered by the so called \u201cbarnyard lobby\u201d, which represents the meat, livestock and poultry industries, over 30 US states have considered or are considering so-called \u201ctruth in labelling\u201d laws aimed at preventing words such as \u201cmeat\u201d, \u201cbeef\u201d or \u201cpork\u201d being used to describe cultured meat (the laws often also target plant-based products).

Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that last year cultured meat companies came together to form their own lobby group. Meanwhile, what\u2019s a vegetarian to do where cultured meat is concerned? And what to make of the many company founders, including Tetrick, who would be vegan if they didn\u2019t eat their own products? For the UK Vegetarian Society, there isn\u2019t enough information yet to decide whether cultured meat can be considered vegetarian. \u201cThere are still questions to answer,\u201d it says, adding that those questions centre on production, ingredients, provenance and ethics.

Certainly, from what meat is to what it is to be vegetarian or vegan, cultured meat is blowing apart our existing categorisations. Meat cell product, anyone?

Stalking is about obsession and fixation so nothing less than custody will keep victims safe.\u201d</p> <p>Prosecution rates for stalking offences are falling despite the number of recorded cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/05/stalking-and-harassment-crimes-routinely-badly-handled-uk-report-says\" title=\"\">rising</a> significantly. In 2014-15 there were 2,882 recorded offences according to the Home Office, a figure that climbed to 10,214 three years later. Yet only a quarter of the 6,702 cases in which a charge could be brought led to one, compared with 2014-15 when almost half of reported crimes resulted in further action.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You turn into this person who shouts at your kids for the wrong thing \u2026 it\u2019s stressful, tiring and it\u2019s time-consuming</p> <footer> <cite>Emily Maitlis, stalking victim</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the proportion of the population likely to have experienced stalking is far greater.

      "bodyText": "New Home Office measures to tackle the growing crime of stalking risk becoming a \u201cretrograde\u201d step that campaigners warn could prompt an increase in murders. The stalking protection orders, unveiled today, aim to block perpetrators from approaching their victims and allow courts in England and Wales to move quicker to ban stalkers from contacting or visiting victims. However, some experts voiced concern that the powers could be used as an alternative to prosecutions, placing victims at greater risk. Rachel Horman, chair of Paladin, a national stalking advocacy service, said: \u201cThis would be a retrograde step and could lead to an increase in homicides.\u201d Horman, also a solicitor specialising in stalking and coercive control cases, added: \u201cThe only way to keep a stalking victim safe in my view is to ensure that the perpetrator is in custody. Stalking is about obsession and fixation so nothing less than custody will keep victims safe.\u201d Prosecution rates for stalking offences are falling despite the number of recorded cases rising significantly. In 2014-15 there were 2,882 recorded offences according to the Home Office, a figure that climbed to 10,214 three years later. Yet only a quarter of the 6,702 cases in which a charge could be brought led to one, compared with 2014-15 when almost half of reported crimes resulted in further action. However, the proportion of the population likely to have experienced stalking is far greater. According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales, almost one in five women over the age of 16 have experienced stalking, along with almost one in 10 men. A court heard last week that BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis was left \u201cscared and let down\u201d after a man who stalked her for more than 25 years was able to continue harassing her despite being in prison. Edward Vines, 49, who is serving a second jail sentence for continuing to contact Maitlis and her family, attempted to breach a restraining order by sending her a letter. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live in 2018, Maitlis said the stalking had had a devastating impact on her family. \u201cYou turn into this person who shouts at your kids for the wrong thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes you jumpy \u2013 and that\u2019s stressful and it\u2019s tiring and it\u2019s time-consuming.\u201d The new stalking protection orders will come into effect immediately. In addition to banning perpetrators from approaching or contacting their victims, the orders can also force stalkers to seek professional help. The orders will normally last for a minimum of two years, with a breach counting as a criminal offence that can result in up to five years in prison. The move was described by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust as an \u201cimportant step\u201d in tackling stalking. Suky Bhaker, acting chief executive of the trust, said: \u201cWe hope to see the new order complement the existing legislation to ensure that victims receive a proactive response when they come forward and report stalking.\u201d Clive Ruggles, of the Alice Ruggles Trust, added that the orders could have protected his daughter who was murdered by an obsessive ex-boyfriend. \u201cThe existence of SPOs could have made a critical difference in Alice\u2019s case, and will help improve the outcome for many others in the future,\u201d he said. However, Ruggles added: \u201cIt is critical that there is no delay in arresting perpetrators who breach them: any other response may well escalate the risk to the victim.\u201d But Horman, who has sat on two parliamentary groups for stalking, saidthe Home Office had not learned the lessons of its domestic violence protection orders, which she said had evolved as an alternative to prosecution. \u201cIt is vital that stalking protection orders are used in addition to criminal charges.

In the US, pain is up even though 100 billion pain meds are distributed, according to the <em>Washington Post</em>.\u201d</p> <p>If Blanchflower\u2019s work is correct, politicians keen on improving wellbeing need to prioritise middle-aged people, which seems counter-intuitive given the pressures facing younger people today. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/19/richard-layard-everybody-could-have-a-better-time-extract-from-can-we-be-happier\" title=\"\">Layard writes </a>in today\u2019s <em>Observer New Review</em>: \u201cThe rise in competitiveness has been made much worse by the advent of social media, which have encouraged self-advertisement and made more young people feel inadequate, anxious, depressed and \u2018left out\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But there are compensations for being young, Blanchflower argues. \u201cYoung people have more energy and fewer responsibilities!\u201d he emailed, the exclamation mark revealing the fervour with which he holds this belief. He has a theory as to why we hit a nadir in our 40s: \u201cLife seems to get complex and it is a struggle to strike out on your own.\u201d</p> <p>This strikes a chord. Before my 40s I had few cares. Life was simple and many places \u2013 schools, hospitals, doctors\u2019 surgeries, creches, nurseries, playgrounds \u2013 were alien to me. Now that I have a child, a wife and elderly relatives to consider, life is a shuttle between these places.</p> <p>I have a job that has resolutely plateaued for the past two decades and, thanks to familial responsibilities, a squeezed disposable income. I crave sleep. My body is disintegrating. I spend my time obsessing about air pollution and knife crime.</p> <p>And gradually something is dawning on me: I will never represent my country in any sport; no one is going to be calling me from Sweden with an invitation to collect a Nobel; Gregg and John are never going to say to me: \u201cMate, that was an awesome tiramisu.\u201d</p> <p>And yet there is something hopeful in Blanchflower\u2019s U-shaped curve and its promise that after 47.2 lies a better tomorrow. As Blanchflower says: \u201cOnce you get there, I think you get more realistic \u2013 and happier.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, if I have learned anything as I hit the age of 47.2, it can be summarised in the observation of Frank Bascombe, the main character, aged 44, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/28/richard-ford-frank-bascombe-novels\" title=\"\">Richard Ford\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/28/richard-ford-frank-bascombe-novels\" title=\"\">The Sportswriter</a></em>. \u201cFor your life to be worth anything, you must sooner or later face the possibility of terrible, searing regret \u2013 though you must also manage to avoid it or your life will be ruined. I believe I have done these two things. Faced down regret. Avoided ruin. And I am still here to tell about it.\u201d</p>",

While Blanchflower believes politicians now understand the need to take happiness seriously, he fears they do not appreciate their role in its delivery. \u201cThey are getting happiness more but I think we need to understand that politicians imposed failed reckless austerity, which broke down social ties even more.\u201d As the west endures an explosion of depression and loneliness, society must look itself in the mirror, says Blanchflower, who thinks the keys to happiness are \u201cfriends, family and a supporting community\u201d. \u201cIt seems society does value happiness more these days but not enough \u2013 we are having an explosion of depression and loneliness. In the US, pain is up even though 100 billion pain meds are distributed, according to the Washington Post.\u201d If Blanchflower\u2019s work is correct, politicians keen on improving wellbeing need to prioritise middle-aged people, which seems counter-intuitive given the pressures facing younger people today. As Layard writes in today\u2019s Observer New Review: \u201cThe rise in competitiveness has been made much worse by the advent of social media, which have encouraged self-advertisement and made more young people feel inadequate, anxious, depressed and \u2018left out\u2019.\u201d But there are compensations for being young, Blanchflower argues. \u201cYoung people have more energy and fewer responsibilities!\u201d he emailed, the exclamation mark revealing the fervour with which he holds this belief. He has a theory as to why we hit a nadir in our 40s: \u201cLife seems to get complex and it is a struggle to strike out on your own.\u201d This strikes a chord. Before my 40s I had few cares. Life was simple and many places \u2013 schools, hospitals, doctors\u2019 surgeries, creches, nurseries, playgrounds \u2013 were alien to me. Now that I have a child, a wife and elderly relatives to consider, life is a shuttle between these places. I have a job that has resolutely plateaued for the past two decades and, thanks to familial responsibilities, a squeezed disposable income. I crave sleep. My body is disintegrating. I spend my time obsessing about air pollution and knife crime. And gradually something is dawning on me: I will never represent my country in any sport; no one is going to be calling me from Sweden with an invitation to collect a Nobel; Gregg and John are never going to say to me: \u201cMate, that was an awesome tiramisu.\u201d And yet there is something hopeful in Blanchflower\u2019s U-shaped curve and its promise that after 47.2 lies a better tomorrow. As Blanchflower says: \u201cOnce you get there, I think you get more realistic \u2013 and happier.\u201d Indeed, if I have learned anything as I hit the age of 47.2, it can be summarised in the observation of Frank Bascombe, the main character, aged 44, in Richard Ford\u2019s The Sportswriter. \u201cFor your life to be worth anything, you must sooner or later face the possibility of terrible, searing regret \u2013 though you must also manage to avoid it or your life will be ruined. I believe I have done these two things. Faced down regret. Avoided ruin. And I am still here to tell about it.\u201d",

He left it until all the campaigning was over to ask to see a detailed plan for the first 100 days that David Miliband, then his head of policy, and Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff, had spent much of the previous months devising. Until then, despite being miles ahead in the polls, \u201cBlair hadn\u2019t wanted to look\u201d, Powell says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/18/boris-johnson-warns-cabinet-shape-up-or-be-sacked\">Johnson to cabinet: shape up or I\u2019ll sack you within weeks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once in No 10, however, the new PM and his administration set a scorching pace. \u201cWe ran for office as New Labour, we will govern as New Labour,\u201d Blair said in his victory speech. And they did. Big surprises day after day added to a sense of national excitement. On day two, Gordon Brown announced the independence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/may/07/economy.uk\" title=\"\">Bank of England</a>. Soon after, the trade union ban at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/05/0515/gchq.shtml\" title=\"\">GCHQ</a> was lifted. All handguns were banned. Nursery vouchers were scrapped. VAT on fuel was cut to 5%. And on it went for 100 days.</p> <p>New prime ministers like to hit the ground sprinting. In Boris Johnson\u2019s case, however, it has not been the scale of the announcements or their number that have particularly caught the eye. There has been no equivalent of the independence of the Bank. Rather, it has been the tone and the carefully charted direction of travel that have captured attention and caused some surprise.</p> <p>During the election campaign, one of Labour\u2019s attack lines was that Johnson would be the most rightwing prime minister the country had ever had. Even then, based on what had \u2013 and had not \u2013 been included in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/24/conservative-manifesto-the-key-points-policies-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Tory manifesto</a>, Labour\u2019s claim seemed open to challenge. A proposed Tory cut in corporation tax to 17% had been dropped from the Johnson manifesto \u2013 as had the idea of increasing the threshold for paying higher-rate tax to \u00a380,000 a year. His blueprint for Britain lacked the radicalism or ideological underpinning of that put forward by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/whats-in-the-labour-party-manifesto\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn and his party</a>.</p> <p>Since the election, however, the Labour caricature has seemed even more open to question. Deliberately, and no doubt partly for strategic political reasons, Johnson has not behaved as expected.

But could it be something more enduring than a short-term Cummings wheeze? People who have known Johnson a long time say there are plenty of reasons why he may well turn out to be different, now he has reached the top.</p> <p>\u201cHis rightwing poses always struck me as mainly to advance himself in the Tory party, not because he held ardently to those views,\u201d said one political ally who has worked with him and voted for him to be leader. \u201cNow we will see what he does actually think.\u201d</p> <p>People who knew Johnson in Brussels, where he grew up and worked as a journalist, say he was never genuinely a hardline Euro-sceptic. They cannot believe he would really have wanted to quit the EU. Those who worked alongside him when he was mayor of London also say he was non-ideological and point to evidence of his social liberalism.</p> <p>It is very, very early days for Johnson. He has ahead of him the huge task of negotiating the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, which will reignite tensions inside his own party, and could cause friction with Washington. The climate crisis looms ever more urgently, and could do the same. The NHS is creaking and the social care system could bring the whole system crashing down. Growth is slow and funds are short.</p> <p>It is these challenges \u2013 not the first easily negotiated days \u2013 that will be the real test of Boris Johnson and will show us what sort of a leader he really is.</p> <h2>The budget<br></h2> <p>March\u2019s budget is a huge moment for Boris Johnson to show he is serious about helping the regions that helped deliver his majority. It also presents him with big decisions about how much he loosens the purse strings and what kinds of projects he funds. Some insiders already believe that the breakthrough in the Midlands and the north-east means he will need to look at more ambitious plans for those areas than were announced during the campaign. With Johnson at the peak of his powers, the Treasury is on board. Earlier tensions between No 10 and No 11 seem to have dissipated, with Johnson and chancellor Sajid Javid meeting twice a week. A main difficulty will be picking the right projects \u2013 those that can deliver tangible improvements within five years. But will spending on infrastructure projects be enough to offset continuing concerns about issues that have caused the Tories problems, such as universal credit and the NHS?</p> <h2>The Brexit conundrum<br></h2> <p>While \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d was the Tory slogan that defined the 2019 election, it papered over the difficult reality that formally leaving the European Union at the end of January will be the easy part of the process. Negotiating a future trade deal with the bloc is the hard bit, made harder by Johnson\u2019s refusal to extend the Brexit transition period beyond the end of the year. There is also a tension at the heart of the prime minister\u2019s plan \u2013 voters in pro-Leave areas handed him a majority, but diverging too far from the EU in an attempt to deliver a \u201cmeaningful Brexit\u201d could land Britain with a poor deal that hurts those areas the most. Delivering a clear break with the EU while preventing a big economic hit on new Tory constituencies is looking a tough trick to pull off, but Javid has signalled that Britain wants to diverge. The prime minister could give himself more time by extending the Brexit transition period. Doing so would require a major U-turn \u2013 but he has executed these before.</p> <h2>The reshuffle<br></h2> <p>With Brexit Day out of the way, a cabinet reshuffle is expected. While it will allow Johnson to put his favoured politicians in top jobs, reshuffles always present a danger to PMs soon after they are carried out, as the overlooked and the disgruntled begin to plot on the backbenches. Not long ago, most anticipated a major overhaul, with figures such as Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg and Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith among those at risk. However, the current cabinet are all working hard to deliver Johnson\u2019s demands \u2013 meaning the reshuffle may now be less comprehensive. But there may still be a gender balance issue for the PM. Many of the vulnerable cabinet ministers are women \u2013 sacking them all could be a bad look for a PM who committed to helping women \u201creach their full potential\u201d during the election. Andrea Leadsom, Liz Truss, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey and Theresa Villiers could be demoted, sacked or moved.</p> <h2>The Cummings revolution<br></h2> <p>Dominic Cummings, the Vote Leave strategy chief who helped plot Johnson\u2019s route to power, has long harboured an obsessive desire to rip up the way Whitehall and government operate. Now in No 10, he is in a position to begin the rewiring. Depending on which of his many and lengthy blog posts you read, he wants to model government on the way Nasa was overhauled before the moon mission or altered to mirror the planning structures ahead of the US military\u2019s Operation Desert Storm. Cummings has already called for \u201cweirdos\u201d to apply for new jobs within No 10 and is itching to take on the civil service. Remodelling and abolishing government departments could also be on his agenda, while he has long been a critic of the Treasury\u2019s wide-reaching power. His brand of creative destruction within Whitehall is going to force Johnson into confrontations. Flashpoints are inevitable and the personal relationship between Cummings and Johnson will be important to watch.</p> <h2>Party tensions<br></h2> <p>With Labour reduced to its worst seat share since 1935 and the Lib Dems still in the doldrums \u2013 and both engaged in leadership battles \u2013 the internal tensions that emerge within the Tory party will provide the political intrigue. Johnson\u2019s 80-strong majority has put him in a very strong position, but it also presents him with the task of keeping together a group of MPs from hugely different constituencies. Successful defences against the Lib Dems mean it still has many MPs in strongly Remain seats, alongside new seats in pro-Brexit areas and their traditional shire heartlands. Issues such as HS2, which could boost the Midlands and the north but receives opposition from some true blue Tory areas, could be an early flashpoint. The power and influence of the European Research Group will also be worth watching closely. The pro-Brexit group was a thorn in the side of Theresa May\u2019s minority government, but with a thumping majority, Johnson has the option to marginalise it should he want to. There are no signs of that so far.</p> <h2>The Union<br></h2> <p>The strong performance of the SNP at the election means that its leader Nicola Sturgeon will be a central figure in this parliament. Johnson has already issued a comprehensive rejection of Sturgeon\u2019s demand for a second independence referendum, saying it would \u201ccontinue the political stagnation Scotland has seen for the past decade\u201d. However, the demands may be harder to deflect should the SNP win a majority in next year\u2019s Scottish parliament elections. It means that the Tories will have to put a lot of time and effort into stopping that happening and figuring out a strategy if it does.</p> <p>Some Tories already believe simply ignoring the demands is unsustainable. Meanwhile, the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland was a huge early boost to Johnson, but risks remain. Brexit has stirred up questions about border polls, and any evidence of barriers being erected between Northern Ireland and Great Britain will inflame matters.<br><strong>Michael Savage, Policy Editor</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was only on general election day \u2013 1 May 1997 \u2013 that Tony Blair began to focus on what he would actually do in government if he won. He left it until all the campaigning was over to ask to see a detailed plan for the first 100 days that David Miliband, then his head of policy, and Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff, had spent much of the previous months devising. Until then, despite being miles ahead in the polls, \u201cBlair hadn\u2019t wanted to look\u201d, Powell says. Once in No 10, however, the new PM and his administration set a scorching pace. \u201cWe ran for office as New Labour, we will govern as New Labour,\u201d Blair said in his victory speech. And they did. Big surprises day after day added to a sense of national excitement. On day two, Gordon Brown announced the independence of the Bank of England. Soon after, the trade union ban at GCHQ was lifted. All handguns were banned. Nursery vouchers were scrapped. VAT on fuel was cut to 5%. And on it went for 100 days. New prime ministers like to hit the ground sprinting. In Boris Johnson\u2019s case, however, it has not been the scale of the announcements or their number that have particularly caught the eye. There has been no equivalent of the independence of the Bank. Rather, it has been the tone and the carefully charted direction of travel that have captured attention and caused some surprise. During the election campaign, one of Labour\u2019s attack lines was that Johnson would be the most rightwing prime minister the country had ever had. Even then, based on what had \u2013 and had not \u2013 been included in the Tory manifesto, Labour\u2019s claim seemed open to challenge. A proposed Tory cut in corporation tax to 17% had been dropped from the Johnson manifesto \u2013 as had the idea of increasing the threshold for paying higher-rate tax to \u00a380,000 a year. His blueprint for Britain lacked the radicalism or ideological underpinning of that put forward by Jeremy Corbyn and his party. Since the election, however, the Labour caricature has seemed even more open to question. Deliberately, and no doubt partly for strategic political reasons, Johnson has not behaved as expected. The view of him as an unstintingly pro-Trump, pro-free market, anti-interventionist, ideologically driven Brexiter set on turning the UK\u2019s back to the EU and its sights unblinkingly to Washington has not quite rung true or been borne out by events. And, for the time being, it appears to be working for him: according to an Opinium poll for the Observer this weekend, 42% of people say he is doing a better job as PM than they had expected. There have been surprises both at home and abroad. When, eventually, Johnson gave a response to the assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, it was far more nuanced and closer to that of the rest of the EU (which the UK will leave in less than two weeks) than many had expected. With Brexit now certain, Johnson has wanted to dial down the anti-EU talk and dial up the idea of close co-operation with the Europeans. Domestically, there have also been oddly un-Tory moves. Last week\u2019s decision to offer a rescue package for the struggling airline Flybe, while also legislating for extra NHS spending, was a striking departure for a Conservative government. The normal Tory approach would be to allow such strugglers to fail. But this time ministers were at pains to point out that Flybe was a regional carrier which served all parts of the country, providing an important national and social as well as economic purpose. Lots of new infrastructure projects are promised for the same \u201cregions\u201d, and a rethink of the HS2 high-speed rail line is rumoured to be under way, with more focus and spending on the north of England. Johnson told his cabinet recently that he was a \u201cBrexity Hezza\u201d. It will have escaped none of them that Michael Heseltine\u2019s one-nation Toryism has always been based upon a commitment \u201cto intervene before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner\u201d.

As Australia\u2019s months-long bushfire crisis continued, an unpredictable mix of fire and rain hit NSW and Victoria on Sunday. Hail the size of golf balls pelted some Melbourne suburbs late in the afternoon as thunderstorms and heavy rain moved across southern Victoria. Residents reported hailstones up to 5cm in diameter in Glen Iris, while fire-affected catchments in East Gippsland and Victoria\u2019s north-east were now on flood watch, ABC News reported. There were fears flash flooding and strong winds could topple trees, create landslides and send debris on to roads. Severe thunderstorms were also forecast for large parts of NSW and flood warnings have been issued for the Bellinger and Orara rivers on the NSW mid-north coast. On Sunday morning, the emergency level fire that flared on French Island at Victoria\u2019s Mornington Peninsula was downgraded to advice. Victoria\u2019s state opposition leader, Michael O\u2019Brien, said the Victorian parliament should move at least one sitting week to bushfire-hit regions such as East Gippsland.

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, described the bushfire crisis as the \u201cbiggest challenge in living memory\u201d to Australian tourism. In the tourism package, A$20m will be spent on a domestic ad campaign and A$10m has been set aside to create new tourist attractions \u2013 such as events, festivals or art \u2013 in bushfire-hit areas. The tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, said this represented a \u201cbreak from the practice of Tourism Australia exclusively focusing on international visitors\u201d and was an \u201curgent\u201d appeal to local visitors as well.

      "body": "<p>Adapted from activist lawyer Bryan Stevenson\u2019s 2014 memoir, subtitled \u201cA Story of Justice and Redemption\u201d, Destin Daniel Cretton\u2019s timely legal drama is, for the most part, as admirably understated as its subject. Largely eschewing dramatic speechifying in favour of quieter contextualisation, it offers a movingly matter-of-fact account of one man\u2019s struggle to lend voice to the silenced, dispossessed inmates of death row. As with the book, the film frames its wider story of poverty, prejudice and institutional racism within an infamous miscarriage of justice \u2013 the case of <a href=\"https://eji.org/cases/walter-mcmillian/\" title=\"\">Walter McMillian</a>, an African American condemned to death for a crime that he evidently did not commit. Yet as the intelligently accessible script by Cretton and Andrew Lanham makes clear, McMillian\u2019s case is not the whole picture; rather, it is a totemic example of how a socioeconomic system forged within the furnace of slavery still bears the shackles of its past.</p> <p>We open in 1987, in Monroe County, Alabama, where pulpwood tree feller McMillian (an almost unrecognisably unimposing Jamie Foxx) is arrested for the murder of white teenager Ronda Morrison. Billboards boast about Monroeville being Harper Lee\u2019s hometown (\u201cCheck out the Mockingbird museum,\u201d says Rafe Spall\u2019s district attorney, \u201cit\u2019s one of the great civil rights landmarks of the south\u201d), but the spirit of Atticus Finch does not appear to haunt these halls of justice. By the time the Harvard-educated Stevenson (Michael B Jordan) starts defending death row inmates, McMillian \u2013 aka Johnny D \u2013 is awaiting execution with little hope of reprieve and even less faith in lawyers. Yet as co-founder of the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), Stevenson is determined to make a difference, and despite his would-be client\u2019s initial dismissals, he makes the journey out to McMillian\u2019s impoverished old neighbourhood to meet the friends and family who <em>know</em> he couldn\u2019t have done it.</p> <p>For those not already au fait with the credibility-defying details of the real-life case (famously shown on the US news programme <em>60 Minutes</em> in 1992), I\u2019ll allow the movie to weave its procedural spell, as the revelation of key facts undermines the state\u2019s conviction. Suffice to say that it doesn\u2019t take much scratching before everything starts to fall apart, incurring the hostility of a community (both civil and legal) with much invested in keeping the Morrison case firmly closed.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbWiCPx99rs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fbWiCPx99rs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbWiCPx99rs\">Watch a trailer for Just Mercy.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Posters for <em>Just Mercy</em> are emblazoned with quotes justifiably extolling the film\u2019s \u201cOscar-worthy\u201d performances, and it\u2019s easy to see its absence from the recent nominations as further evidence that #OscarsSoWhite still applies, a feeling amplified by the similarly depressing lack of recognition for stand-out 2019 turns from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/24/us-review-jordan-peele-lupita-nyongo\" title=\"\">Lupita Nyong\u2019o</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/14/hustlers-review-jennifer-lopez\" title=\"\">Jennifer Lopez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/31/the-farewell-review-awkwafina-sundance\" title=\"\">Awkwafina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho\" title=\"\">Song Kang-ho</a> et al. Yet the overlooking of Cretton\u2019s movie may have just as much to do with its lack of Oscar-friendly grandstanding, and the fact that, unlike last year\u2019s best picture winner, <em>Green Book</em>, it feels horribly contemporary.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/01/bryan-stevenson-americas-mandela\" title=\"\">excellent 2015 interview with Stevenson for this paper,</a> headlined \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mandela\u201d (a term coined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu), Tim Adams refers repeatedly to Stevenson\u2019s habitual underplaying of any idea of heroism, describing him speaking \u201cquietly and exactly\u201d and noting the \u201cmeasured, anecdotal\u201d style of his writing in the face of \u201cbarely credible inhumanity\u201d. These are the attributes that chime with Cretton\u2019s film-making CV, dating back to his 2013 feature debut, the South by Southwest festival favourite <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/01/short-term-12-review\" title=\"\">Short Term 12</a></em>, and the autobiographically inspired 2008 short that preceded it. Rami Malek, Lakeith Stanfield and Brie Larson all had early roles in Cretton\u2019s acclaimed debut, and Larson returns to work with Cretton again in<em> Just Mercy</em> (as she did in his 2017 oddity <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/06/the-glass-castle-review-woody-harrelson-naomi-watts-brie-larson\" title=\"\">The Glass Castle</a></em>) in the crucial but low-key role of EJI co-founder Eva Ansley. It\u2019s a defiantly unshowy supporting performance, helping to tell the story without ever stealing the spotlight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/01/bryan-stevenson-americas-mandela\">Bryan Stevenson: \u2018America's Mandela\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other ensemble roles are equally un-self-serving, a quality that usually proves to be Kryptonite for awards voters. O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr and Rob Morgan are utterly convincing as Anthony Ray Hinton and Herbert Richardson, fellow death row inmates whose guilt or innocence becomes secondary to the grotesque spectre of capital punishment, which is evoked with as much impact as in Tim Robbins\u2019s Oscar-feted 1995 drama <em>Dead Man Walking</em>. Darrell Britt-Gibson lends nervy energy to the role of reluctant witness Darnell Houston, while Tim Blake Nelson is convincingly bent out of shape as McMillian\u2019s primary accuser. As for Foxx and Jordan, their dialled-down discipline pays dividends, lending greater weight to those few moments (a courtroom showdown, a jailhouse breakdown) when Cretton briefly turns up the dramatic heat, with rousing results.</p>",

In his excellent 2015 interview with Stevenson for this paper, headlined \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mandela\u201d (a term coined by Archbishop Desmond Tutu), Tim Adams refers repeatedly to Stevenson\u2019s habitual underplaying of any idea of heroism, describing him speaking \u201cquietly and exactly\u201d and noting the \u201cmeasured, anecdotal\u201d style of his writing in the face of \u201cbarely credible inhumanity\u201d. These are the attributes that chime with Cretton\u2019s film-making CV, dating back to his 2013 feature debut, the South by Southwest festival favourite Short Term 12, and the autobiographically inspired 2008 short that preceded it. Rami Malek, Lakeith Stanfield and Brie Larson all had early roles in Cretton\u2019s acclaimed debut, and Larson returns to work with Cretton again in Just Mercy (as she did in his 2017 oddity The Glass Castle) in the crucial but low-key role of EJI co-founder Eva Ansley. It\u2019s a defiantly unshowy supporting performance, helping to tell the story without ever stealing the spotlight. Other ensemble roles are equally un-self-serving, a quality that usually proves to be Kryptonite for awards voters. O\u2019Shea Jackson Jr and Rob Morgan are utterly convincing as Anthony Ray Hinton and Herbert Richardson, fellow death row inmates whose guilt or innocence becomes secondary to the grotesque spectre of capital punishment, which is evoked with as much impact as in Tim Robbins\u2019s Oscar-feted 1995 drama Dead Man Walking. Darrell Britt-Gibson lends nervy energy to the role of reluctant witness Darnell Houston, while Tim Blake Nelson is convincingly bent out of shape as McMillian\u2019s primary accuser. As for Foxx and Jordan, their dialled-down discipline pays dividends, lending greater weight to those few moments (a courtroom showdown, a jailhouse breakdown) when Cretton briefly turns up the dramatic heat, with rousing results.",

It is a pale and fleshy pink this Tuesday, slightly sticky to the touch, its edges softened by the growing hope that you have won. And not for the last time!

The shops are full of Christmas leftovers: those high-calorie, nutrient-light foodstuffs, now for sale at massive discounts \u2013 confectionery collections, deep-filled mince pies, presentation tins of chocolate biscuits. You exert all that willpower over the festive period, and just when you think it\u2019s safe to go back into the supermarkets \u2026</p> <p>But in the last year I\u2019ve pretty much stopped going into supermarkets. Or takeaways. Or fast-food joints. Not that I\u2019ve stopped eating their products \u2013 I\u2019ve restricted myself to hoovering up what other people bring on to the streets and squander: my own personal Deliveroo, free of charge.</p> <p>From quinoa salads discarded at farmers\u2019 markets to pub grub abandoned by fellow diners, it can be quite a varied regime. Park yourself in a central London square on a nice day, and the pricey rice bowls from eateries such as Itsu or Benugo, often still laden with dumplings and prawns and spicy vegetables, pile up alongside overflowing bins. Once I ate my children\u2019s leftovers. Now I eat leftovers from strangers.</p> <p>I\u2019ve fought a lifelong battle with an urban environment that encourages unhealthy eating \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-27601593\" title=\"\">the obesogenic environment</a>, as it has now been defined \u2013 and, after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I seemed destined to be on the losing side. But after adopting a diet that friends and family and experts had deep reservations about, I feel transformed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On a good day I often can take a surplus home \u2013 my very own weekly shop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Friends dubbed me<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/im-the-gutter-gourmet-how-i-spent-a-month-eating-other-peoples-leftovers\" title=\"\"> the Gutter Gourmet.</a> My mum was horrified. My GP was concerned. It wasn\u2019t just that they felt I would pick up some dreadful lurgy. They were worried about my mental health \u2013 this isn\u2019t what decent people did. Certainly a dose of indecency has been the most efficacious medicine I could have hoped for.</p> <p>When I repurposed myself as the Gutter Gourmet, it was fuelled by anger at the criminal excesses of casual waste all around me (not as a way to save a few bob, as some who know me well contend). The government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap, estimates a colossal 10.2m tonnes of annual food waste. Of that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/10/uk-throwing-away-13bn-of-food-each-year-latest-figures-show\" title=\"\">household contribution is 7.</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/10/uk-throwing-away-13bn-of-food-each-year-latest-figures-show\" title=\"\">3m tonnes</a>. My particular harvest \u2013 restaurant plate waste and on-the-go squandering \u2013 is more difficult to quantify. Yes, restaurants and cafes bin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/16/uk-restaurants-and-cafes-bin-320m-fresh-meals-a-year-data-shows\" title=\"\">more than 300</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/16/uk-restaurants-and-cafes-bin-320m-fresh-meals-a-year-data-shows\" title=\"\">m meals a year</a>. But that\u2019s before the consumers I clean up after get a chance to sink their teeth into the complacency industry. One telling survey by the environmental charity Hubbub estimated that our fast food habit generates a staggering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/lunch-on-go-habit-generates-11bn-items-packaging-waste-year-uk\" title=\"\">11</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/lunch-on-go-habit-generates-11bn-items-packaging-waste-year-uk\" title=\"\">bn items of mostly unrecyclable packaging waste a year</a>, from cartons to napkins and plastic cutlery. According to my highly unscientific empirical survey, good food is binned in a third of these cartons, from Hawaiian sushi to garishly coloured meringues.</p> <p>But I was also triggered by the \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d apathy of individuals. A couple of years ago, when I was last in hospital with one of the many serious health issues I\u2019d chalked up since that diabetes diagnosis, the bloke in the next bed would order his hot meals for lunch and dinner \u2013 and then ignore them when they were delivered, in favour of the grub his family brought in. I talked to him: how can you allow all these wholesome meals to go to waste, and all the effort that goes into producing them, and the nursing resources? It would be so easy not to order them every morning. All he had to do was not tick a few boxes on a form.</p> <p>He was not interested. Did he not see a link between his behaviour and systemic waste? Why should he change, when it was the system\u2019s fault? It was his right to do with his food as he saw fit. He\u2019d paid for it with his taxes. And what business was it of mine? For a minute I thought he was going to ask me if I liked hospital food. (I do.)</p> <p>In that hospital stay I gave up on education and plumped for action. If I stopped ordering my own meals, could I eat the ones he ordered and left untouched? It was a deal. When I was discharged, I had an epiphany. All around me were versions of my ward mate, coming out of shops with on-the-go edibles, and discarding them after a few bites or gulps. The Gutter Gourmet was loosed upon the world.</p> <p>I was diagnosed with diabetes on my 40th birthday. I tried to remedy the situation. I went jogging. I put vegetables in my morning porridge instead of sugar. Carrots. Broad beans. Spring onions. Broccoli. Kale. Spinach. If you persevere, they say your taste buds get used to anything. Mine refused to cast off the memory of crunchy brown sugar melting on hot oats. Every morning I fought the battle anew, and often lost.</p> <p>I diligently swallowed the pills \u2013 Metformin, Levothyroxine, Simvastatin \u2013 and jabbed myself with insulin twice a day. What I needed was an injection of willpower. The iron resolve I woke up with to keep all those satanic carbohydrates and sugary treats behind me always seemed to evaporate by mid-afternoon, usually just as the refreshment trolley arrived at work. What harm can one more toffee-coated flapjack do?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b10e1f182b6c1d61675d89ec03b11e3ca974f53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b10e1f182b6c1d61675d89ec03b11e3ca974f53/0_185_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We are not actually consuming more calories than we were back in the mid-70s.

Since the onset of diabetes, my compromised immune system has got me into one mess after another. The steady gain of bodily fat decommissioned my number one defence against diabetes \u2013 exercise \u2013 and weaponised its severity. In the past decade I have clocked up five bouts of pneumonia; recurrent raging episodes of cellulitis (a deep-tissue bacterial infection you can see racing up your legs); ulcerated shins; a general vulnerability to every opportunistic infection going; and intermittent erectile dysfunction.</p> <p>A bloodstream full of sugar, as the top lung professor in my hospital trust put it, is a chemsex orgy venue for microbes. Then my GP weighed in. Unless I pulled my socks up, he warned, eyesight-robbing retinopathy, or peripheral artery disease leading to lower limb amputation, could be just around the corner.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t an idle threat \u2013 there are about 7,000 lower-limb amputations in the UK each year. I recalled visiting a friend who\u2019d lost a leg in a car accident, years ago. The woman in the next bed on the amputation ward had diabetes. \u201cMy doctor told me I had a choice,\u201d she cheerily informed me. \u201cEither the chocolate goes or a leg goes. And I couldn\u2019t give up my Cadbury\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>If I\u2019d known as a child that my passion for Cadbury\u2019s, and fry-ups and bakeries and condiments and cakes and puddings, would decades later have me hooked up to IV drips and emergency antibiotics, would it have made any difference?</p> <p>Probably not. I am a child of the obesogenic revolution. Of course, they didn\u2019t call it obesogenic back in the early 70s. We still had early closing, shops were shut on Sunday, and you couldn\u2019t order so much as a pizza to be delivered. </p> <p>But our local high streets were changing. In my part of south London, there was always a Wimpy bar or a greasy spoon caff around the corner. </p> <p>The era of the microwave turned every corner shop into a takeaway. Vesta curries, Findus pancakes, Angel Delight for afters. Baby food for grown-ups, as we lounged in front of the TV. </p> <p>The first layers of fat that would eventually entomb my pancreas and degrade its production of insulin \u2013 the hormone that breaks down glucose into energy in the cells \u2013 were being laid down.

      "bodyText": "My NHS dietician says that January is a dangerous month for diabetics such as me. The shops are full of Christmas leftovers: those high-calorie, nutrient-light foodstuffs, now for sale at massive discounts \u2013 confectionery collections, deep-filled mince pies, presentation tins of chocolate biscuits. You exert all that willpower over the festive period, and just when you think it\u2019s safe to go back into the supermarkets \u2026 But in the last year I\u2019ve pretty much stopped going into supermarkets. Or takeaways. Or fast-food joints. Not that I\u2019ve stopped eating their products \u2013 I\u2019ve restricted myself to hoovering up what other people bring on to the streets and squander: my own personal Deliveroo, free of charge. From quinoa salads discarded at farmers\u2019 markets to pub grub abandoned by fellow diners, it can be quite a varied regime. Park yourself in a central London square on a nice day, and the pricey rice bowls from eateries such as Itsu or Benugo, often still laden with dumplings and prawns and spicy vegetables, pile up alongside overflowing bins. Once I ate my children\u2019s leftovers. Now I eat leftovers from strangers. I\u2019ve fought a lifelong battle with an urban environment that encourages unhealthy eating \u2013 the obesogenic environment, as it has now been defined \u2013 and, after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I seemed destined to be on the losing side. But after adopting a diet that friends and family and experts had deep reservations about, I feel transformed. Friends dubbed me the Gutter Gourmet. My mum was horrified. My GP was concerned. It wasn\u2019t just that they felt I would pick up some dreadful lurgy. They were worried about my mental health \u2013 this isn\u2019t what decent people did. Certainly a dose of indecency has been the most efficacious medicine I could have hoped for. When I repurposed myself as the Gutter Gourmet, it was fuelled by anger at the criminal excesses of casual waste all around me (not as a way to save a few bob, as some who know me well contend). The government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap, estimates a colossal 10.2m tonnes of annual food waste. Of that the household contribution is 7.3m tonnes. My particular harvest \u2013 restaurant plate waste and on-the-go squandering \u2013 is more difficult to quantify. Yes, restaurants and cafes bin more than 300m meals a year. But that\u2019s before the consumers I clean up after get a chance to sink their teeth into the complacency industry. One telling survey by the environmental charity Hubbub estimated that our fast food habit generates a staggering 11bn items of mostly unrecyclable packaging waste a year, from cartons to napkins and plastic cutlery. According to my highly unscientific empirical survey, good food is binned in a third of these cartons, from Hawaiian sushi to garishly coloured meringues. But I was also triggered by the \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do\u201d apathy of individuals. A couple of years ago, when I was last in hospital with one of the many serious health issues I\u2019d chalked up since that diabetes diagnosis, the bloke in the next bed would order his hot meals for lunch and dinner \u2013 and then ignore them when they were delivered, in favour of the grub his family brought in. I talked to him: how can you allow all these wholesome meals to go to waste, and all the effort that goes into producing them, and the nursing resources? It would be so easy not to order them every morning. All he had to do was not tick a few boxes on a form. He was not interested. Did he not see a link between his behaviour and systemic waste? Why should he change, when it was the system\u2019s fault? It was his right to do with his food as he saw fit. He\u2019d paid for it with his taxes. And what business was it of mine? For a minute I thought he was going to ask me if I liked hospital food. (I do.) In that hospital stay I gave up on education and plumped for action. If I stopped ordering my own meals, could I eat the ones he ordered and left untouched? It was a deal. When I was discharged, I had an epiphany. All around me were versions of my ward mate, coming out of shops with on-the-go edibles, and discarding them after a few bites or gulps. The Gutter Gourmet was loosed upon the world. I was diagnosed with diabetes on my 40th birthday. I tried to remedy the situation. I went jogging. I put vegetables in my morning porridge instead of sugar. Carrots. Broad beans. Spring onions. Broccoli. Kale. Spinach. If you persevere, they say your taste buds get used to anything. Mine refused to cast off the memory of crunchy brown sugar melting on hot oats. Every morning I fought the battle anew, and often lost. I diligently swallowed the pills \u2013 Metformin, Levothyroxine, Simvastatin \u2013 and jabbed myself with insulin twice a day. What I needed was an injection of willpower. The iron resolve I woke up with to keep all those satanic carbohydrates and sugary treats behind me always seemed to evaporate by mid-afternoon, usually just as the refreshment trolley arrived at work. What harm can one more toffee-coated flapjack do? Quite a lot, it turned out. Since the onset of diabetes, my compromised immune system has got me into one mess after another. The steady gain of bodily fat decommissioned my number one defence against diabetes \u2013 exercise \u2013 and weaponised its severity. In the past decade I have clocked up five bouts of pneumonia; recurrent raging episodes of cellulitis (a deep-tissue bacterial infection you can see racing up your legs); ulcerated shins; a general vulnerability to every opportunistic infection going; and intermittent erectile dysfunction. A bloodstream full of sugar, as the top lung professor in my hospital trust put it, is a chemsex orgy venue for microbes. Then my GP weighed in. Unless I pulled my socks up, he warned, eyesight-robbing retinopathy, or peripheral artery disease leading to lower limb amputation, could be just around the corner. It wasn\u2019t an idle threat \u2013 there are about 7,000 lower-limb amputations in the UK each year. I recalled visiting a friend who\u2019d lost a leg in a car accident, years ago. The woman in the next bed on the amputation ward had diabetes. \u201cMy doctor told me I had a choice,\u201d she cheerily informed me. \u201cEither the chocolate goes or a leg goes. And I couldn\u2019t give up my Cadbury\u2019s.\u201d If I\u2019d known as a child that my passion for Cadbury\u2019s, and fry-ups and bakeries and condiments and cakes and puddings, would decades later have me hooked up to IV drips and emergency antibiotics, would it have made any difference? Probably not. I am a child of the obesogenic revolution. Of course, they didn\u2019t call it obesogenic back in the early 70s. We still had early closing, shops were shut on Sunday, and you couldn\u2019t order so much as a pizza to be delivered. But our local high streets were changing. In my part of south London, there was always a Wimpy bar or a greasy spoon caff around the corner. The era of the microwave turned every corner shop into a takeaway. Vesta curries, Findus pancakes, Angel Delight for afters. Baby food for grown-ups, as we lounged in front of the TV. The first layers of fat that would eventually entomb my pancreas and degrade its production of insulin \u2013 the hormone that breaks down glucose into energy in the cells \u2013 were being laid down. I am one of two and a half million people in the UK who would suffer. Boyd Swinburn, the New Zealand public health expert who gave the world the term \u201cobesogenic environment\u201d, concluded that the problem is not driven by greed or abnormal appetites, but is a normal response to abnormal environments \u2013 encapsulated by the conditions he felt were responsible for the high rates of diabetes and obesity in the Arizona reservations of the Native American Pima people, whom he studied in the late 1980s. My NHS dietician says Swinburn would have recognised similar issues in the south London I grew up in: the aggressive promotion of energy-dense but nutrient-light foods; the beginning of a discount, \u201cbogof\u201d (buy one get one free) checkout culture encouraging you to buy more than you need; high-street domination by takeaways and (relatively) fast food outlets; the ascendancy of sedentary screentime over outdoor exercise. Although it is estimated that 60% of adults in England are now obese or overweight, we are not actually consuming more calories than we were back in the mid-70s. Indeed, there is evidence that sugar consumption is actually falling. It\u2019s the food we eat that\u2019s different.

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://londoncoliseum.org/whats-on/le-corsaire/\" title=\"\">Le Corsaire</a></strong> is a 19th-century fever dream based on a Byron poem, in which Conrad the lovestruck pirate saves a girl, Medora, from a leering pasha and various pimps and traffickers. Inspired by Victorian orientalist oil paintings, the setting is knowingly overblown: no minaret, souk, bazaar, temple, grotto, nomad\u2019s tent or Taj Mahal-style palace goes unreferenced.</p> <p>English National Ballet\u2019s revival succeeds through sheer choreographic bravura. This is not dance as story or psychology, but dance as feat, as endurance, as a throwing down of the gauntlet. The men are more airborne than earthbound, the Olympian height of their leaps and turns augmented by astounding flourishes and combative kicks. And the women\u2019s choreography is no less demanding.</p> <p>It takes a strong performer to carve themselves out of this spectacle. Francesco Gabriele Frola as Conrad, though technically adept, is somehow too fine and prissy, too effortful and conscientious to really nail it as a pirate hero. The steely Erina Takahashi invests Medora with wonderful tonality: from a fearful victim to a tender and delighted lover in the second act\u2019s famous <em>pas d\u2019action</em> \u2013 a curious balletic threesome between Conrad, his servant and Medora \u2013 which segues into a lovely, prolonged pre-coital duet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It couldn\u2019t have been more full-on if they had actually pumped incense into the theatre</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the fierce pageantry defies belief, flouts gravity and laughs at fatigue, it\u2019s also a lonely business. The principals perform to the audience, not to each other, and much character and psychology get shucked off in the process. Overall it was three American dancers who stamped their mark: <a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/people/brooklyn-mack/\" title=\"\">Brooklyn Mack</a>, swaggering and frightening as the slave trader Lankendem, <a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/people/jeffrey-cirio/\" title=\"\">Jeffrey Cirio</a> as Conrad\u2019s lithe, puckish servant Ali, and the hugely charismatic <a href=\"https://www.ballet.org.uk/people/precious-adams/\" title=\"\">Precious Adams</a>, seen only briefly, her feet delicately flickering and weightless.</p> <p>Despite being rooted in the ethnocentric fantasies of the 19th century, the production carries a pleasing whiff of the baroque era, cut through with sweat and rot, sexploitation and corruption.

      "bodyText": "Le Corsaire is a 19th-century fever dream based on a Byron poem, in which Conrad the lovestruck pirate saves a girl, Medora, from a leering pasha and various pimps and traffickers. Inspired by Victorian orientalist oil paintings, the setting is knowingly overblown: no minaret, souk, bazaar, temple, grotto, nomad\u2019s tent or Taj Mahal-style palace goes unreferenced. English National Ballet\u2019s revival succeeds through sheer choreographic bravura. This is not dance as story or psychology, but dance as feat, as endurance, as a throwing down of the gauntlet. The men are more airborne than earthbound, the Olympian height of their leaps and turns augmented by astounding flourishes and combative kicks. And the women\u2019s choreography is no less demanding. It takes a strong performer to carve themselves out of this spectacle. Francesco Gabriele Frola as Conrad, though technically adept, is somehow too fine and prissy, too effortful and conscientious to really nail it as a pirate hero. The steely Erina Takahashi invests Medora with wonderful tonality: from a fearful victim to a tender and delighted lover in the second act\u2019s famous pas d\u2019action \u2013 a curious balletic threesome between Conrad, his servant and Medora \u2013 which segues into a lovely, prolonged pre-coital duet. While the fierce pageantry defies belief, flouts gravity and laughs at fatigue, it\u2019s also a lonely business. The principals perform to the audience, not to each other, and much character and psychology get shucked off in the process. Overall it was three American dancers who stamped their mark: Brooklyn Mack, swaggering and frightening as the slave trader Lankendem, Jeffrey Cirio as Conrad\u2019s lithe, puckish servant Ali, and the hugely charismatic Precious Adams, seen only briefly, her feet delicately flickering and weightless. Despite being rooted in the ethnocentric fantasies of the 19th century, the production carries a pleasing whiff of the baroque era, cut through with sweat and rot, sexploitation and corruption. No single part of the choreography, costuming, set or score (by Adolphe Adam, with additional music by nine other composers) is without embellishment. It couldn\u2019t have been more full-on if they had actually pumped incense into the theatre. Yet, perhaps through sheer audacity, it\u2019s a ridiculously entertaining spectacle.

      "body": "<p>Even if you\u2019re one of the most promising young racing drivers of your era, you still have to take your driving test. Shortly after she turned 17, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/w-series-jamie-chadwick-f1-brands-hatch-motor-sport\" title=\"\">Jamie Chadwick</a> thought she\u2019d better get on with it. She had been driving competitively since she first raced a go-kart, when she was 11. \u201cObviously I knew how to drive a car,\u201d she says. \u201cBut driving on roads, knowing everything about road driving, is very different.\u201d She\u2019d planned to have lessons, but only managed \u201csort of one and a half\u201d before a cancellation meant she had a chance to take the test. \u201cI was, like, I\u2019ll just do it and if I fail, I might never live it down, but I just have to give it a go.\u201d To her great relief, she passed. \u201c<em>Somehow</em>. But I was never taught to park, so I still can\u2019t. Then I found myself as designated driver and I was, like, this isn\u2019t worth it either.\u201d She laughs. \u201cSo a lot of regret in that whole situation.\u201d</p> <p>Chadwick might not be able to park, but in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\" title=\"\">Formula 1</a>, she\u2019s not going to need to. If all goes to plan, that is exactly where she\u2019ll end up, breaking a 43-year dry spell for women on the starting grid. Last year, she won the inaugural <a href=\"https://wseries.com/\" title=\"\">W Series</a>, an all-female championship that ended at Brands Hatch in August. She is gathering firsts at quite a rate: at 17, she was the first woman and youngest driver to win the <a href=\"https://www.britishgt.com/\" title=\"\">British GT Championship</a>. In 2018, she became the first woman to win a British F3 race. Last February, she became the first female winner of the <a href=\"https://www.mrfracing.in/racing\" title=\"\">MRF Challenge</a> series in Chennai. She is competing now in the <a href=\"http://www.f3asia.com/\" title=\"\">Asian F3 Championship</a>.</p> <p>We meet at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/williams\" title=\"\">Williams</a> racing team\u2019s HQ, in the Oxfordshire countryside. Impressed by her considerable achievements so far, Williams took her on as a development driver at the beginning of 2019. It is a legitimate pathway to Formula 1 and they will train her for the job \u2013 she immerses herself with the team, goes to race weekends and learns from existing drivers and engineers, in preparation for the new, unfamiliar racing environment. </p> <p>She looks like a typical 21-year-old, in ripped jeans, a white sweatshirt and crisp Stan Smiths, clutching her phone. Though she makes light of them, she is serious about her ambitions and very aware she is trying to make history. History is, in fact, all around us. We\u2019re sitting in Williams\u2019 onsite museum, surrounded by racing cars from across the eras. As we drink tea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/15/nigel-mansell-silverstone-f1-1992-win-world-title-williams\" title=\"\">Nigel Mansell</a>\u2019s eyebrows are poking up from behind an old FW14B racing car, watching over us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2b205e4ed2b4901194bf2210016411eb8c87fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2b205e4ed2b4901194bf2210016411eb8c87fbf/0_388_2730_2992/912.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Chadwick in her racing gear and cap, smiling broadly as she opens a bottle of Champagne, spraying its contents, after winning the inaugural W Series.\" width=\"912\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m at an advantage, because you need to be light\u2019: winning the inaugural W Series in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This has been a huge year for Chadwick \u2013 and the attention has taken her by surprise. \u201cNow it\u2019s a weird sort of comedown.\u201d She walked away with $500,000 prize money after winning the W Series (almost all of it will be ploughed back into her career). The series attracted far more notice than any of its participants expected. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of unheard of in motorsport at that level,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Partly, she puts that interest down to a growing appetite for women competing in sport in general. In football, the success of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/womens-world-cup-2019\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s World Cup </a>has seen attendance records smashed for the Women\u2019s Super League this year, and the W Series was shown on Channel 4. \u201cEveryone\u2019s getting behind it,\u201d she says, of female sport. But Chadwick wants to succeed as a driver, not a <em>female</em> driver, and is aware that people were sceptical when the series was first announced. Why segregate by gender, when the goal is to see women and men racing on an equal footing?</p> <p>\u201cI think if you put it like that, it doesn\u2019t appeal to any of the drivers who ended up doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy initial thought process was, \u2018If I\u2019m raising X amount of sponsorship to do this, why would I put it into something that might not be so competitive?\u2019\u201d Then she met the people who founded it, talked to those close to her and realised that the W Series was significantly funded, gave young female drivers the chance to drive cars they might not otherwise have had access to and, crucially, allowed participants to amass super licence points, which are necessary to progress to Formula 1.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I want to do it on merit, not because I\u2019m a token female racing driver</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe finance of motorsport is the biggest barrier for pretty much all young drivers, and specifically the many girls coming through,\u201d she says. The W Series tries to level the playing field. \u201cIt allows talent to prevail and puts female drivers in and around the junior ranks to be given a greater opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>The amount of money involved in motorsports is staggering, even at junior levels. \u201cIf I explain it to you, you would just think we\u2019re all mad, in terms of, why would anyone spend that kind of money to go racing?\u201d she says.</p> <p>Financial backing is crucial for success, so any attention the drivers receive is likely to be beneficial in terms of attracting sponsors and investors. Chadwick is becoming a name known outside of what she likes to call the \u201clittle bubble\u201d or \u201clittle world\u201d of motorsports. \u201cBut I\u2019m blissfully oblivious to a lot of that stuff, which is probably a good thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIf anything, it makes me more motivated. I now feel like I\u2019ve been given an opportunity greater than I\u2019ve ever had in my career, and I want to use that, take it with both hands. If I can blank everything else out, then that\u2019s going to be a good thing.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Chadwick was born </strong></em>in Bath and spent some of her childhood in the Isle of Man, where the TT motorcycle races \u201cmight have subconsciously ignited something. My perception of speed must have changed after seeing that.\u201d Her parents work in finance and property, and are not in the motor racing world. \u201cSo they see it for what it is, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d Her older brother, Oliver, started go-karting and Chadwick, always competitive, tagged along. \u201cI was 11 or 12, so relatively late,\u201d she explains. Usually professional drivers have been karting since six or seven, in vehicles that go up to 60mph. Chadwick drove go-karts for fun, and had no notion it might be a career. But her natural ambition intervened. \u201cI think I drove my brother\u2019s kart, which was slightly higher performance,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIf I was running in athletics, I wouldn\u2019t suddenly find four or five seconds each lap, but in a go-kart, I could. I fell in love.\u201d</p> <p>Her brother stopped racing when it became apparent it wouldn\u2019t be a career for him and he now runs his own business. But when he did drive competitively there was a year when brother and sister raced in the same series. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get on,\u201d she laughs. \u201cMy poor parents. They had to drive us everywhere, and it was always a two or three-hour drive. If it was a good weekend, great, but if it was a bad weekend, just\u2026 hell.\u201d</p> <p>Presumably, a good weekend for one of them might have meant a bad one for the other? \u201cExactly! Yeah. We clashed a lot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7806190f2bf7eeb36a27a91235457a05c3e9a868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7806190f2bf7eeb36a27a91235457a05c3e9a868/231_413_2988_1793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman driving a racing car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early pioneer: Maria Teresa de Filippis in 1959.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Klemantaski Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chadwick is often asked how her parents feel about the dangers of her sport. We meet a few days after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/31/spa-f2-race-abandoned-antoine-hubert-juan-manuel-correa-crash\" title=\"\">Anthoine Hubert</a> was killed in a horrifying Formula 2 crash during the Belgian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton paid tribute to Hubert with a reminder of the dangers of what they do. \u201cIf a single one of you watching thinks for a second what we do is safe, you\u2019re hugely mistaken,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy compassion obviously goes straight to the driver,\u201d says Chadwick, carefully. \u201cOur world is extremely competitive, but when you see something like this, you really do see our community coming together.\u201d She insists the sport is getting safer, that accidents are rare and unlikely. \u201cBut you know the risks, you know these things can happen, and you know that every race you have, that\u2019s just the way it is. It\u2019s unlikely, but these things do happen.\u201d</p> <p>Chadwick has always been sporty and always loved a thrill. She went to Cheltenham College, an independent boarding school, though she would go home at weekends. She turned down trials for the England under-18 hockey squad to compete at the Ginetta Junior scholarship weekend \u2013 a fund for budding racing drivers offered by the British racing and sports car builder. (She won the scholarship.) She\u2019s a keen skiier \u2013 as children, she and her brother would race each other at top speed on the slopes. \u201cIf it all stopped today, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d get that fix of adrenaline.\u201d</p> <p>But it doesn\u2019t look as if it\u2019s going to stop any time soon. Chadwick has an intensive fitness training regime, most of which centres around building her core strength and upper body. \u201cThe G-forces your body goes through when you\u2019re in a Formula 1 car, or any single-seater, is huge, and that puts a lot of strain on your neck. Going up the ranks, you don\u2019t have power steering. You have to be mentally fit so you don\u2019t get to that point of fatigue.\u201d The physical training for driving is more complex than many realise. \u201cA lot of people say, women can definitely race in Formula 1 because it\u2019s not a physical sport. Well, it <em>is</em> a physical sport, but I think it\u2019s a level that women can get to.\u201d</p> <p>Motor racing remains male-dominated, particularly when it comes to the higher echelons. In 1958, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,1720870,00.html\" title=\"\">Maria Teresa de </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/observer/osm/story/0,,1720870,00.html\" title=\"\">Filippis</a> became the first woman to compete in a Formula 1 race. She told the <em>Observer</em> in 2006 that she stopped racing \u201cbecause too many friends had died\u201d. In the 1970s, Lella Lombardi raced for a number of teams. But since Lombardi, there have been no women on an F1 starting grid. Chadwick says that physical strength is only a small part of that. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m at an advantage, because you need to be quite light,\u201d she counters. She is short and compact \u2013 she shows me that her neck is getting thicker from the training. She mentions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/04/susie-wolff-quits-f1-dream-williams\" title=\"\">Susie Wolff</a>, who also worked as a development driver for Williams, but retired in 2015. \u201cWhen she stopped racing, the circumference of her neck shrank by a crazy amount. She said loads of her clothes didn\u2019t fit her any more.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d64beff3dc0e58ecf07e56587037515c02531cbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d64beff3dc0e58ecf07e56587037515c02531cbf/201_348_3155_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A purple racing car with green markings and 'Chadwick' written on the side, on a race track\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revved up: Chadwick heads down a straight in the W Series Misano race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirco Lazzari/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The goal for Chadwick is Formula 1. \u201cIt always has been, but now it\u2019s a little more realistic than it was a year or two ago.\u201d When she was 14 or 15, she remembers realising that driving wasn\u2019t just a hobby, or something she did for fun. \u201cAnd then when you think, I want to be a racing driver, you think, I want to race in Formula 1. But you say that, and you never actually think it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s still a mad thought, to think that one day it could be possible.\u201d</p> <p>The old racing cars in the museum are ghost-like around us. \u201cEven now, immersing myself with Williams, I still have pinch-me moments,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, yeah, it\u2019s the ultimate goal. I\u2019m under no illusions as to how tough it\u2019ll be to get there.\u201d She insists that, despite the attention 2019 brought, it is crucial for her to get there because she is the best at what she does. \u201cI want to do it on merit. I don\u2019t want to do it because I\u2019m a token female racing driver. I really feel that given the right opportunity and the right support, it is possible, not just for me, but for women, to race competitively in Formula 1. Ultimately, I want to be the one to prove that.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/14/female-f1-driver-bernie-ecclestone\" title=\"\">Bernie Ecclestone</a> caused a stink when he said women \u201cwouldn\u2019t be taken seriously\u201d as F1 drivers. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether a woman would physically be able to drive an F1 car quickly,\u201d he said. Chadwick is breezy when it comes to the topic. \u201cWhen I hear quotes like that, I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s telling <em>me</em>. It really doesn\u2019t seem to affect me.\u201d</p> <p>Chadwick is so cool and composed you can\u2019t help but believe her. \u201cThere are people who think, OK, you\u2019re good <em>for a girl</em>, but you might not necessarily make it to the top. I see it as motivation. I genuinely believe that it is possible and, if not me, there is a female out there who is definitely capable.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Right now, Chadwick\u2019s</strong></em> life is all racing. The W Series victory has left her with options on the table for 2020. She wants to get her F1 super licence points and to be racing as much as possible. \u201cUltimately, I want to find myself in a position where I can drive a Formula 1 car in two or three years.\u201d That leaves little space for a world outside of racing, though she seems perfectly happy for that to be the case at this stage.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, but it is quite hard to manage a social life and personal life, too.\u201d Her job means she works weekends. \u201cSuddenly, on a Tuesday night, I\u2019m like, who wants to hang out with me? Who wants to go out? My schedule fits in with no one else\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>As a child, Chadwick didn\u2019t follow motorsports. She didn\u2019t have posters on her wall. \u201cNow, on a daily basis, I meet people I\u2019m inspired by, but not so much when I was growing up. I just kind of did my own thing, I guess.\u201d Now, if all goes to plan, Jamie Chadwick might be that poster for someone else. \u201cIt\u2019s an added bonus,\u201d she smiles, though she\u2019s having none of it. \u201cBut what I\u2019m doing at the moment is just for me. I want to achieve what I want to achieve for me, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even if you\u2019re one of the most promising young racing drivers of your era, you still have to take your driving test. Shortly after she turned 17, Jamie Chadwick thought she\u2019d better get on with it. She had been driving competitively since she first raced a go-kart, when she was 11. \u201cObviously I knew how to drive a car,\u201d she says. \u201cBut driving on roads, knowing everything about road driving, is very different.\u201d She\u2019d planned to have lessons, but only managed \u201csort of one and a half\u201d before a cancellation meant she had a chance to take the test. \u201cI was, like, I\u2019ll just do it and if I fail, I might never live it down, but I just have to give it a go.\u201d To her great relief, she passed. \u201cSomehow. But I was never taught to park, so I still can\u2019t. Then I found myself as designated driver and I was, like, this isn\u2019t worth it either.\u201d She laughs. \u201cSo a lot of regret in that whole situation.\u201d Chadwick might not be able to park, but in Formula 1, she\u2019s not going to need to. If all goes to plan, that is exactly where she\u2019ll end up, breaking a 43-year dry spell for women on the starting grid. Last year, she won the inaugural W Series, an all-female championship that ended at Brands Hatch in August. She is gathering firsts at quite a rate: at 17, she was the first woman and youngest driver to win the British GT Championship. In 2018, she became the first woman to win a British F3 race. Last February, she became the first female winner of the MRF Challenge series in Chennai. She is competing now in the Asian F3 Championship. We meet at the Williams racing team\u2019s HQ, in the Oxfordshire countryside. Impressed by her considerable achievements so far, Williams took her on as a development driver at the beginning of 2019. It is a legitimate pathway to Formula 1 and they will train her for the job \u2013 she immerses herself with the team, goes to race weekends and learns from existing drivers and engineers, in preparation for the new, unfamiliar racing environment. She looks like a typical 21-year-old, in ripped jeans, a white sweatshirt and crisp Stan Smiths, clutching her phone. Though she makes light of them, she is serious about her ambitions and very aware she is trying to make history. History is, in fact, all around us. We\u2019re sitting in Williams\u2019 onsite museum, surrounded by racing cars from across the eras. As we drink tea, Nigel Mansell\u2019s eyebrows are poking up from behind an old FW14B racing car, watching over us. This has been a huge year for Chadwick \u2013 and the attention has taken her by surprise. \u201cNow it\u2019s a weird sort of comedown.\u201d She walked away with $500,000 prize money after winning the W Series (almost all of it will be ploughed back into her career). The series attracted far more notice than any of its participants expected. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of unheard of in motorsport at that level,\u201d she says. Partly, she puts that interest down to a growing appetite for women competing in sport in general. In football, the success of the Women\u2019s World Cup has seen attendance records smashed for the Women\u2019s Super League this year, and the W Series was shown on Channel 4. \u201cEveryone\u2019s getting behind it,\u201d she says, of female sport. But Chadwick wants to succeed as a driver, not a female driver, and is aware that people were sceptical when the series was first announced. Why segregate by gender, when the goal is to see women and men racing on an equal footing? \u201cI think if you put it like that, it doesn\u2019t appeal to any of the drivers who ended up doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cMy initial thought process was, \u2018If I\u2019m raising X amount of sponsorship to do this, why would I put it into something that might not be so competitive?\u2019\u201d Then she met the people who founded it, talked to those close to her and realised that the W Series was significantly funded, gave young female drivers the chance to drive cars they might not otherwise have had access to and, crucially, allowed participants to amass super licence points, which are necessary to progress to Formula 1. \u201cThe finance of motorsport is the biggest barrier for pretty much all young drivers, and specifically the many girls coming through,\u201d she says. The W Series tries to level the playing field. \u201cIt allows talent to prevail and puts female drivers in and around the junior ranks to be given a greater opportunity.\u201d The amount of money involved in motorsports is staggering, even at junior levels. \u201cIf I explain it to you, you would just think we\u2019re all mad, in terms of, why would anyone spend that kind of money to go racing?\u201d she says. Financial backing is crucial for success, so any attention the drivers receive is likely to be beneficial in terms of attracting sponsors and investors. Chadwick is becoming a name known outside of what she likes to call the \u201clittle bubble\u201d or \u201clittle world\u201d of motorsports. \u201cBut I\u2019m blissfully oblivious to a lot of that stuff, which is probably a good thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIf anything, it makes me more motivated. I now feel like I\u2019ve been given an opportunity greater than I\u2019ve ever had in my career, and I want to use that, take it with both hands. If I can blank everything else out, then that\u2019s going to be a good thing.\u201d Chadwick was born in Bath and spent some of her childhood in the Isle of Man, where the TT motorcycle races \u201cmight have subconsciously ignited something. My perception of speed must have changed after seeing that.\u201d Her parents work in finance and property, and are not in the motor racing world. \u201cSo they see it for what it is, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d Her older brother, Oliver, started go-karting and Chadwick, always competitive, tagged along. \u201cI was 11 or 12, so relatively late,\u201d she explains. Usually professional drivers have been karting since six or seven, in vehicles that go up to 60mph. Chadwick drove go-karts for fun, and had no notion it might be a career. But her natural ambition intervened. \u201cI think I drove my brother\u2019s kart, which was slightly higher performance,\u201d she smiles. \u201cIf I was running in athletics, I wouldn\u2019t suddenly find four or five seconds each lap, but in a go-kart, I could. I fell in love.\u201d Her brother stopped racing when it became apparent it wouldn\u2019t be a career for him and he now runs his own business. But when he did drive competitively there was a year when brother and sister raced in the same series. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get on,\u201d she laughs. \u201cMy poor parents. They had to drive us everywhere, and it was always a two or three-hour drive. If it was a good weekend, great, but if it was a bad weekend, just\u2026 hell.\u201d Presumably, a good weekend for one of them might have meant a bad one for the other? \u201cExactly! Yeah. We clashed a lot.\u201d Chadwick is often asked how her parents feel about the dangers of her sport. We meet a few days after Anthoine Hubert was killed in a horrifying Formula 2 crash during the Belgian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton paid tribute to Hubert with a reminder of the dangers of what they do. \u201cIf a single one of you watching thinks for a second what we do is safe, you\u2019re hugely mistaken,\u201d he said. \u201cMy compassion obviously goes straight to the driver,\u201d says Chadwick, carefully. \u201cOur world is extremely competitive, but when you see something like this, you really do see our community coming together.\u201d She insists the sport is getting safer, that accidents are rare and unlikely. \u201cBut you know the risks, you know these things can happen, and you know that every race you have, that\u2019s just the way it is. It\u2019s unlikely, but these things do happen.\u201d Chadwick has always been sporty and always loved a thrill. She went to Cheltenham College, an independent boarding school, though she would go home at weekends. She turned down trials for the England under-18 hockey squad to compete at the Ginetta Junior scholarship weekend \u2013 a fund for budding racing drivers offered by the British racing and sports car builder. (She won the scholarship.) She\u2019s a keen skiier \u2013 as children, she and her brother would race each other at top speed on the slopes. \u201cIf it all stopped today, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d get that fix of adrenaline.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t look as if it\u2019s going to stop any time soon. Chadwick has an intensive fitness training regime, most of which centres around building her core strength and upper body. \u201cThe G-forces your body goes through when you\u2019re in a Formula 1 car, or any single-seater, is huge, and that puts a lot of strain on your neck. Going up the ranks, you don\u2019t have power steering. You have to be mentally fit so you don\u2019t get to that point of fatigue.\u201d The physical training for driving is more complex than many realise. \u201cA lot of people say, women can definitely race in Formula 1 because it\u2019s not a physical sport. Well, it is a physical sport, but I think it\u2019s a level that women can get to.\u201d Motor racing remains male-dominated, particularly when it comes to the higher echelons. In 1958, Maria Teresa de Filippis became the first woman to compete in a Formula 1 race. She told the Observer in 2006 that she stopped racing \u201cbecause too many friends had died\u201d. In the 1970s, Lella Lombardi raced for a number of teams. But since Lombardi, there have been no women on an F1 starting grid. Chadwick says that physical strength is only a small part of that. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m at an advantage, because you need to be quite light,\u201d she counters. She is short and compact \u2013 she shows me that her neck is getting thicker from the training. She mentions Susie Wolff, who also worked as a development driver for Williams, but retired in 2015. \u201cWhen she stopped racing, the circumference of her neck shrank by a crazy amount. She said loads of her clothes didn\u2019t fit her any more.\u201d The goal for Chadwick is Formula 1. \u201cIt always has been, but now it\u2019s a little more realistic than it was a year or two ago.\u201d When she was 14 or 15, she remembers realising that driving wasn\u2019t just a hobby, or something she did for fun. \u201cAnd then when you think, I want to be a racing driver, you think, I want to race in Formula 1. But you say that, and you never actually think it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s still a mad thought, to think that one day it could be possible.\u201d The old racing cars in the museum are ghost-like around us. \u201cEven now, immersing myself with Williams, I still have pinch-me moments,\u201d she says. \u201cBut, yeah, it\u2019s the ultimate goal. I\u2019m under no illusions as to how tough it\u2019ll be to get there.\u201d She insists that, despite the attention 2019 brought, it is crucial for her to get there because she is the best at what she does. \u201cI want to do it on merit. I don\u2019t want to do it because I\u2019m a token female racing driver. I really feel that given the right opportunity and the right support, it is possible, not just for me, but for women, to race competitively in Formula 1. Ultimately, I want to be the one to prove that.\u201d In 2016, Bernie Ecclestone caused a stink when he said women \u201cwouldn\u2019t be taken seriously\u201d as F1 drivers. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether a woman would physically be able to drive an F1 car quickly,\u201d he said. Chadwick is breezy when it comes to the topic. \u201cWhen I hear quotes like that, I don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s telling me. It really doesn\u2019t seem to affect me.\u201d Chadwick is so cool and composed you can\u2019t help but believe her. \u201cThere are people who think, OK, you\u2019re good for a girl, but you might not necessarily make it to the top. I see it as motivation. I genuinely believe that it is possible and, if not me, there is a female out there who is definitely capable.\u201d Right now, Chadwick\u2019s life is all racing. The W Series victory has left her with options on the table for 2020. She wants to get her F1 super licence points and to be racing as much as possible. \u201cUltimately, I want to find myself in a position where I can drive a Formula 1 car in two or three years.\u201d That leaves little space for a world outside of racing, though she seems perfectly happy for that to be the case at this stage. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, but it is quite hard to manage a social life and personal life, too.\u201d Her job means she works weekends. \u201cSuddenly, on a Tuesday night, I\u2019m like, who wants to hang out with me? Who wants to go out? My schedule fits in with no one else\u2019s.\u201d As a child, Chadwick didn\u2019t follow motorsports. She didn\u2019t have posters on her wall. \u201cNow, on a daily basis, I meet people I\u2019m inspired by, but not so much when I was growing up. I just kind of did my own thing, I guess.\u201d Now, if all goes to plan, Jamie Chadwick might be that poster for someone else. \u201cIt\u2019s an added bonus,\u201d she smiles, though she\u2019s having none of it. \u201cBut what I\u2019m doing at the moment is just for me. I want to achieve what I want to achieve for me, and that\u2019s it.\u201d",

In March 2007, after Giuliani formally announced his White House campaign, he was the early favorite to win the Republican primary contest, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/26803/giuliani-solidifies-lead-republican-nomination-poll.aspx\">with 44% support</a> nationwide.

Oprah Winfrey had dubbed Giuliani \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d following the 9/11 attacks \u2013 a moniker that stuck \u2013 while Time magazine went further, <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20011231,00.html\">naming Giuliani</a> its person of the year for 2001 and branding him <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2020227_2020306_2022358,00.html\">\u201cmayor of the world\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Cafaro said: \u201cHis strength predominantly came from being seen as America\u2019s mayor \u2013 in light of this being just a few years after 9/11.

But he hit an unexpected problem, in the form of a man dressed in a chicken suit \u2013 the \u201cIowa Chicken\u201d \u2013 who <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070624092238/http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/24280\">tirelessly followed</a> Giuliani around in protest at him skipping the Ames straw poll, a traditional barometer of the Republican primary race.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t the end of Giuliani\u2019s Iowa troubles. He decided, essentially, to skip the first state to vote and did not place much stock in second-to-vote New Hampshire.

      "bodyText": "If things had gone a little differently, Rudy Giuliani might have been elected president in 2008. The former New York City mayor turned Donald Trump stooge led polling in the Republican primaries for almost a year, and was seen as someone who could defeat Hillary Clinton \u2013 then the presumptive Democratic nominee \u2013 in key metropolitan areas. Giuliani, still riding a wave of good feeling from his handling of the 9/11 attacks, was raising serious amounts of cash, and was the best-known of the Republican candidates. He had a very real chance of succeeding George W Bush. But Giuliani\u2019s campaign collapsed in chaotic fashion, and he became a political irrelevance \u2013 until re-emerging a decade later as Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer, mouthpiece, bungling envoy to Ukraine and a central character in the third impeachment of an American president. It\u2019s hard to imagine now, but at the end of 2006, Giuliani was the most popular politician in the country. In March 2007, after Giuliani formally announced his White House campaign, he was the early favorite to win the Republican primary contest, with 44% support nationwide. (John McCain, the eventual nominee, was second with 20%.) Giuliani maintained that lead throughout the year, and raised the most money. Armed with a campaign slogan that read like the responses to a word-association examination \u2013 \u201cTested. Ready. Now\u201d \u2013 Giuliani seemed destined to represent the Republican party in the November 2008 election. \u201cWhen Rudy Giuliani entered the race he was seen as the frontrunner,\u201d said Capri Cafaro, a former minority leader of the Ohio senate and an adjunct professor at the American University school of public affairs. Oprah Winfrey had dubbed Giuliani \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d following the 9/11 attacks \u2013 a moniker that stuck \u2013 while Time magazine went further, naming Giuliani its person of the year for 2001 and branding him \u201cmayor of the world\u201d. Cafaro said: \u201cHis strength predominantly came from being seen as America\u2019s mayor \u2013 in light of this being just a few years after 9/11. [He was] playing to his strengths: his strengths in national security and essentially being able to rise to the occasion as a leader.\u201d Giuliani wasn\u2019t shy of leaning into that, which led to mockery as he launched his campaign. \u201cWhen he decided to run for president he was being laughed at by the late-night comedians for answering every question by mentioning 9/11,\u201d said Robert Polner, who covered Giuliani\u2019s mayoralty as a reporter for Newsday, and later edited a book on Giuliani: America\u2019s Mayor, America\u2019s President? It wasn\u2019t just late-night comics poking fun. Joe Biden, then running \u2013 for the second time \u2013 to be the Democratic nominee, mused of Giuliani: \u201cThere\u2019s only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb and 9/11.\u201d The Onion ran a piece with the headline: \u201cGiuliani to run for president of 9/11\u201d. \u201cHe was still trying to ride his fame and convert that into primary votes,\u201d Polner said. \u201c[But] he had no real plan as to what he would do if he was president.\u201d Giuliani was still leading the polls in the summer of 2007, six months out from the first Republican vote in Iowa. But he hit an unexpected problem, in the form of a man dressed in a chicken suit \u2013 the \u201cIowa Chicken\u201d \u2013 who tirelessly followed Giuliani around in protest at him skipping the Ames straw poll, a traditional barometer of the Republican primary race. That wasn\u2019t the end of Giuliani\u2019s Iowa troubles. He decided, essentially, to skip the first state to vote and did not place much stock in second-to-vote New Hampshire. Instead Giuliani pinned his hopes on Florida. Many people saw this as a bad decision, including the Guardian\u2019s then Washington correspondent, Ewen MacAskill. \u201cHistory will show the unconventional, and ultimately catastrophic, strategy to be one of the biggest miscalculations in US campaign history,\u201d MacAskill wrote in 2008, as Giuliani\u2019s campaign collapsed around him. \u201cOne that has brought Giuliani\u2019s ambitions to be the 44th US president to a humiliating end.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s Florida gameplan was based on the idea that for some Republicans elsewhere, he just wasn\u2019t conservative enough.

      "body": "<p>For Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean, it\u2019s been a struggle to keep their feet on the ground after rowing in record-breaking time across the Atlantic. \u201cWhen I went to sleep last night, I thought I\u2019d wake up on the boat with the alarm going off, and someone screaming \u2018to port, to port\u2019,\u201d said Jamie.</p> <p>For their parents, Sheila and Charlie, the brothers\u2019 arrival in Antigua on Thursday must have come as a relief. Their only children, aged 27, 26 and 21 respectively, have just spent 35 days, nine hours and nine minutes in a 28ft boat, travelling 2,720 nautical miles from the Canaries in the <a href=\"https://www.taliskerwhiskyatlanticchallenge.com/\" title=\"\">Talisker Atlantic Challenge</a>.</p> <p>They came third, breaking the record for three rowers by six days, and in the process becoming the first three brothers, and the youngest trio, to make the trip. \u201cI wonder how their mother feels,\u201d said Kelly Carmichael, mother of another competitor in a Royal Navy team the MacLeans beat to the finish line. Sheila, who was helping to tidy up the boat on Friday, laughed it off: \u201cI had such a quiet Christmas; I want them to go out into the mid-Atlantic every year.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers\u2019 boat, Broar, was loudly welcomed into the dour 18th-century surroundings of Nelson\u2019s Dockyard, Antigua by a set of very modern hornblowers, a line of super-yachts at anchor.</p> <p>By the standards of the race, the MacLeans had it relatively easy. Fortitude IV, the British foursome who won the race, had capsized stern over bow and rolled during the crossing, which one of the team described as \u201cstartling\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile Sam Coxon, who was on Ocean5, the boat that arrived 10 hours behind the MacLeans, stepped on to the wharf with a long-harboured plan to go down on one knee to his girlfriend Natasha, only to find he couldn\u2019t, because, he said, \u201cmy knees were so wobbly\u201d. He proposed anyway.</p> <p>Rowing the Atlantic is increasingly popular, although fewer people have made the crossing than have climbed Everest. Thirty five boats competed this time.</p> <p>The brothers, who grew up in Edinburgh, spent their summers in Sutherland in the far north of Scotland. Jamie plays the bagpipes, Ewan the guitar and Lachlan an accordion, and they\u2019re a striking lot, with sun-bleached hair and green eyes.</p> <p>The challenge was Lachlan\u2019s idea, with Jamie first on board. \u201cThen Ewan was like, \u2018Lads, what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m not going to be able to live through any future family Christmases if you guys do this and I\u2019m the odd one out,\u2019\u201d said Jamie.</p> <p>Nine out of 10 teams that register for the race don\u2019t make it to the starting line. \u201cIt costs around \u00a3120,000,\u201d said Lachlan. \u201cTo raise that sort of money when we are two students and one young professional, it\u2019s quite a challenge.\u201d They are also raising money for the charities Feedback Madagascar and Children First.</p> <p>They found sponsors and bought a secondhand boat and patched it up.\u201cWe spent so much time working on the boat that we knew the whole thing inside out,\u201d said Ewan.</p> <p>The Dyson design engineer believes this gave them an edge. He made innovations: a streamlined keel, lighter bedding made by his mother. \u201cBeing brothers was hands down the biggest advantage though,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cWe get on so well.\u201d When the cables for their iPhones didn\u2019t stand up to the conditions, they couldn\u2019t listen to music or podcasts. \u201cThat was a big thing because it meant we talked,\u201d said Lachlan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"660db779dff50da0617b586bdb4125dea5c12d34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/660db779dff50da0617b586bdb4125dea5c12d34/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The brothers celebrate their achievement on arrival in Antigua.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The brothers celebrate their achievement on arrival in Antigua.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Atlantic Campaigns/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe had some great conversations,\u201d said Jamie, as Lachlan added: \u201cWe talked about everything, from our childhood, through to our projects, to the future.\u201d Ewan then interjected. \u201cOur life plans.\u201d</p> <p>Lachlan is studying philosophy at the University of Glasgow, while Jamie studies architecture at Glasgow School of Art, although this experience may take them in new directions. They agree they will definitely do something else together.</p> <p>Often long-distance rowers fall out, forced to fury by the confined space. \u201cOur fall-outs only occurred when there was an accusation of someone eating more than their fair share of porridge,\u201d said Lachlan. Jamie is currently the chief suspect: \u201cI\u2019m the one who has lost the least amount of weight.\u201d</p> <p>The welcome they received came as a shock. They believed they had travelled so fast their family wouldn\u2019t make it on time, and that no one would be waiting. \u201cEwan and I were rowing,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p> <p>When the horns began to sound on the yachts in the harbour, Jamie and Ewan started asking Lachlan what was going on. \u201cAnd then mum popped up beside us,\u201d said Ewan. \u201cShe\u2019d managed to get a lift on a local\u2019s rib.\u201d</p> <p>They celebrated their record breaking arrival by eating \u2013 a lot. \u201cWe made a stack of blueberry pancakes and streaky bacon and maple syrup with loads of peanut butter and apple,\u201d said Ewan. Because of the training, it\u2019s been three and a half months since any of them have had a drink. \u201cThat\u2019s going to change tomorrow,\u201d said Lachlan.</p> <p>\u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 20 January 2020 because an earlier version referred to Lachlan trio when MacLean trio was meant.</p>",

Their only children, aged 27, 26 and 21 respectively, have just spent 35 days, nine hours and nine minutes in a 28ft boat, travelling 2,720 nautical miles from the Canaries in the Talisker Atlantic Challenge. They came third, breaking the record for three rowers by six days, and in the process becoming the first three brothers, and the youngest trio, to make the trip. \u201cI wonder how their mother feels,\u201d said Kelly Carmichael, mother of another competitor in a Royal Navy team the MacLeans beat to the finish line. Sheila, who was helping to tidy up the boat on Friday, laughed it off: \u201cI had such a quiet Christmas; I want them to go out into the mid-Atlantic every year.\u201d The brothers\u2019 boat, Broar, was loudly welcomed into the dour 18th-century surroundings of Nelson\u2019s Dockyard, Antigua by a set of very modern hornblowers, a line of super-yachts at anchor. By the standards of the race, the MacLeans had it relatively easy. Fortitude IV, the British foursome who won the race, had capsized stern over bow and rolled during the crossing, which one of the team described as \u201cstartling\u201d. Meanwhile Sam Coxon, who was on Ocean5, the boat that arrived 10 hours behind the MacLeans, stepped on to the wharf with a long-harboured plan to go down on one knee to his girlfriend Natasha, only to find he couldn\u2019t, because, he said, \u201cmy knees were so wobbly\u201d. He proposed anyway. Rowing the Atlantic is increasingly popular, although fewer people have made the crossing than have climbed Everest. Thirty five boats competed this time. The brothers, who grew up in Edinburgh, spent their summers in Sutherland in the far north of Scotland. Jamie plays the bagpipes, Ewan the guitar and Lachlan an accordion, and they\u2019re a striking lot, with sun-bleached hair and green eyes. The challenge was Lachlan\u2019s idea, with Jamie first on board. \u201cThen Ewan was like, \u2018Lads, what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m not going to be able to live through any future family Christmases if you guys do this and I\u2019m the odd one out,\u2019\u201d said Jamie. Nine out of 10 teams that register for the race don\u2019t make it to the starting line. \u201cIt costs around \u00a3120,000,\u201d said Lachlan. \u201cTo raise that sort of money when we are two students and one young professional, it\u2019s quite a challenge.\u201d They are also raising money for the charities Feedback Madagascar and Children First. They found sponsors and bought a secondhand boat and patched it up.\u201cWe spent so much time working on the boat that we knew the whole thing inside out,\u201d said Ewan. The Dyson design engineer believes this gave them an edge. He made innovations: a streamlined keel, lighter bedding made by his mother. \u201cBeing brothers was hands down the biggest advantage though,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cWe get on so well.\u201d When the cables for their iPhones didn\u2019t stand up to the conditions, they couldn\u2019t listen to music or podcasts. \u201cThat was a big thing because it meant we talked,\u201d said Lachlan. \u201cWe had some great conversations,\u201d said Jamie, as Lachlan added: \u201cWe talked about everything, from our childhood, through to our projects, to the future.\u201d Ewan then interjected. \u201cOur life plans.\u201d Lachlan is studying philosophy at the University of Glasgow, while Jamie studies architecture at Glasgow School of Art, although this experience may take them in new directions. They agree they will definitely do something else together. Often long-distance rowers fall out, forced to fury by the confined space. \u201cOur fall-outs only occurred when there was an accusation of someone eating more than their fair share of porridge,\u201d said Lachlan. Jamie is currently the chief suspect: \u201cI\u2019m the one who has lost the least amount of weight.\u201d The welcome they received came as a shock. They believed they had travelled so fast their family wouldn\u2019t make it on time, and that no one would be waiting. \u201cEwan and I were rowing,\u201d said Jamie. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201d When the horns began to sound on the yachts in the harbour, Jamie and Ewan started asking Lachlan what was going on. \u201cAnd then mum popped up beside us,\u201d said Ewan. \u201cShe\u2019d managed to get a lift on a local\u2019s rib.\u201d They celebrated their record breaking arrival by eating \u2013 a lot. \u201cWe made a stack of blueberry pancakes and streaky bacon and maple syrup with loads of peanut butter and apple,\u201d said Ewan. Because of the training, it\u2019s been three and a half months since any of them have had a drink. \u201cThat\u2019s going to change tomorrow,\u201d said Lachlan. \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 20 January 2020 because an earlier version referred to Lachlan trio when MacLean trio was meant.",

That\u2019s the takeaway from <em>Mind Games</em>, a new book by Annie Vernon, best known at the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> for a short work placement she did here in 2015, though in the wider world she perhaps has greater fame as a world champion rower who won a silver medal at the 2008 Olympics.</p> <p><em>Mind Games</em> sets out to unpick what it is about top\u2011level athletes that makes them different. For Vernon it\u2019s mostly mental. \u201cYou have to be unbelievably, ruthlessly, exceptionally driven,\u201d she writes. It\u2019s the difference between chickens, which is to say most of us, and pigs, who are rare sorts like Vernon. \u201cThink about a plate of bacon and eggs,\u201d she continues, \u201cas the saying goes, the chicken is involved, but the pig is committed.\u201d</p> <p>This process starts early in life, really early on. First\u2011born children are \u201cself-referencing\u201d, Vernon contends, and have to find their own path, make all the mistakes. The siblings that follow, meanwhile, instantly have a target: a rival who is usually stronger and quicker, at least initially, and who gives them someone ultimately to overtake. \u201cStudies suggest that first-born children are motivated to learn while younger siblings are motivated to win,\u201d Vernon notes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are tons of examples.

That was the hardest part.\u201d</p> <p>Serena Williams couldn\u2019t beat her older sister Venus, admittedly no slouch, for years. But when she finally did, she never looked back. Jamie Murray arguably had more potential as a junior than his younger brother ever did \u2013 when he was 13, Jamie was world No 2 \u2013 but Andy hauled himself to the top through grit and near\u2011psychotic resilience.</p> <p>Everywhere you look: Roger Federer has an elder sister who apparently was very good at hockey and volleyball, but is now a nurse in Switzerland; Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent have two elder sisters; Michael Phelps is the youngest of three children; Harry Kane, Rebecca Adlington and Usain Bolt have all taken aim first at elder siblings before moving on to take on and beat the world.</p> <p>The evidence seems solid \u2013 consistent across sports, across countries \u2013 and it is backed up by common sense (though, as the youngest of four, I would think that). There is certainly plenty there for any budding Richard Williamses and Earl Woodses (Tiger Woods has three elder half-siblings), parents looking to hothouse their own children and engineer sporting greats of the future, to consider. If you\u2019re really serious about conceiving and raising a star athlete, this information should be allied with research from the University of Essex that found that children (aged 10 to 16) born in October and November performed better on tests of strength, cardiovascular fitness and stamina. These children not only have the advantage of being the oldest in their school year but their mothers would have been bombarded over the summer months with vitamin D, which is believed to be beneficial for bone and muscle growth, while they were in the womb.</p> <p>So an autumn baby with at least one elder sibling is practically halfway to the Olympics, then. Someone like Annie Vernon, who has an elder brother and the dream birthday: 1 September. She certainly believes it helped her in rowing, though she also points out that it may have resulted in some less desirable characteristics. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s always been structured, team sports where it\u2019s competitive and I can compare myself to others,\u201d she writes in <em>Mind Games</em>. \u201cInsecure? Moi?\u201d</p> <p>There are inevitably exceptions. The one that swims, cycles and runs to mind is Alistair Brownlee, who, after a flirtation with Ironman, announced recently that he plans make a comeback to triathlon for this summer\u2019s Olympics. Brownlee, at the age of 32, wants a third gold medal, and a third victory over his long-suffering kid brother, Jonny, who is two years his junior and won a bronze medal in 2012 and silver in 2016.</p> <p>By Vernon\u2019s logic, Alistair should have come out of the traps fast but been steadily and inexorably overhauled by a more cut-throat Jonny. This has not happened yet. If you ever meet the Brownlees \u2013 which I did before the Olympics in 2012 \u2013 the expected roles are essentially reversed. Jonny, a phenomenal athlete by any measure, told me that he did not even consider Alistair a rival. \u201cHe <em>is</em> a rival but, at the same time, he\u2019s a teammate and a brother,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>Jonny went on to recall the 2011 world championships where his brother won and he finished second. \u201cThat was great really. That was perfect.\u201d</p> <p>Alistair, meanwhile, in my 20 years of meeting professional athletes, is perhaps the most single-minded I\u2019ve come across. The story goes that at the Rio Olympics in 2016, when the Brownlee brothers pulled clear of the field, Jonny turned to Alistair and said: \u201cRelax, take it easy.\u201d Alistair took this as his cue to raise the pace. \u201cI just thought: \u2018If he\u2019s telling me to relax, he\u2019s probably finding this quite hard,\u2019\u201d Alistair said.</p> <p>So, all you firstborns out there, take hope. You can achieve sporting immortality, you just have to be a bit more Brownlee. And even if success on the field eludes you, take solace from MIT research from 2017.

They were also less likely (certainly in the case of boys) to be involved in violent crime and general misbehaviour. \u201cThe firstborn has role models who are adults,\u201d explained the MIT economist Joseph Doyle. \u201cAnd the second, later-born children have role models who are slightly irrational two-year-olds.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Expectation and dread. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be feeling this afternoon as Liverpool take on Manchester United at Anfield. On paper, the result is a foregone conclusion. Liverpool are runaway leaders of the Premier League and possibly the best team in the world. United these days play dreadful, soul-sapping football and languish 27 points behind their rivals.</p> <p>But football isn\u2019t played on paper. And there is nothing certain about sport. United are the one team that have taken points off Liverpool this season and may do so again.</p> <p>One plays, and watches, sport for the emotions it generates. As a Liverpool supporter, I am both ecstatic that they\u2019re so far ahead in the title race and strangely dissatisfied. Of course, I want Liverpool to crush all opposition, go through the season unbeaten and to have won the league title by March.</p> <p>But sport is also about thrill and drama and excitement and ecstasy. And that comes from closeness of combat and overcoming impossible odds, not a cruise to victory. If you ask most Liverpool fans about their favourite matches, two would probably come top of the list. The first is the \u201cmiracle of Istanbul\u201d in 2005, when Liverpool came from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan and become European champions. The second is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Liverpool\u2019s 4-0 demolition of Barcelona last season</a> to reach the Champions League final \u2013 having lost the first leg 3-0. Both results defied logic. Both drained the emotions as only sport can. Both were about as thrilling as football gets.</p> <p>Perhaps there will always be a tension between being a sports fan and being the supporter of a particular team. Between the desire for electrifying drama and the craving for a crushing victory. This afternoon, though, a crushing victory will do just fine.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Expectation and dread. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll be feeling this afternoon as Liverpool take on Manchester United at Anfield. On paper, the result is a foregone conclusion. Liverpool are runaway leaders of the Premier League and possibly the best team in the world. United these days play dreadful, soul-sapping football and languish 27 points behind their rivals. But football isn\u2019t played on paper. And there is nothing certain about sport. United are the one team that have taken points off Liverpool this season and may do so again. One plays, and watches, sport for the emotions it generates. As a Liverpool supporter, I am both ecstatic that they\u2019re so far ahead in the title race and strangely dissatisfied. Of course, I want Liverpool to crush all opposition, go through the season unbeaten and to have won the league title by March. But sport is also about thrill and drama and excitement and ecstasy. And that comes from closeness of combat and overcoming impossible odds, not a cruise to victory. If you ask most Liverpool fans about their favourite matches, two would probably come top of the list. The first is the \u201cmiracle of Istanbul\u201d in 2005, when Liverpool came from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan and become European champions. The second is Liverpool\u2019s 4-0 demolition of Barcelona last season to reach the Champions League final \u2013 having lost the first leg 3-0. Both results defied logic. Both drained the emotions as only sport can. Both were about as thrilling as football gets. Perhaps there will always be a tension between being a sports fan and being the supporter of a particular team. Between the desire for electrifying drama and the craving for a crushing victory. This afternoon, though, a crushing victory will do just fine. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

Instead on Sunday night he will occupy his place in the dugout at a place where they have not seen their team lose for 38 games, going back more than a year \u2013 not since the last time he was there.</p> <p>Ernesto Valverde lost one home game as Barcelona manager: to Seti\u00e9n\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/nov/12/real-betiss-barcelona-tribute-act-is-even-better-than-the-real-thing\" title=\"\">Real Betis, 4-3 in November 2018</a>. As a player Seti\u00e9n beat Barcelona too. In Santander some Racing fans still cling to the old, fading T-shirt that celebrated their 5-0 victory over the Dream Team in February 1995 like some religious relic. On the front is a green hand, a finger for every goal they put past Carlos Busquets, Sergio\u2019s father, the scorer\u2019s name at each of its tips: Esteban Torre, Jes\u00fas Merino, Dmitri Radchenko, twice, and Quique Seti\u00e9n.</p> <p>But it was not usually like that and that is why Seti\u00e9n is like this, he says. In defeat, in destruction, he found himself; it was like a revelation. \u201cYou\u2019re on the pitch, suffering, endlessly running after the ball and you think: \u2018That\u2019s the football I like,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it was possible to play better football but I didn\u2019t truly know until I played against Johan Cruyff\u2019s team. I saw expressed there the way I felt about football. Everything I am as a coach I owe to chasing the ball against Barcelona.\u201d</p> <p>Now he has been entrusted with recovering that identity: philosophy and DNA became recurring themes last week after Barcelona sacked Valverde on Monday. Seti\u00e9n says he \u201cimbibed Cruyff\u201d, even though he never played with him. \u201cI would have given my little finger to have worked under him,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When he told Cruyff that, the Dutchman laughed, but there are few men as committed to a footballing identity. \u201cThis is the way I feel football. Deep down, I defend this way of playing as an ethical question,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/jan/16/quique-setien-at-barca-matas-magic-and-love-island-football-weekly-extra\">Quique Seti\u00e9n at Bar\u00e7a, Mata's magic and Love Island \u2013 Football Weekly Extra</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At 14 Seti\u00e9n worked as an errand boy in a pharmaceutical college, writing match reports on an old typewriter someone lent him. When Racing signed him in 1977 from Perines, the transfer fee was 40 pairs of boots and his father did not want him to be a footballer: why turn down a full-time job for something so risky, so temporary?</p> <p>A technical player who did not always run much or get on with his coaches, he saw himself as countercultural then, but not so now. Seti\u00e9n represented Spain and later became an international at beach football. He began coaching because he had to. \u201cDeep inside me is this: the game,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat moves me, what drives me, has always been the same: what I feel for the ball. When I see great players, the satisfaction is the same as I felt in the school playground.\u201d</p> <p>That identity has run through the teams he has coached. He did not manage in the top division until he was 57 but, when he did, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/oct/31/rolling-stone-quique-setien-shows-theres-glory-in-every-game\" title=\"\">Las Palmas</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jan/08/real-betis-crowned-kings-of-seville-again-after-winning-the-wildest-of-all-derbies\" title=\"\">and Betis </a>were unmistakably teams built in his own image, rooted in overwhelming possession and driven by a belief in the importance of the aesthetic even beyond the scoreline.</p> <p>That is why Barcelona have hired the 61-year-old and why Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez and Ronald Koeman said no. As Seti\u00e9n said on Tuesday, he does not have a huge CV, nor any titles, and he is not sure that what he has done is enough to have got the call from one of the world\u2019s greatest clubs. But he does have an unshakable faith in his type of play. \u201cThe one promise I always make is that my team will play good football,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It is possible that Bar\u00e7a\u2019s ills have been misdiagnosed, their reality misread and their failings sought in the wrong place, but the talk has been all about the how, about style and identity. At the Camp Nou, they saw how. Just as he had with Cruyff, they suffered it. When Betis beat Barcelona that day, the Spanish sports daily <em>AS </em>wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we saw a team treat Barcelona like this, using their own weapons against them.\u201d</p> <p>Afterwards Seti\u00e9n was asked if Cruyff would be proud: \u201cBarcelona have been doing this for 25 years, laying a path; we\u2019re just apprentices, trying to consolidate an idea.\u201d He departed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealBetis/status/1061747701229019136\" title=\"\">the Camp Nou with Sergio Busquets\u2019 shirt</a>, signed. \u201cFor Quique,\u201d it said, \u201cwith affection and admiration for the way you see football.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, Seti\u00e9n said his task was to get his Barcelona players to see it the same way, with the same enthusiasm and commitment, to believe in his vision. At Betis the best example of his powers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/16/fun-finta-and-why-it-is-impossible-not-to-love-joaquin-at-real-betis\" title=\"\">conviction may be Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez</a>, still playing at 38, his enthusiasm renewed.</p> <p>The coach has often talked about making players happy by giving them <a href=\"ttps://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1216806343111335938?s=20\" title=\"\">something they love: the ball</a>. He has talked, too, about convincing them to play: they can take the ball while he takes responsibility. Which, incidentally, he did: the accusations levelled at him, perhaps inevitably with an identity as immovable as his, hung on defensive fragility. Critics <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/3775940/real-betis-are-mocked-in-spain-thanks-to-moral-manager-quique-setien-yet-hes-made-them-better-than-ever\" title=\"\">saw his virtues as a vice</a>.</p> <p>At Las Palmas his relationship with the board deteriorated; at Betis, supporters did not fully buy into the style and felt little warmth for his commitment to it. At the end of the season, with results slipping and the fans putting on pressure, the board released him. Both sides overachieved but results did eventually slip, bringing recrimination. That was at clubs who did not have to win every game.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/14/quique-setien-barcelona-job-cows-new-manager\">Camp Moo: Quique Seti\u00e9n goes from cows to Barcelona job in 24 hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At Betis he had tutorials \u2013 his word \u2013 with players. Seti\u00e9n would tell them to come to him if they did not agree or had doubts. He is charismatic, a communicator, didactic and convincing, and he will have to be. But every message requires a receptor.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s not normal to take over at a team that\u2019s top,\u201d Quique Seti\u00e9n said after the call that took him from a stroll among the cows in Liencres, Cantabria, to a job among the sacred cows at the Camp Nou. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out of work, waiting for an opportunity, you imagine a team near the bottom, in trouble,\u201d said Barcelona\u2019s new manager. Instead on Sunday night he will occupy his place in the dugout at a place where they have not seen their team lose for 38 games, going back more than a year \u2013 not since the last time he was there. Ernesto Valverde lost one home game as Barcelona manager: to Seti\u00e9n\u2019s Real Betis, 4-3 in November 2018. As a player Seti\u00e9n beat Barcelona too. In Santander some Racing fans still cling to the old, fading T-shirt that celebrated their 5-0 victory over the Dream Team in February 1995 like some religious relic. On the front is a green hand, a finger for every goal they put past Carlos Busquets, Sergio\u2019s father, the scorer\u2019s name at each of its tips: Esteban Torre, Jes\u00fas Merino, Dmitri Radchenko, twice, and Quique Seti\u00e9n. But it was not usually like that and that is why Seti\u00e9n is like this, he says. In defeat, in destruction, he found himself; it was like a revelation. \u201cYou\u2019re on the pitch, suffering, endlessly running after the ball and you think: \u2018That\u2019s the football I like,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI knew it was possible to play better football but I didn\u2019t truly know until I played against Johan Cruyff\u2019s team. I saw expressed there the way I felt about football. Everything I am as a coach I owe to chasing the ball against Barcelona.\u201d Now he has been entrusted with recovering that identity: philosophy and DNA became recurring themes last week after Barcelona sacked Valverde on Monday. Seti\u00e9n says he \u201cimbibed Cruyff\u201d, even though he never played with him. \u201cI would have given my little finger to have worked under him,\u201d he says. When he told Cruyff that, the Dutchman laughed, but there are few men as committed to a footballing identity. \u201cThis is the way I feel football. Deep down, I defend this way of playing as an ethical question,\u201d he says. At 14 Seti\u00e9n worked as an errand boy in a pharmaceutical college, writing match reports on an old typewriter someone lent him. When Racing signed him in 1977 from Perines, the transfer fee was 40 pairs of boots and his father did not want him to be a footballer: why turn down a full-time job for something so risky, so temporary? A technical player who did not always run much or get on with his coaches, he saw himself as countercultural then, but not so now. Seti\u00e9n represented Spain and later became an international at beach football. He began coaching because he had to. \u201cDeep inside me is this: the game,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat moves me, what drives me, has always been the same: what I feel for the ball. When I see great players, the satisfaction is the same as I felt in the school playground.\u201d That identity has run through the teams he has coached. He did not manage in the top division until he was 57 but, when he did, Las Palmas and Betis were unmistakably teams built in his own image, rooted in overwhelming possession and driven by a belief in the importance of the aesthetic even beyond the scoreline. That is why Barcelona have hired the 61-year-old and why Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez and Ronald Koeman said no. As Seti\u00e9n said on Tuesday, he does not have a huge CV, nor any titles, and he is not sure that what he has done is enough to have got the call from one of the world\u2019s greatest clubs. But he does have an unshakable faith in his type of play. \u201cThe one promise I always make is that my team will play good football,\u201d he says. It is possible that Bar\u00e7a\u2019s ills have been misdiagnosed, their reality misread and their failings sought in the wrong place, but the talk has been all about the how, about style and identity. At the Camp Nou, they saw how. Just as he had with Cruyff, they suffered it. When Betis beat Barcelona that day, the Spanish sports daily AS wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we saw a team treat Barcelona like this, using their own weapons against them.\u201d Afterwards Seti\u00e9n was asked if Cruyff would be proud: \u201cBarcelona have been doing this for 25 years, laying a path; we\u2019re just apprentices, trying to consolidate an idea.\u201d He departed the Camp Nou with Sergio Busquets\u2019 shirt, signed. \u201cFor Quique,\u201d it said, \u201cwith affection and admiration for the way you see football.\u201d On Tuesday, Seti\u00e9n said his task was to get his Barcelona players to see it the same way, with the same enthusiasm and commitment, to believe in his vision. At Betis the best example of his powers of conviction may be Joaqu\u00edn S\u00e1nchez, still playing at 38, his enthusiasm renewed. The coach has often talked about making players happy by giving them something they love: the ball. He has talked, too, about convincing them to play: they can take the ball while he takes responsibility. Which, incidentally, he did: the accusations levelled at him, perhaps inevitably with an identity as immovable as his, hung on defensive fragility. Critics saw his virtues as a vice. At Las Palmas his relationship with the board deteriorated; at Betis, supporters did not fully buy into the style and felt little warmth for his commitment to it. At the end of the season, with results slipping and the fans putting on pressure, the board released him. Both sides overachieved but results did eventually slip, bringing recrimination. That was at clubs who did not have to win every game. At Betis he had tutorials \u2013 his word \u2013 with players. Seti\u00e9n would tell them to come to him if they did not agree or had doubts. He is charismatic, a communicator, didactic and convincing, and he will have to be. But every message requires a receptor. Much of his focus has previously been on making footballers believe they are better: playing for Lugo or Racing, for a smaller club, is no excuse for not trying to play. At Barcelona, with a squad that contains Lionel Messi, Gerard Piqu\u00e9, Sergio Busquets, Antoine Griezmann et al, the message cannot be the same. These players already know they are good. This is a different dressing room, he knows, and these players are powerful. It is a place where politics also plays a part, more so than anywhere else and where the demands offer no margin for error: Seti\u00e9n takes over top, remember. Fans want to play better but they also want that place; they want style but also success. He must hold on to that, even without Luis Su\u00e1rez, injured until the end of the season. Seti\u00e9n has spoken glowingly of Messi before; now he will find out what he is really like. Perhaps the way he has enthused about the Argentinian and his teammates, a fan as well as an opponent and now a boss, will help. Perhaps it will not. \u201cAdmiration is one thing and Messi is Messi, Busquets is Busquets, Piqu\u00e9 too, but everyone in their place.\u201d For some that may be no longer in the team. Seti\u00e9n framed his willingness to play young players as a message to the first team \u2013 no one can assume status. But status is a reality and he will have to tread with care. Valverde\u2019s flaws did not exist in a vacuum and were not his alone, the problems deeper and conditioned by a context with which Seti\u00e9n is only just becoming acquainted. There are significant decisions ahead, with uncertain consequences. To start with at least, this might be as much about personality as play. He will confront those decisions directly, to judge by his approach before, starting on Sunday evening against Granada. \u201cWhen you say something to a footballer, you have to be convinced you will do it,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes managers say something to get through a difficult moment but that rebounds on you.

Ghattas quotes Suleimani explaining how a gruesome incident involving an IRGC officer beheaded by Isis in Syria was divinely inspired. The officer\u2019s widow declared \u201cher husband had lost his head so the women of Iran could keep covering theirs\u201d. Her final chapter focuses on Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was murdered in his country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi\u2019s life and horrific death embody large elements of this story \u2013 from early support for the Afghan mujahideen to his later, fatal realisation that the reforms of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were designed, above all else, to maintain his dynasty in power. \u201cObfuscation and the feigning of ignorance would become favourite forms of Saudi subterfuge to evade responsibility for any violence or intolerance connected to the kingdom,\u201d as the author wrote \u2013 before five hitmen were sentenced to death by a Riyadh court while those who issued their orders never faced trial. Iran and Saudi Arabia took steps to ease tensions during the rule of the reformist President Khatami and the easier-going King Abdullah \u2013 and there are signs they may be doing so again since Iran\u2019s devastating attack last September on the Aramco oil refinery at Abqaiq \u2013 for which the ever-unpredictable Twitterer-in-chief in the White House conspicuously failed to retaliate despite his policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Tehran. Whatever happens next in this long-running, oppressive and dangerous Middle Eastern drama, Black Wave will be a vivid, indispensable guide to the story so far. Ian Black, the Guardian\u2019s former Middle East editor, is a visiting senior fellow at the Middle East Centre, LSE \u2022 Black Wave: Saudi Arabia, Iran and the Rivalry That Unravelled the Middle East by Kim Ghattas is published by Headline (\u00a320)",

I watch a little TV \u2013 usually the news \u2013 to wake up my mind, and then I do exercises, followed by breakfast.</p> <p><strong>Who\u2019s the first person you speak to? </strong>My life has changed since my wife, Patricia, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, that terrible disease. So now when I go downstairs, I usually just sit down and have a cup of tea or coffee and do my crosswords. The first people I talk to are the live-in carers who help me look after her. I\u2019m pleased to say that Patricia is making some progress. She\u2019s starting to talk a little. She said \u2018Good morning\u2019 to me this morning, which was rather lovely.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s for breakfast? </strong>I tend to smoke the whole house out because I fry chilli and onions for my favourite Sunday breakfast: chilli, egg and onions on toast.</p> <p><strong>How do you relax? </strong>I spend time playing golf, at a course two miles from our Beverly Hills home, where I\u2019ll grab some lunch and a nice glass of wine in the clubhouse. If I really want to let my hair down I\u2019ll ride my Harley-Davidson around the Hollywood Hills. Sometimes I\u2019ll get to the lights, pull up my visor, and see people next to me do a double take: \u2019Oh my God, it\u2019s Engelbert Humperdinck.\u2019 I don\u2019t mind. Recognition is one of the greatest compliments you can have.</p> <p><strong>Are Sundays active? </strong>Sunday is Scrabble day. Friends come over and we sit down and play. I love it. I love words.</p> <p><strong>Signing off on Sundays\u2026 </strong>My LA home has four floors. I\u2019m on the top floor and the carers live on the second floor with my wife, so the last thing I do on Sunday night \u2013 and every night \u2013 is give Patricia a kiss and tell her that I love her and that I\u2019ll see her in the morning. I dream music and if I have a strong idea for a song I\u2019ll wake up, record it on my phone then record it the next day. My dreams are the blueprints of my reality.</p> <p><em>Engelbert Humperdinck plays the London Palladium on 4 May</em></p>",

Who\u2019s the first person you speak to? My life has changed since my wife, Patricia, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, that terrible disease. So now when I go downstairs, I usually just sit down and have a cup of tea or coffee and do my crosswords. The first people I talk to are the live-in carers who help me look after her. I\u2019m pleased to say that Patricia is making some progress. She\u2019s starting to talk a little. She said \u2018Good morning\u2019 to me this morning, which was rather lovely. What\u2019s for breakfast? I tend to smoke the whole house out because I fry chilli and onions for my favourite Sunday breakfast: chilli, egg and onions on toast. How do you relax? I spend time playing golf, at a course two miles from our Beverly Hills home, where I\u2019ll grab some lunch and a nice glass of wine in the clubhouse. If I really want to let my hair down I\u2019ll ride my Harley-Davidson around the Hollywood Hills. Sometimes I\u2019ll get to the lights, pull up my visor, and see people next to me do a double take: \u2019Oh my God, it\u2019s Engelbert Humperdinck.\u2019 I don\u2019t mind. Recognition is one of the greatest compliments you can have. Are Sundays active? Sunday is Scrabble day. Friends come over and we sit down and play. I love it. I love words. Signing off on Sundays\u2026 My LA home has four floors. I\u2019m on the top floor and the carers live on the second floor with my wife, so the last thing I do on Sunday night \u2013 and every night \u2013 is give Patricia a kiss and tell her that I love her and that I\u2019ll see her in the morning. I dream music and if I have a strong idea for a song I\u2019ll wake up, record it on my phone then record it the next day. My dreams are the blueprints of my reality.

Last week saw the news of a step forward on that path, with 69% of UK offers being made to state school students, an increase from just 56% five years ago. Colleges and departments have been making use of the data that underpins the university\u2019s access programmes to ask themselves an important question: what does it mean for access to Oxford to be \u201cfair\u201d?</p> <p>At my college, Worcester, we agreed on what so many in higher education perceive as the most obvious definition: access can be considered \u201cfair\u201d when the group of students to whom offers are made is representative of those who achieve AAA or higher at A-level. This year we met this definition of fairness for three under-represented groups: state school students (who account for 83% of our offer holders, and 73% of those who achieve AAA+ at A-level); those living in areas with low likelihood of progression to higher education (20%; 13%); and those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas (22%; 11%).</p> <p>We don\u2019t have the whole picture for all underrepresented groups, because Ucas has not yet provided us with data on how many of our offer-holders are BAME. But this was a serious step up for a college where 10 years ago only 58% of offer-holders were state school educated. Here\u2019s how we did it.</p> <p>By analysing contextual data, we were able to look at how certain kinds of advantages and disadvantages affected our applicants\u2019 likelihood of being offered a place. It was not the case that state school educated and disadvantaged students were not applying, or achieving highly at school: between 2014 and 2018, 2,000 of the disadvantaged students who were not made offers by Oxford went on to achieve AAA or higher. We knew first-hand that disadvantaged students did not perform less well than their peers once they arrived on course, so their academic potential was not in question. We needed to look closely at how we went about assessing it.</p> <p>A huge range of factors are known to affect performance in the application process, including school type, access to experiences beyond the curriculum, opportunities to develop particular kinds of cultural capital and familiarity with higher education. Expecting all applicants to perform in similar ways was disadvantaging those who had not had the privilege of being taught how to make their abilities legible against the kinds of metrics used in university admissions processes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most disadvantaged students became more than twice as likely to be offered places as the most advantaged</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once we had begun to think critically about our expectations of applicants \u2013 and to admit to ourselves that it was not fair to expect potential to look the same in applicants who had had vastly different opportunities \u2013 something changed. We looked at the kinds of questions we were asking and the kinds of answers we were expecting, we interrogated our own and each others\u2019 assumptions about different forms potential might take in an applicant, and asked our admitting tutors to come together for a conversation about how to use contextual data to recognise diverse potential. As we sought to uncouple privilege from the assessment of potential, the most disadvantaged students became more than twice as likely to be offered places as the most advantaged.

The small and banal is rendered otherworldly and apparently interesting simply by dint of having been expanded to something far beyond the expected. Think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/koons\" title=\"\">Jeff Koons</a>\u2019s shiny, polished balloon animals, inflated to elephantine size, or the 70m-long pink knitted rabbit, seemingly dropped on to a hillside by the Austrian art collective <a href=\"https://www.gelitin.net/projects/hase/\" title=\"\">Gelitin</a>, as if the discarded toy of some unimaginably giant child.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As each tiny plateful arrives, I push my reading glasses up my nose and peer down, as if examining a rare jewel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Don\u2019t worry. This is still the restaurant column. Art criticism remains the sacred domain of my marvellous colleague <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lauracumming\" title=\"\">Laura Cumming</a>. But dinner at <a href=\"https://eat-merienda.com/\" title=\"\">Merienda</a>, in Stockbridge, to the north of Edinburgh\u2019s city centre, did make me brood on those vast, one-trick sculptures. Because, whether consciously or not \u2013 let\u2019s go with not \u2013 it feels like the kitchen here is attempting a reverse manoeuvre: rendering the ordinary much more interesting, simply by making it very small indeed. As each tiny plateful arrives, I am forced to push my reading glasses up the bridge of my nose and peer down, as if examining a rare jewel. Is this an intense and thrilling examination of the impact of sustained heat on the natural sugars deep within orange squash? Or is it, you know, just a really, really small portion of roasted veg?</p> <p>It\u2019s a risky strategy. Early on I run my finger down the list of dishes, all at around \u00a37 or \u00a38, and thinking myself a veteran of this sharing plate thing, this clattering parade of \u201cnever enough\u201d and \u201cmore please\u201d, I conclude the three of us will need three dishes each. Our waiter takes a sharp intake of breath. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, solemnly, \u201cthey are tasting-menu size.\u201d Oh joy. We will therefore need more. Quite a few more. Which means it\u2019s not quite as good value as at first it seemed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b6d97a6a78fefedb13772f4c97c833f80a87093\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b6d97a6a78fefedb13772f4c97c833f80a87093/543_312_5126_3076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We adore it\u2019: duck breast with fava beans and chorizo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We adore it\u2019: duck breast with fava beans and chorizo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It also means the kitchen has set itself a trap. If it\u2019s about small and often, then they can\u2019t get away with a compact menu of greatest hits. There are more than 20 dishes on offer tonight. The fact is few kitchens, operating outside of a set repertoire \u2013 I\u2019m excluding those working in, say, Chinese traditions \u2013 can pull off a long menu. It\u2019s always going to be a case of big hitters, solid fillers and \u201cWhat the hell were they thinking?\u201d</p> <p>So it proves. In October, Merienda joined the ranks of those like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/01/the-leaping-hare-suffolk-it-doesnt-put-a-foot-wrong-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Leaping Hare</a>, which I reviewed a few weeks ago, which have received a <a href=\"https://guide.michelin.com/en/article/features/the-bib-gourmand#\" title=\"\">Bib Gourmand</a> from Michelin. A reminder: it\u2019s meant to signify good food at a reasonable price, currently \u00a330 for three courses or the equivalent. I can see that at Merienda you can, if you choose well, get exactly that. You could also get something decidedly less so.</p> <p>But in the words of the song, let\u2019s accentuate the positive. There is a crisp friable disc of filo pastry, piled with lubricated white crabmeat, topped in turn with a full Ker-Plunk of green apple batons, in a puddle of brisk acidic dressing. Of course, being tiny, it\u2019s gone quickly. We miss it because it is sweet and salty and crisp and crunchy. Finely dicing up pear and walnut does not make them into a tartare. That\u2019s a word applied to something served raw when normally it would be cooked. But slathering them in a Roquefort dressing does make it punchy and amusing. We adore a sizable chunk of duck breast, served pink, with a pile of fresh fava beans and loads of crisped chorizo, all bound together by a glossy jus. The roast squash with a few croutons is a nice enough side dish. At the end there is a well-roasted pear with splodges of salt caramel, and a few kernels of caramel popcorn as if someone had left a bag of Butterkist open, and it was felt better to use it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d7651d8f24f3e61590559d354859b8ed5086724\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d7651d8f24f3e61590559d354859b8ed5086724/596_430_4895_2937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There\u2019s a good reason why savoury foods are rarely blue\u2019: tuna with blue spirulina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There\u2019s a good reason why savoury foods are rarely blue\u2019: tuna with blue spirulina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other things just missed the point, baffled us or weren\u2019t very nice. \u201cBean pur\u00e9e with parsley pesto and powdered porcini mushroom\u201d, sounds both rugged and flashily modern at the same time. But nice words are not the same as nice things to eat. It is just a bit gritty and salty. So too, the \u201cnage poached Hebridean salmon, potato, dill, carrot cream\u201d in which the fish has been so overpoached and so grossly underseasoned that you couldn\u2019t help wishing the poor animal had been left to live out its days back in the Hebrides. It is the dull salmon dish at the summer wedding you didn\u2019t really want to attend in the first place.</p> <p>Still, at least it is recognisable as food. The \u201ctuna carpaccio, radish, lobster vinaigrette, blue spirulina\u201d looks like a plate you\u2019d pick up in a Chania souvenir shop as a memento of a jolly Cretan holiday: petals of all but tasteless purple tuna, laid in a star pattern, are interspersed with dribbles and drops of tasteless sauce in two shades of blue, like Dulux emulsion. There\u2019s a good reason why savoury foods are rarely blue. It\u2019s a plate of wrongness that also tastes of nothingness. (In case you\u2019re wondering, spirulina is a blue-green algae often used as a feed supplement for aquaculture. Doesn\u2019t that just make you purr, \u201cOoh. Dinner.\u201d)</p> <p>Alongside the poached pear we have a chocolate mousse heavy with the cocktail-bar coffee-tang of Kahl\u00faa, and a bouncy, shuddering coconut panna cotta. So here we sit, in the moodily downlit dining room with its semi-open kitchen and its Stockbridge date-night chatter, trying to work out whether this has been a good experience or not. It is, we conclude, the proverbial curate\u2019s egg: good in parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"076e2aa51ac89fb945f769f37b812fbf0a21043a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/076e2aa51ac89fb945f769f37b812fbf0a21043a/436_389_4970_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018As if someone had left a bag of Butterkist open\u2019: pear with salted caramel popcorn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As if someone had left a bag of Butterkist open\u2019: pear with salted caramel popcorn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Service is friendly and efficient, although our waiter can\u2019t quite cope when I say politely that we\u2019ll fill our glasses ourselves. She insists it\u2019s her job, that she is specifically there to take away the stress of clocking that your wine glass is empty and then lifting a bottle to fill it. Except I find someone filling my glass when I don\u2019t want it filled to be, in itself, stressful. Please, if someone says they\u2019re good with the whole wine glass thing, let them get on with it. Yeah, I know. There are worse problems in the world. I should get over myself. But that\u2019s the point of nice restaurants. They\u2019re meant to be places that keep all those terrible problems at bay. They\u2019re meant to offer something consistent and reliable. But sometimes, as at Merienda, they just leave you scratching your head.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Back in the centre of Edinburgh at the Waldorf Astoria Caledonian hotel, there\u2019s Grazing by Mark Greenaway, offering a menu of small, big and sharing plates. Greenaway comes from the fancier end of the restaurant business, but here he\u2019s avoided the overly refined.

      "bodyText": "Merienda, 30 North West Circus Place, Edinburgh EH3 6TP (0103 220 2020). All savoury dishes \u00a35.90-\u00a39.50, desserts \u00a37, wines from \u00a326 There is a strain within postwar modern sculpture that, like the male ego, is dependent for its impact on enlargement. The small and banal is rendered otherworldly and apparently interesting simply by dint of having been expanded to something far beyond the expected. Think Jeff Koons\u2019s shiny, polished balloon animals, inflated to elephantine size, or the 70m-long pink knitted rabbit, seemingly dropped on to a hillside by the Austrian art collective Gelitin, as if the discarded toy of some unimaginably giant child. Don\u2019t worry. This is still the restaurant column. Art criticism remains the sacred domain of my marvellous colleague Laura Cumming. But dinner at Merienda, in Stockbridge, to the north of Edinburgh\u2019s city centre, did make me brood on those vast, one-trick sculptures. Because, whether consciously or not \u2013 let\u2019s go with not \u2013 it feels like the kitchen here is attempting a reverse manoeuvre: rendering the ordinary much more interesting, simply by making it very small indeed. As each tiny plateful arrives, I am forced to push my reading glasses up the bridge of my nose and peer down, as if examining a rare jewel. Is this an intense and thrilling examination of the impact of sustained heat on the natural sugars deep within orange squash? Or is it, you know, just a really, really small portion of roasted veg? It\u2019s a risky strategy. Early on I run my finger down the list of dishes, all at around \u00a37 or \u00a38, and thinking myself a veteran of this sharing plate thing, this clattering parade of \u201cnever enough\u201d and \u201cmore please\u201d, I conclude the three of us will need three dishes each. Our waiter takes a sharp intake of breath. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, solemnly, \u201cthey are tasting-menu size.\u201d Oh joy. We will therefore need more. Quite a few more. Which means it\u2019s not quite as good value as at first it seemed. It also means the kitchen has set itself a trap. If it\u2019s about small and often, then they can\u2019t get away with a compact menu of greatest hits. There are more than 20 dishes on offer tonight. The fact is few kitchens, operating outside of a set repertoire \u2013 I\u2019m excluding those working in, say, Chinese traditions \u2013 can pull off a long menu. It\u2019s always going to be a case of big hitters, solid fillers and \u201cWhat the hell were they thinking?\u201d So it proves. In October, Merienda joined the ranks of those like the Leaping Hare, which I reviewed a few weeks ago, which have received a Bib Gourmand from Michelin. A reminder: it\u2019s meant to signify good food at a reasonable price, currently \u00a330 for three courses or the equivalent. I can see that at Merienda you can, if you choose well, get exactly that. You could also get something decidedly less so. But in the words of the song, let\u2019s accentuate the positive. There is a crisp friable disc of filo pastry, piled with lubricated white crabmeat, topped in turn with a full Ker-Plunk of green apple batons, in a puddle of brisk acidic dressing. Of course, being tiny, it\u2019s gone quickly. We miss it because it is sweet and salty and crisp and crunchy. Finely dicing up pear and walnut does not make them into a tartare. That\u2019s a word applied to something served raw when normally it would be cooked. But slathering them in a Roquefort dressing does make it punchy and amusing. We adore a sizable chunk of duck breast, served pink, with a pile of fresh fava beans and loads of crisped chorizo, all bound together by a glossy jus. The roast squash with a few croutons is a nice enough side dish. At the end there is a well-roasted pear with splodges of salt caramel, and a few kernels of caramel popcorn as if someone had left a bag of Butterkist open, and it was felt better to use it. Other things just missed the point, baffled us or weren\u2019t very nice. \u201cBean pur\u00e9e with parsley pesto and powdered porcini mushroom\u201d, sounds both rugged and flashily modern at the same time. But nice words are not the same as nice things to eat. It is just a bit gritty and salty. So too, the \u201cnage poached Hebridean salmon, potato, dill, carrot cream\u201d in which the fish has been so overpoached and so grossly underseasoned that you couldn\u2019t help wishing the poor animal had been left to live out its days back in the Hebrides. It is the dull salmon dish at the summer wedding you didn\u2019t really want to attend in the first place. Still, at least it is recognisable as food. The \u201ctuna carpaccio, radish, lobster vinaigrette, blue spirulina\u201d looks like a plate you\u2019d pick up in a Chania souvenir shop as a memento of a jolly Cretan holiday: petals of all but tasteless purple tuna, laid in a star pattern, are interspersed with dribbles and drops of tasteless sauce in two shades of blue, like Dulux emulsion. There\u2019s a good reason why savoury foods are rarely blue. It\u2019s a plate of wrongness that also tastes of nothingness. (In case you\u2019re wondering, spirulina is a blue-green algae often used as a feed supplement for aquaculture. Doesn\u2019t that just make you purr, \u201cOoh. Dinner.\u201d) Alongside the poached pear we have a chocolate mousse heavy with the cocktail-bar coffee-tang of Kahl\u00faa, and a bouncy, shuddering coconut panna cotta. So here we sit, in the moodily downlit dining room with its semi-open kitchen and its Stockbridge date-night chatter, trying to work out whether this has been a good experience or not. It is, we conclude, the proverbial curate\u2019s egg: good in parts. Service is friendly and efficient, although our waiter can\u2019t quite cope when I say politely that we\u2019ll fill our glasses ourselves. She insists it\u2019s her job, that she is specifically there to take away the stress of clocking that your wine glass is empty and then lifting a bottle to fill it. Except I find someone filling my glass when I don\u2019t want it filled to be, in itself, stressful. Please, if someone says they\u2019re good with the whole wine glass thing, let them get on with it. Yeah, I know. There are worse problems in the world. I should get over myself. But that\u2019s the point of nice restaurants. They\u2019re meant to be places that keep all those terrible problems at bay. They\u2019re meant to offer something consistent and reliable. But sometimes, as at Merienda, they just leave you scratching your head. News bites Back in the centre of Edinburgh at the Waldorf Astoria Caledonian hotel, there\u2019s Grazing by Mark Greenaway, offering a menu of small, big and sharing plates. Greenaway comes from the fancier end of the restaurant business, but here he\u2019s avoided the overly refined. Instead, he\u2019s knocking out food that\u2019s undeniably clever, but never short on big flavours: try the fried duck egg with duck ham and a confited leg, the gnocchi with parmesan and baby spinach, or a whole shepherd\u2019s pie to share (markgreenaway.com).

Deeley, who won with dishes including pork belly with black pudding, langoustine, fennel and yuzu gel, will open his own restaurant in the city later in the year, serving a menu of what he calls \u2018Brummie fusion food\u2019.

Donald Trump threatened legal action against author and publisher. He also lauded himself and his electoral college victory: \u201cI think that would qualify as not smart, but genius \u2026 and a very stable genius at that!\u201d Trump\u2019s outburst confirmed what many already feared. In the aftermath of the firing of FBI director James Comey in May 2017, Rod Rosenstein, then deputy attorney general, reportedly weighed secretly recording the president with an eye to removing him from office under the 25th amendment. Now Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of the Washington Post offer A Very Stable Genius. As befitting Pulitzer winners for investigative reporting, their book is richly sourced and highly readable.

In other words, from workers.</p> <p>What this means is that in order for the stock market to do as well in coming years, either economic growth has to accelerate markedly (highly unlikely), or chief executives will have to siphon off even more of the gains from growth from workers and other stakeholders to their shareholders.</p> <p>This is likely to require even more downward pressure on wages, more payoffs to politicians for tax cuts and subsidies and further rollbacks of environmental regulations.

All true, but the assembled CEOs know they\u2019ll get richer far quicker if they boost equity values in the short term by buying back their shares of stock, suppressing wages, fighting unions, resisting environmental regulations and buying off politicians for tax cuts and subsidies. This has been their strategy for three decades, and it\u2019s about to get worse. Three researchers \u2013 Daniel Greenwald at MIT\u2019s Sloan School, Martin Lettau at Berkeley and Sydney Ludvigson at NYU \u2013 found that between 1952 and 1988, economic growth accounted for 92% of the rise in equity values. But since 1989 most of the increase has come from \u201creallocated rents to shareholders and away from labor compensation\u201d. In other words, from workers. What this means is that in order for the stock market to do as well in coming years, either economic growth has to accelerate markedly (highly unlikely), or chief executives will have to siphon off even more of the gains from growth from workers and other stakeholders to their shareholders. This is likely to require even more downward pressure on wages, more payoffs to politicians for tax cuts and subsidies and further rollbacks of environmental regulations. All of which will worsen the prevailing discontent. There will be no mention at Davos of any of this, nor of the increasing political and economic power of these elites and the diminishing power of average workers and citizens around the world. Nothing will be achieved in the Swiss Alps because the growing global discontent has yet to affect the bottom lines of the corporations and financial institutions whose leaders are assembling to congratulate themselves on their wealth, influence and benevolence. Trump, meanwhile, is likely to be acquitted by Senate Republicans who are so cowardly and unprincipled that they will ignore his flagrantly unconstitutional acts. Trump plans to speak at Davos, by the way: an impeached president addressing world economic leaders while being tried in the Senate. He\u2019ll probably boast about the stock market, bully and lie, as usual. One thing he won\u2019t say is that the whatever-it-takes abuses of economic and political power such as he and much of his audience are engaged in threaten to destroy capitalism, democracy and the planet.

At least two other accusers have retained lawyers to file formal objections to the deal.</p> <p>Last month, it was reported that Weinstein and more than 30 women had reached a tentative deal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/28/weinstein-victims-lawyers-could-get-10-times-more-than-accusers-in-settlement-sources-say\">following two years of negotiations</a>.</p> <p>However, the Guardian has learned that a settlement hearing that was due before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/18/harvey-weinstein-trial-jury-gigi-hadid-prison-threats-protests\">Weinstein\u2019s criminal trial in New York</a> has been postponed until at least February. It is not known if this was due to the growing number of women opting out.</p> <p>Huett joins three others who have decided to not be a part of the agreement: Wedil David, Kaja Sokola and Alexandra Canosa.</p> <p>Huett told the Guardian: \u201cOriginally I thought it was the best option for everyone, but after finding out more details, I think that opting out is the best way to get a better deal for me and for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Under the proposed deal, Weinstein would not have to pay a penny or admit any wrongdoing. The settlement would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer\u2019s former studio, the Weinstein Company. More than $12m \u2013 a quarter of the overall package \u2013 would go towards legal costs for Weinstein and his board.</p> <p>\u201cI feel the settlement amount is not very fair for all victims and the way it is structured really benefits the defendants a lot more than us,\u201d Huett said. \u201cI want to opt out to set a precedent for others and say that this settlement is not just.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The settlement is not very fair and benefits the defendants more than us</p> <footer> <cite>Dominique Huett</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Huett has retained a new attorney, Douglas Wigdor, who represents two others who have opted out. Wigdor believes the $500,000 Huett was offered was \u201cnot fair\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI think Dominique\u2019s case is worth significantly more than this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Wigdor will take on Huett\u2019s claim, which was filed in a California court in October 2017, under sex trafficking laws. She was the first alleged Weinstein victim to file a civil claim and unlike many other accusers has a case within the statute of limitations.</p> <p>Huett alleges that in 2010, Weinstein invited her to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel in Los Angeles for a business meeting. She says he forced oral sex on her then masturbated, telling her it was a right of passage to a career in Hollywood.</p> <p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cI refused and said no but was so shocked and paralysed by fear that I froze.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s devastating to think that what he did to me had happened to so many other actresses in the years before and that if his company had acted when they first learnt of his behaviour, it would never have happened to me.\u201d</p> <p>Weinstein has denied any claim, criminal or civil, of non-consensual sex.</p> <p>The proposed settlement with some of his alleged victims is part of a $47m deal aimed at paying Weinstein Company debts. Of this sum, around $6.2m would go to 18 accusers who filed cases in the US, Canada and the UK. Approximately $18.5m is thought to be set aside for class-action participants, more of whom are expected.

      "bodyText": "A controversial proposed settlement between Harvey Weinstein and alleged victims of his sexual misconduct faces further delays, as a fourth accuser opts out and several others plan to object. Dominique Huett will remove herself from the settlement in order to pursue her own claim against the movie mogul, the Guardian can reveal. At least two other accusers have retained lawyers to file formal objections to the deal. Last month, it was reported that Weinstein and more than 30 women had reached a tentative deal following two years of negotiations. However, the Guardian has learned that a settlement hearing that was due before Weinstein\u2019s criminal trial in New York has been postponed until at least February. It is not known if this was due to the growing number of women opting out. Huett joins three others who have decided to not be a part of the agreement: Wedil David, Kaja Sokola and Alexandra Canosa. Huett told the Guardian: \u201cOriginally I thought it was the best option for everyone, but after finding out more details, I think that opting out is the best way to get a better deal for me and for everyone.\u201d Under the proposed deal, Weinstein would not have to pay a penny or admit any wrongdoing. The settlement would be paid by insurance companies representing the producer\u2019s former studio, the Weinstein Company. More than $12m \u2013 a quarter of the overall package \u2013 would go towards legal costs for Weinstein and his board. \u201cI feel the settlement amount is not very fair for all victims and the way it is structured really benefits the defendants a lot more than us,\u201d Huett said. \u201cI want to opt out to set a precedent for others and say that this settlement is not just.\u201d Huett has retained a new attorney, Douglas Wigdor, who represents two others who have opted out. Wigdor believes the $500,000 Huett was offered was \u201cnot fair\u201d. \u201cI think Dominique\u2019s case is worth significantly more than this,\u201d he said. Wigdor will take on Huett\u2019s claim, which was filed in a California court in October 2017, under sex trafficking laws. She was the first alleged Weinstein victim to file a civil claim and unlike many other accusers has a case within the statute of limitations. Huett alleges that in 2010, Weinstein invited her to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel in Los Angeles for a business meeting. She says he forced oral sex on her then masturbated, telling her it was a right of passage to a career in Hollywood. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer,\u201d she said. \u201cI refused and said no but was so shocked and paralysed by fear that I froze. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating to think that what he did to me had happened to so many other actresses in the years before and that if his company had acted when they first learnt of his behaviour, it would never have happened to me.\u201d Weinstein has denied any claim, criminal or civil, of non-consensual sex. The proposed settlement with some of his alleged victims is part of a $47m deal aimed at paying Weinstein Company debts. Of this sum, around $6.2m would go to 18 accusers who filed cases in the US, Canada and the UK. Approximately $18.5m is thought to be set aside for class-action participants, more of whom are expected. Board members of the Weinstein Company would be protected from liability. Zelda Perkins and Rowena Chiu have also retained Wigdor to file objections to the deal, the Guardian has learned. Kevin Mintzer is also counsel for Huett, Perkins, and Chiu. Perkins and Chiu, Weinstein\u2019s British assistants in the late 90s, reached a settlement and signed an NDA in 1998 after they alleged he attempted to rape Chiu at the Venice film festival. Perkins and Chiu are not part of the proposed settlement, but say they are speaking out for other victims. \u201cThis is the whole reason I broke my NDA, so women can\u2019t be pushed into a corner,\u201d Perkins told the Guardian. \u201cIt is not indicative or correct compensation for the crimes and the majority of that money is being fed back to Harvey\u2019s own defence,\u201d she said of the deal. \u201cThey\u2019re making it look like he\u2019s compensating victims but he and his board of directors will be gaining more than the individuals will be.\u201d Perkins added: \u201cUltimately the most important thing is that these women get compensation.\u201d Wigdor said: \u201cWe are not seeking to prevent survivors who want to participate in a settlement from doing so. We just want to ensure that those who don\u2019t are not precluded from going after insurance proceeds and the directors, and that the terms of the agreement are fair.\u201d Caitlin Dulany, a lead plaintiff in the settlement, believes it is the best option for many women.

      "bodyText": "Leatherback turtles Last week it was reported that rising ocean temperatures and changing sea currents are causing leatherback turtles\u2019 journeys from nesting to feeding grounds to double in length. After laying their eggs on some beaches, the turtles must move to cooler waters to feed, but higher temperatures mean some are having to swim further to reach suitable areas, according to France\u2019s Hubert Curien Institute. Pikas Pikas, small mammals native to North America, are increasingly moving off high-alpine boulder piles to adjacent forests. A study in the Journal of Mammology notes that the cool, moist, rocky habitat they require is getting hotter, drier, and less snowy. Because they live high in the mountains, when their terrain becomes inhabitable, there\u2019s nowhere left to go. Monarch butterflies Warmer temperatures are causing monarch butterflies\u2019 southern migrations to be delayed by up to six months. Columbia University\u2019s Earth Institute explains that this is causing migrations to fall out of sync with the bloom time of the nectar-producing plants the monarchs rely on for food, contributing to the 95% decrease in their numbers in the last two decades.

      "body": "<p><strong>Is happiness, which we think of as fleeting, a realistic state to which to aspire?</strong><br>I think happiness is what people most care about. They want to know how happy their child is. They want to know whether they\u2019re happy in their work, they want to know whether they\u2019re happy in their marriages. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s happiness or nothing. It\u2019s somewhere on the scale. And we want to be higher up the scale. We want everybody to be higher up the scale and that\u2019s to my mind the definition of a good society.</p> <p><strong>You write in the book about the attempted suicide</strong><strong> by your father (the distinguished psychoanalyst John Layard) before he met your mother. How formative was that knowledge in your young life?</strong><br>Well, I was aware of it because I used to feel the dent in his head where the bullet had lodged but it wasn\u2019t what made me think about people\u2019s unhappiness. What did interest me in mental health was not my father but his patients and the fact that my father was able to help them. That I think was where my interest in mental health came from rather than from any kind of angst.</p> <p><strong>Given your interest in your father\u2019s patients, what directed you to economics?</strong><br>I did think of becoming a psychiatrist but I in fact became a schoolteacher. I went to the LSE for evening classes to broaden my education and after that I became the research officer for the Robbins committee on higher education [which led to the expansion of universities]. I was at once struck by the difficulty of making the case for why more money should be spent on one thing rather than another. And I discovered that there was such a thing called cost-benefit analysis and I decided I should become an economist, because that had the merit of at least trying to develop a rational basis for choosing priorities for government spending.</p> <p><strong>You argue that happiness should be a key metric, like GDP, in assessing a nation\u2019s performance. Can happiness be reliably measured, given that it is a subjective quality?</strong><br>It is a subjective quality and that\u2019s why it matters, because how people feel is their deepest reality and it\u2019s the way we should think about the quality of the person\u2019s life. How is their life as they themselves experience it, not as we think it might be. The standard way to find out is to ask people: overall, how satisfied with your life are you on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 extremely satisfied and 0 extremely dissatisfied?</p> <p><strong>It seems inherent in human nature to </strong><strong>believe that we were happier in the past. But is the UK more or less happy now than in years gone by?</strong><br>This is probably one of the best periods the human race has been through. We know quite a lot about that from evidence. In the US, where we have the longest time series, happiness has been pretty much flat. In the world as whole it\u2019s risen since 1970. In some countries it hasn\u2019t. Britain has risen slightly. We\u2019re not at all in the business of saying this is a terrible period. But there are some people having a really hard time in their lives and everybody could have a better time.</p> <p><strong>We tend to focus on economic status as the key to the good life, but how much bearing do wealth or poverty have on happiness?</strong><br>Less than 2% of the huge variation in happiness within our society is explained by variation in income. By far the most important single factor is mental health. Physical health also matters. The other huge influences are human relationships \u2013 in our family, whether we have a partner and whether we\u2019re happy with the partner. Also very important is the quality of work and of course whether we have work, but in particular how we\u2019re getting on with our colleagues at work. And finally the community \u2013 are we living in a friendly community where we feel safe?</p> <p><strong>You speak about the importance of increasing the happiness of others. But the law of unintended consequences tells us that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</strong><br>That\u2019s a very good point and it\u2019s one reason why we should be using whatever evidence we have on the things that are really important to people. For example, if we take the school teaching profession we know that the most important predictor of whether a young person will be a happy adult is not the grades they get but whether they\u2019re happy at school. It would make a huge difference if we could get away from the focus on exams as the main purpose of education, which sets people such a burden of responsibility to themselves.</p> <p><strong>A happy society has to be explicitly aimed for, you say. It will never come as a byproduct. Why?</strong><br>Because it\u2019s so easy to get diverted into things that are more obviously measurable. So what has happened is that because income can be measured, income has become the totem pole at the level of the country and the GDP. This is the thing that politicians feel is critical \u2013 how they deal with the economy \u2013 but we know that the way people vote in elections is not influenced as much by people\u2019s economic status as satisfaction with all other aspects of their lives.</p> <p><strong>Immigration, you say, is a cause of anxiety. Can we maintain the trend towards greater migration and also become happier?</strong><br>The story of migration is that in the end the migrants become the natives. And in that sense zero migration is a ridiculous idea. So if people want to come in we should up to a point welcome them. But if the speed is too fast it creates tensions and therefore we have to have controlled migration. There will be no other way of sustaining a harmonious community. It\u2019s a matter of balance.</p> <p><strong>You make reference to the link between levels of unhappiness and the growth of populism. What is that relationship?</strong><br>The general point, which has been confirmed by studies of European elections since the 1970s and studies of the Trump vote in the US, is that the higher their level of life satisfaction, the more people are likely to vote for the existing government \u2013 or parties currently in power. This explains more of the variation in election outcomes than the economy does. So people\u2019s votes reflect more how they feel in terms of non-economic causes of their enjoyment of life than the economic causes. This is why the case for government making wellbeing their target is also based on their own self-interest. If it wants to be re-elected it should not just go for economic growth but all the things that matter to people.</p> <p><strong>And what is the specific relationship in terms of populism?</strong><br>First it\u2019s true that less happy people are more likely to vote populist. But the second fact is that in European countries, except for Italy and Greece, there hasn\u2019t been an increase in the number of unhappy people. In the US there has been an increase. So you\u2019ve got to find in Europe some other explanation of populism. I think there are four factors to explain its growth. One, the long-term trend towards reduced deference, but two is the fact that the elite discredited themselves greatly by allowing the 2008 financial crisis to be generated and to a degree mishandled afterwards. Three, I think immigration is an issue \u2013 many people feel that their interest is not being considered.</p> <p>But I think that the main reason for this sudden change is social media. When you talk to people face to face you have to moderate your language. But this economic method of communication has led to people feeling much less constrained by the normal rules of etiquette, and people have become quite wild in their expressions of their frustrations. To sum up, there has not been a big increase in discontent but there has been a complete change in the way people express it. They feel entitled to disrespect the elite and they feel entitled to do this on social media and in voting.</p> <p><strong>Should the UK follow </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/14/new-zealands-world-first-wellbeing-budget-to-focus-on-poverty-and-mental-health\" title=\"\"><strong>New Zealand\u2019s lead</strong></a><strong> and formally target wellbeing?</strong><br>Definitely. We have a great opportunity now we have a new government that\u2019s rethinking its priorities. There are three countries that have adopted wellbeing as their targets recently \u2013 New Zealand, Scotland and Iceland, all with female leaders. Now Boris Johnson has the chance to become the first male prime minister to make wellbeing his target. That would be a great moment if Britain gave that lead to the world.</p> <p><strong>Happiness varies from hour to hour, but there tends to be an underlying trend in our lives. In your own life, do you think that there has been a great deal of variation or have you remained roughly consistent?</strong><br>Of course it fluctuates from day to day and month to month. I think on the whole that I\u2019ve been lucky and have had a happy life. In the past 20 years since I\u2019ve been writing about all this, I have gained a lot from what I\u2019ve learned, both in terms of being more aware of other people\u2019s feelings but also in being better able to distance myself from the negative thoughts and feelings that all of us have from time to time.</p>",

This is probably one of the best periods the human race has been through. We know quite a lot about that from evidence. In the US, where we have the longest time series, happiness has been pretty much flat. In the world as whole it\u2019s risen since 1970. In some countries it hasn\u2019t. Britain has risen slightly. We\u2019re not at all in the business of saying this is a terrible period. But there are some people having a really hard time in their lives and everybody could have a better time. We tend to focus on economic status as the key to the good life, but how much bearing do wealth or poverty have on happiness? Less than 2% of the huge variation in happiness within our society is explained by variation in income. By far the most important single factor is mental health. Physical health also matters. The other huge influences are human relationships \u2013 in our family, whether we have a partner and whether we\u2019re happy with the partner. Also very important is the quality of work and of course whether we have work, but in particular how we\u2019re getting on with our colleagues at work. And finally the community \u2013 are we living in a friendly community where we feel safe? You speak about the importance of increasing the happiness of others. But the law of unintended consequences tells us that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. That\u2019s a very good point and it\u2019s one reason why we should be using whatever evidence we have on the things that are really important to people. For example, if we take the school teaching profession we know that the most important predictor of whether a young person will be a happy adult is not the grades they get but whether they\u2019re happy at school. It would make a huge difference if we could get away from the focus on exams as the main purpose of education, which sets people such a burden of responsibility to themselves. A happy society has to be explicitly aimed for, you say. It will never come as a byproduct. Why? Because it\u2019s so easy to get diverted into things that are more obviously measurable. So what has happened is that because income can be measured, income has become the totem pole at the level of the country and the GDP. This is the thing that politicians feel is critical \u2013 how they deal with the economy \u2013 but we know that the way people vote in elections is not influenced as much by people\u2019s economic status as satisfaction with all other aspects of their lives. Immigration, you say, is a cause of anxiety. Can we maintain the trend towards greater migration and also become happier? The story of migration is that in the end the migrants become the natives. And in that sense zero migration is a ridiculous idea. So if people want to come in we should up to a point welcome them. But if the speed is too fast it creates tensions and therefore we have to have controlled migration. There will be no other way of sustaining a harmonious community. It\u2019s a matter of balance. You make reference to the link between levels of unhappiness and the growth of populism. What is that relationship? The general point, which has been confirmed by studies of European elections since the 1970s and studies of the Trump vote in the US, is that the higher their level of life satisfaction, the more people are likely to vote for the existing government \u2013 or parties currently in power. This explains more of the variation in election outcomes than the economy does. So people\u2019s votes reflect more how they feel in terms of non-economic causes of their enjoyment of life than the economic causes. This is why the case for government making wellbeing their target is also based on their own self-interest. If it wants to be re-elected it should not just go for economic growth but all the things that matter to people. And what is the specific relationship in terms of populism? First it\u2019s true that less happy people are more likely to vote populist. But the second fact is that in European countries, except for Italy and Greece, there hasn\u2019t been an increase in the number of unhappy people. In the US there has been an increase. So you\u2019ve got to find in Europe some other explanation of populism. I think there are four factors to explain its growth. One, the long-term trend towards reduced deference, but two is the fact that the elite discredited themselves greatly by allowing the 2008 financial crisis to be generated and to a degree mishandled afterwards. Three, I think immigration is an issue \u2013 many people feel that their interest is not being considered. But I think that the main reason for this sudden change is social media. When you talk to people face to face you have to moderate your language. But this economic method of communication has led to people feeling much less constrained by the normal rules of etiquette, and people have become quite wild in their expressions of their frustrations. To sum up, there has not been a big increase in discontent but there has been a complete change in the way people express it. They feel entitled to disrespect the elite and they feel entitled to do this on social media and in voting. Should the UK follow New Zealand\u2019s lead and formally target wellbeing? Definitely. We have a great opportunity now we have a new government that\u2019s rethinking its priorities. There are three countries that have adopted wellbeing as their targets recently \u2013 New Zealand, Scotland and Iceland, all with female leaders. Now Boris Johnson has the chance to become the first male prime minister to make wellbeing his target. That would be a great moment if Britain gave that lead to the world. Happiness varies from hour to hour, but there tends to be an underlying trend in our lives. In your own life, do you think that there has been a great deal of variation or have you remained roughly consistent? Of course it fluctuates from day to day and month to month. I think on the whole that I\u2019ve been lucky and have had a happy life. In the past 20 years since I\u2019ve been writing about all this, I have gained a lot from what I\u2019ve learned, both in terms of being more aware of other people\u2019s feelings but also in being better able to distance myself from the negative thoughts and feelings that all of us have from time to time.",

How it works is this. The client comes in with a problem, chats to Winkleman generally about it, and then goes into a one-time, unscripted therapy-style session with Byron. (She has said it\u2019s not a proper therapy session, though it does sound like it.) Winkleman listens in, has a round-up chat with Byron halfway through, then the client goes back in. At the end, Winkleman talks to the client, and then Byron. So, in terms of conversations, we get Winkleman-subject, Byron-subject, Winkleman-Byron, Byron-subject, Winkleman-subject, Winkleman-Byron.

But I am unsure about the Winkleman bits: not because she isn\u2019t an excellent, warm presenter, but because they seem a distraction from what is actually going on. Clearly, Winkleman is there to represent the listener: to put the points that an ordinary, non-qualified person might make. But it means that the sections when the subject talks to Byron are quite brief. You don\u2019t get quite so much therapy in the 45 minutes, and that\u2019s the bit I like. Despite this, I recommend <em>How Did We Get Here?</em> All such podcasts are helpful, and Byron and Winkleman are so likable and clever, you\u2019re bound to get something out of this.</p> <p>More women talking to each other in <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct047r\" title=\"\">The Coffin Club</a></strong>, a World Service documentary made by the brilliant producer-presenter Cathy FitzGerald.

Now, a group of about 30 to 40 older people get together every week in Williams\u2019s house in Rotorua for the Coffin Club. They assemble, sand and decorate coffins for themselves. The charismatic Williams, 80, was the first to finish hers: \u201cWe had to have a prototype. I\u2019m a big lady and so I had an oblong one.\u201d She\u2019s happy that several \u201chandsome strong young men\u201d attend; she\u2019s hoping they might want to be her pallbearers when she actually goes.</p> <p>Gossip is exchanged, cake is eaten. Most of those we meet are women in their 70s and 80s. FitzGerald gets them to describe their coffins. There\u2019s a green, Irish-themed one, for Joyce, 81, who keeps her coffin propped up in the corner of her front room; Faye, 82, wants her children\u2019s paintings, plus those of her 18 grandchildren and 26 great-grandchildren, to go with her. Everyone we meet likes to chat. The gentle rumble of to-and-fro conversation is what the Coffin Club is about.

      "bodyText": "\u2022 The Welsh composer Rhian Samuel (b1944) tirelessly supported the cause of female composers long before it became fashionable, co-editing The Norton/Grove Dictionary of Women Composers (1994). Now her own works are winning proper recognition. In Clytemnestra (BIS), soprano Ruby Hughes, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and conductor Jac van Steen give new life to Samuel\u2019s powerful, seven-movement work for soprano and orchestra (here coupled with Mahler and Berg). Commissioned by the BBC NOW in 1994 but neglected since, it explores \u2013 with rare insight, passionately expressed by Hughes \u2013 the motives that led Clytemnestra to murder her husband, Agamemnon. There\u2019s more by Samuel on the album Song Lied C\u00e2n (Ty Cerdd). This small Welsh label, doing quietly impressive work, has paired her songs with works by Clara Schumann, performed by Katharine Dain (soprano), Paul Carey Jones (baritone) and Jocelyn Freeman (piano).

He urged families to shop around to punish providers increasing costs faster than recommended. According to September quarter data, published by the education department, fees have increased by 5.1% in the past year.

Bornstein said he was \u201cinterested in conducting\u201d a test case or class action on a pro bono basis, suggesting there would be \u201cno shortage of volunteers from the legal community\u201d to assemble a crack team. \u201cIdeally the sorts of sporting club I\u2019m looking for is someone who was entitled to the grant on merit and lost out on as a result of the minister\u2019s intervention.\u201d Slater and Gordon class actions practice group leader, Andrew Baker, said that \u201cevery dollar that went to a club whose application should have been unsuccessful is a dollar that didn\u2019t end up with a club that Sport Australia had identified and recommended for funding in the course of proper processes\u201d. \u201cThese community organisations, clubs and groups have lost out because it appears public funds were used for political gain,\u201d he said in a statement. Baker said the audit office report \u201craises serious questions about the lawfulness of the conduct involved\u201d. In a scathing report, the auditor general found that 70% of projects approved by the minister in the second round in March 2019 were not recommended by Sport Australia, rising to 73% in the third round in April 2019 after an extra $40m was tipped into the program. \u201cA significant shortcoming was that, while the program guidelines identified that the minister for sport would approve [community sport infrastructure grant] funding, there are no records evidencing that the minister was advised of the legal basis on which the minister could undertake an approval role, and it is not evident to the ANAO what the legal authority was,\u201d the ANAO report said. It noted that although the sports minister has a power to direct Sports Australia \u201cit was not used\u201d. Labor leader Anthony Albanese, independent MP Zali Steggall and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson have all called for McKenzie to resign over the program. A Senate inquiry is likely, as Labor has vowed to expose the projects recommended by Sports Australia that were denied funding by ministerial intervention and the Greens, Hanson and Centre Alliance have offered to support an inquiry. Scott Morrison is yet to comment on the scathing audit report, after days of bad headlines including a $500,000 grant to Mosman Rowing Club in Tony Abbott\u2019s seat of Warringah, Labor MP Graham Perrett being excluded from the announcement of a grant he helped lobby for, and a $500,000 sports grant in the rural Victorian seat of Mallee a year and a half after it was first rejected when the seat became hotly contested due to the resignation of Nationals MP Andrew Broad.",

Under the US constitution, the president can be removed if found guilty of whatever lawmakers consider to be \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours\u201d. Trump is charged with abusing his power and obstructing Congress.</p> <p>On Saturday, House impeachment managers outlined their view of the case against Trump in <a href=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=913\">a 111-page legal brief of their own</a>. It pulls together private and public testimony of a dozen witnesses, ambassadors and national security officials at high levels of government.</p> <p>In a joint statement, the seven managers led by the Democratic intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff said their case was \u201csimple, the facts are indisputable, and the evidence is overwhelming: President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardising our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAnd when the president got caught, he tried to cover it up by obstructing the House\u2019s investigation into his misconduct.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s legal team, led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, is challenging the impeachment on both procedural and constitutional grounds, claiming Trump has been mistreated by House Democrats and that he did nothing wrong.</p> <p>Trump will file a more detailed legal brief on Monday, and the House will be able to respond to the Trump filing on Tuesday.</p> <p>The case hinges on a 25 July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked his counterpart to do him a \u201cfavour\u201d and investigate both a conspiracy theory concerning election interference and ties between former vice-president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and the eastern European country.</p> <p>Biden remains a possible Democratic candidate for president. At the time of the Ukraine call, Trump was withholding from Kyiv nearly $400m of military aid and the prospect of a White House meeting for Zelenskiy.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s legal team for the Senate trial, starting on Tuesday,will also include Ken Starr, whose investigation led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and former Harvard professor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/18/donald-trump-impeachment-news-today-alan-dershowitz\">Alan Dershowitz.</a></p> <p>Both have been fixtures on Fox News. Some in the administration have echoed warnings from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell that the lawyers must be sensitive to staid Senate traditions and not use the sharp rhetoric exhibited during House proceedings last year.</p> <p>Many observers suggest the slow nature of the trial will prove a turnoff to the American public, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/18/donald-trump-impeachment-democrats-republicans-senate-election\">boosting Trump\u2019s hopes of surviving unscathed</a>. Others report that the president wants to add fire and TV knowhow to the team mounting his defence.</p> <p>White House lawyers succeeded in blocking Trump from adding House Republicans to his team, the AP reported, but also advised against picking Dershowitz. They are concerned about the professor\u2019s association with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, the financier who killed himself in a New York jail last summer while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p> <p>Dershowitz has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/18/donald-trump-impeachment-news-today-alan-dershowitz\">said he will deliver constitutional arguments</a> defending Trump from allegations he abused his power and obstructed Congress.</p> <p>Former New York mayor and current Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the AP the president had a \u201ctop-notch\u201d team and insisted he was not disappointed to be excluded. Giuliani, who many in the White House blame for leading Trump to impeachment over Ukraine, said his focus would be on being a potential witness.</p> <p>On Friday, House Democrats released documents, text messages, audio recordings and photos turned over by Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate indicted on campaign finance charges. The release included photos of the Soviet-born businessman posing with Giuliani, Trump and Donald Trump Jr.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a4eb60ed0b43e7160f184dacfb8820e72fe863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a4eb60ed0b43e7160f184dacfb8820e72fe863/0_0_2706_2032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rudy Giuliani, left, with Lev Parnas at the Trump Hotel in Washington in September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rudy Giuliani, left, with Lev Parnas at the Trump Hotel in Washington in September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters  Staff/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Messages between Parnas and a staffer for Devin Nunes, a congressman and Trump ally, were also released. Parnas appeared to be connecting the staffer to Ukrainian officials who pushed unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens.</p> <p>The documents also raised more questions about the security of Marie Yovanovitch, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/16/ukraine-marie-yovanovitch-investigation-surveillance\">a former ambassador to Ukraine</a> who testified in House impeachment proceedings. An unidentified individual with a Belgian country code appeared to describe Yovanovitch\u2019s movements.</p> <p>The document release followed the announcement by the Government Accountability Office that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/16/us-senate-impeachment-trial-donald-trump\">the White House violated federal law</a> by withholding congressionally approved security aid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/17/trump-third-impeachment-us-history-no-case-stronger\">Trump\u2019s is the third impeachment in US history and no case has been stronger | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The White House said it did not have to follow decisions by the GAO because it is an arm of Congress. White House officials noted that Trump did send the aid to Kyiv.</p> <p>But the GAO report and Parnas documents intensified the pressure senators have been under to call more witnesses for the trial. The White House has instructed officials to disregard subpoenas seeking testimony or information.</p> <p>On Saturday Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate Republican wooed by Democrats, told reporters she was comfortable waiting to decide if more information was needed until after hearing arguments from House managers and attorneys for Trump and questions from other senators.</p> <p>Trump seems certain to survive the Senate trial, as a two-thirds majority will be needed to convict and remove him and Republicans remain in line behind him.</p> <p>In their statement on Saturday, the House impeachment managers said senators \u201cmust accept and fulfill the responsibility placed on them by the framers of our constitution and the oaths they have just taken to do impartial justice.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s legal team has delivered a fiery response to impeachment summons from the Senate, calling the two articles passed by the House \u201ca dangerous attack on the right of the American people to freely choose their president\u201d. \u201cThis is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election, now just months away,\u201d the lawyers said on Saturday, also claiming the charges against the president were invalid as they did not concern a crime. Impeachment is a political process, not a criminal one. Under the US constitution, the president can be removed if found guilty of whatever lawmakers consider to be \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours\u201d. Trump is charged with abusing his power and obstructing Congress. On Saturday, House impeachment managers outlined their view of the case against Trump in a 111-page legal brief of their own. It pulls together private and public testimony of a dozen witnesses, ambassadors and national security officials at high levels of government. In a joint statement, the seven managers led by the Democratic intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff said their case was \u201csimple, the facts are indisputable, and the evidence is overwhelming: President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardising our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy\u201d. \u201cAnd when the president got caught, he tried to cover it up by obstructing the House\u2019s investigation into his misconduct.\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team, led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump personal lawyer Jay Sekulow, is challenging the impeachment on both procedural and constitutional grounds, claiming Trump has been mistreated by House Democrats and that he did nothing wrong. Trump will file a more detailed legal brief on Monday, and the House will be able to respond to the Trump filing on Tuesday. The case hinges on a 25 July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked his counterpart to do him a \u201cfavour\u201d and investigate both a conspiracy theory concerning election interference and ties between former vice-president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and the eastern European country. Biden remains a possible Democratic candidate for president. At the time of the Ukraine call, Trump was withholding from Kyiv nearly $400m of military aid and the prospect of a White House meeting for Zelenskiy. Trump\u2019s legal team for the Senate trial, starting on Tuesday,will also include Ken Starr, whose investigation led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and former Harvard professor, Alan Dershowitz. Both have been fixtures on Fox News. Some in the administration have echoed warnings from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell that the lawyers must be sensitive to staid Senate traditions and not use the sharp rhetoric exhibited during House proceedings last year. Many observers suggest the slow nature of the trial will prove a turnoff to the American public, boosting Trump\u2019s hopes of surviving unscathed. Others report that the president wants to add fire and TV knowhow to the team mounting his defence. White House lawyers succeeded in blocking Trump from adding House Republicans to his team, the AP reported, but also advised against picking Dershowitz. They are concerned about the professor\u2019s association with Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who killed himself in a New York jail last summer while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Dershowitz has said he will deliver constitutional arguments defending Trump from allegations he abused his power and obstructed Congress. Former New York mayor and current Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the AP the president had a \u201ctop-notch\u201d team and insisted he was not disappointed to be excluded. Giuliani, who many in the White House blame for leading Trump to impeachment over Ukraine, said his focus would be on being a potential witness. On Friday, House Democrats released documents, text messages, audio recordings and photos turned over by Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate indicted on campaign finance charges. The release included photos of the Soviet-born businessman posing with Giuliani, Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Messages between Parnas and a staffer for Devin Nunes, a congressman and Trump ally, were also released. Parnas appeared to be connecting the staffer to Ukrainian officials who pushed unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens. The documents also raised more questions about the security of Marie Yovanovitch, a former ambassador to Ukraine who testified in House impeachment proceedings. An unidentified individual with a Belgian country code appeared to describe Yovanovitch\u2019s movements. The document release followed the announcement by the Government Accountability Office that the White House violated federal law by withholding congressionally approved security aid. The White House said it did not have to follow decisions by the GAO because it is an arm of Congress. White House officials noted that Trump did send the aid to Kyiv. But the GAO report and Parnas documents intensified the pressure senators have been under to call more witnesses for the trial. The White House has instructed officials to disregard subpoenas seeking testimony or information. On Saturday Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a moderate Republican wooed by Democrats, told reporters she was comfortable waiting to decide if more information was needed until after hearing arguments from House managers and attorneys for Trump and questions from other senators. Trump seems certain to survive the Senate trial, as a two-thirds majority will be needed to convict and remove him and Republicans remain in line behind him. In their statement on Saturday, the House impeachment managers said senators \u201cmust accept and fulfill the responsibility placed on them by the framers of our constitution and the oaths they have just taken to do impartial justice. They must conduct a fair trial \u2013 fair to the president and fair to the American people\u201d.",
